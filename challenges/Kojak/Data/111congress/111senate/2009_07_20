The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                             Cap and Trade\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an Agricultural \nCommittee hearing that is scheduled later on this week. It is an \nimportant topic. The hearing is titled ``The Role of Agriculture and \nForestry in Global Warming Legislation.'' I look forward to \nparticipating. This is the committee's first effort this year to tackle \nthe ongoing climate change debate. It is very important. Much of the \ndiscussion in both Houses of Congress has centered on potential new \nlegislation and regulations relative to climate change. Any\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\nkind of new climate-related law would have sweeping consequences that \ntouch every corner of American life. Thus, I have made it clear that \nany climate change legislation should require a robust, open, and \nextensive debate on the Senate floor.\n  Numerous studies have now been released about cap and trade and \naffect on American life. Those studies also include agriculture. During \nlast year's debate over cap and trade, the Fertilizer Institute \nreleased a study stating that the legislation would result in a $40 to \n$80 increase in the cost to produce an acre of corn. That means higher \ninput costs for livestock producers as well. That same study indicated \nthe cost of producing soybeans would increase from $10 to $20 an acre. \nWheat would jump $16 to $32 an acre.\n  According to one recent analysis, the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade \nbill would also have a significant, if not severe, impact on \nagriculture. If the bill is enacted, farm income is estimated to \ndecrease as much as $8 billion in the year 2012. By 2024, farmers stand \nto lose $25 billion. An eye-popping $50 billion would be lost by \nfarmers by 2035. Gasoline and diesel costs are expected to increase by \n58 percent. Electric rates would soar maybe as high as 90 percent.\n  Agriculture is an energy intensive industry. Those kinds of increased \ncosts are certainly going to impact this business. These are not \nisolated studies. The American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest \nagricultural organization in the country, has also studied these costs. \nThe Farm Bureau reported that if Waxman-Markey were to become law, \ninput costs for agriculture would rise by $5 billion, compared to a \ncontinuation of current law. Other studies have indicated in various \nways that the likely impact of cap and trade would include increased \nelectricity and heating costs, construction costs, fertilizer prices, \nhigher gas, and higher diesel prices. Different studies come up with \nvaried numbers, but they all paint the same picture--agriculture loses.\n  None of this should surprise anyone because the bill is specifically \ndesigned to increase the cost of energy.\n  In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office:\n\n       Reducing emissions to the level required would be \n     accomplished mainly by stemming demand for carbon-based \n     energy by increasing its price.\n\n  We also know farmers in America's heartland get hit worse by these \nhigh energy costs, and we know that USDA agrees. Last week, USDA \nofficials indicated in testimony to the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee that as a result of cap-and-trade legislation:\n\n       The agriculture sector will face higher energy and input \n     costs.\n\n  At the very least, all of this tells us that this is an enormously \ncomplicated issue with significant economic ramifications, perhaps as \ncomplex as any we will deal with this Congress, not to mention very \ncostly. Given the gloomy predictions about cap-and-trade proposals, it \nseems clear to me that we need to take an approach that is extensive, \nmethodical, and well thought out. We need more specific and clear \nanalysis to make sure we know--and, most importantly, the American \npeople know--exactly what passage of this bill will mean.\n\n  As I mentioned, USDA knows that cap and trade will increase energy \nprices. Here is the kicker: At the same time the Department also has \nindicated:\n\n       USDA believes the opportunities for climate legislation \n     will likely outweigh the costs.\n\n  Let me say that again: USDA says energy prices will increase, but \nthey think the opportunities for climate change legislation will \noutweigh the costs. This kind of claim must be based on hard data or it \nis reckless to make the claim. Such a sweeping conclusion should not be \ndrawn unless the impact is studied and analyzed. If USDA has conducted \nanalysis of increases in farm input costs and weighed them against the \nmeasured opportunities, then I applaud their efforts. But if that is \nthe case, it is mystifying that the Department has not shared the \nanalysis, despite having testified before the Senate twice in the 2 \nweeks preceding this week.\n  Having served as the Secretary of Agriculture, I know that the USDA \nhas an outstanding team of economists with expertise to do this kind of \nanalysis. That is why last week I sent a letter to the current Ag \nSecretary, Tom Vilsack, who will testify at the Ag Committee hearing \nthis week. The letter requested USDA to provide the following: A State-\nby-State analysis of the cost of cap and trade on ag industries; a \ncrop-specific analysis; an analysis of how the legislation would impact \nlivestock producers; finally, USDA's assessment of how many acres will \nbe taken out of production as a result of the bill and what impact this \nwill have on food availability, the cost of food, fiber, feed, \nbiofuels, and other ag products.\n  Without detailed analysis, USDA's assertions about costs and benefits \nwill simply ring hollow. Why wouldn't the USDA provide this \ninformation? Isn't this why the department exists? Agriculture is going \nto be directly impacted by the legislation. Yet we have no analysis \nfrom the people's department. If the people who feed the world are \ngoing to get hammered by this legislation, we should know about it. We \nshould debate it, and we should vote on it on this floor.\n  I hope the third time is the charm for the USDA, and they bring more \nthan rhetoric to Wednesday's hearing. Cap and trade will not affect \nStates, crops or regions equally. It will have a different impact on a \ncorn farmer in Nebraska than on a chicken farmer in Arkansas. \nSimilarly, it will impact a dairy farmer in New York differently than \nthe orange grower in California. We need a State-by-State and \ncommodity-by-commodity analysis. One-size-fits-all will not work. A \nnational average would not paint a true picture. When one is camping, \nthey can't put one foot in the cooler and one foot in the campfire and, \non average, it is about right. The same goes for loose assessments that \nare riddled with averages.\n  We have a responsibility to seek a full understanding of this \nlegislation's impact on our Nation's farmers and related ag industries. \nThe information I requested is critical to help the Senate and \nAmerica's producers develop a clearer picture of cost increases for \nfarmers, ranchers, and consumers.\n  We need the impact analysis to tell us which parts of the country \nwill be hit the hardest and which industries within agriculture will \nincur the greatest losses as a result of this legislation.\n  I have asked for this analysis prior to the hearing. I believe it is \nnecessary, and I hope we will have it before the hearing.\n  I am puzzled by the passage of nearly a full week since my request \nand no analysis has been provided. I trust the administration has \nnothing to hide. I will remain engaged in the debate. I look forward to \nWednesday's hearing.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed on my leader \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the \nJudiciary Committee staff, as well as Senators Leahy and Sessions, for \nconducting a collegial, civil, and dignified hearing on the matter of \nthe Supreme Court nomination. In my view, the hearing was in perfect \nkeeping with the importance of the task before it.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution says the President ``shall \nnominate''--``by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate''--\n``Judges of the supreme Court.'' It is an obligation that all of us in \nthe Senate take very seriously, even though Senators have not always \nagreed on the exact meaning of the phrase ``advise and consent.'' In \nfact, it has been the subject of significant disagreement and struggle \nover the years.\n  I remember from my days as a young staffer on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the debate flared up \nover the nominations of Clement Haynsworth and Harrold Carswell after a \nfull century in which appointments to the Supreme Court had more or \nless been a sleepy Presidential prerogative.\n  It was during that time that I first grasped the danger of \npoliticizing the process. By focusing on a nominees's\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nideology or political views above all else, I feared the Senate would \nend up distorting its traditional role of providing advice and consent \nand weaken the Presidential prerogative of making appointments to the \nCourt.\n  I was so concerned, in fact, about the potential dangers that I wrote \na law review article on the topic, which I have repeatedly returned to \nover the years. Its purpose was to establish a meaningful standard for \nconsidering Supreme Court nominees that would bring some consistency to \nthe process.\n  In the course of developing that standard, I went back and looked at \nthe history of nominations, and I noticed something interesting: Every \ntime a Senator had opposed nominees in the past, the reason for doing \nso was almost always based on the nominees's ``fitness''--even if it \nwas perfectly clear to everyone else that the Senator's opposition was \nbased on political or ideological differences.\n  What this polite fiction showed me, quite clearly, was that up until \nfairly recent history, ideology had never been viewed as an openly \nacceptable reason to oppose a nominee. And, in my view, this aversion \nto a political litmus test was a good convention and well worth \nfollowing if we wanted to avoid gridlock every time the White House \nswitched parties.\n  So I developed a list of fairly standard criteria that I had hoped \nwould govern the process: A nominee must be competent; have obtained \nsome level of distinction; have a judicial temperament; violated no \nexisting standard of ethical conduct; and have a clean record in his or \nher life off the bench.\n  In short, a President should be given great deference on his choice \nof a nominee, and these criteria certainly allowed that. As a Senator, \nI have consistently applied these criteria to Supreme Court nominees by \nPresidents of both parties.\n  In adhering to this standard, I was confident I had history on my \nside. Despite a few notable exceptions, during the last century the \nSenate understood its advice and consent role to be limited to an \nexamination of a nominee's qualifications, not his or her ideology. \nThis attitude is consistent with the Framers' decision, after no little \ndebate, to invest the President, not the Senate, with the power to \nnominate Justices. They did not want politics to interfere. And that is \nwhy it has always been my view that opposing a nominee to the Supreme \nCourt because he or she has a different judicial philosophy than I do \nwas not a valid reason for doing so.\n  During the Clinton years, I had no illusions about the ideology or \npolitical views of Stephen Breyer or Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice \nGinsburg's views on a number of contentious issues were well known and \nclearly different than my own, such as her view that Mother's Day \nshould be abolished or that the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts should be \ncriticized for perpetrating false stereotypes about gender.\n  Most Americans, and certainly most Kentuckians, do not think those \nkinds of things. Yet despite that, I and the vast majority of my \nRepublican colleagues voted for Justice Ginsburg. Why? Because the \nConstitution gave the President the power to nominate. And, in my view, \nJustice Ginsburg met the traditional standards of competence, \ndistinction, temperament, and ethical conduct.\n  The vote in favor of Justice Ginsburg was 96 to 3. The vote in favor \nof Justice Breyer was 87 to 9. I voted for both, just as I had voted \nfor every previous Republican nominee to the high Court since my \nelection to the Senate--consistent with my criteria and based on their \nqualifications.\n  In voting for nominees such as Ginsburg and Breyer, it was my hope \nthat broad deference to a President's judicial nominees would once \nagain become the standard. Even if the treatment of Republican \nnominees, such as Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas, suggested that many \nDemocrats felt differently than I did, it was still possible at that \ntime to imagine a day when the traditional standard would reemerge. As \nit turned out, that hopefulness was misplaced and short-lived.\n  Things changed for good during the last administration. It was then \nthat the Democrats turned their backs on the old standard once and for \nall. Ideology as a test would no longer be the exception but the rule. \nThe new order was firmly established at a Democratic retreat in April \n2001 in which a group of liberal law professors laid out the strategy \nfor blocking any high-level conservative judicial nominee. The strategy \nwas reinforced during a series of hearings in which Senator Schumer \ndeclared that ideology alone--ideology alone--was sufficient reason to \nblock judicial nominees.\n  These events marked the beginning of a seismic procedural and \nsubstantive shift on judicial nominees, and the results were just as I \nhad anticipated as a young staffer. Democrats would now block one \nhighly qualified nominee after another to the appeals court for no \nother reason than the fact that they were suspected of being too \nconservative for their tastes.\n  Miguel Estrada was one of the first victims of the new standard. \nBecause he had been nominated by a Republican, Estrada got no points \nfor his compelling personal story, despite the fact that he had come \nhere as a child from Honduras, went to Harvard Law School, clerked on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, and served as a prosecutor in New York and at \nthe Justice Department. He was blocked by seven leadership-led \nfilibusters--an unprecedented action for an appeals court nominee.\n  Opponents of the Estrada nomination were ruthless and eventually \nsucceeded in driving him to withdraw from consideration after more than \n2 years of entrenched opposition. He was not alone. Democrats employed \nthe filibuster strategy against an entire block of Republican nominees \non the insistence of special interest groups and in complete \ncontravention of Senate tradition--often relying on the flimsiest of \npretexts for doing so.\n  As a result, several widely respected, highly qualified nominees saw \nwhat should have been a high honor transformed into a humiliating and \npainful experience for themselves and for their families; the country \nwas deprived of their service on the circuit court; and the standard I \nhad articulated and applied throughout my career became increasingly \nirrelevant.\n  Despite my efforts to preserve deference and keep ideology out of the \nprocess, the proponents of an ideological test had won the fight; they \nchanged the rules. Filibustering nominees on the grounds of ideology \nalone was now perfectly acceptable. It was now Senate precedent.\n  Some may argue that Republicans were no better since a few of them \nsupported filibusters against two Clinton-era nominees, Richard Paez \nand Marsha Berzon. It is a flawed comparison. First, neither filibuster \nattempt got very far. And in both cases, the leadership--the \nleadership--of the Republican Party, including me, strongly opposed the \neffort.\n\n  Senator Lott, the then-majority leader at the time, voted in favor of \nallowing an up-or-down vote on both nominees, even though he would \nultimately vote against them as nominees to the Ninth Circuit, as did I \nand the vast majority of our conference. It was our view that a \nPresident--and in that instance President Clinton--deserved \nconsiderable deference and that therefore his nominees should not be \nfilibustered.\n  The new standard devolved even further during the Roberts nomination. \nJudge Roberts was a spectacular nominee, a man whose background and \nlegal abilities, even according to Democrats, made him one of the most \nqualified Supreme Court nominees in the history of our country. For \nhim, Democrats came up with an even more disturbing test.\n  Ironically, no one Senator articulated this new test more forcefully \nthan Senator Obama. In a floor speech announcing his opposition to John \nRoberts, Senator Obama was perfectly straightforward. Roberts was \ncompletely qualified, he said. But he still would not get his vote. \nHere is what Senator Obama said on the Senate floor:\n\n       There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is \n     qualified to sit on the highest court in the land. Moreover, \n     he seems to have the comportment and the temperament that \n     makes for a good judge. He is humble. He is personally \n     decent.\n\n  The reason Senator Obama would vote against Judge Roberts, he said, \nrested not on any traditional standard, but on a new one, a standard \nwhich amounted to a kind of alchemy based on what he described as \n``one's deepest values, one's core concerns, one's broader perspectives \non how the world\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\nworks, and the depth and breadth of one's empathy''--what has come to \nbe known as the ``empathy standard.''\n  So over the course of the Bush administration the rules completely \nchanged. Not only had it become common practice to block nominees on \nthe grounds of ideology, but now it was acceptable to reject someone \nbased solely on the expectation that their feelings--their feelings--\nwould not lead them to rule in favor of certain groups. Suddenly, \njudges were not even expected to follow the fundamental principle of \nblind justice. Deference had eroded even more.\n  As I have stated repeatedly throughout this debate, empathy is a very \ngood quality in itself. And I have no doubt that Senator Obama--now \nPresident Obama--had good intentions, and that his heart was in the \nright place when he made this argument. But when it comes to judging, \nempathy is only good if you are lucky enough to be the person or group \nthat the judge in question has empathy for. In those cases, it is the \njudge, not the law, who determines the outcome. And that is a dangerous \nroad to go down if you believe, as I do, in a nation not of men but of \nlaws--which brings us to Judge Sotomayor.\n  Over the past several weeks, Judge Sotomayor has impressed all of us \nwith her life story. And the confirmation process is not easy. I admire \nanyone who goes through it, which is why I was gratified by Judge \nSotomayor's statement at the conclusion of the hearing that she was \ntreated fairly by everyone.\n  But the first question I have to ask myself in deciding how to vote \non this nominee is this: How stands the traditional standard for voting \non nominees?\n  Deference is still an important principle. But it was clearly eroded \nduring the filibusters of appeals court nominees early in the Bush \nadministration, and it was eroded even further when Senators voted \nagainst John Roberts and tried to filibuster Samuel Alito. Moreover, \nthe introduction of a new standard--the empathy standard--forces us to \nreevaluate again the degree of deference a President should be granted. \nIsn't it incumbent upon even those of us who have always believed in \ndeference to be even more cautious about approving nominees in this new \nenvironment? I believe it is.\n  If empathy is the new standard, then the burden is on any nominee who \nis chosen on that basis to show a firm commitment to equal justice \nunder law. In the past, such a commitment would have been taken for \ngranted. Americans have always had faith that our judges would apply \nthe law fairly--or at least always knew they should. Unfortunately, the \nnew empathy standard requires a measure of reassurance about this. If \nnominees aren't even expected to apply equal justice, we can't be \nexpected simply to defer to the President, especially if that nominee, \nas a sitting judge, no less, has repeatedly doubted the ability to \nadhere to this core principle.\n  This doesn't mean I would oppose a nominee just because he or she is \nnominated by a Democrat. It means that, at a minimum, nominees should \nbe expected to uphold the judicial oath that judges in this country \nhave taken since the earliest days of our Nation; namely, that they \nwill ``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal \nright to the poor, to the rich, and . . . faithfully and impartially \ndischarge and perform all the duties incumbent upon them under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, so help [them] God.''\n  Looked at in this light, Judge Sotomayor's record of written \nstatements suggests an alarming lack of respect for the notion of equal \njustice and therefore, in my view, an insufficient willingness to abide \nby the judicial oath. This is particularly important when considering \nsomeone for the Supreme Court since, if she were confirmed, there would \nbe no higher court to deter or prevent her from injecting into the law \nthe various disconcerting principles that recur throughout her public \nstatements. For that reason, I will oppose her nomination.\n  Judge Sotomayor has made clear over the years that she subscribes to \na number of strongly held and controversial beliefs that I think most \nAmericans, and certainly most Kentuckians, would strongly disagree \nwith, but that is not why I oppose her nomination; rather, it is her \nviews on the essential question of the duty of a judge and the fact \nthat there would be no check on those views were she to become a member \nof the Supreme Court.\n  In her writings and in her speeches, Judge Sotomayor has repeatedly \nstated that a judge's personal experiences affect judicial outcomes. \nShe has said her experiences will affect the facts she chooses to see \nas a judge. Let me say that again. She has said her experiences will \naffect the facts she chooses to see as a judge. She has argued that in \ndeciding cases, judges should bring their sympathies and prejudices to \nbear. She has dismissed the ideal of judicial impartiality as an \n``aspiration''--an aspiration--that, in her view, cannot be met even in \nmost cases. Taken together, these statements suggest not just a sense \nthat impartiality is not just impossible but it is not even worth the \neffort.\n  But there is more. It appears these views have already found \nexpression in Judge Sotomayor's rulings from the bench. The clearest \nevidence of this is the judgment of the Supreme Court itself. The \nSupreme Court doesn't take easy cases. It only takes cases where there \nis no easy precedent, where the law is not crystal clear, cases where \nsomebody's policy preferences can more easily make their way into an \nopinion. In this vein, it is worth noting that the Supreme Court has \nfound that Judge Sotomayor misapplied the law in 9 of the 10 cases in \nwhich her rulings were brought before it. In this term, in fact, she is \nzero for three. Not only isn't this a record to be proud of, together \nwith her statements about impartiality, it is a record to be scared of \nif you happen to find yourselves standing in front of Justice \nSotomayor.\n  Her most recent reversal by the Court is a perfect illustration of \nhow her personal views can affect an outcome. I am referring to the \nRicci case in which a majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court \nrejected Judge Sotomayor's decision, and all of them, all nine of them, \nagreed that her reading of the law was flawed.\n  This was a case in which a group of firefighters who had studied hard \nand passed a written test for promotion were denied it because not \nenough minority firefighters had scored as well as they had. In a one-\nparagraph opinion that a number of judges on her own court criticized \nas insubstantial and less than adequate given the seriousness of the \ncircumstances, Judge Sotomayor flatly rejected an appeal by \nfirefighters who had scored highly.\n  Here was a case where Judge Sotomayor's long history of advocacy for \ngroup preferences appeared to overtake an evenhanded application of the \nlaw. Judge Sotomayor didn't empathize with the firefighters who had \nearned a promotion, and they suffered as a result. This is the real-\nworld effect of the empathy standard. If the judge has empathy for you, \ngreat, but if she has it for the other guy, it is not so good. That is \nwhy you can call this new standard a lot of things, but you certainly \ncan't call it justice.\n  Judge Sotomayor's record on the Second Circuit is troubling enough, \nbut, as I have noted, at least on the circuit court there is a \nbackstop. Her cases can be reviewed by the Supreme Court. This meant \nthat in the Ricci case, for example, the firefighters whose promotions \nwere unfairly denied could appeal the decision. Fortunately for them, \nthe Supreme Court sided with them over Judge Sotomayor. If, however, \nJudge Sotomayor would become a Supreme Court Justice, her rulings would \nbe final. She would be unencumbered by the obligation of lower court \njudges to follow precedent. She could act more freely on the kinds of \nviews that animated her troubling and legally incorrect ruling in the \nRicci case. That is not a chance I am willing to take.\n  From the beginning of the confirmation process, I have said that \nAmericans expect one thing when they walk into a courtroom, whether it \nis a traffic court or the Supreme Court, and that is equal treatment \nunder the law. Over the years, Americans have accepted significant \nideological differences in the kinds of men and women various \nPresidents have nominated to the Supreme Court, but one thing Americans \nwill never tolerate in a nominee is a belief that some groups are more \ndeserving of a fair shake than others. Nothing could be more offensive \nto the American sensibility than that.\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\n  Judge Sotomayor is a fine person with an impressive story and a \ndistinguished background. But above all else, a judge must check his or \nher personal or political agenda at the courtroom door and do justice \nevenhandedly, as the judicial oath requires. This is the most basic and \ntherefore the most fundamental standard of all upon which judges in our \ncountry must be judged. Judge Sotomayor does not meet the test.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Republican leader on \nhis statement. I think it was very thorough. I think it was very \nthoughtful, and I am sure it took a lot of hours of deliberation and \nobservation not only of Judge Sotomayor's record but also of her \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee. So I congratulate the \nRepublican leader on a very thoughtful statement and one that I think \nmakes very clear the reason he reached the difficult decision to oppose \nthe nomination of Judge Sotomayor for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I wish to say that we are supposed to be on the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. Obviously, we are not. We are on the hate crimes \nbill, which the majority leader decided was important enough to replace \nthe proceedings of the Senate on the Defense authorization bill and the \nvery urgent mission we have and obligation and duties we have as a \nCongress to authorize the means necessary to defend the security of \nthis Nation and the men and women who are defending it. So we will be \nwrapped around the axle on amendments and which ones are allowed and \ntime agreements. I am not saying this legislation would have moved \nforward smoothly; there are always some difficulties. But for many \nyears now, I have been involved in the authorization bill, and this is \nthe first time I ever saw the majority leader of the Senate come \nforward and propose a comprehensive piece of legislation which had not \ngone through the committee of authorization, and, of course, this side \nof the aisle then had to, as is our right, propose an amendment of our \nown. Of course, there is some reluctance on this side of the aisle to \nagree to a time agreement, and so we go back and forth. Meanwhile, the \nmen and women of the military are in two wars and they don't quite \nunderstand why we don't just move forward and do what our oath of \noffice requires us to do, and that is to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States. So I will continue to work with the \ndistinguished chairman, and I am hoping we will be able to work \ntogether to get the legislation moving again.\n  I understand there are four amendments to be considered on the hate \ncrimes bill and that a gun amendment has been introduced and there may \nbe amendments on that, and time agreements. Meanwhile, the issue of the \nF-22 and whether we continue production of it is set aside while we \ndebate nongermane amendments to the Defense authorization bill.\n  So I guess what is probably going to happen, from previous \nexperience--and I don't know--probably around Thursday, the majority \nleader will come to the floor and say that we haven't moved forward and \nwe haven't made progress, blame it on this side of the aisle, and file \ncloture. Then we will have a vote on cloture. I would imagine that \ngiven--I don't know how that vote turns out; it depends on whether \nMembers on both sides of the aisle feel their amendments or their views \nhave been adequately addressed.\n  But I am convinced that we would have moved forward with the \nauthorization bill, that we probably could have addressed the issue of \nthe F-22--and I do not say this side of the aisle is blameless, but I \ndo understand why, when we knew hate crimes was going to be brought up, \nthat those who feel strongly on this side of the aisle--including the \nfact that it never went through the Judiciary Committee; it has never \nbeen reported out but is added on a defense authorization bill--had \ntheir concerns. So it is unfortunate. It is unfortunate, and it is not \nreally a good statement about the way we represent the American people, \nbecause if there is any legislation we should be moving forward on--and \nI will take responsibility on this side of the aisle too--that \ncertainly is the Defense authorization bill.\n  I believe there is an unbroken record of approval of the Defense \nauthorization bill over a many-year period of time. I hope that, on \nbehalf of the greater good, we can sit down and work out amendments and \nwork through the hate crimes and the amendment by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, and we can move forward and get this issue resolved. I \ndon't think it is the right way to do business, particularly when we \nare talking about the defense of the Nation.\n  So I pledge to my colleague from Michigan, the distinguished chairman \nwhom I have had the great honor of working with for many years, to try \nto work through this. But I still maintain that the fact that the \nmajority leader of the Senate felt it necessary to bring a hate crimes \nbill up before the Senate on a defense authorization bill, which is \nclearly not germane, triggered this situation we are in today.\n  Having said that, it is what it is, and so I will go in the back now \nand see where we can work out amendments, see if we can work out an \nagreement to have the hate crimes vote, to have the gun vote, and then \nhopefully work with the target of tomorrow morning for voting on the F-\n22 since, as we have discussed in the past on the floor of the Senate, \nthe importance of that vote is far transcendent of any single weapons \nsystem. It is really all about whether we are going to have business as \nusual and spend taxpayers' money on what the President of the United \nStates, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nstaff, and our other military leaders think should be spent on the \nJoint Strike Fighter rather than further production of the F-22. From \nwhat I understand, it may be a close vote and a very interesting one. I \nwish we were spending more time debating that than hate crimes and gun \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, we are operating under a \nunanimous consent agreement. We have an agreement to vote on the F-22 \namendment after 2 hours of debate. We are attempting to schedule that \nnow. People are getting the cooperation of Members for tomorrow \nmorning. That is our goal.\n  The pending amendments to the hate crimes provision are going to be \ndisposed of this afternoon pursuant to that same unanimous consent \nagreement. There may be a difference as to how we got to where we are. \nThere is a difference; it was the inability to get the F-22 amendment \nto a vote, to get a time agreement, which triggered the determination \nof the majority leader to offer an amendment that Senator Kennedy had \noffered about 2 years ago on a Defense authorization bill. It passed \nthe Senate after a long debate.\n  It is not the first time hate crimes was taken up by the Senate. It \nis not the first time the hate crimes amendment was offered on the \nDefense authorization bill. It was offered 2 years ago, and it passed \non a 60-to-39 vote, I believe. It was Senator Kennedy's amendment. Of \ncourse, Senator Kennedy is not available now to offer his own \namendment. The majority leader offered it because of Senator Kennedy's \nnecessary absence.\n  So now we are operating under a unanimous consent agreement. The \npending amendment is Senator Thune's. It is not germane, but, again, it \nis not unusual that nongermane amendments are offered in the Senate. We \ntry to keep them to a minimum--those who manage bills--in order to get \nthrough the bill.\n  We are hoping that once the F-22 amendment and the amendment of \nSenator Thune are disposed of, we will then be able to get back to \ngermane and relevant amendments. That is our hope. In order for that to \nhappen, we need Members of the Senate to bring those amendments to the \nfloor and tell us they are ready to proceed.\n  We are working very hard, as we always do, and our staffs are working \nvery hard, as they always do, to clear amendments. I believe we have \nabout 20 amendments that have been cleared already and, at an \nappropriate time, I believe Senator McCain and I will be able to offer \nthem as a package.\n  Senator McCain was extremely helpful in getting us to the point where \nwe\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\ncould enter the unanimous consent agreement. A vote is scheduled today \non our hate crimes-related amendment. We have a time agreement on the \nF-22 amendment, and a time for voting on that amendment is being \ndiscussed. It is my goal that we vote on that amendment tomorrow \nmorning after we debate it.\n  Please, colleagues, bring your amendments to the floor. We are here. \nWe are ready to be notified of those amendments on which Members of the \nSenate believe we will need a rollcall vote. We will try to clear as \nmany amendments as we can. We urge our colleagues to notify us now of \nthe amendments they intend to offer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 1614 be \nidentified as a Kennedy amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Moon Landing Anniversary\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the historic event that \ntook place on this date 40 years ago. On this day in 1969, Ohio native \nNeil Armstrong became the first human to step foot on the Moon.\n  For those of us old enough to remember that day, it was a day when \nthe stuff of dreams became reality. While that magical moment is still \na source of inspiration for young people today, the times in which the \nlanding took place are often forgotten. The United States and the \nSoviet Union were in the middle of the space race, but the Moon landing \nwas about so much more than who could get there first.\n  It was the height of a major progressive era in our Nation's history, \nwhich saw the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid; saw the Civil \nRights and Voting Rights Act signed into law; the creation of Head \nStart; a time which saw the beginning of the environmental movement in \nour time, all within about a 5-year period, during that progressive \nera.\n  It was also a time of turmoil for America. We were a nation at war. \nWe bore witness to the assassinations, only a year before, of Dr. \nMartin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.\n  When America needed heroes--and it did that summer in 1969--it found \nthem in the crew of the Apollo 11 spacecraft.\n  Despite uncertain times our Nation faced, we refused to succumb. We \nmoved forward in the most American way--working to achieve what others \nsaid could not be done.\n  I was 16 years old when Neil Armstrong took that historic first step. \nNeil Armstrong is from Wapakoneta, OH, in the western part of the \nState, with just shy of 10,000 people and a little more than 100 miles \nor about a 2-hour drive from where I grew up.\n  I remember those days when I was 16. We had a black-and-white \ntelevision, and my brother convinced my parents, because we were the \nonly ones among our friends who still had a black-and-white TV, that \nthey should go out and get a colored TV so we could watch the Moon \nlanding. I think my brother knew--although I am not sure--that the Moon \nlanding would be broadcast in black and white. But my brother convinced \nmy parents to get that TV, on which we enjoyed watching Cleveland \nIndians baseball games and other things after that. Nonetheless, I am \nsure almost everybody of almost any age remembers, after watching that \nMoon landing, going outside on that late July night and looking up at \nthe Moon and being private with our thoughts, wondering about these two \nAmericans walking on the Moon, wondering about the other American in \nthe space capsule--not at that time able to walk on the Moon. He was \nstaying inside the space capsule.\n  I remember, too, 7 years before Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon, \nsimilar to most Americans, watching John Glenn, from New Concord, OH, \nbecome the first American to orbit the Earth.\n  So an Ohioan was the first one to orbit the Earth and an Ohioan was \nthe first to walk on the Moon.\n  Today, such as then, NASA continues to capture our Nation's \nimagination. While Neil Armstrong will forever be remembered as the \nChristopher Columbus of our time, his step for all humankind was a \nculmination of the efforts of thousands of Americans who dedicated \nthemselves to landing on the Moon.\n  It was more than his crew mates, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. It \nwas more than the hundreds of men and women at mission control. From \nwhat is now NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland to the hundreds of \nthousands of scientists and researchers around the Nation, the Moon \nlanding was about the American spirit and know-how. The Apollo 11 Moon \nlanding was a national collaborative success.\n  As we look back on the past 40 years, we have seen a different \ncountry in a different time, with many of the same challenges. As our \nNation struggles to pull itself out of the current economic downturn, \nwe have debated what role the government should play in space \nexploration. While we debate the future of NASA, we must also remember \nthe billions of dollars of economic benefit NASA has brought, and is \nstill bringing, our Nation.\n  The myth that the Federal Government is incapable of doing great \nthings is shattered when one thinks of achievements such as the Moon \nlanding--not to mention Medicare, Social Security, and all we talked \nabout in that progressive era.\n\n  From the six Apollo landings, to Skylab, to cooperation with the \nSoviet Union, to the shuttle program, to the Hubble telescope, to the \nspace shuttle, and beyond, NASA has touched and improved nearly every \naspect of our American way of life.\n  Those who believe government should sit on the sidelines and merely \nbe an observer in our Nation's future need not look back 40 years but \ncan look at everything NASA has done and what it continues to do today.\n  Today, NASA, in many ways, is more important than ever. As we work \ntoward a carbon-free economy, we forget that NASA was building the \nfirst large-scale windmills in the 1970s. Much of the early work on \nwind turbine technology development was done at Plum Brook in northern \nOhio, near Sandusky, part of NASA Glenn.\n  In a modern version of the space race, the United States is in a \nsprint to lead the world in clean energy. NASA's alternative fuel \nresearch laboratory, and its solar-powered aircraft, Helios and \nPathfinder Plus and its space solar program are just three of the many \nNASA clean energy programs.\n  We can create a carbon-free world, and NASA can lead the way, just \nlike it has in aeronautics and space flight. We must never forget the \nmen and women of NASA and their work that enabled the United States to \nput Apollo 11 on the Moon.\n  I am proud to cosponsor S. 951, which would authorize the President \nto award Congressional Gold Medals to Neil A. Armstrong, the first \nhuman to walk on the Moon; Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin, Jr., the pilot of \nthe lunar module and second person to walk on the Moon; Michael \nCollins, the pilot of their Apollo 11 mission's command module; and the \nfirst American to orbit the Earth, John Herschel Glenn.\n  The bill's sponsor is Senator Nelson of Florida, an American hero in \nhis own right, who has a long history of service to our Nation and \nNASA.\n  Today is a celebration of NASA, of the Apollo mission, and a \ncelebration of our country. It is also a celebration of humankind's \nability to do great things. Today is a celebration of reaching for the \nstars in every way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICDER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am very concerned about legislation \nthat has been added to the Defense bill, the\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\nso-called Hate Crimes Act. Certainly, none of us has any sympathy \nwhatsoever for people who commit crimes of any kind, particularly those \nwho would attack somebody because of their race, ethnicity, sexual \norientation, or any other reason. I wish to take a few moments to \nexplain why this is important and why this legislation is not good and \nit ought not to be passed. Some of my remarks may appear to be \ntechnical, but they are very important, in my view, as a former Federal \nprosecutor for almost 15 years.\n  I don't think it was ever appropriate that we bring this legislation \nto the floor and stick it on this Defense bill without having a markup \nin the committee without the ability to discuss it and improve it.\n  For years legal commentators and jurists have expressed concern at \nthe tendency of Congress, for the political cause of the moment, to \npersist in adding more and more offenses to the U.S. Criminal Code that \nwere never Federal U.S. crimes before. This is being done at the same \ntime that crime rates over the past decade or so have dropped and State \nand local police forces have dramatically improved their skills and \ntechnology. There are really fine police forces all over the country \ntoday. An extraordinary number of police officers have college degrees \nand many advanced degrees.\n  I think two questions should be asked initially. First, is this a \ncrime that uniquely affects a Federal interest, and can it be addressed \nby an effective and enforceable statute? Second, have local police and \nsheriffs' offices failed to protect and prosecute this vital interest?\n  Most people do not understand that a majority of crimes--theft, rape, \nrobbery, and assault--are not Federal crimes and are not subject to \ninvestigation by the FBI or any other Federal agency. They could not do \nso if they wanted to because they have no jurisdiction. They can only \ninvestigate Federal crimes. It has been this way since the founding of \nour country, and it fixes responsibility for law enforcement on local \nauthorities where it should be.\n  Americans have always feared a massive Federal Government police \nforce. It is something that we have not ever favored. This is not \nparanoia but a wise approach, and I do not think it should be changed.\n  Instead of administering justice without fear or favor, this \nlegislation that has been placed on this bill creates a new system of \njustice for individuals because of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity, providing them with a special protection, while excluding \nvulnerable individuals, such as the elderly or police officers or \nsoldiers, from such special protections. I don't think we can justify \nthat.\n  The purpose of the DOD reauthorization bill is to make sure the men \nand women who protect our freedoms have the necessary resources to \ncontinue to do the fabulous job they have been doing. We should not \ndeviate from this path by addressing matters wholly unrelated to the \ndefense of our Nation.\n  A bill of such breadth and lack of clarity as this should be \ncarefully reviewed with the opportunity for discussion and amendment in \ncommittee. Yet this legislation had no markup in any committee. In \nfact, no version of the bill has been marked up since 2001, and this \nversion is quite different and more expansive than the 2001 bill.\n  The committee did hold a quickly thrown-together hearing on June 25 \nin which Attorney General Holder himself appeared. The Attorney \nGeneral, however, failed to point to one single serious incident in the \npast 5 years, when I asked him that question, where the types of crimes \nthat are referred to in the bill, to give special Federal protection to \nselect individuals, were not being prosecuted by State and local \ngovernments.\n  Additionally, the Attorney General refused to say attacks on U.S. \nsoldiers predicated on their membership in the military by, for \nexample, a Muslim fundamentalist, could be considered a hate crime.\n  It is baffling to me, given previous opposition and serious concerns \nwhich have been raised about this legislation, that the act, instead of \nbeing constrained, is actually expanded in a vague and awkward way. It \nfocuses on the perception of what someone might have been thinking when \nthey committed the crime and includes categories which are undefined \nand exceedingly broad, such as gender-related characteristics and \ngender identity. From questions that have been raised, these categories \ndo not have clear meaning. During the course of debate on hate crimes \nlegislation--a debate that started in 2001--amendments have been \noffered to also protect our military men and women, where it is \nunquestioned they have been targeted. Those amendments were rejected.\n\n  Mr. President, I will briefly outline my opposition to the \nlegislation in the following ways:\n  The hate crimes amendment is unwarranted, possibly unconstitutional--\ncertainly, I believe it is unconstitutional in certain parts--and it \nviolates the basic principle of equal justice under the law. The hate \ncrimes amendment to this bill has been said to cheapen the civil rights \nmovement.\n  When Congress passed the original civil rights statute in 1968, it \ncriminalized violent and discriminatory actions directed at individuals \nbecause of race, color, religion, or national origin. There was, sadly, \nquite a substantial body of evidence that crimes were being committed \nagainst minorities and they were not being prosecuted. Section 245 that \nwas then passed was never envisioned by Congress to be a hate crimes \nstatute but one, rather, that would ensure access by minorities to \nspecific activities legitimate to their freedom, such as enrolling in \npublic schools, enjoying the benefit of programs administered by the \nState, or attending court as a juror.\n  In 1968, care was taken to ensure that the underlying statute was \ncarefully crafted and narrowly tailored to address the problem of \naccess to ensure that criminal activity fell within the confines of the \nconstitutional requirement that there be a Federal nexus with \ninterstate commerce. The statute enumerates six instances in which a \ncrime could be charged. That statute says this:\n\n       Whoever, whether or not acting under the color of law, by \n     force or threat of force willfully injures, intimidates or \n     interferes with, or attempts to injure, intimidate or \n     interfere with any person because of his race, color, \n     religion or national origin and because he is or has been. . \n     . .\n\n  And then it lists specific areas that would encompass a criminal \noffense.\n\n       (a) enrolling in or attending any public school or public \n     college.\n\n  So if anyone who was attempting to attend a public school or college \nwas interfered with or intimidated because of their race, color, \nreligion or national origin, that would be the offense.\n\n       (b) participating in or enjoying any benefit, service, \n     privilege, program, facility or activity provided or \n     administered by any State or subdivision thereof.\n\n  In other words, you can go to the city hall, you can go to the health \ndepartment, and you cannot be discriminated against because of your \nrace or background.\n  Unfortunately, I have to say there were areas of the country--\nparticularly in my area of the South--where that was not so. People \nwere being unfairly treated. In fact, in some other areas of the \ncountry also. I believe great care was taken with that act because, as \nI said, there was strong evidence to suggest that a Federal expansion \nof criminal law would be appropriate to deal with it.\n  So the history of civil rights violations caused and fully justified \nCongress's passage of this statute. There was direct evidence, for \nexample, that African Americans were being denied the right to vote or \nintimidated at voting precincts without State and local law enforcement \nprotecting them. There was much evidence, sadly, that other rights of \nAfrican Americans were not being protected.\n  But that is not the case with this amendment, and I will talk about \nthat in a minute. Gays and lesbians have not been denied basic access \nto things such as health or schooling or to the ballot box. They openly \nare able to advocate their positions today, which I think is certainly \nhealthy, and have no difficulty in approaching government officials at \nwhatever level.\n  When Eric Holder testified a few weeks ago before the Judiciary \nCommittee, I asked him point-blank for direct evidence that hate crimes \nagainst individuals over the past 5 years, because of their sexual \norientation or\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\notherwise, were not being prosecuted by local authorities. Instead of \nanswering the question, he referred me to four cases in his written \ntestimony which he had delivered to the committee. Let me make the \nnumber clear as strong evidence that these cases are being prosecuted.\n  The Attorney General could not come up with 4,000 cases or 400 or 40 \ncases. He only named four cases in 5 years. So we took a look at those \nfour cases he cited in his testimony, and this is what we found.\n  In one case, Joseph and Georgia Silva assaulted an Indian-American \ncouple on the beach. Although there was evidence that racial and ethnic \nslurs were used during the altercation, a California El Dorado County \njudge ruled that prosecutors failed to produce sufficient evidence that \nthe alleged assault was motivated by racial prejudice. The prosecutor \nhad pursued a hate crimes conviction, including charging Silva with a \nfelony assault, punishable by up to 3 years in prison. The evidence, \naccording to the judge, was that racial slurs were used in the heat of \nanger. There was no evidence the attack was initiated because of \nethnicity.\n  Both Joseph and Georgia Silva were convicted of assault, the basic \ncrime that they committed, and Joseph Silva was sentenced to 6 months \nin prison and 3 months probation, while Georgia was sentenced to 1 year \nin prison.\n  So the question is, was there an important Federal right left \nunaddressed that needed to be vindicated by charging this couple again \nfor the crime arising from that assault? In other words, that is what \nthis bill does. It says if we are unhappy with the result in State \ncourt under a select group of crimes, the Federal Government can try \nthe case again.\n  You might say, well, there is a double jeopardy clause in the \nConstitution; you can't be tried twice for the same crime. Good; if you \nasked that question, you get an A in constitutional law. However, there \nis an answer. It has long been established that the States are \nsovereign and the Federal Government is sovereign. So an individual can \nbe tried by two separate sovereigns without implicating the double \njeopardy clause of the Constitution. However, we have always understood \nthat ought not to be done lightly. It ought not be done without a real \njustification because it violates the spirit of the double jeopardy \nclause of the Constitution.\n  Attorney General Holder also cited a 2003 case in Holtsville, NY. In \nthat case, three White men, while using racial slurs, assaulted a group \nof Latino teenagers as they entered a Chili's restaurant. One of the \nthree defendants entered a guilty plea for his involvement in the \nassault and was sentenced to 15 months in prison. The other two \ndefendants proceeded to trial and were acquitted because the jury \napparently concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the offense that occurred was to deny the victims \naccess to the restaurant. So they had a trial, and one was convicted \nand two were not.\n  The Attorney General cited a South Carolina case where a gay man was \nassaulted after leaving a bar. During the altercation, he fell and he \nsuffered a fatal strike to the head from the concrete. Stephen Miller \nwas convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 5 years in \nprison.\n  Finally, the Attorney General cited a case from here in the District \nof Columbia where a transgender prostitute was murdered. Apparently, \nafter Derrick Lewis discovered that the prostitute he had picked up in \nhis automobile was not female, and the prostitute refused to get out of \nhis car, an altercation of some kind occurred--an argument--and he had \na gun and shot and killed this transgender individual. He eventually \npled guilty, gave a full statement of what happened, and was sentenced \nto 10 years in prison. The evidence showed they had begun fighting and \nthat is when he pulled the gun and shot him. He said the individual \nwould not get out of the car.\n  Well, those are not insignificant crimes, but I can just advise my \ncolleagues, if we just pause one moment and think, we know that at this \nvery moment thousands, maybe 10,000 or more trials are ongoing in State \nand local courts all over America, and they do not always end as people \nwould like them to end. What this bill does basically is it provides an \nopportunity for the Federal Government to pick and choose certain \ncrimes they want to prosecute again to get the kind of justice they \nthink might be likely. That is a broad power that we give to the \nAttorney General and a broad statute I don't believe is compelled by \nthe facts that are happening in America today.\n  When my staff followed up with the Office of the Attorney General to \nsee why they listed just these cases, the response wasn't that State \nand local law enforcement were not doing their jobs but that the \nAttorney General believed the cases were under prosecuted. Citing four \ncases over 5 years as being underprosecuted is not the kind of evidence \nneeded to justify the passage of such an expansive new piece of \nlegislation that injects Federal prosecutors in areas of crime not \nheretofore occurring.\n  After the Judiciary hearing, both Senator Coburn and I sent followup \nquestions to the Attorney General to provide him an additional \nopportunity to demonstrate that the bill was necessary because of under \nprosecution, as he had testified. Senator Coburn asked this question:\n\n       Precisely how many hate crimes is the Justice Department \n     aware of that have gone unprosecuted at the State and local \n     level?\n\n  This is the answer we got from the U.S. Attorney General:\n\n       The Department believes that our partners at all levels of \n     law enforcement share our commitment to effective hate crimes \n     enforcement. The Department does not have access to precise \n     statistics of hate crimes that have gone unprosecuted at the \n     State and local level, and we are unaware of any source for \n     such comprehensive information of unprosecuted offenses \n     generally. Federal jurisdiction over the violent bias-\n     motivated offenses covered under S. 909 is needed as a \n     backstop for State and local law enforcement, to ensure that \n     justice is done in every case.\n\n  So he is suggesting that, in a select group of cases that are on the \nfront burner today, the Attorney General needs this legislation--S. \n909, which has now been attached to the Defense bill--as a backstop for \nState and local law enforcement to ensure that justice is done in every \ncase.\n  Well, there are many prosecutorial and jury decisions that are made \nin State courts every day with which one could disagree. The question \nis whether the Federal Government will be empowered to ensure justice \nis done in every case.\n\n  I just want to share the reality of the world with my friends here, \nthat anyone, I guess, can conclude that a case didn't end justly for \nthem. One distinguished jurist is famously quoted as saying, ``To speak \nof justice is the equivalent of pounding the table. It just adds an \nelement of emotion to the discussion.'' But whatever we mean by that \nword, it basically means the Attorney General gets to decide whatever \nhe wants to do. I am not sure this is good legislation. I think \nlegislation ought to be crisp and clear and set forth criteria by which \na prosecution occurs or does not occur, leaving not so much broad \ndiscretion among the prosecutorial authorities.\n  I submitted, after Senator Coburn--or at the same time, really--a \nsimilar question because I believed he had not been responsive to my \nquestion, and I asked this about our colleague, referring to Senator \nHatch--of course a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee and who \nhas worked on this issue for a number of years--and my question is \nthis:\n\n       Senator Hatch in the past has offered a complete substitute \n     to similar legislation, which would require that a study be \n     conducted to prove that there is an actual problem with hate \n     crimes not being prosecuted. Do not give me a general \n     response that there are some problems out there. I would like \n     you to provide the Committee with an exact and precise number \n     of hate crimes the Justice Department is aware of which have \n     gone unprosecuted at the State and local level. Please detail \n     every example you or anyone in the Department of Justice is \n     aware of where no prosecutorial effort took place.\n\n  This was the answer we got:\n\n       The Department is unable to provide an exact number of \n     cases in which State, local or tribal jurisdictions have \n     failed to prosecute hate crimes because we are not aware of \n     any such compilation of data.\n\n  Senator Hatch has been offering this amendment for a study for a \ndecade.\n  The Attorney General goes on to say:\n\n       When the Department receives complaints it clearly lacks \n     jurisdiction to prosecute, these matters generally are never \n     opened as investigations. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\n\n  Let me just say, if this legislation is passed it will have one \ndramatic, undiscussed impact. Federal law enforcement agents--and there \nare not many. You may have a city with 300 police officers in it and 10 \nFBI agents, another hundred sheriffs' deputies, another number of State \nofficers. Now huge numbers of crimes will be coming across the desk of \nthe FBI, which has terrorism, white-collar crime, bank fraud which they \nneed to be working on today, violent crimes and drug smuggling. Now \nthey are going to have to review hundreds of complaints about cases \nthey had not heretofore had jurisdiction of and did not have to review. \nI just raise that point as an aside.\n  Based on the Attorney General's response, I conclude that the bottom \nline is there is nowhere near the real evidence needed to justify this \nlegislation. No one in this body has produced the evidence, and the \nAttorney General of the United States, who is promoting the bill, has \nnot produced any. Attorney General Holder's response, instead of \ndemonstrating the need for hate crimes legislation as written, provides \nverification that it is not necessary, and it raises a question of \nwhether this is driven by political interests at this time. It is easy \nto complain that anybody who opposes a hate crimes bill favors hate. \nThat is not a fair charge. I think most of our colleagues fully \nunderstand that. But politically that is the suggestion some have made \nwhen this legislation has been objected to by people with very valid \nconcerns.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the studies heavily relied on by the \nAttorney General in support of this bill is a 2008 report published by \nthe National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, which is composed \nprimarily of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender groups. They have \nevery right to do those studies and present them, but it is a coalition \nclearly with a vested interest in the legislation, and it should be \nexamined carefully. The Attorney General had to rely on these types of \nreports because crime statistics do not support the notion that the \nincidence of hate crimes has increased. Even though we are doing a \nbetter job of reporting those today, still over the past 10 years the \nnumber is down, down slightly, even though population is up in our \ncountry.\n  Furthermore, in a rushed attempt to provide answers to the committee \nprior to this amendment being filed, the Department seemed to put \nlittle thought into their responses to our questions. As a matter of \nfact, it appears the Attorney General didn't think the issue important \nenough to answer them himself. He let his staff people answer, when he \nwas the one who appeared before the committee and we were following up \non his personal testimony.\n  A number of arguments and statements have been made, including those \nby the Attorney General, that there are quite a few of these incidents, \ntens of thousands of these incidents over the last number of years. But \noverwhelmingly these despicable incidents are of vandalism, many by \njuveniles. Let me make clear that even those incidents are significant \nand deserve prosecution and investigation and, where appropriate, stiff \npunishment. But let's look at the views of the members of the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights, our own U.S. Civil Rights Commission, who \nhave examined this legislation carefully. Six of its eight members \nsigned a strong letter to the President and to the Judiciary Committee \nto oppose hate crimes legislation. Did I mean to say the Civil Rights \nCommission wrote in favor it? No. But to oppose it. Their letter, dated \nJune 16--just last month--addressed to the Members of the Senate and \nthe President, said this:\n\n       We believe that the MSHCPA [Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \n     Prevention Act] will do little good and a great deal of harm. \n     Its most important effect will be to allow Federal \n     authorities to reprosecute a broad category of defendants who \n     have already been acquitted by State juries, as in the Rodney \n     King and Crown Heights cases more than a decade ago. Due to \n     the exception for prosecution by ``dual sovereigns,'' [that \n     is the two sovereign entities] such double prosecutions \n     technically are not violations of the double jeopardy clause \n     of the U.S. Constitution. But they are very much a violation \n     of the spirit that drove the Framers of the Bill of Rights, \n     who never dreamed that Federal criminal jurisdiction would be \n     expanded to the point where an astonishing portion of crimes \n     are now both State and Federal offenses. We regard the broad \n     federalization of crime as a menace to civil liberties. There \n     is no better place to draw the line on that process than with \n     a bill that purports to protect civil rights.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       While the title of MSHCPA suggests that it will apply only \n     to ``hate crimes,'' the actual criminal prohibitions \n     contained in it do not require that the defendant be inspired \n     by hatred or ill will in order to convict. It is sufficient \n     if he acts ``because of'' someone's actual or perceived race, \n     color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, \n     gender identity or disability.\n\n  I am quoting from the Civil Rights Commission letter.\n\n       Rapists are seldom indifferent to the gender of their \n     victims. They are virtually always chosen ``because of'' \n     their gender. A robber might well steal only from women or \n     the disabled because, in general, they are less able to \n     defend themselves. Literally they [these victims] are chosen \n     because of their gender or disability.\n\n  The letter goes on to state their belief that every rape in America \nwould now be declared a crime under this bill because it is an action \ntaken against someone because of their gender.\n  Professor Gail Heriot, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights, testified at our June 25 hearing. She made clear that all rapes \nwould be covered under the bill and that, indeed, this was intentional. \nShe said:\n\n       This wasn't just sloppy draftsmanship. The language was \n     chosen deliberately. Officials understandably wanted \n     something susceptible to broad construction, in part because \n     it makes prosecutions easier. As a staff member of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee back in 1998, I had conversations with \n     the Department of Justice representatives. They repeatedly \n     refused to disclaim the view that all rape would be covered, \n     and resisted efforts to correct any ambiguity by redrafting \n     the language. They wanted a bill with broad sweep. The last \n     thing they wanted was to limit the scope of the statute's \n     reach by requiring that the defendant be motivated by ill \n     will toward the victim's group.\n\n  I think that is a serious charge made by a member of the Civil Rights \nCommission about the purpose of the Department of Justice in supporting \nthis act.\n  I would note, it is an inevitable delight of prosecutors to have more \nand more power and more and more ability to prosecute criminals. That \nis what they do. They are wonderful people. I never enjoyed anything \nmore than being a prosecutor, wearing a white hat every day to work and \ntrying to vindicate decent people from criminal acts. But that is just \na tendency of the prosecutorial mindset that we ought not to forget.\n  The truth is, during the recent hate crimes hearing, no one who \ntestified in favor of the bill could point to a single incident where, \nI think, a valid hate crime was not pursued or prosecuted by State and \nlocal law enforcement officers.\n  In the latest statistics that are available, of the 2006 hate crimes \nreported in 2007, only nine were classified as murder or nonnegligent \nmanslaughter. That is certainly nine too many. I think every one should \nbe prosecuted. But no complaints have been raised that any of these \nwere not vigorously or fairly prosecuted. Indeed, two-thirds of the \noffenses involved property defacement, such as graffiti and name-\ncalling. Missing from the analysis is any evidence that the crimes are \nnot being prosecuted at the State and local level. Indeed, 45 of the 50 \nStates and the District of Columbia already have and enforce hate \ncrimes laws. Although the language is broad and some could criticize \nit, these States have passed these bills, and they are able to enforce \nthem.\n  Statistics show that these hate crimes, even with better reporting, \nhave decreased slightly over the years. Forty-four States have stiffer \npenalties for violence related to race, religion, or ethnicity, and 31 \nStates have tougher penalties on violence related to sexual \norientation.\n  The question arises, do we have a basis for this massive and historic \nchange in Federal enforcement of what have been State crimes?\n  Perhaps Mr. Andrew Sullivan--an openly gay man who has pioneered the \neffort to have gays in the military and is a well known and an able \nwriter, provides the answer. Mr. Sullivan had this to say about the \nlegislation.\n\n       The real reason for hate crime laws is not the defense of \n     human beings from crimes. There are already laws against \n     that--and Matthew Shepard's murderers were successfully \n     prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law in a State that \n     had no hate crime law at the time.\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\n       The real reason for the invention of hate crimes was a hard \n     left critique of conventional liberal justice and the \n     emergence of special interest groups which need boutique \n     legislation to raise funds for their large staffs and \n     luxurious buildings. Just imagine how many direct mail pieces \n     have gone out explaining that without more money, more gay \n     human beings will be crucified on fences. It is very, very \n     powerful as a money-making tool, which may explain why the \n     largely symbolic Federal bill still has not passed (if it \n     passes, however, I'll keep a close eye on whether it is ever \n     used.)\n\n  This is a gay man expressing his opinion. No doubt he takes these \nissues very seriously, and symbolism is important in our political \nworld, but we need to be careful that statutes that become a permanent \npart of our criminal code are supported by evidence and principle.\n  I do not think our focus here is to deal with symbolic legislation \nthat is broad and can expand Federal criminal jurisdiction beyond its \nhistoric role and where the facts do not support the need. In other \nwords, more narrowly tailored legislation consistent with a \nconstitutional right could very well be something this Congress would \nwant to pass. To pass legislation so extremely broad again could give \nFederal jurisdiction for the first time in history to every rape that \noccurs in America. It ought to be looked at with great care and ought \nnot to be stuck onto a defense bill and moved forward, in my opinion.\n  The Constitution endows Congress with limited and enumerated powers. \nThere is no general police power in the Federal Government. So at this \npoint, I wish to raise issues with the constitutionality of the hate \ncrimes provision.\n\n       Congress's power is limited to what it can regulate under \n     the Commerce Clause. The proposed legislation is based upon \n     the idea that a discrete crime in a local community may have \n     an impact on interstate commerce. This is the same theory \n     that was rejected in both U.S. vs. Lopez and U.S. vs. \n     Morrison, where the Supreme Court essentially ruled that \n     intrastate violent conduct does not impact commerce normally.\n\n  Nat Hentoff, a well-respected noted civil rights and civil \nlibertarian attorney and writer recently wrote about some \nconstitutional concerns he has with the legislation. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       In the definitive constitutional analysis of James B. \n     Jacobs and researcher Kimberly Potter, it is documented in \n     ``Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics'' that in \n     ``Grimm v. Churchill the arresting officer was permitted to \n     testify that the defendant had a history of making racial \n     remarks. Similarly, in People v. Lampkin, the prosecution \n     presented as evidence racist statements the defendant had \n     uttered six years before the crime for which he was on \n     trial,'' as specifically relating to the offense.\n       As for the 14th Amendment's essential requirement that no \n     person be denied ``the equal protection of the laws,'' there \n     is carved above the entrance to the Supreme Court the words \n     ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n       This legislation, certain to be passed by the Senate, now \n     it seems will come to the Supreme Court.\n\n  And I am quoting Mr. Nat Hentoff, the well-known and respected civil \nlibertarian civil rights attorney. He says this:\n\n       When it comes before the Supreme Court, I hope the Justices \n     will look up at the carving as they go into the building. \n     They should also remember that the Fifth Amendment makes \n     clear: ``nor shall any person be subject for the same offence \n     to be twice put in jeopardy.''\n       But the House hate crime bill allows defendants found \n     innocent of that offense in a state court to be tried again \n     in federal court because of insufficiently diligent \n     prosecutors; or, as Attorney General Holder says, when state \n     prosecutors claim lack of evidence. It must be tried again in \n     federal court. Imagine Holder as the state prosecutor in the \n     long early stages of a Duke University lacrosse rape case.\n       What also appalls me, as the new federal bill races toward \n     a presidential signature, is that for many years, and now, \n     the American Civil Liberties Union approves ``hate crimes'' \n     prosecutions. I have long depended on the ACLU's staff of \n     constitutional warriors to act persistently against \n     government abuses of our founding documents. And these \n     attorneys and analysts have been especially valuable in \n     opposing the results of executive branch lunges against the \n     separation of powers in the Bush-Cheney years, and still \n     under Obama.\n\n  Then he says this:\n\n       Is there no non-politically correct ACLU lawyer or other \n     staff worker or anyone in the ACLU affiliates around the \n     country or any dues-paying member outraged enough to demand \n     of the ACLU's ruling circle to at last disavow this \n     corruption of the Constitution?\n\n  That is Mr. Hentoff's view of it.\n  So this hate crimes amendment is a substantial overreach by Congress, \nI do believe. It is not carefully crafted or narrowly tailored. Unlike \nthe historic civil rights statute, it seeks to federalize the violent, \nnoneconomic conduct that is local in nature and has little or no \nFederal nexus.\n  The Supreme Court has held that violent conduct that does not target \neconomic activity is among the types of crimes that have the least \nconnection to Congress's commerce power. However, this is precisely the \nsort of violent, noneconomic conduct that this amendment would \nfederalize.\n  If this approach were permissible, it would put Congress on a path to \nrely on the Commerce Clause and legislate any criminal law it wants. \nWhen it comes to criminal law, Congress would no longer be a body of \nlimited and enumerated powers but would have plenary power to \ncriminalize any and all conduct that is already criminalized by the \nStates, a clear violation of our historical policy of not taking over \nState and local law enforcement.\n  There are still a lot of complaints over the drug laws aggressively \nprosecuted when I was a Federal prosecutor, and many think that was an \noverreach. When drugs come in, the vast majority from outside the \ncountry, they move as interstate commerce, and the courts have held \nthat up.\n  But there is still intellectual criticism and concern about it. But \nin this case, you do not have the kind of dramatic nexus, and you also \nlack the evidence to suggest those cases are not being effectively \nprosecuted. So the sponsors have also tried to ease constitutional \nconcerns by citing the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments.\n  The 13th amendment provides Congress with the limited authority to \nabolish ``all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States.'' I \nhope my colleagues are not seriously attempting to argue that \nassaulting someone because of their religious views or gender is \ntantamount to slavery.\n  The 14th and 15th amendments apply only to State actions, and since \nwe have already established that States are vigorously prosecuting \nthese actions and not ignoring them, I do not think this is a valid \napproach.\n  Finally, I would note that the legislation raises questions \nconcerning the constitutional imperative that there be ``equal justice \nunder law.'' Is there a legitimate, justifiable reason to punish one \nrape differently than another rape simply because someone decides the \nfirst rape was committed out of hate or actually because of the gender \nof the victim? I think the victims would say the same thing, the \ncriminal should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n  This legislation would add a different element to certain crimes, and \nI know, as a former prosecutor, make it more difficult and more \nexpensive to obtain a conviction, especially when you have to prove an \nindividual's thought process as an underlying element to the offense.\n  This bill at bottom tries to distinguish between assaults by \ndeclaring if someone assaults and kills his girlfriend because she \nbroke up with him it is not a Federal offense, but if he kills her \nbecause she claims she wanted to explore her sexual orientation and he \nbecame upset and killed her, that would be a Federal offense.\n  Senator Hatch offered a complete substitute on Thursday night. It was \nrejected. His proposal would require that a study be conducted so \nactual evidence can be obtained to see if there is a real serious \nproblem with States not prosecuting these matters.\n  For some reason, even though Senator Hatch has been trying to get it \npassed for quite a number of years, the study has never been conducted, \nand all proposals for such a study have been rejected. I fear it is \nbecause perhaps Mr. Sullivan got it right. It is not so much about the \nfailure of States to prosecute these crimes but about an underlying \nidea to pass a symbolic piece of legislation.\n  There is no good reason to pass such a broad piece of legislation. To \npass it would be unwise. No one believes that individuals should be \nassaulted because of their beliefs, their gender or their sexual \norientation. That type of behavior is unacceptable and should be \nprosecuted.\n\n  It has been prosecuted. I am sure State and local law enforcement \nofficers will continue to do so. I believe\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\nthat if my colleagues would study the legislation and think about what \nthey are doing, they would see that this is more unwise and the \nobjections they have heard have far more weight than they had thought \ninitially.\n  It seems like a good idea. Who would want to be against a crime that \nsays it wants to punish hate? But there are serious matters and \nconstitutional issues, as I noted from the Civil Rights Commission, \nfrom the civil rights attorneys such as Mr. Nat Hentoff.\n  I think, in truth, the Attorney General should have been more \nbalanced in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. He came \npushing this legislation without listening or expressing any concern. \nBut I do think he should have pointed out that it represents one of the \nlargest expansions of Federal law enforcement in history. He should be \nthe first to point out and express that concern. He should not allow \npolitics to drive law in America.\n  I know most of my colleagues think this is the right thing to do. I \nwish I had been able to participate more in the debate before it was a \ndone deal the other night. I was involved at the same time, of course, \nwith the confirmation process.\n  Hopefully, we can watch this legislation come with some ideas that \ncurtail its potential for abuse and make it better. But, in reality, I \nwant my colleagues to know it is time for us in Congress to step back \nand question carefully any proposal to create new or further expand \nfederal criminal jurisdiction that would encroach upon the historic \npowers of our State and local law enforcement to enforce the law in \ntheir jurisdiction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Virginia be \nrecognized next as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Mr. LEVIN assumed the Chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to serve on the Supreme Court of \nthe United States.\n  First, I would like to applaud Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nSessions for conducting a successful confirmation hearing. The hearings \nlasted 4 days, 15 witnesses testified, and thousands of people attended \nthe hearing in person.\n  The topics of discussion ranged from executive privilege to property \nrights. In the end, the reviews were that the hearing was constructive \nand fair. At the same time, millions of Americans all across the \ncountry tuned in to the confirmation hearings on television to find out \nwho Justice Sotomayor is.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I had the privilege of meeting with Judge \nSotomayor in person and can say that the American people say what I \nwitnessed firsthand, an individual with extensive judicial experience, \na clear understanding of the law, and the judicial temperament to be an \nexcellent Supreme Court Justice. Judge Sotomayor's nomination is a \nhistoric moment for several reasons. With 17 years as a Federal \ndistrict and appellate court judge, Judge Sotomayor has more judicial \nexperience than anyone confirmed for the Court in the past 100 years. \nShe is also part of a small group of judges who have been nominated to \nthe Federal judiciary by Presidents of different parties: President \nGeorge H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton. With the addition of \nPresident Obama, she will become the first person nominated by three \nPresidents to serve on the Federal judiciary.\n  Judge Sotomayor is also the first Hispanic American nominated to \nserve on the Supreme Court in its 220-year history.\n  Her family immigrated to the United States from Puerto Rico. The \nfamily didn't have a lot of money, but her mother valued education and \nhard work. Judge Sotomayor would go on to Princeton and Yale Law \nSchool, where she excelled academically. Judge Sotomayor did not have \nthe benefit of a family name or wealth but she had ambition. She proved \nthat one can improve their life in a single generation. I am confident \nmany young men and women of all backgrounds are inspired by her \nexample. Perhaps they will hit the books a little harder, practice \ntheir craft a little more, and not give up on reaching their own \nindividual dreams.\n  As Governor of Virginia and now U.S. Senator, I have carried out the \nresponsibility of selecting, vetting, and nominating individuals to \nserve on the bench. It is an enormous responsibility, because the \ndecisions judges make affect people's lives. Much has been said about \nJudge Sotomayor's judicial philosophy. In testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, she made clear to me that she fully understands \nthe role of a judge. In her own words, her judicial philosophy is \nsimple: ``Fidelity to the law'' and a ``rigorous commitment to \ninterpreting the Constitution according to its terms.''\n  Independent institutions can attest to this. The American Bar \nAssociation unanimously found Judge Sotomayor to be highly qualified, \nits highest rating. A number of other nonpartisan groups have found her \nconstitutional decisions to be solidly in the mainstream. Judge \nSotomayor's commitment to public service, extensive judicial \nexperience, and fidelity to the law make her an excellent candidate to \nserve on the Supreme Court of the United States. I look forward to \ncasting my vote in support of Judge Sotomayor and encourage my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Six Months in Office\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today marks President Obama's sixth month in \noffice. The President began his term with an enormous amount of \ngoodwill, high approval ratings and pledges to work in a bipartisan \nway. In the earliest days he reached out in a bipartisan way to secure \npassage of administration priorities and Republicans reciprocated. For \nexample, I joined the President in supporting the release of the second \ntranche of financial stabilization money. But the administration has \nbecome increasingly partisan in the months since then. The \neffectiveness of the President's policies is increasingly questioned by \nthe American people as spending and deficits have skyrocketed. \nUnemployment has gotten much worse since he took office, and America's \ninterests abroad have been challenged with little response.\n  Let me first speak to the issue of domestic policy, spending and \ndebt. On domestic policy, President Obama's first 6 months in office \nhave been characterized by unprecedented spending and debt \naccumulation. In 6 months, President Obama has put the country on a \ncourse to spend more and accrue more debt than any President in \nhistory; in fact, to take on more debt than all of the other Presidents \nin the history of the United States combined. The President has at the \nsame time exercised the power of government in unprecedented ways. The \nPresident knows this is greatly concerning to the American people. So \non June 16, President Obama told an interviewer:\n\n       I actually would like to see a relatively light touch when \n     it comes to government.\n\n  But when it comes to the size and scope of the government, nothing \nPresident Obama has done in his first 6 months resembles a light touch. \nTime after time, he has pushed government intervention and takeovers \nand huge spending increases as the preferred solutions to various \nproblems, whether it is to stimulate the economy, reform health care, \nor bail out bankrupt car companies.\n  The President cites the economic downturn as a reason to clear the \nway for more and more new spending, but we still don't have any \nevidence that this record-breaking spending has actually helped the \neconomy. Take the $1.2 trillion so-called stimulus bill. In pitching \nthe stimulus to the Nation, the President pledged that ``a new wave of \ninnovation, activity, and construction would be unleashed all across \nAmerica.'' The administration also said it would help keep unemployment \nfrom topping 8 percent and ``save or\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\ncreate 3.5 million new jobs.'' He insisted Congress rush the bill \nthrough despite concerns about the cost and the Government's ability to \ndisburse funds in a timely way.\n  As we now know, since President Obama signed the legislation, far \nfrom stopping unemployment from exceeding 8 percent, unemployment has \nnow reached over 9.5 percent and is headed to at least 10 percent. The \neconomy has lost over 2 million jobs, including 433,000 last month. \nAccording to the White House Web site, which tracks stimulus spending, \nonly 7.68 percent of the stimulus money has been funneled into the \neconomy.\n  In an article for the Washington Post, Michael Gerson explains why \nthe stimulus is having such a negligible effect:\n\n       Pouring money into the economy through a thirst sponge of \n     federal programs . . . is slow and inefficient.\n\n  Just as Senate Republicans argued when we opposed this plan.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects less than a \nquarter of the funds earmarked for this bill will be spent by the end \nof this year, with the lion's share being distributed over the next 3 \nyears, by which time, hopefully, the recession will be over. If that is \nthe case, the administration will no longer have a justification for \nthis stimulus spending. But taxpayers will still be on the hook for the \nhundreds of billions of dollars the government will have to borrow to \npay for it.\n  Thanks to a new report by Senator Coburn, we know more about some of \nthese wasteful projects that have been funded by the so-called stimulus \nor are awaiting funds, including a $23.5 million turtle tunnel in \nFlorida, a $550,000 skateboard park in Rhode Island, and even $40,000 \nto give someone a job in North Carolina to lobby for more stimulus \nfunds. That is just a handful of the projects approved so far.\n  So what has happened to the President's plan to spend wisely? That \nbrings us to the budget. The President's $3.4 trillion 10-year budget \nalso defies the idea of a light touch. In an editorial about the \nbudget, the Wall Street Journal wrote:\n\n       With [his] fiscal 2010 budget proposal, President Obama is \n     attempting not merely to expand the role of the federal \n     government, but to put it in such a dominant position that \n     its power can never be rolled back.\n\n  So the spending is the means to an end, a bigger government that can \nnever be tamed. To understand the magnitude of the budget the President \nproposed, consider: Federal spending will skyrocket to 27.7 percent of \nthe gross domestic product in 2009. That is up from 21 percent of GDP \nin 2008. According to the CBO's monthly budget review, for the first 9 \nmonths of the 2009 fiscal year, outlays are 21 percent higher than they \nwere in the first three quarters of 2008, though revenues have fallen \nby 18 percent. Federal spending will make up a greater share of the \neconomy in 2009 than in any year since 1945, when the country was still \nfighting World War II. It is also a greater share of the economy than \nduring the Vietnam war or during the recessions of 1974-1975 or 1981-\n1982.\n  The debt created by his budget will be greater than the combined debt \ncreated by the budgets of each of the previous 43 Presidents, all the \nway back to President Washington. By the end of this fiscal year, our \npublicly held debt will amount to roughly 57 percent of the gross \ndomestic product and deficits of $1 trillion every year are predicted \nfor the next decade. This will drive the debt to 82 percent of the \ngross domestic product by the year 2019. Interest payments on this debt \nwill soon make up the single largest item in the debt. In fact, as for \nthe interest cost, beginning in 2012 and every year thereafter, the \ngovernment will spend more than $1 billion a day on finance charges to \nholders of U.S. debt. That means Federal spending on finance charges \nfor the government's debt will be a whopping $5,700 per household in \n2019.\n  Americans are weary of this kind of debt, to say the least, and many \ndon't think it is fair for Washington to overspend and then simply pass \nthe bill on to our children and grandchildren.\n  These levels of spending and debt would be reckless in the best of \neconomic times, and they are not consistent with President Obama's \npledge for a new era of fiscal responsibility.\n  Let's turn to health care.\n  The American people--and those of us in Congress--want health care \nreform. That is not in question. But President Obama is proposing a \ntrillion-dollar health care program that would, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, cause millions of Americans to lose their \ncurrent care by providing an incentive to employers to drop their \nhealth care coverage.\n  How is this consistent with the President's assurances that if \nAmericans like their current insurance, they can keep it? Remember, 85 \npercent of Americans have insurance and the vast majority of them like \ntheir coverage and they do not want to lose it.\n  President Obama frames this huge new entitlement as a cost-saving, \ndeficit-reducing measure. At a July 1 townhall meeting in Virginia, the \nPresident told participants:\n\n       If we want to control our deficits, the only way for us to \n     do it is to control healthcare costs.\n\n  But does anyone believe that creating a new trillion-dollar, \nWashington-run health care bureaucracy will reduce costs? When in \nhistory has a new government program ever reduced costs? Our two \ncurrent government-run health care programs--Medicare and Medicaid--are \nboth on financially unsustainable paths. Medicare alone has a $38 \ntrillion unfunded liability over the next 75 years and is in urgent \nneed of reform.\n  Some of the projected revenue for the President's plan comes from \ncuts in Medicare. How is it fair to cut seniors' care to pay for a new \ngovernment-dominated system for nonseniors, especially since Medicare \nis already in financial trouble? This would ultimately lead to \nshortages, rationing, and the elimination of private plan choices--\nsomething our seniors rightly fear.\n  It does not make much sense to strip funds from those already \nparticipating in government health care and to then use the savings for \nthe creation of a massive new government health care system that few \npeople want. Americans rightly worry the President's proposals will \nlead to the kind of denial and delay that happens in Canada and Great \nBritain.\n  The President has even said:\n\n       What I think the government can do is be an honest broker \n     in assessing and evaluating treatments.\n\n  That can only mean one thing: denial and delay of care. In that kind \nof system, Federal boards would dictate what is best for you and me, if \nour health care is worth the money, and drive a wedge between doctors \nand patients.\n  President Obama said recently:\n\n       When you hear the naysayers claim that I am trying to bring \n     about government-run healthcare . . . know this, they are not \n     telling the truth.\n\n  Well, maybe the President does not like the term ``government-run \nhealth care'' because it is not popular with Americans. But a plan \nadministered by the government, with prices and policies and treatments \nevaluated and dictated by Washington bureaucrats, is government-run \nhealth care, plain and simple.\n  On another issue, cap and trade: One of the President's oft-repeated \ncampaign pledges was he would not raise taxes on middle-income \nAmericans. But the cap-and-trade legislation he and congressional \nDemocrats are backing would do just that.\n  On June 26, the House of Representatives passed cap-and-trade \nlegislation described by Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein \nas ``a stealth strategy for a massive long-term tax increase.''\n  The bill would implement a cap-and-trade program with the goal of \nreducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Cap-and-trade \nprograms set strict mandatory limits on carbon emissions from various \nsources, such as electric utilities. Those sources would then either \nreduce carbon emissions or buy or trade emission allowances to achieve \nthe required overall emissions reductions.\n  The energy bill would not directly raise taxes on Americans; that is, \nthey will not necessarily see a larger income tax bill at tax time in \nApril. Rather, cap and trade increases the cost of living for everyone \nby raising energy costs and consumer prices for virtually everything. \nThe effect would be the same as if the IRS sent them a tax bill.\n  When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed the cost of \na reduction of carbon emissions by 15 percent below 2005 levels, it \nestimated a\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\nfamily's cost of living would increase by $1,600.\n\n       To put that $1,600 carbon tax in perspective--\n\n  Martin Feldstein wrote--\n\n     a typical family of four with earnings of $50,000 now pays an \n     income tax of about $3,000. The tax imposed by the cap-and-\n     trade system is, therefore, equivalent to raising the \n     family's income tax by about 50 percent\n\n  That is $1,600 that families will not be able to spend or save for \nthe future.\n  In addition to the tax increase, cap and trade would retard economic \ngrowth. The Heritage Foundation analyzed the proposal and concluded it \nwould slow long-term growth by almost $10 trillion over the next 26 \nyears. Jobs would be lost. The Heritage Foundation's analysis, in fact, \nfound that my State of Arizona would lose thousands of jobs.\n  Proponents of the cap-and-trade proposal argue that job losses will \nbe offset by the creation of new green jobs. But it is not at all \ncertain those jobs will materialize, let alone make up for the jobs \nthat are lost. In Spain, where government has invested heavily in green \njobs, two jobs are lost for every green job created, according to \nSpanish economist Gabriel Calzada.\n  Especially at a time when the economy is shaky and unemployment has \nreached a 25-year high, I am disappointed the President is promoting \nthis legislation that not only would violate his campaign promise but \nwould cost taxpayers billions of dollars and harm jobs.\n  Let me now address some issues that are not directly domestic: free \ntrade issues and problems with Iran and North Korea.\n  First, on free trade: I am very disappointed that the administration \nhas not made free trade a top priority. It has failed in its first 6 \nmonths to take any action on bilateral trade pacts with Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea--all of which were signed under President Bush. \nThese trade deals would provide a boost to the U.S. economy and would \nalso strengthen U.S. partnerships in two important regions. Not only \nhas the administration failed to move swiftly on these trade \nagreements, it has also supported a number of damaging protectionist \nmeasures, such as a ``Buy American'' provision in the stimulus package.\n  These policies have angered U.S. trading partners and hurt America's \ncredibility as a promoter of free trade liberalization. They have \nalready triggered retaliation. For example, after the administration \ncanceled a trucking program with Mexico--a program opposed by the \nTeamsters Union--the Mexican Government responded by slapping tariffs \non a range of American imports, including wheat, beans, beef, and rice. \nA global recession is no time in which to start a trade fight.\n  With Iran: There are few regions of the world as volatile as the \nMiddle East. Yet the administration's approach to Iran has been \nregrettable, to say the least.\n  When prodemocracy demonstrations were being suppressed in Tehran, the \nPresident offered barely a word of support for the people putting their \nlives on the line for their freedom.\n  Iranian people were met with violence after they took to the streets \nto peacefully protest the validity of Iran's Presidential election in \nJune to declare their support for free elections and oppose Iran's \noppressive police state.\n  The President likes to say: Words matter. Very true. But his initial \nstatement referring to ``deep concerns about the election'' failed to \ncondemn the Iranian theocracy and lacked moral fortitude. And even as \npressure rose on the President to take a stronger stand, he declined to \nprovide the leadership the world expects from America, the standard \nbearer for freedom and democracy.\n  As the Weekly Standard recently editorialized:\n\n       Since June 12, [President Obama has] done nothing to help \n     those Iranians who have been seeking, in the words of Thomas \n     Jefferson, `` . . . to assume the blessings and security of \n     self-government.''\n\n  Explaining his reticence, the President said:\n\n       It's not productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian \n     relations to be seen as meddling--the U.S. president meddling \n     in Iranian elections.\n\n  The United States should be lending full-throated voice to the \ndemocratic aspirations of the Iranian people, while seeking to impose \nsanctions on their oppressors. It is not meddling for the world's \noldest and greatest democracy to stand with them.\n  The administration's Iranian policy was flawed from the beginning. It \ncame into office with the idea that it could negotiate a ``grand \nbargain'' with the mullahs on Iran's nuclear program and would meet \nwith its rogue leader without preconditions. With the mullah's \nrepression of dissent following Iran's flawed elections, that has all \ngone by the boards. Of course, it was always destined to fail.\n  Was it ever realistic to believe this is a government with which we \ncan successfully negotiate--a government that sponsors terrorism and \nmurders peaceful student protesters and does not even have the mandate \nof its own people? What do we think we can give this government more \nthan it wants a nuclear weapon?\n  What is more, what message do we send to the Iranian people, many of \nwhom have been arrested, tortured, and had family members killed, by \nnegotiating with this regime while it robs its own people of their \nfundamental rights? I do not believe the United States can deal in good \nfaith with a regime that so violently suppresses its own citizens. I \nhope the President will come to agree.\n  With regard to North Korea, the administration's reaction to North \nKorea's recent activity is also of concern. As Pyongyang prepares for \nthe transition of power from Kim Jong Il to his son Kim Jong Un, the \nregime's behavior has become increasingly belligerent and \nunpredictable.\n  North Korea has pulled out of the six-party negotiations, restarted \nits nuclear program, test launched several ballistic missiles, and \nconducted a suspected underground nuclear test. The regime even \ndeclared that it has now abandoned the armistice that brought a cease-\nfire to the Korean war.\n  What has the Obama administration done in response to this threat to \nthe security of other nations in the region and indeed to the very \nsecurity of the United States? The answer is disappointing. It has cut \nmissile defense.\n  The President's budget cut the Missile Defense Agency's budget for \nfiscal year 2010 by $1.2 billion and decreased the planned number of \nGround-Based Interceptor missiles in Alaska from 44 to 30. These \nproposals amount to almost a 15-percent cut in the Missile Defense \nAgency's budget and a major reduction in our missile defense \nportfolio--at the very moment we should be increasing our capability to \ndefend ourselves and our allies from the North Korean threat.\n  Finally, a word about the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I think this is \nimportant in evaluating the first 6 months of this administration \nbecause one of the very first acts of the President, after he was \ninaugurated 6 months ago, was his self-imposed deadline to close the \nfacility at Guantanamo within 1 year.\n  A majority of Americans strongly oppose the closure of Guantanamo. \nCongress has refused to support President Obama's arbitrary deadline to \nclose the facility without a plan, for example, showing where he will \nrelocate the terrorists. The administration has convinced Palau and \nBermuda to take a few detainees, but this is not much of a solution if \nthe President is determined to close the facility in just another 6 \nmonths. Where will the rest of the detainees still housed at Guantanamo \nBay go? We still do not know.\n  Ultimately, the debate over Guantanamo has become a debate over \ngeography. Both the new Attorney General and the new Solicitor General \nhave endorsed the government's right to detain suspected terrorists \nindefinitely. Whether we can detain them at Guantanamo or at prisons on \nU.S. soil does not change the fundamental reality that this \nadministration, similar to its predecessor, will be holding certain \nindividuals without trial.\n  We have been told that Guantanamo must be closed for symbolic \nreasons. But America should never make national security decisions \nbased on symbolisms--or on false moral arguments.\n  In conclusion, on the campaign trail and after his election, \nPresident Obama repeatedly promised ``change we can believe in'' and \nthe end of partisan politics in Washington. He pledged to bring \nRepublicans and Democrats together.\n  On election night, he said:\n\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\n\n       Let us resist the temptation to fall back on . . . \n     partisanship.\n\n  But partisan politics looms larger than ever. Congress is urged to \nrush costly legislation through, despite frequent Republican concerns \nabout the pricetag and the efficacy of the legislation. Indeed, the \nPresident's budget and stimulus both passed mainly on party lines.\n  As Michael Barone recently wrote, the President:\n\n       Brings [to Washington] the assumption that there will \n     always be a bounteous private sector that can be plundered on \n     behalf of political favorites. Hence, the takeover of \n     Chrysler and GM to bail out the United Auto Workers union.\n\n  Six months later, President Obama continues to take unnecessary jabs \nat his predecessor. On his promise for change, more government debt, \ngovernment bailouts, and large transfers of the economy from the \nprivate to the public sector are not what Americans are looking for.\n  Americans want the President and Congress to support the private \nsector to help the economy get back on track, without tidal waves of \nspending, debt, and new taxes. They want real health care reform \nwithout a government takeover, and they want the President to lead us \nin this dangerous world, acknowledging the harsh reality that not every \nrogue regime will respond to smooth talk.\n  In the next 6 months, and beyond, I hope the President will take a \nmore sensible and, indeed, more bipartisan course so we can all \naccomplish what the American people seek.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that Senator Kaufman of Delaware be recognized \nafter I have concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I thank the minority whip for his statement on the \nfloor. I would like to suggest I see things a little differently and \nsuggest there are a couple items I would like to speak to.\n  First, on Guantanamo:\n  President Obama took office and realized we had a serious problem in \nGuantanamo Bay. It is a safe and secure facility, but it has become a \nrecruiting tool for terrorists around the world. That is not just his \nconclusion; it is the conclusion of people I respect very much. Among \nthose who called for the closing of Guantanamo include the following: \nGEN Colin L. Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nSecretary of State under President George W. Bush; Republican Senators \nJohn McCain and Lindsey Graham; former Secretaries of State James \nBaker, Henry Kissinger, and Condoleezza Rice; Defense Secretary Robert \nGates, who served President Bush and President Obama; ADM Mike Mullen, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and GEN David Petraeus.\n  These are not politicians, these are people who represent both sides \nof the political aisle--Democrat and Republican--who have concluded \nthat keeping Guantanamo open, unfortunately, is going to continue to \ngive encouragement to the recruitment of terrorists around the world.\n  President Obama announced that we should start to close Guantanamo, \nwe should start deciding the fate of each of these prisoners, and it is \nhigh time we do.\n  Under President George W. Bush, hundreds of Guantanamo Bay detainees \nwere released. They were arrested, incarcerated, questioned, and \nreleased, no charges against them. It was accepted. We made mistakes on \nthe battlefield. People came up collecting bounties for turning in \nprisoners who turned out not to be dangerous. These people were \nreleased. The overwhelming majority of these people didn't cause any \ntrouble beyond that. Some did. That is a fact. I will not ignore it.\n  Now comes the Republican side of the aisle arguing that it is unsafe \nfor us to transfer Guantanamo prisoners from Guantanamo to Federal \nprisons in the United States. I have heard the arguments. They say it \nis unsafe in my community of Springfield, IL, to have a convicted \nterrorist; that it is a threat to all the people, the 12.5 million \npeople who live in Illinois, and they believe that is the case around \nthe country. But if we look at the facts, that argument doesn't stand \nup.\n  Today, in the prisons of the United States, the Federal prisons, we \nhave 355 convicted terrorists currently incarcerated, being held safely \nand securely. They are no threat to our safety. In my hometown of \nSpringfield, not far away, just in southern Illinois, maybe a little \nover 100 miles, is Marion Federal Penitentiary. I visited there several \nweeks ago and talked to the men and women who are the guards and those \nrunning the prison, and they said to me: Senator Durbin, send them \nhere. We have dealt with terrorists. We have terrorists now on our cell \nblock. We have had crime syndicates. We have had people from the \nColombian drug cartels. We can handle them.\n  The mayor of Marion, IL, went out and said to the people: Are you \nfrightened if these detainees come to Marion?\n  They said: No.\n  These guards know how to do their job. This is a Federal penitentiary \nthat is safe. So the fear that is being espoused and bred by the other \nside of the aisle about Guantanamo Bay is not well placed. What the \nPresident is doing systematically and carefully is evaluating each of \nthese prisoners.\n  I know of one who received notice from our government last year, \nafter having been held for 6 years as a prisoner, that we had no case \nagainst him. No charges were going to be pursued. He is still a \nprisoner. We are looking for a place to put him. He is from the Gaza, a \nbottled up area. There is a question about whether he goes back there. \nBut the fact is, we have no reason to believe we can convict or \nprosecute this man for anything. He is being held. It will be his \nseventh year now. He came in at age 19. He may leave at age 26 or 27. \nHis life is dramatically changed because, unfortunately, our early \ninclination that he was a danger to this country turned out not to be a \nbasis for a crime that could be prosecuted. That is the reality.\n  The President has addressed this issue. Just a few weeks ago he \nannounced one of these detainees in Guantanamo Bay was finally going to \nface justice, and despite the protests of some on the other side of the \naisle, he moved that prisoner to New York for a trial. It wasn't the \nfirst time the city of New York has had the trial of a terrorist. It \nhas happened before. They know how to hold these terrorists in jail \nduring the course of the trial. We don't hear panic in the streets in \nNew York over it. The only panic and fear we hear comes from the other \nside of the aisle in the Senate.\n  The President is doing the right thing closing Guantanamo Bay and \nsaying to the world: We will not engage in torture. We will close \nGuantanamo Bay. This is a new chapter and a new day for America. With \nthis approach, we are closing down a recruiting tool for terrorists and \nopening the door for allies to come back to the side of the United \nStates to join us in stopping the kind of extremism that led to the \ntragedy of 9/11.\n  So I disagree with my colleague from Arizona who has argued that we \nshouldn't close Guantanamo Bay. I agree with GEN Colin L. Powell and \nother military leaders that closing it is in the best interests of the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Senator Kyl initiated his remarks by noting that we have reached the \n6-month anniversary of the inauguration of President Obama. It is hard \nto imagine. It seems to have just been flying by if you are on the \nfloor of the Senate with all of the activity and all of the business we \nhave considered. But he made special notice of the stimulus bill.\n  I wish to remind people what the President inherited when he took his \noath of office 6 months ago. Our economy was losing on average 700,000 \njobs a month when President Obama took his oath of office. The growth \nrate was at a negative 6.3 percent, the worst since the 1982 recession. \nHome foreclosures, mortgage foreclosures were at record levels, and \nresidential investment had fallen by more than 40 percent in just 18 \nmonths. Banks were in crisis, freezing lending, and nearly $10 trillion \nin wealth had been lost in the stock market. Virtually all of us who \nhad 401(k)s or savings involved in the stock market know exactly what \nhappened to those savings. We lost a lot of value.\n  As President Obama took office, this is what he inherited. He came to \nthe\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\nCongress and said: We can't stand idly by. We have to do something. We \nhave to try to energize this economy, create and save American jobs; \ngive businesses and families a fighting chance. He asked for both sides \nof the aisle to cooperate.\n  On the House side not a single Republican House Member would join the \nPresident in this effort, in this attempt at a bipartisan effort to \ndeal with the economic situation in our country. On this side of the \nRotunda, three Republican Senators stepped up and said they would work \nwith the Democrats to try to find a way to help put our economy back on \nits feet--only three, despite the President's invitation for all of \nthem to join in this conversation to try to find a compromise to work \ntoward a solution to the problems we faced.\n  At the end of the day, the bill was a $787 billion recovery and \nreinvestment bill to be spent over 2 years. We are now 4 months into \nthat 2-year period--150 days, roughly, into that 2-year period--and \nSenators are coming to the Senate floor, as did the minority whip, and \nsaying it has failed.\n  Well, let's take a look and see what it has done. So far we have \nactually spent about $56 billion out of the $787 billion, a very small \namount. We have obligated--which means we have promised to spend--up to \n$200 billion, 4 months into it. We are trying to address this carefully \nso taxpayers' funds are not wasted. But there are still those who voted \nagainst it initially who come to the Senate floor, as the previous \nSenator did, and say it was a failure; we shouldn't have done it.\n  Several things should be noted. First, they had no alternative. They \nhad no substitute. They had no option for the economy other than to \nstand idly by, take two Excedrin, try to take a nap, and hope it would \nbe better in the morning. Not good enough.\n  If we are going to deal with an economy with so many jobs lost, so \nmany businesses failing, standing idly by waiting for the economy to \nwork its way out would have been a disaster.\n  This stimulus package from President Obama stopped what could have \nbeen the collapse of the U.S. economy and the global economy. We still \nhave a long way to go. We are not out of this recession, but it could \nhave been worse. For those who say we shouldn't have done it, let me \ntell my colleagues: Over 40 percent of the money in the stimulus \npackage went back to tax breaks for working families in America. \nNinety-five percent of working families across America will see the \nbenefits of the Making Work Pay tax credit in their paychecks. Those \ndealing with job loss, unemployed people, got an additional $25 a week. \nIt doesn't sound like much unless you have no other source of income.\n  I take it from their statements those on the other side of the aisle \nthink the tax breaks for working families should not have been enacted. \nThey oppose the unemployment compensation benefit increases.\n  We also gave a helping hand to unemployed families to keep health \ninsurance for their kids and their families. That was part of the \nstimulus package, as well as money for nutrition assistance, food \nstamps for some of these unemployed families. So when the other side of \nthe aisle says we shouldn't have done this, they are basically saying \nwe shouldn't have helped these unemployed families and a lot of other \nfamilies across America. I think it was the right thing to do.\n  We are making investments in the infrastructure of America as well. \nBasically, we are trying to make an investment that will give us a \nrecovery in jobs. We were losing about 25,000 jobs a day when this \ninitially hit. Now we are trying to build back from that to create and \nsave jobs across America. In my home State of Illinois, it means \ninfrastructure projects, transportation infrastructure projects, and \nmany others. So we are just beginning. We are moving in the right \ndirection. We have stopped the worst from occurring in the economy. We \nare going to see a turnaround, I hope, sooner rather than later.\n\n  The President's words warrant repeating: This is not going to happen \novernight, and we have to be open to the idea that it is going to take \nsome time for us to make the kind of recovery we absolutely need.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Arizona talked about health care reform. \nRepublican after Republican has come to the Senate floor--not all of \nthem but many of them--and criticized the idea of health care reform, \nbut they are ignoring the obvious. We have a serious problem with \nhealth care in America. We are spending twice as much per person as any \nnation on Earth for health care, and the results--the health care \nresults don't show it. Many times countries spend far less, have far \nbetter outcomes in terms of curing diseases and life expectancy.\n  So we should ask the hard questions: Shouldn't our money be better \nspent? Shouldn't it be more effectively spent? Then we take a look at \nwhat we face when it comes to health insurance premiums, and we find \nout that premiums over the last several years have been going up three \ntimes the increase in the average worker's wages in this country.\n  We are falling further and further behind as the costs of health care \ngo beyond the grasp of individual families and small businesses. So we \nhave to tackle this, and the American people know we do. They \nunderstand this system is, unfortunately, out of control. They have \ncalled on us to fix what is broken and to preserve those parts of our \nsystem that are important.\n  One of the things we want to make sure we do is to say: If you have a \nhealth insurance policy today you want to keep for your family or your \nbusiness, you can keep it. Nothing we say or do in the law will change \nthat. It is ultimately your decision.\n  Secondly, we want to preserve the relationship between doctor and \npatient--the confidential relationship, the trust that has developed \nbetween them so that you can take a member of your family or yourself \nto a doctor and believe it is a confidential conversation and that \ndoctor is giving the best advice possible for you. We want you to have \nthat choice and make that decision.\n  What we want to stop is the mistreatment of Americans and American \nfamilies by health insurance companies. You know what I mean: If you \nhappened to have had an illness last year and it becomes a preexisting \ncondition this year and you find out your health insurance won't cover \nit, or if they are going to cover it but dramatically increase your \npremiums, in fact, they increase your premiums without notice or any \nkind of forewarning that it is going to occur, these sorts of things \ntrouble people.\n  The fact that their doctors have to get into a fight with health \ninsurance clerks as to appropriate medical care and whether a person \nshould be hospitalized; the fact that health insurance companies, \nprivate health insurance companies, have turned out to be some of the \nmost profitable companies in America, even during the recession. All of \nthese things are fair warning that if we don't do something about \nhealth care in this country, the costs are going to break the bank, not \nonly for individuals, families, and businesses, but for governments at \nevery single level.\n  Today many Americans live in fear of the astronomical costs that will \noccur if they or their families experience a health care emergency. Two \nand a half Illinoisans in my State of 12.5 million, more than one out \nof every five under the age of 65, is in a family who must spend more \nthan 10 percent of its income on health care costs. Among those, one-\nfourth of those are spending more than 25 percent of their income on \nhealth care costs.\n  The other side says: Just leave well enough alone. This isn't ``well \nenough.'' For these families, this is intolerable and unsustainable. It \nis an astounding burden. It is 30 percent more people than the number \nfacing the 25-percent payment than faced it 8 years ago.\n  There is also concern on the other side about cap and trade. Well, \ncap and trade is a bill that has passed the House to address global \nwarming, to try to assign a value to carbon in our economy. Just last \nweek we had the CEOs of three major companies come speak to us: Duke \nEnergy, one of the largest energy companies in America, DuPont, and \nSiemens.\n  They favor the establishment of a cost for carbon. They said: Give us \na transition period so that we can make our plants cleaner, our \nprocesses more energy effective, and we can meet that goal. We have the \ncreativity to do it.\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\n  So we can reduce global warming and reduce the pollution and our \ndependence on foreign oil. In the meantime, we will create new \nbusinesses; new products; new technology that will be energy efficient; \nnew jobs, 21st-century jobs that will pay well, and jobs we can keep \nright here in America. There are those who oppose this and say leave it \nas it is. Our continued dependence on foreign oil should be a source of \nconcern to every single person.\n  I am also genuinely concerned that the world I am leaving my grandson \nmight be a compromised world because of some of the bad environmental \ndecisions that have been made by my generation. We have an opportunity \nto change that, to make this a cleaner planet, to show ourselves as \ngood stewards of the Earth that God gave us, and we can work together \nin a bipartisan fashion to find a way to encourage the right conduct \nand discourage bad conduct when it comes to these energy issues. Some \ndon't want to touch it; they just want to criticize it. At the end of \nthe day, we won't be judged as having met our responsibility if we do \nnothing.\n  I know Senator Kaufman is on the floor and will ask for recognition \nat this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                    Apollo Moon Landing Anniversary\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, on the 40th anniversary of \nthe Apollo 11 Moon landing, to highlight the importance of scientific \nresearch and development to America's economic recovery.\n  Forty years ago, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took the \nfirst human steps on the Moon. It was, needless to say, a historic \nmoment for the United States and the world.\n  Eight years prior, President John F. Kennedy declared before a joint \nsession of the Congress that the United States ``should commit itself \nto achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on \nthe moon.'' Armstrong's famous words, ``One small step for man, one \ngiant leap for mankind,'' marked the fulfillment of President Kennedy's \ngoal. That momentous step signaled the coronation of the United States \nas the world leader in the sciences--a distinction we held through the \nrest of the 20th century but which is now in jeopardy.\n  Make no mistake, the dawn of a renewed American powerhouse economy \nwill not come without the same determination that propelled America's \njourney to the Moon. The key to America's success in a global economy \nwill be the research, innovation, and hard work of our Nation's \nscientists and engineers.\n  Americans at the time were inspired by a sense of patriotism and \ndedication to explore the universe following the Soviets' successful \nlaunch of the Sputnik satellite. The race to the Moon launched a \nsubstantial Federal investment in scientific and technological research \nand development. Students across the country were inspired to study \nengineering, and I, a working engineer at the time, was among those \ninspired.\n  This extraordinary investment in research and development helped fuel \nthe Nation's economic growth and left an indelible mark on our society. \nThe discoveries and innovations of this time created new opportunities, \nindustries, companies, products and services, and new ways of \ndelivering old products and services more efficiently.\n  Unfortunately, since that time our investments in research and \ndevelopment have not kept up. Other nations may soon outpace us in \npursuit of the technological and scientific discoveries that will \ndefine this generation. If we hope to assert our country's preeminence \nin these fields, we must again invest significantly and responsibily in \nresearch and development.\n  The vitality of our economy rests with our ability to be the world's \nleader in innovation. As we face some of our greatest economic \nchallenges, the scientific and engineering community has the greatest \npotential to find avenues for what we need most: new, sustainable jobs. \nThat is why I am pleased President Obama has set the goal to devote \nmore than 3 percent of our economy to research and development--a feat \nthat will require significant Federal as well as private investment. \nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has already provided over \n$20 billion of Federal funds to reach this target, and it is our job to \nsee that these resources are spent wisely in order to achieve the \nmaximum economic benefit.\n  But the national goal is also about research and development \ninvestment by private industry, which the government can help foster \nwith pro-innovation policies. We also need to encourage a new \ngeneration of engineers through education policies that emphasize \nscience and math.\n  I am confident that engineers will continue to foster the research \nand innovation that will lead America on the path to economic recovery \nand prosperity. They will help us build a clean energy economy, stay \ncompetitive in a globalizing world, and drive the real-world \napplications from our Nation's health and science research to improve \nour quality of life. Moreover, these discoveries and innovations will \ncreate millions of new jobs and invest in our future.\n  Just before Apollo 11 returned to Earth, Armstrong concluded that:\n\n       The responsibility for this flight lies first with history \n     and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; \n     next, with the American people, who have, through their will, \n     indicated their desire; next, with 4 administrations and \n     their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with \n     the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the \n     Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the \n     spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on \n     the lunar surface.\n\n  Just as we all came together in the race to the Moon over 40 years \nago, we need a renewed urgency for science and engineering. The \nAmerican people, the administration, Congress, agencies, and industries \nmust unite to support the research and development that will lead us \nnot only to new frontiers in health, energy, technology, and security, \nbut to new jobs and, ultimately, a sustainable economic recovery.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, four decades ago, in this \nextraordinary feat we have recently seen repeated over and over with \nthe death of Walter Cronkite--we have seen that time he was \nbroadcasting live when we landed on the Moon. That restrained TV anchor \nexhibited extraordinary excitement at the landing on the Moon. That is \nwhat the entire world felt at the time.\n  I was a lieutenant in the Army and happened to be behind the Iron \nCurtain at the particular time we lifted off. I went to the Embassy in \nBudapest, Hungary, and asked if they had a TV so that we could see the \nlaunch. They said no, but to take your shortwave radio and go outside \nof the city on those hills and put your radio antenna up, and you can \nget the BBC, which we did. They cut into NASA control, and we three \nyoung Americans stood on that hill cheering as Apollo 11 lifted off.\n  We fulfilled the human dream of boundless flight to another celestial \nbody. Neil Armstrong promised us that it was ``one small step for man, \none giant leap for mankind.'' It was to be the first step on our way to \nMars and beyond, toward new knowledge of our universe and, perhaps, the \ndiscovery of other life.\n  Yet today we are mired in a debate about the direction of our space \nprogram. We had a little victory last week when we had unanimously \nconfirmed the new Administrator and Deputy Administrator of NASA. But \nnow we are in this debate of where the space program should go. The \nanswer should be obvious: Our thirst for knowledge requires that we \nexplore the universe. I often say that this country is built on the \ncharacter we have and that we are, by nature, explorers and \nadventurers. When this country was founded, our frontier was westward. \nNow that frontier is upward or inward. Space flight--as we continue in \npushing that frontier upward, what does it do? It grows science and \ntechnology. It grows education. It grows the economy.\n  Earlier today, I was on one of the network talk shows, and the whole \nidea was, what does it do for education? My goodness, look at the \ncompetitive edge America has in the global economy today from our \nsuperiority in math, science, technology, and engineering that occurred \nover four decades ago. Why? Because young people were so inspired by \nthe extraordinary feats we\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\nwere accomplishing in our space program that they wanted to go into \nengineering, math, science, and technology. That produced a generation \nof these people from whom we are continuing to reap the benefits.\n  Of course, space flight improves and enriches life here on Earth. How \ndoes it do that? Well, if you think about it, four decades ago what we \ndid was--if we were going to the Moon, we had to have highly reliable \nsystems that were small in volume and light in weight. That led to the \nrevolution in microminiaturization. For instance, my watch is a part of \nthe space program. All of the microminiaturization was spawned off of \nthat necessity to get things smaller, more reliable, and light in \nweight. That is just one example of how it enriches life here on Earth.\n  If you think back to the visionary President we had who started this \nwhole thing, President Kennedy said the opening of the vistas of space \nwould bring high costs and grave dangers. Indeed, it did. But he said \nthat ``this country was not built by those who rested.''\n  So today, on this historic anniversary, let us not rest. Our \nPresident needs to make space exploration a national priority. Our \nNation needs a clear goal, and that is a lunar base, humans on Mars, \nand then beyond. It is up to us to continue the greatest adventure. It \nis up to us to reach for the stars.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Sessions has introduced an \namendment that would create two new death penalty eligible offenses for \ncrimes under the Matthew Shepard Act. I stand firmly in opposition to \nany new legislation that would radically expand the use of the death \npenalty, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose the Sessions \namendment because it adds another new death penalty to the Federal \nCriminal Code.\n  Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in the 1970s, the Death \nPenalty Information Center has reported that 135 people have been \nreleased from death row in the United States because of innocence--\napproximately one exoneration for every nine executions. Some have \nattempted to argue that the large number of death row exonerations \ndemonstrates that the system is working. Yet in many cases, fatal \nmistakes were avoided only because of discoveries made by students or \njournalists, not the courts.\n  In the last 6 months, there have already been five exonerations in \ndeath penalty cases in four different States. Ronald Kitchen was freed \nfrom prison in Illinois after the State dismissed all charges against \nhim on July 7. He had spent 13 years on death row and a total of 21 \nyears in prison. Herman Lindsey was freed from Florida's death row on \nJuly 9 after the State supreme court unanimously ruled for his \nacquittal from a 2006 conviction. As the court said:\n\n       [T]he State failed to produce any evidence in this case \n     placing Lindsey at the scene of the crime at the time of the \n     murder. . . . Indeed, we find that the evidence here is \n     equally consistent with a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\n\n  There have also been three other exonerations of death row prisoners, \nincluding Nathson Fields in Illinois, Paul House in Tennessee, and \nDaniel Moore in Alabama.\n  This high number of exonerations has led many observers, both liberal \nand conservative, to express concern about\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nthe fairness of the death penalty's administration. As former Supreme \nCourt Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has stated ``if statistics are any \nindication, the system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to \nbe executed.'' How can we continue to expand a system that likely leads \nto the execution of innocent defendants?\n  The U.S. Government should not be in the business of taking the lives \nof innocent Americans. Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg once said \nthat the deliberate institutionalized taking of human life by the state \nis the greatest degradation of the human personality imaginable. We \nmust not expand this flawed system by accepting Senator Sessions' broad \namendment.\n  In 2007, New Jersey became the first State to repeal the death \npenalty since the modern era of capital punishment began in the 1970s. \nNew Mexico followed in 2009. The number of States without a death \npenalty has now increased to 15. States have begun to recognize that \nflawed administration of the death penalty has dire consequences--no \nmatter how slight or unintentional that flaw may be.\n  The American public has also recognized the danger created by a \nsociety that supports the death penalty. A 2008 Gallup poll found that \nsupport for the death penalty is at its lowest level in the last 30 \nyears. American citizens are deciding that they will not tolerate this \narchaic form of punishment.\n  Furthermore, there is no denying that there is a pattern of racial \nbias in death sentencing. A study in California found that those who \nkilled Whites were over three times more likely to be sentenced to \ndeath than those who killed Blacks, and over four times more likely \nthan those who killed Latinos. In addition, a study found that in 96 \npercent of the States where there have been reviews of race and the \ndeath penalty, there was a pattern of either race-of-victim or race-of-\ndefendant discrimination, or both. Administration of the death penalty \nis flawed, and that flaw disproportionately affects racial minorities.\n  The average cost of defending a Federal murder case when the death \npenalty is sought is $620,000. That is about eight times the cost of a \nFederal murder case in which the death penalty is not sought. It has \nbeen shown time and time again that sentencing an individual to life in \nprison is far cheaper than the administration of the death penalty. For \nexample, the California death penalty system costs taxpayers $114 \nmillion a year beyond the costs of keeping convicts locked up for life. \nTaxpayers have paid more than $250 million for each of the State's \nexecutions. While the monetary costs of seeking the death penalty are \nhigh, the possibility of executing an innocent American is the ultimate \ncost.\n  Some argue in favor of the death penalty because they believe it \ndeters individuals from committing some of the most severe crimes. \nAccording to a survey of the former and current presidents of the \nNation's top academic criminology societies, 88 percent of these \nexperts rejected the notion that the death penalty acts as a deterrent \nto murder. In addition, a Hart Research Poll of police chiefs in the \nU.S. found that the majority of the chiefs do not believe that the \ndeath penalty is an effective law enforcement tool. If the death \npenalty does not deter violent crime, we shouldn't ask our government \nto play executioner.\n  Stephen Bright is a preeminent scholar on the death penalty. In his \nlaw review article Will the Death Penalty Remain Alive in the Twenty-\nFirst Century?, he states:\n\n       If we here in the United States examine our own system, \n     face its flaws, and think about what kind of society we want \n     to have, we will ultimately conclude that, like slavery and \n     segregation, the death penalty is a relic of another era, \n     that it represents the dark side of the human spirit, and \n     that we are capable of more constructive approaches to the \n     problem of crime in our society.\n\n  All violent crime is reprehensible and deserves to be punished. \nHowever, as Stephen Bright points out, we are capable of more \nconstructive approaches to dealing with crime than by using the death \npenalty. The death penalty is a relic of the past. It has been proven \nto lead to wrongful executions where innocent lives are lost at the \nhand of their government. Although most developed nations in the world \nhave abandoned the death penalty, the United States, which purports to \nbe a leader in the protection of human rights, continues to increase \nthe number of death-eligible offenses that are on the statute books.\n  The Kennedy amendment being offered will ensure consistency with \nexisting federal law and Supreme Court precedent by setting forth clear \nstandards for the use of the federal death penalty only in hate crimes \ncases where a murder occurs. Given concerns regarding the well-\ndocumented mistakes and racial disparities associated with death \npenalty cases, this amendment adds appropriate safeguards in cases \nwhere the federal government seeks the ultimate--and irreversible--\npenalty of death. In a hate crime prosecution involving the death \npenalty, the amendment will empower the trial court to determine \nwhether the case was properly considered to be among the most \naggravated of death-eligible hate crimes.\n  The Kennedy amendment is modeled after an existing Nebraska State \nlaw, and will establish a system of meaningful proportionality review \nin capital hate crime prosecutions. If the court determines that a case \nis not among the ``worst of the worst'' of hate crimes resulting in a \nhomicide, it can dismiss the government's request for a death penalty \nat the conclusion of the guilt trial or at the conclusion of the \npenalty trial, before the sentencing decision is submitted to the jury. \nUnder the Kennedy amendment, the test applied by the trial court to \ndetermine whether a case is among the ``worst of the worst'' is whether \ndeath sentences are sought and imposed more than half the time in \nsimilar Federal cases. This information will enable the court to assess \nthe extent to which race or other inappropriate factors may have been a \nsystemic factor in prior capital charging and sentencing decisions in \nhate crimes that have resulted in the victim's death. The Kennedy \namendment's requirements are a significant improvement over existing \nFederal practice in death penalty cases.\n  Senator Sessions' amendment increases the number of death-eligible \noffenses. It expands the use of the death penalty to two new offenses--\nthose created by the Matthew Shepard Act. It is time to stand up \nagainst expansion of the death penalty. With this statement, I submit \nseveral letters of opposition to the Sessions amendment and other \namendments proposed by Senator Sessions. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst Senator Sessions' amendment and to support the Kennedy \namendment to correct the flaws in Senator Sessions' proposal.\n  In addition, Senator Sessions has introduced an amendment that \ncreates a new Federal criminal offense for cases involving assaults or \nbattery of a U.S. serviceman--or a member of the serviceman's immediate \nfamily. It creates a new Federal crime to punish individuals who \nknowingly destroy or injure the property of an active or retired \nserviceman or the property of an immediate family member, or conspires \nto do so. Crimes against veterans, members of the armed service are \nreprehensible. It is undeniable that our Nation is held together by the \nprotection that these brave men and women provide each day. This \namendment places another mandatory minimum in our Federal code. \nMandatory minimums are unjust, unwise and unnecessary. Such sentences \ntie the court's hand to review the facts of an individual case. I hope \nthat problems with the broad language of this amendment and the \ninclusion of a mandatory minimum can be worked out in conference.\n  Finally, I appreciate that we were able to work with Senator Sessions \nto make some modifications to his amendment regarding the issuance of \nAttorney General guidelines for hate crime offenses. For over 40 years, \nthe Justice Department's record demonstrates objective decisionmaking \nwhen selecting hate crime cases for prosecution--regardless of the \nadministration in charge.\n  DOJ guidance and professional responsibility rules already guard \nagainst any nonmeritorious prosecution. As originally drafted, Senator \nSessions' amendment could have prevented ``mistake of fact'' cases--\nsuch as an attack against a White person whom the defendant believed to \nbe African American or cases based upon associations--in which a White \nwoman is targeted because her spouse is African American. In addition, \nthere was concern about whether the amendment\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\ncould also impede prosecutions where a hate crimes victim was perceived \nto be African American, Latino, or gay because the amendment covers a \nmore narrow class of victims than those covered under the hate crimes \nbill. With the cooperation and assistance from Chairman Leahy's staff \nalong with Senator Sessions' staff, I believe that the modified version \nof this amendment will address these concerns so that the amendment \nwill not be interpreted in any way to limit the scope of victims who \nare protected under the Matthew Shepard Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have the letters to which I referred printed \nin the Record.\n  The letters follow.\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2009.\n     Re: ACLU urges ``No'' vote on SA 1615--Sessions Death Penalty \n         Amendment to Hate Crimes Amendment in Defense \n         Authorization Bill (S. 1390); Sessions amendment is \n         unconstitutional.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union (ACLU), a non-partisan organization with more than a \n     half million members, countless activists and supporters, and \n     fifty-three affiliates nationwide, we write to urge you to \n     oppose Senate Amendment 1615, being offered by Senator Jeff \n     Sessions (R-AL) to the National Defense Authorization Act (S. \n     1390). This unconstitutional and misguided amendment seeks to \n     expand the reach of the federal death penalty, including to \n     non-homicide crimes, by adding it to a hate crimes provision \n     that the Senate adopted by unanimous consent on Thursday \n     night.\n       Capital punishment has been proven to be an unreliable and \n     expensive means of punishment and Congress should oppose any \n     effort to expand its scope and reach. According to the Death \n     Penalty Information Center, 135 innocent people have been \n     exonerated from death row since 1973, including five so far \n     in 2009 alone. Such a high error rate illustrates the \n     fallibility of our nation's death penalty system. Indeed, \n     chronic problems, including inadequate defense counsel and \n     racial disparities, have always plagued the death penalty \n     system in the United States. In a 2003 report entitled \n     ``Death by Discrimination--The Continuing Role of Race in \n     Capital Cases,'' Amnesty International found that even though \n     blacks and whites are murder victims in nearly equal numbers \n     of crimes, 80 percent of people executed since the death \n     penalty as reinstated have been executed for murders \n     involving white victims. More than 20 percent of black \n     defendants who have been executed were convicted by all-white \n     juries. Even if one supports the death penalty in theory, \n     there is no justifiable reason to expand our system of \n     capital punishment while such discriminatory impacts continue \n     to exist.\n       A troubling record of the death penalty being imposed on \n     defendants who were later found to be innocent, along with a \n     long history of racial and geographic disparities in its use, \n     have spurred states to move away from its use. In 2007 and \n     2008, New Jersey and New Mexico, respectively, abolished the \n     death penalty, bringing to 15 the number of states (including \n     the District of Columbia) that currently have no death \n     penalty. In addition, in recent years, the number of death \n     sentences returned by juries has declined precipitously--from \n     around 300 a year in the 1990s to approximately 120 in the \n     past few years.\n       The ACLU is also concerned that the Sessions Amendment \n     would unconstitutionally expand the reach of the federal \n     death penalty to include certain non-homicide crimes. The \n     United States Supreme Court has already held that the death \n     sentence is an unconstitutional penalty for kidnapping (see \n     Eberheart v. Georgia); sexual abuse (see Coker v. Georgia and \n     Kennedy v. Louisiana); and attempted murder (see Enmund v. \n     Florida and Tison v. Arizona), all crimes included in the \n     scope of the Session amendment. To now expand the reach of \n     the federal death penalty to these non-homicide crimes would \n     be clearly unconstitutional, under recent Supreme Court \n     precedent.\n       The ACLU has a long history of supporting civil rights \n     legislation, including legislation responding to criminal \n     civil rights violations. While we did not support the \n     underlying hate crimes provision in the defense authorization \n     bill because of First Amendment weaknesses, an expansion of \n     the federal death penalty stands in stark contrast to \n     furthering the cause of civil rights in the United States.\n       The ACLU urges you to oppose the Sessions Amendment (S.A. \n     1615) to the defense authorization bill and to vote ``NO'' \n     when it comes to the floor. The ACLU will score this vote. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact Chris Anders at (202) 675-\n     2308 if you have any questions regarding this amendment or \n     the underlying hate crimes provision.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael W. Macleod-Ball,\n       Interim Director, ACLU Washington Legislative Office.\n     Christopher E. Anders,\n       Senior Legislative Counsel.\n     Jennifer Bellamy,\n       Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                        Leadership\n\n\n                                   Conference on Civil Rights,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the civil rights, religious, \n     professional, civic, and educational groups below, we write \n     to urge you to oppose two unnecessary and harmful amendments \n     offered by Senator Sessions to S. 1390, the FY 2010 \n     Department of Defense Authorization bill.\n       As strong supporters of S. 909, the Matthew Shepard Hate \n     Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA), we supported the addition of \n     this legislation as an amendment to S. 1390 last week. At a \n     time when Congress is poised to advance civil rights \n     protection by promoting new Federal-state partnerships and \n     providing new tools to address bias-motivated violence, the \n     proposed amendments by Senator Sessions (a staunch opponent \n     of the HCPA) would be a disturbing step backward--and raise \n     the prospects of unequal, politically-motivated, shifting \n     standards of justice in applying the new hate crime law in \n     the future.\n       One amendment offered by Senator Sessions, S.Amdt. 1615, \n     would add the death penalty to the provisions of the HCPA. We \n     strongly oppose this amendment.\n       The HCPA was first introduced in 1997, but no version of \n     the bill has ever included the death penalty. Senate and \n     House sponsors of the bill and the very broad coalition of \n     supporters have always opposed adding the death penalty to \n     this legislation. The House of Representatives approved its \n     very similar version of this measure, HR 1913, the Local Law \n     Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act, without the death \n     penalty on April 29 by a vote of 249-175. An amendment to add \n     the death penalty was defeated at the House Judiciary \n     Committee markup.\n       Supporters of the HCPA should oppose this amendment. The \n     death penalty is irreversible and highly controversial--with \n     significant doubts about its deterrent effect and clear \n     evidence of disproportionate application against poor people. \n     Moreover, there are serious, well-documented concerns about \n     unequal and racially biased application of the death penalty. \n     According to the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice \n     Statistics, since 1977, blacks and whites have been the \n     victims of murders in almost equal numbers, yet 80% of the \n     people executed in that period were convicted of murders \n     involving white victims.\n       Importantly, the vast majority of hate crimes are \n     prosecuted by state and local officials. Failure to include \n     the death penalty in the HCPA, which will be codified at 18 \n     U.S.C. 249, will not impact state action. States with the \n     death penalty are free to pursue that option.\n       We also urge you to oppose another amendment, SA 1617, \n     offered by Senator Sessions. This amendment would require the \n     Attorney General to promulgate guidelines with ``neutral and \n     objective criteria for determining whether a crime was \n     motivated by the status of the victim.'' This amendment is \n     unnecessary and injects politics into the Justice \n     Department decision-making process in these cases. \n     Senators should be especially concerned that this \n     additional Attorney General guidance could vary from \n     Administration to Administration, resulting in uncertainty \n     and, at worst, an unequal application of this important \n     law.\n       Moreover, the amendment is redundant. The HCPA already \n     requires the Attorney General to certify that a crime meets \n     the requirement of the statute before initiating any \n     prosecution:\n       (A) the State does not have jurisdiction;\n       (B) the State has requested that the Federal Government \n     assume jurisdiction;\n       (C) the verdict or sentence obtained pursuant to State \n     charges left demonstratively unvindicated the Federal \n     interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence; or\n       (D) a prosecution by the United States is in the public \n     interest and necessary to secure substantial justice.\n       This language tracks the very similar certification \n     requirement from an existing statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245. FBI \n     investigators and Justice Department prosecutors have had \n     forty years of experience under this parallel statute to \n     develop well-established procedures governing the conduct of \n     prosecutors--and for determining whether a case is bias-\n     motivated and whether the Justice Department has jurisdiction \n     to pursue it. There is no record of abuse by the Justice \n     Department in selective prosecutions or in using its \n     authority capriciously or arbitrarily. Therefore, there is no \n     need to burden these prosecutions with another layer of \n     guidance and another procedural obstacle.\n       The time for action to update and expand federal hate crime \n     law is now. These amendments offered by Senator Sessions are \n     unnecessary and harmful and we urge you to oppose them.\n       Please contact Michael Lieberman, Anti-Defamation League \n     Director, Civil Rights Policy Planning Center or Nancy \n     Zirkin, LCCR Executive Vice President with any questions. \n     Thank you in advance for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n         Anti-Defamation League; Human Rights Campaign; Leadership \n           Conference on Civil Rights; National Council of Jewish \n           Women; American Association of People with \n           Disabilities; American Association of University Women \n           (AAUW); American Federation of Labor-Congress of \n           Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) American Federation \n           of Teachers.\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\n         American Jewish Committee; Amputee Coalition of America; \n           Asian American Justice Center; Association of \n           University Centers on Disability; Bazelon Center for \n           Mental Health Law; B'nai B'rith International; \n           DignityUSA; Disability Rights Education and Defense \n           Fund.\n         Family Equality Council; GLSEN--The Gay, Lesbian and \n           Straight Education Network; Helen Keller National \n           Center National Coalition on Deaf-Blindness; Hindu \n           American Foundation; Human Rights Campaign; Human \n           Rights First; Jewish Council for Public Affairs; Legal \n           Momentum.\n         NAACP; NA'AMUT USA; National Advocacy Center of the \n           Sisters of the Good Shepherd; National Center for \n           Transgender Equality; National Coalition for the \n           Homeless; National Coalition on Deaf-Blindness; \n           National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty; \n           National Congress of Black Women.\n         National Council of La Raza; National Disability Rights \n           Network; National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action \n           Fund; National Urban League; Orthodox Church in \n           America; Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and \n           Gays (PFLAG) National; People for the American Way; \n           Religious Institute.\n         School Social Work Association of America; Sikh American \n           Legal Defense and Education Fund; The American-Arab \n           Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC); Union for Reform \n           Judaism; Unitarian Universalist Association of \n           Congregations; United Methodist Church, General Board \n           of Church and Society; Women of Reform Judaism; YWCA \n           USA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the American Bar \n     Association to urge you to vote against the Sessions \n     Amendment (No. 1615) to create a death penalty offense for \n     what are now non-capital hate crimes. We understand that the \n     amendment will be offered during consideration of S. 1390, \n     Department of Defense authorization legislation.\n       For decades, the American Bar Association has studied the \n     administration of the death penalty in the United States and \n     identified serious concerns that must be addressed by all \n     jurisdictions that seek to impose it. Among these concerns \n     are: (1) the lack of competent counsel in capital cases; (2) \n     the need for proper procedures for adjudicating claims in \n     capital cases (including the availability of federal habeas \n     corpus); and (3) racial discrimination in the administration \n     of capital punishment. The ABA has called for reforms that \n     are consistent with many longstanding ABA policies intended \n     to ensure that death penalty cases are administered fairly \n     and impartially, in accordance with due process, and to \n     minimize the risk that innocent persons may be executed.\n       The proposed Sessions Amendment to S. 1390 (``Amendment'') \n     fails to address the profound concerns articulated by the ABA \n     and others about the lack of fairness and due process in the \n     federal death penalty system. To expand an already ``broken \n     system'' without first addressing the serious flaws in the \n     system would risk the execution of innocent persons and other \n     acts of injustice.\n       The Amendment would also result in an unprecedented and \n     unconstitutional expansion of the federal death penalty. \n     Unlike every other state death penalty statute in the United \n     States, a death sentence pursuant to this Amendment is \n     available for an offense that did not result in the death of \n     a victim. The United States Supreme Court has definitively \n     ruled that a death sentence is inappropriate when the offense \n     did not result in the death of the victim. Kennedy v. \n     Louisiana, 554 US        (2008). The Court held that none of \n     these laws, where the crime against an individual involved no \n     murder, were in keeping with the national consensus \n     restricting the death penalty to the worst offenses. The ABA \n     is thus concerned that the proposed Amendment is not \n     consistent with constitutional principles or Supreme Court \n     precedent.\n       The ABA strongly condemns hate crimes; we adopted policy in \n     1987 that states that ``the ABA condemns crimes of violence \n     including those based on bias or prejudice against the \n     victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or minority \n     status, and urges vigorous efforts by federal, state, and \n     local officials to prosecute the perpetrators and to focus \n     public attention on this growing national problem.'' \n     Likewise, ABA supports the aggressive prosecution and \n     deterrence of these offenses. However, in light of its \n     experiences, studies, and policies on the death penalty, the \n     ABA opposes an expansion of the current federal death penalty \n     system so that these crimes would carry a potential death \n     sentence for offenders.\n       The American Bar Association thus urges you to vote against \n     this Amendment when it is considered on the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas M. Susman,\n                    Director, Governmental Affairs Office.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1616\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sessions \namendment No. 1616 now be the pending business, and that at 4:10 p.m., \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, with the time \nuntil then equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Sessions, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1616.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, with the \npermission of the Senator from Alabama, that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit assault or battery of a United States serviceman \n on account of the military service of the United States serviceman or \n                        status as a serviceman)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ATTACKS ON UNITED STATES SERVICEMEN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 67 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1389. Prohibition on attacks on United States \n       servicemen on account of service\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Whoever knowingly assaults or batters a \n     United States serviceman or an immediate family member of a \n     United States serviceman, or who knowingly destroys or \n     injures the property of such serviceman or immediate family \n     member, on account of the military service of that serviceman \n     or status of that individual as a United States serviceman, \n     or who attempts or conspires to do so, shall--\n       ``(1) in the case of a simple assault, or destruction or \n     injury to property in which the damage or attempted damage to \n     such property is not more than $500, be fined under this \n     title in an amount not less than $500 nor more than $10,000 \n     and imprisoned not more than 2 years;\n       ``(2) in the case of destruction or injury to property in \n     which the damage or attempted damage to such property is more \n     than $500, be fined under this title in an amount not less \n     than $1000 nor more than $100,000 and imprisoned not more \n     than 5 years; and\n       ``(3) in the case of a battery, or an assault resulting in \n     bodily injury, be fined under this title in an amount not \n     less than $2500 and imprisoned not less than 16 months nor \n     more than 10 years.\n       ``(b) Exception.--This section shall not apply to conduct \n     by a person who is subject to the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice.\n       ``(c) Definitions.--In this section--\n       ``(1) the term `Armed Forces' has the meaning given that \n     term in section 1388;\n       ``(2) the term `immediate family member' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 115; and\n       ``(3) the term `United States serviceman'--\n       ``(A) means a member of the Armed Forces; and\n       ``(B) includes a former member of the Armed Forces during \n     the 5-year period beginning on the date of the discharge from \n     the Armed Forces of that member of the Armed Forces.''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of \n     sections for chapter 67 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``1389. Prohibition on attacks on United States servicemen on account \n              of service.''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Did we get an agreement on the time before we vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided until 4:10 p.m.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Levin. It is always a \npleasure to work with him and others who work with us to make sure that \nwhen we prosecute a hate crime that results in death, that it is \npossible to have the death penalty in Federal court. I think that is \nappropriate in those instances where it may be appropriate for the \nFederal Government to proceed with such a death penalty prosecution. It \nwould be odd that it would not be possible and a crime could have \nresulted--easily in multiple murders--by one of the most vicious \ncriminals one can imagine.\n  The next amendment I call the soldiers amendment. It is distinct from \nthe hate crimes legislation we have been discussing. It expands the \nprotections that the United States of America provides to its soldiers. \nRemember, we provide protections now to Federal officers, postmen--any \nFederal officer of the United States is protected, and so are soldiers \nin certain circumstances.\n  This amendment would create a new Federal crime which puts members of \nthe U.S. military on equal footing with other protected classes. It \nmakes it a crime to knowingly assault, batter a serviceman or immediate \nfamily member or knowingly destroy or injure\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\ntheir property ``on account of the military service or status of that \nindividual as a United States serviceman . . . ''\n  It is not a total expansion of Federal law, but it says if you are \nattacked or assaulted, battered, or your family members are simply \nbecause you are a member of the U.S. military serving your country, \nthen the Federal Government would obviously have the ability to \nprosecute because it is a high duty, and no higher responsibility, for \nthe U.S. Government to protect its soldiers from assaults arising from \ntheir service to our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have had problems with these \nassaults on our military officers. This will be a good step in \ncorrecting that situation.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak. I hope my colleagues \nwill support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from Alabama \nfor this amendment. He is a valued member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He knows, as we all know, because of our work on the Armed \nServices Committee, how our men and women in uniform protect us, and we \nshould do everything we can when it comes to our criminal laws to \nprotect them and their families. This amendment is aimed at doing this. \nIt would create a new Federal crime. It is appropriate we do that. I \nsupport the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1616.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was going to inquire of the Senator whether he is \nspeaking on the bill? It is morning business.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I know we are debating the Defense \nAuthorization bill and a myriad of other things we are sticking into \nthe bill. Nationally, Americans are focused on health care and what the \nPresident and the majority are trying to push through in a mad rush \nthat we seem to have been in all year long under this guise of crisis. \nIt is pretty amazing in that the legislation we are talking about would \nnot take effect for several years, so it is incredible we are being \ntold we need to pass this in the next couple of weeks before we go home \nin August.\n  The last time the President made grand promises and demanded passage \nof a bill before it could be reviewed or even read, we ended up with \nthe colossal stimulus failure and unemployment near 10 percent. Now we \nare being told they misread the economy. But we were urged to pass this \nwithin a day or two because we had to do it in order to keep \nunemployment below 8 percent.\n  Now the President wants Americans to trust him again but he cannot \nback up the utopian promises he is making about a government takeover \nof health care. He insists his health care plan will not add to our \nNation's deficit, despite the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nsaying exactly the opposite.\n  Today we learned that the President is refusing to release a critical \nreport on the state of our economy which contains facts essential to \nthis debate. What is he hiding? If the actual legislation came close to \nmatching the President's rhetoric, he would have no problem passing \nthis bill, with huge Democratic majorities in both Chambers. But \nAmericans are not being fooled and we are discovering the truth about \nhis plan, which includes rationed care, trillions in new costs and high \ntaxes, and penalties which will destroy jobs, and even government-\nfunded abortion.\n  In addition, we are looking at a deficit increased by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars and billions in new taxes on small businesses. It \ncould destroy over 4 million more jobs, according to a model by the \nPresident's own chief economic adviser, and it could force 114 million \nAmericans to lose their health care, according to a nonpartisan group.\n  Let's be clear. There is no one in this debate advocating that we do \nnothing, despite the President's constant straw man arguments. \nRepublicans have offered comprehensive health care reform solutions \nthat cover millions of the uninsured without exploding costs, raising \ntaxes, and rationing care. Since I have been in Congress, we have \nintroduced a number of proposals that would help the uninsured buy \ntheir own policies.\n  We have introduced bills that would allow them to deduct it from \ntheir taxes just as businesses do, but our Democratic colleagues have \nkilled it. We have introduced legislation that would allow Americans to \nbuy health insurance anywhere in the country, to make it more \ncompetitive and more affordable, but the Democrats have killed it. We \nhave introduced legislation that would allow Americans to use money in \ntheir health savings accounts to pay for an insurance premium, but the \nDemocrats have killed it. We have introduced legislation that would \nstop all these frivolous and wasteful lawsuits that cause the cost of \nmedicine to go up, but the Democrats have killed it. We have introduced \nassociation health plans that would allow small businesses to come \ntogether so they could buy policies less expensively, but the Democrats \nhave killed it. Now they want to come back and say the government needs \nto take over health care.\n  It makes absolutely no sense at all. We can give every American \naccess to affordable health insurance plans if we get out of the way \nand allow the market to work.\n  This is no time to rush into another government takeover of another \npart of the American economy, spending billions of dollars we do not \nhave and raising taxes on the small businesses that create jobs.\n  There are good solutions. I introduced one a couple of weeks ago that\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\nwould give people fair treatment. If you do not get your insurance at \nwork or you are unemployed, we will give you $5,000 a year to buy \nhealth insurance. That is fair treatment. It is the same basic benefit \nwe give people who get insurance at work, good insurance that does not \ncost any more money.\n  I would encourage the President to stop the rhetoric, let us take \nsome time for debate, let's reform health care in a way that makes it \npossible for every American to have a health insurance plan they can \nafford and own and keep. We do not need the government to take it over.\n  I yield for the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                         Apollo 11 Anniversary\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, today I rise to speak and \ncommemorate a great milestone; that is, Apollo 11, the anniversary of \nits landing.\n  Forty years ago today, on a hot Sunday afternoon in Texas, three \nastronaut families and close friends in the Houston suburb of El Lago \nwere gathered around television sets in the privacy of their homes \nwatching grainy broadcasts and listening to the sounds from a small \nloudspeaker wired from Mission Control conveying the voices of \nastronaut Charlie Duke's conversation with the Apollo 11 astronauts \nduring the final moments leading to the first landing on the Moon.\n  It was an intensely personal experience for all of them and yet one \nshared by much of the world. Everyone was glued to their televisions, \nthose who could get to a television at that moment, and waiting for the \nword, wherever they were. It was 3:18 p.m. Houston time when Neil \nArmstrong announced: ``Houston, Tranquility Base here, The Eagle has \nlanded.''\n  A baseball game in Yankee Stadium in New York was stopped, and the \nannouncement made that America had put men on the Moon. The audience \nerupted in applause and then burst into singing ``The Star Spangled \nBanner.'' In college dormitories, in workplaces, in living rooms across \nthe world, people gathered to watch this broadcast of the ``giant leap \nfor mankind'' that Neil Armstrong made, and Buzz Aldrin following him \nonto the surface of the Moon, that attracted and compelled millions of \npeople throughout the world.\n  The Apollo 11 landing is forever etched in the minds of those who \nwatched it or heard it. They are bound together in the history of \nmankind in a stunning milestone in the advancement of humanity.\n  The Apollo Program gave us the very first view through the eyes of \nhuman beings, captured and transmitted by their cameras, of the Earth, \nour own spaceship against the infinite backdrop of space. It gave us \ngreat advancement in technology, new industries, capabilities \nbenefitting everyone on Earth, especially medical science and quality \nof life.\n  Most importantly, it gave us a new vision of ourselves as a nation \nand the sense of our ability to accomplish things that once seemed \nutterly impossible and probably were not even thought about but yet had \njust happened.\n  The anniversary we celebrate today comes at a time when we need to be \nreminded that we can overcome challenges and achieve great things when \nwe are committed and dedicated and prepared to step up to the plate. We \nface enormous challenges as a nation and as part of the global \ncommunity: finding solutions to our current economic crisis; ensuring \nour national security; finding solutions to the many domestic issues we \nface in health care, unemployment, energy, and the environment.\n  What many may not recall is that in May of 1961, President Kennedy \nspoke to Congress on ``urgent national needs.'' He spoke of issues \nstrikingly similar to those we face today. He began with a focus on \n``the great battleground for the defense of freedom'' being in Asia, \nLatin America, Africa, and the Middle East, and of enemies of freedom \nwhose ``aggression is more often concealed than open.''\n  Remember this is 1961, and the President is talking about issues that \nrelate to us today. Yet, he said, as he turned to the economy, he \ndescribed the need ``to turn recession into recovery'' and meeting \n``the task of abating unemployment and achieving a bold use of our \nresources.'' He spoke of shoring up our international allegiances and \nproviding aid to developing countries seeking to establish themselves \nas democratic states. He spoke of reshaping our military to better meet \nunconventional threats and mobility and flexibility in response and the \nneed to ensure effective and accurate intelligence.\n  This sounds so familiar because we are talking about a Moon landing, \nbut yet we are facing all of these domestic, international, and \nsecurity issues at the same time. But yet we do not lose that zeal to \ncommand something that is beyond the parameters we have known.\n  President Kennedy spoke of the need to expand efforts in civil \ndefense, what we might now call homeland security, to ensure the safety \nof our citizens at home. He spoke of renewed calls for arms control and \nreductions in nuclear arsenals across the globe.\n  Finally, he focused his concluding remarks on the challenge of space \nexploration saying:\n\n       Now is the time . . . for a great new American enterprise--\n     time for this Nation to take a clearly leading role in space \n     achievement which, in many ways, may hold the key to our \n     future on earth.\n\n  He went on to use those words that are perhaps the most familiar from \nthat speech.\n\n       I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the \n     goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon \n     and returning him safely to the earth.\n\n  President Kennedy made that commitment for U.S. leadership in space \nand set the highest possible goal for establishment of that leadership \nwith the Apollo Program at a time when the Nation faced challenges not \nunlike those we face today. I believe he did so because he saw that \nspace exploration was something that could elevate the entire national \nspirit and enhance its broader economy and national security.\n  As we celebrate the anniversary of the lunar landing, we honor the \nvision, the courage, and the accomplishments of all of the men and \nwomen of Apollo, whether astronauts, engineers, flight directors, or \nassembly workers, and their families. We thank them for two generations \nof excellence and leadership in science and technology.\n  How do we best honor that legacy? We can do it by continuing our \nNation's commitment to space exploration and to sustain the leadership \nrole they won for us in those early pioneering days. We must recognize, \nas President Kennedy did, that space exploration was an important and \nurgent national need, not an activity to be short-changed or sacrificed \nin the face of other pressing economic and security concerns.\n  We must make the investment needed to ensure that the United States \nhas the ability to launch humans into space. Today, we are looking at a \nfew more missions of our space shuttle, and then we are looking at up \nto 5 years in which America will not be able to put men and women in \nspace at all.\n  This is, as Charles Krauthammer said in a recent article: Five years \nin which we are going to beg Russia or even China for space on their \nspaceships to be able to put men and women in space.\n\n  Forty years ago America did something that changed our country and \nthe world. It gave us new technology. It gave us the dominance of space \nfor our national security purposes. It gave us the ability to have \nsatellite-guided missiles that can now go into a window from miles away \nand stop the collateral damage and the death of innocent humans when we \nare in a war situation. It has given us so much. Forty years later we \nare sitting here with a space program where we are going to have 5 \nyears in which we cannot put men and women into space with our own \nvehicle. That is not what we should be celebrating on this 40th \nanniversary. We should be celebrating a renewal of the commitment to \nspace exploration.\n  We should be celebrating that we are going to finish out an \ninternational space station in which many of our international partners \nhave invested billions, as have we, and that we are committed to \nputting people in that space station that is now designated as a \nnational laboratory--our part is--to have the scientific exploration \ncapability to be able to take the next step in medical research that \ncannot be done on Earth because we have that national lab.\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\n  The idea that we would make that investment and then not be able to \nput people there for 5 years is unthinkable. That is what it is, it is \nunthinkable.\n  So I want to remember the words of President Kennedy, and I have to \nsay I want to remember another speech that President Kennedy made. It \nwas at Rice University. He was talking about why we are committed to \nputting people on the Moon, why we are committed to things that are so \nvisionary for the future.\n  He said: Why would we put people into space? Why would Rice play \nTexas? Not because it is easy but because it is hard.\n  That very next year, Rice tied the University of Texas in football. \nIt was not in the same league as putting men on the Moon. It was not. \nBut he had the vision and he also had the humor to convey it. He knew \nwhat made our country the best country in the world was the vision of \ndoing things that would be seemingly impossible and having the capacity \nand commitment to do it.\n  That is what President Kennedy led us to do 40 years ago. Today we \nmust renew that commitment. That is the only way we can show we are \nworthy of all that has gone on before us that led to Neil Armstrong's \nfamous words: ``One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''\n  I hope with all of the remembrances we are making that the real \neffort that will be made is what Charlie Bolden said when he was in our \ncommittee last week. The chairman of the committee asked Charlie: \n``NASA's deteriorating. Tell me why we should support it?''\n  Charlie Bolden, the new Administrator of NASA, said:\n\n       I am committed to doing it and doing it right. We have to \n     have the commitment of Congress to make it happen.\n\n  He knows what is right. He is a former astronaut, he is an engineer, \nhe is a great Texan who is a visionary and the person who can implement \nthat vision, and we are going to support him in every way.\n  I hope all of my colleagues in Congress will do the same thing on the \neve of the anniversary of one of the great achievements of America and \nall mankind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I commend the Secretary from Texas \nfor her commemoration of this spectacular day when Americas went to the \nMoon. One of them was a fellow named Buzz Aldrin, who lived in the town \nof Montclair, NJ, the town that I inhabited for many years.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from New Jersey because, of \ncourse, Buzz Aldrin is going to be at that commemoration tomorrow and \nhas been one of the leaders in trying to make sure America does not \nflag in its enthusiasm and commitment to space exploration and all that \nit will bring us.\n  So I thank the Senator for remembering Buzz Aldrin as well because he \nwas a great astronaut and one of the leaders still today for that very \nimportant mission.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It looked as though it were a fairly simple mission. \nNow as we study it more thoroughly and realize what conditions were \nlike there--the dust was threatening to the people, to the machinery, \nto the ship that took them there, to the spaceship that took them \nthere--it was a remarkable event. I join the distinguished Senator from \nTexas in her tribute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1618\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, this past Friday, five policemen \nfrom a city in New Jersey, Jersey City, were shot by a single gunman. \nOn the previous Wednesday, only a few hundred feet from the steps of \nthis Senate, a gunman fired an assault weapon at Capitol policemen. \nDespite this point in time, after all of that mayhem last week, we have \nseen the prospect for more gun violence offered by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  He has offered an amendment that would gut State public safety laws \nand make it easier to carry concealed weapons across State lines, \nregardless of the laws of that State. Currently 48 States do allow some \nsort of concealed carried weapons. The standards vary from State to \nState based on each State's law enforcement needs and challenges. But \nunder this new idea, this amendment would permit a concealed carry \npermit from one State to simply override the rules in other States. If \nI get a permit in State A, I can go to State B, C, D, any one I choose, \nwith a weapon on my back, on my hip, wherever I want it. And I don't \nthink it matters how many guns one carries.\n  Understand this thoroughly, that despite a State's laws on \navailability of concealed guns, Congress would override them. The State \nsays no. Congress would say: No, we want the Federal Government to be \nable to tell you what to do. That is unusual, because I think the \nofferor of this amendment is more often a States rights person. But now \nhe wishes Congress to override State laws and make one's own State \nfollow this mandate. It would deprive one's State from making its own \ndecisions on the issue. One's constituents would not be able to say \nthey don't want this to happen. In fact, this amendment would allow \nsome people to carry concealed assault weapons, multifiring, multishell \nfiring weapons in States where those assault weapons are not even \npermitted.\n  The amendment before us is more about the right of States to make \ntheir own decisions about how they keep families in their States safe \nfrom gun violence. This amendment would allow almost anyone anywhere to \ncarry a concealed firearm regardless of that State's law. Strangers \ncoming into town carrying a hidden weapon have an open sesame \nopportunity to go anywhere they darn please--into town, into a school, \ninto a sporting event, into a shopping mall, anywhere they wish to go \nregardless of what that State's laws are. Because under this amendment \nit is clear: If you have a license for a permit from a State in the Far \nWest and you want to carry it to the eastern part of our country, you \ncan do so. Just take away the public safety laws in that State and \nessentially erase the fact that they are now in the laws.\n  The amendment declares to State governments that they don't know how \nto take care of themselves. The gun lobby in Washington is the best \nplace to go to find out what you should or can do. We can't tolerate \nsuch an insult.\n  Here are some of the State concealed weapon requirements that would \nbe wiped out by the amendment. Eighteen States prohibit alcohol abusers \nfrom receiving carry permits, including South Dakota. Under the Thune \namendment, these 18 States would have to allow alcohol abusers from \nother States to carry a weapon into their State. Twenty-four States \nprohibit those convicted of certain misdemeanor crimes, including \nPennsylvania, which does not allow those convicted of impersonating a \npolice officer, to carry concealed weapons. Under this amendment, those \nprohibitions would be violated. Nineteen States require those seeking \nconcealed carry permits to complete gun safety programs. Under this \namendment, those States would have to allow untrained, untested gun \nusers from other States to carry concealed firearms. It is an outrage.\n  The proponents of this amendment claim they are respecting each \nState's concealed carry laws. That is simply not true. Not only does \nthe Thune amendment override a State's concealed weapons law, it also \noverrides State laws restricting the type of guns that can be possessed \nin that State, such as assault weapons. Think about that; the type of \nguns that are restricted in the State, that rule would be obviated, and \nyou would have to permit the licensed gun owner from a far different \nState to come in.\n  I have a letter from 400 mayors opposed to the Thune amendment. Over \n400 mayors wrote to the Congress and said: Vote no on the Thune \namendment, including 106 from Pennsylvania, 51 from Florida, 50 from \nOhio, 13 from Wisconsin--the list goes on--from Louisiana, from \nMissouri, from South Carolina, from almost every State in the country \nthat has its own gun laws. They have written and said: Don't do this.\n  As these mayors explained in their letter:\n\n       Each state ought to have the ability to decide whether to \n     accept concealed carry permits issued in other states.\n\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 17, 2009.\n     Re: 400 mayors call on Congress to respect State autonomy and \n         protect public safety by voting no on the Thune Concealed \n         Carry Amendment.\n\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Office of the Speaker,\n     Washington, D.C.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid: As members of \n     Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a bi-partisan coalition of more \n     than 400 mayors representing more than 56 million Americans, \n     we are writing to express our strong opposition to \n     Congressional bills pushing for the Thune Concealed Carry \n     Amendment. If passed, this legislation will infringe upon the \n     ability of state and local governments to protect their \n     citizens with sensible, constitutional, community-specific \n     laws and regulations regarding the carrying of hidden \n     handguns. It will empower gun traffickers, making it easier \n     for them to transport the guns they sell to criminals without \n     being apprehended by law enforcement. Finally, the bill \n     threatens the safety of our police officers by making it far \n     more difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal \n     firearm possession.\n       The Mayors Against Illegal Guns coalition has long believed \n     that the issue of concealed carry regulation is one best left \n     to cities and states. Our coalition believes that what state \n     officials, law enforcement and legislators decide are the \n     best policies for rural areas may not be the best for big \n     cities--and vice-versa.\n       It is very common for states to set standards for carrying \n     guns on city streets that go beyond simply whether an \n     applicant is able to pass a federal background check. Many \n     states, including those with strong gun rights traditions, \n     have enacted common sense concealed carry laws that prohibit \n     carrying by persons regarded as unusually dangerous and \n     criminals convicted of certain misdemeanors, or that require \n     safety training for anyone who wants to carry concealed \n     firearms. For example:\n       At least 31 states prohibit alcohol abusers from obtaining \n     a concealed carry permit, including South Carolina, which \n     prevents ``habitual drunkards'' from carrying guns.\n       At least 35 states prohibit persons convicted of certain \n     misdemeanor crimes from carrying concealed firearms, \n     including Pennsylvania, which bars carrying by those who have \n     been convicted of impersonating a law enforcement officer and \n     other misdemeanor offenses.\n       At least 31 states require the completion of a gun safety \n     program prior to the issuance of a permit, including Nevada, \n     which requires a 40-question written exam and live fire \n     training from three different positions with a certified \n     instructor as components of their required gun safety course.\n       This legislation would eviscerate all of these standards, \n     moving concealed carry permitting to a new national lowest \n     common denominator.\n       Each state ought to have the ability to decide whether to \n     accept concealed carry permits issued in other states. 9 \n     states have chosen to allow concealed carrying by all out-of-\n     state permit holders. However, 12 states choose not to \n     recognize any out-of-state permits. And 29 states recognize \n     permits only from selected states--typically from states with \n     equivalent or higher standards. Any of these options should \n     be available--and it should be each state's choice to make.\n       This legislation will also aid and abet gun traffickers. In \n     December 2008, Mayors Against Illegal Guns issued a first-of-\n     its-kind report illustrating how traffickers already rely on \n     states with weak laws as a source for the guns they sell \n     illegally. In fact, the report showed that 30% of crime guns \n     crossed state lines before they were recovered, meaning \n     traffickers and straw purchasers often purchase guns in one \n     state and then drive them to their destinations, often major \n     cities hundreds of miles away. This bill would frustrate law \n     enforcement by allowing criminal traffickers to travel to \n     their rendezvous with loaded handguns in the glove \n     compartment. Even more troubling is that a trafficker holding \n     an out-of-state permit would be able to walk the streets of \n     their city with a backpack full of loaded guns, enjoying \n     impunity from police unless he or she was caught in the act \n     of selling a firearm to another criminal.\n       Finally, this law would not only frustrate our police \n     officers, it would endanger them. Policing our streets and \n     confronting the risks inherent in even routine traffic stops \n     is already perilous enough without increasing the number of \n     guns that officers encounter. Ambiguity as to the legality of \n     firearm possession could lead to confusion among police \n     officers that could result in catastrophic incidences. \n     Congress should be working to make the job of a police \n     officer more safe--not less.\n       We urge every member of Congress who respects the \n     prerogatives of local law enforcement, wishes to shield \n     communities from gun trafficking, and strives to protect our \n     nation's police officers to take immediate action to oppose \n     and vote against this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas M. Menino,\n       Mayor of Boston, Coalition Co-Chair.\n     Michael R. Bloomberg,\n       Mayor of New York City, Coalition Co-Chair.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As the mayors make clear, the Thune amendment savages \nthe rights of States to enact their own laws. Unfortunately, this \ndangerous amendment doesn't end there. It would unleash total havoc by \nsuddenly letting dangerous and unstable people carry weapons into other \nStates and across State lines. Supporters of this amendment claim that \nonly ``law-abiding citizens'' get their hands on concealed weapons \npermits. That is not true. Over the 2-year period from May 2007 to \nApril 2009, concealed carry permit holders killed seven law enforcement \nofficers with guns. In fact, the Florida Sun Sentinel did an \ninvestigation of concealed carry permit holders in Florida and found \nthat Florida granted concealed carry weapons to more than 1,400 people \nwho pled guilty or no contest to a felony; 216 people with outstanding \nwarrants were allowed to carry a gun; 120 people with active domestic \nviolence injunctions; and 6 registered sex offenders.\n  I worked very hard some years ago--going back to 1996--to get a rule \non issuing guns that would say to those convicted of misdemeanor \nspousal abuse should be unable to get guns. It was scoffed at by some \nwho were here at that time who said: This isn't a gun matter. It is \nnothing too serious and why bother. I am pleased to tell the Senate \nthat with Supreme Court affirmation about 6 months ago, saying that the \nlaw prohibiting gun permits to spousal abusers stood, 150,000 of these \npeople were denied guns.\n  When I look at these things, it raises a question. While a State such \nas Florida works to correct these problems, should every other State be \nforced to allow felons, domestic abusers, and sex offenders to carry \nguns within their States? I don't want it in my State.\n  This is a reckless amendment that would force States from coast to \ncoast to comply with the weakest conceal carry laws. A few months ago \nin Alabama, a person holding a concealed carry license went on a \nmurderous rampage that lasted almost a full hour and spanned two \ncommunities. First he shot and killed his mother in Coffee County, AL. \nHe then put on a vest loaded with firearms and ammunition, got into his \ncar and drove into town. Once there he shot and murdered 10 innocent \npeople--we can't forget that--including two young mothers, a father, \nand an 18-month-old child. It was later discovered that this killer had \nqualified and been issued a concealed weapons permit from the Coffee \nCounty sheriff's department.\n  A few weeks after Mr. Mclendon's murderous rampage in Alabama, there \nwas a premeditated shooting spree in upstate New York. The gunman drove \nhis car up to a citizenship services center in Binghamton, NY, \nbarricaded the backdoor with his car, and then burst through the front \nentrance with two handguns and a bag full of ammunition. In what would \nbecome the worst mass shooting since the tragic assault at Virginia \nTech, the assailant opened fire, killing one receptionist and wounding \nanother.\n  He then entered a classroom where he sprayed gunfire, killing 12 more \ninnocent people and wounding 7 others. The gunman then committed \nsuicide. The killer was no stranger to guns. He was a firearms \nenthusiast and even though he had been convicted of a misdemeanor, he \nheld a license to carry concealed weapons.\n  The day after the city of Binghamton was terrorized by a gunman, two \npolice officers arrived at a house in Pittsburgh to quell a domestic \nconflict between a man and his mother. When the two officers entered, \nthey were ambushed and killed. The assailant was carrying three \nfirearms and wearing a bulletproof vest and murdered the policemen with \nan AK-47.\n  Minutes later, the gunman shot and killed a third officer who arrived \nat the scene. The attacker held the police at bay for 4 hours before \nsurrendering. It was later learned the killer had been arrested for \ndomestic abuse against his girlfriend but held a concealed weapons \npermit.\n  We have to face up to this. This amendment would let more brutal \npeople carry concealed weapons legally--\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\nand not just in their own town or in their own State but in other \nStates and across State lines.\n  This amendment would also open the floodgates for gun trafficking. A \ngun dealer who sells firearms to criminals would be free to travel \nacross the country with a car full of loaded weapons as long as the \ndriver had a concealed weapons permit from some other State. The fact \nis, if the police were to discover the pile of guns in the trafficker's \ntrunk, the police could do nothing about it.\n  The prospect of this scenario is no exaggeration. Last year, a report \nshowed that one-third of firearms sold on the black market came from \nStates with weak gun safety laws. The Thune amendment would simply \nexacerbate this problem and make it easier for gun traffickers to \nsupply known criminals--including terrorists--with weapons.\n  The scourge of gun violence and gun deaths is a menace this Chamber \nmust take seriously. Think about it. All of us here represent a State--\nall of us, two per State--and we are being told by one of our Members \nthat what we ought to do is let the Federal Government decide how we \ncare for our people: decide, the Federal Government, how safe our \nstreets ought to be; decide, the Federal Government, to ignore or \nobviate laws we have on our books, and say: We are going to override \nyour books. We know best what is good for you.\n  Well, those in other States--whether Illinois or San Francisco, CA, \nor Houston, TX--do not know better about what we ought to do in New \nJersey than we do about them, and we should not allow this to take \nplace.\n  Just look at the toll gun violence takes on our most innocent and \ndefenseless in our country. Every single day, 8 children die because of \ngun violence, while another 48 kids are shot. They, however, manage to \nsurvive their gun injuries. Think about it: over 50 kids shot each and \nevery day. It is a tragedy in America.\n  The Thune amendment would place our communities in danger in further \ndanger than we already have. That is why law enforcement leaders--the \nvery people who put their lives on the line to combat criminals and \nkeep families safe--are against the Thune amendment. I have a letter \nfrom the International Association of Chiefs of Police opposing this \namendment. As the letter explains, the police chiefs urge Congress to \n``act quickly and take all necessary steps to defeat this dangerous and \nunacceptable legislation.'' The Association of Chiefs of Police--if \nanybody ought to know what is good for their communities, it should be \nthe chiefs of police.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed \nin the Record directly following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is no wonder that when police departments are in \ncharge of issuing concealed weapons permits, they are very conservative \nabout whom they allow to have these permits. Nevertheless, the \namendment from Senator Thune would defer to the weakest--think this \nthrough--would defer to the weakest concealed permit laws. So now \nuntrained, amateur gun owners will be free to carry a hidden firearm in \nother States and across State lines.\n  Do we want to completely disregard State law enforcement officers' \ndecisions or do we want criminals wandering our streets with pistols in \ntheir backpacks or carrying them on their sides or do we want unstable \ndrivers stuck in rush hour with guns in the front seats of their cars? \nI do not.\n  These are critical questions, and they should not be resolved by an \namendment tacked onto a Defense authorization bill--defense. We have \nour soldiers, and the toll keeps rising in Afghanistan. By no means is \nIraq a safe place to be. They should not have to be further jeopardized \nor have their health threatened. We see what conditions are like. We \nsee the reports from the war front. This bill ought to be moved along \njust on the Defense authorization.\n  On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee is going to hold hearings on \nSenator Thune's proposal. That hearing will give everyone a fair \nopportunity to get all the facts, hear from both sides of the issue, \nand learn from the testimony of experts. The hearing will include law \nenforcement officers testifying against this legislation. They deserve \nto have their voices heard. We should not shortcut the legislative \nprocess and the vital work of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Before I close, I wish to make one thing crystal clear: This \namendment has nothing to do with individuals' rights to protect \nthemselves in their own homes. A concealed weapons permit is a separate \nand special privilege that lets gun owners hide their firearms in a \njacket or a bag as they travel in the community and go out in public. \nWhether they are riding in a bus or a car or walking down the street, \nthey can have that weapon.\n  Why in our world is it necessary to make sure those who want to carry \na concealed weapon can go anyplace they want with this weapon? You know \nwhat happens. We read about fights occurring in cafes all the time. To \njust allow people to come in there with weapons and see what happens \nafter alcohol or too much celebration? Bad idea, and we should not \nallow it.\n  States and local communities must be allowed to choose who has earned \nthis privilege, based on what is in the best interest of that \nparticular State or community. Unfortunately, this amendment takes the \npower away from the local community, away from the State capitals, and \nleaves the decision about what is in the public interest to the gun \nlobby and the politicians here in town--lobbyists in many cases.\n  The Thune amendment poses extreme danger to our country, and it \nblatantly nullifies State laws and State rights in favor of a radical \nagenda. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on the Thune \namendment.\n  I recently was traveling with my wife out West, and we were \ninterested in seeing a particular baseball team play. We know the \nowners of the team. The hotel had a gun show.\n  By the way, I carried a gun. It was not concealed. I did it in a \nuniform during a war, and I loved that weapon. But it had a mission. It \nhad a mission to kill somebody else before they killed me. That is not \nwhat we typically see with concealed weapons.\n  In this case, we were at this hotel gun show, and people were buying \nammunition for their purpose. There was lots of activity. Lots of \nammunition was being put in the back of cars. The State, though, in \nthat case permitted it. There could not be any objection. The State \ndecided what was best for its citizens and its communities, and they \ndid just that. I do not agree with that, but I cannot object. If that \nState wants to do it that way, they are entitled to do it that way, and \nwho am I, from the State of New Jersey, to tell them how they should \nconduct themselves in those moments? I have no right to do that.\n  So here we are. We are faced with an amendment that says nobody in \nthe State knows what is better for their people than does the gun \nlobby, the NRA, the gun manufacturers. We disagree with that, and I \nhope we will show the American people we care enough about them and \nrespect their intelligence--respect the fact they have their own \nstructure in their States to take care of their needs as they see them. \nWe do not want to see intruders carrying guns coming into those \nStates--not mine, not yours, not anybody's--who do not pass the test \nthat is required within that State's jurisdiction before they go around \ntown with their weapons.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                          of Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 17, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am writing to \n     express our strong opposition to S. 845, the Respecting \n     States Rights and Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2009. \n     This bill would weaken existing state laws by allowing an \n     individual to carry concealed firearms when visiting another \n     state or the District of Columbia as long as the individual \n     was entitled to carry concealed firearms pursuant to the laws \n     of his or her home state.\n       It is the IACP's belief that S. 845 would severely \n     undermine state concealed carry licensing systems by allowing \n     out of state visitors to carry concealed firearms even if \n     those visitors have not met the standards for\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\n     carrying a concealed weapon in the state they are visiting. \n     For example, some states require a person to show that they \n     know how to use a firearm or meet minimum training standards \n     before obtaining a concealed carry license. These states \n     would be forced to allow out of state visitors to carry \n     concealed weapons even if they do not meet that state's \n     concealed licensing standards.\n       It is the IACP's belief that states and localities should \n     have the right to determine who is eligible to carry firearms \n     in their communities. It is essential that state, local and \n     tribal governments maintain the ability to legislate \n     concealed carry laws that best fit the needs of their \n     communities--private citizens as well as active and former \n     law enforcement personnel.\n       The IACP urges you to act quickly and take all necessary \n     steps to defeat this dangerous and unacceptable legislation.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me \n     know how we can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Russell B. Laine,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1618\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the business pending before the Senate is \nthe amendment I have offered to the Defense authorization bill. I think \nit is close to nearing an agreement with both sides about a process for \nproceeding to have debate on this amendment and then perhaps, \nhopefully, a vote sometime as early as Wednesday of this week.\n  I think it is important to note for the record--because many have \nalready or some at least have come down already and spoken on this \namendment--that I had hoped to offer this amendment as a second-degree \namendment to the hate crimes amendment that has been on the floor now \nfor the past week. The Defense authorization bill was brought up early \nlast week. Immediately, this hate crimes amendment was offered. It is a \nnongermane amendment. It is not relevant, obviously, to the underlying \ncontent of the bill.\n  The Defense bill sets priorities for our national security interests \nfor the coming year. Yet the Democratic leadership chose to make the \nhate crimes amendment the first amendment to be debated and voted upon. \nWhen they did that, it had been my intention to offer as a second-\ndegree amendment the concealed carry amendment, which is now the \npending amendment before the Senate. It makes sense in a lot of ways, \nto me, to do that simply because one of the best ways to help prevent \nhate crimes against potential victims of hate crimes is to allow them \nto defend themselves. The concealed carry permit is something most \nStates across the country have. What my amendment simply does is it \nallows those who have concealed carry permits in their own States to be \nable to move across State lines to other States that also allow \nconcealed carry permits. Obviously, they also have to respect the laws \nof those individual States if there are restrictions on the exercise of \nthat right.\n  I think it is important in the debate over hate crimes to point out \nthat the victims of those crimes ought to have at their disposal as \nmany ways of defending themselves as is possible. Frankly, there are \nlots of organizations that have come out in support of this amendment \nfor that reason, because they believe if you want to prevent those \ntypes of violent crimes, those types of hate crimes from being \ncommitted in this country, one way to do that is to allow individuals \nwho are the potential victims of those types of crimes to be able to \nhave a concealed carry permit in order to deter a crime from being \ncommitted.\n  It is also important to point out that there are a number of \narguments that have been raised against this amendment which just, \nfrankly, are not true.\n  First of all, my amendment does not create a national concealed carry \npermit system or standard. My amendment does not allow individuals to \nconceal and carry within States that do not allow their own citizens to \ndo so. My amendment does not allow citizens to circumvent their home \nState's concealed carry permit laws. If an individual is currently \nprohibited from possessing a firearm under Federal law, my amendment \nwould continue to prohibit them from doing so. When an individual with \na valid concealed carry permit from their home State travels to a State \nthat allows their citizens to conceal and carry, the visitor must \ncomply with the restrictions of the State they are in.\n  It has been suggested that somehow this preempts State laws. That is \nnot the case. The restrictions an individual State imposes upon \nconcealed carry laws that have been enacted by that State must be \nfollowed by any individual who has a concealed carry permit in their \nown State. In other words, the individual who travels to that State \nwill be required to live under the laws that are on the books in that \nState.\n  But it does get at an issue which I think many have raised regarding \npeople who travel across State lines all the time--truckdrivers, for \ninstance, who on any given day take a cargo load from one State across \nseveral States in this country and want to be able to protect \nthemselves as they do so. In many cases, they stay overnight in \ntruckstops or pull over for a nap somewhere. Being able to possess a \nfirearm that would enable them to have some level of self-protection \nand to deter crimes from being committed makes a lot of sense.\n  So the amendment is very straightforward and very simple. It is \nsimply tailored to allow individuals to protect themselves while at the \nsame time respecting States rights. So individual States can continue \nto enact restrictions on that, and every State has those. They may be \nplace restrictions, and I think most States--I know my State of South \nDakota has restrictions regarding courthouses, schools, and those sorts \nof places where there are restrictions against concealed carry. Many \nStates have those types of laws which would apply to anyone who has a \nconcealed carry permit in their own State of residence and moves into \nanother State that also has a concealed carry permit law. So they would \nhave to live under the laws of those States. So I want to make very \nclear what the amendment does and doesn't do.\n  I have heard it said here that somehow this is going to be used to \ncircumvent or to preempt State laws. That certainly is not the case. \nBut it does get at the heart of what is a constitutional right in this \ncountry. The second amendment of the Constitution allows people to keep \nand bear arms. That is a constitutional right, and it should not be \ninfringed upon. Like I said before, an individual State can enact \nstatutes that impose restrictions on that. That is something most \nStates have, and every State treats the situation a little differently. \nBut an individual should be able to exercise their second amendment \nconstitutional right and be able to travel through individual States as \nlong as they live by the laws of those States.\n  So that is essentially what the amendment does. It is very simple, \nvery straightforward, and not particularly complicated, as I said. It \ncertainly doesn't do many of the things that have been proposed here on \nthe floor that it does. So I thought it was important to set the record \nstraight.\n  Obviously, we will have a debate about this in the next couple of \ndays. I think we will probably have a debate on the defense amendment \nhere first, and then we will get to this particular issue. But I hope \nmy colleagues, as they listen to that debate, will do their best to \nferret out and to differentiate facts from myth and facts from fiction \nbecause there are a lot of statements that are being made that are not \nconsistent with the facts, and the facts on this are very clear.\n  So I look forward to having the opportunity to make that case and to \nhave this issue debated. As I said before, I had hoped to be able to \noffer this as a second-degree amendment to the hate crimes amendment \nbecause I think it fits very nicely there. As I said before, it ties in \nto the overall theme of protecting potential victims from hate crimes \nby allowing them to have a deterrent. Obviously, a concealed carry \npermit acts as a deterrent and has been proven over time, both in terms \nof the data you look at as well as a lot of anecdotal examples, to have \nthe desired effect, which is to prevent many of these crimes from \noccurring in the first place.\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\n  Because the Democratic leadership filled the tree--in other words, \nprecluded or prevented my offering a second-degree amendment to the \nhate crimes amendment--we are now offering it as a first-degree \namendment and understand completely the importance of moving the \nDefense bill forward. So I think, on Wednesday, after we have had a \ncertain amount of time to debate, we will bring it to a vote, and I \nhope my colleagues would support this. I think it is an amendment that \nhas broad bipartisan support. I already have 22 or 23 cosponsors on \nthis amendment from both sides of the aisle, and I hope that number \ngrows because it is common sense. It has been very effective in many \nStates across the country.\n  We want to use as many tools as we can to deter crime, particularly \nviolent crimes that are committed against individuals in this country. \nIt seems to me it makes sense in having a concealed carry permit law \nthat allows an individual who has a valid concealed carry permit in \ntheir individual State of residence an opportunity to move freely \nacross this country and to have that constitutional right protected.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the balance of my time and look \nforward in the next day or two, as this issue is debated further, to \nhaving a discussion with my colleagues here in the Senate in hopes that \nwe can get this amendment enacted on this bill. So I hope my colleagues \nwill vote for it when the time comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I just want to say how much I \nappreciate the Senator's efforts. It is consistent with the retired law \nenforcement officers bill we passed, as I recall, not long ago that \nallowed them to carry their weapons in other States under certain \ncircumstances. When people are traveling, they many times feel more \nvulnerable and they feel a greater need to protect themselves.\n  I think it is a sound and reasonable approach--limited but \nimportant--and I thank Senator Thune for offering that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, notwithstanding the order of July 16, \n2009, I ask unanimous consent that the Levin-McCain F-22 amendment be \nconsidered on Tuesday, July 21, beginning immediately after the opening \nof the Senate on that day and extending for up to 2 hours, and the vote \non the amendment occur upon the use or yielding back of time, as \nprovided for under the previous order which established the parameters \nof considering the amendment, with the other provisions of the July 16 \norder governing consideration of the Levin-McCain F-22 amendment \nremaining in effect; further, that on Wednesday, July 22, at 9:30 a.m., \nafter opening of the Senate, the Senate then resume consideration of S. \n1390 and the Thune amendment No. 1618, with the time until 12 noon for \ndebate with respect to amendment No. 1618, and the time equally divided \nand controlled between Senators Thune and Durbin or their designees, \nwith no amendments in order to the Thune amendment during its pendency; \nthat adoption of the Thune amendment requires an affirmative 60-vote \nthreshold; further, that if the amendment achieves that threshold, then \nit be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nthat if it does not achieve that threshold, then it be withdrawn; that \nat 12 noon, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of the Senate, on \nTuesday the Senate will convene at 10 a.m.; therefore, the vote on the \nLevin-McCain amendment is expected to occur around 12 noon. That is \nexpected to be the first vote of the day.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have been busy in the Judiciary \nCommittee with the Sotomayor hearing. I have not been able to \nparticipate in the debate over the hate crimes legislation. I want to \nfollow up a little bit more on what I said earlier today. I have an \nobligation to assert a principle that I think is important in Federal \ncriminal law.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years and was very familiar with \nthe jurisdiction issues that are involved in Federal criminal law. We \nneed to do this right. I do not think we have done that right.\n  The bill has basically been made a part of this Defense bill already, \nso in one sense I guess the die is cast, but I will share a few \nthoughts.\n  To repeat briefly, I will quote from the letter from six, I believe, \nof the eight members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that was \nreceived June 16, was sent to the President and members of the \nJudiciary Committee. They said:\n\n       We believe the MSHCPA--\n\n  That is the so-called hate crimes legislation, this is their opinion, \nsix of the eight members--\n\n     will do little good and a great deal of harm. Provisions in \n     the bill ``are very much a violation of the spirit that drove \n     the framers of the Bill of Rights, who never dreamed that \n     federal criminal jurisdiction would be expanded to the point \n     where an astonishing proportion of crimes are now both state \n     and federal offenses. We regard the broad federalization of \n     crime as a menace to civil liberties. There is no better \n     place to draw the line on that process than with a bill that \n     purports to protect civil rights.\n\n  In other words, this is an official commission of the U.S. \nGovernment, appointed by Presidents, and that is what they sent to us.\n  Gail Heriot, who is a member of the commission, testified at our \njudiciary hearing a couple of weeks ago. She testified that:\n\n       The proposed hate crimes legislation, which is being touted \n     as a response to murders, should not have been treated as a \n     mere photo opportunity. It is real legislation with real \n     world consequences--and not all of them are good. A close \n     examination of its consequences, especially its consequences \n     for federalism and double jeopardy protections, is therefore \n     in order.\n       Given the many civil liberties issues that would raise, \n     including the routine potential for double jeopardy \n     prosecutions, this is a step that members of the Senate \n     should think twice before they take.\n\n  Bob Knight, a senior fellow--I guess I am going to show some members, \nliberal lawyers and conservative advocates, also sharing concern over \nthis legislation. I hope my colleagues have not treated these concerns \ntoo lightly.\n  It is hard to vote against legislation that purports to fight hate. \nYou do not want to be somebody defending hate crimes. I certainly do \nnot. Neither do these good people who have expressed their concern.\n  Bob Knight, a senior fellow at the American Civil Rights Union, said \nthis:\n\n       The proposed law, whatever its sponsors' good intentions, \n     is a grave threat to the constitutional guarantee of equal \n     protection under the law. America's legal heritage of judging \n     actions rather than thoughts or beliefs, and it will \n     politicize law enforcement by making some crime victims' \n     cases more important than others.\n       Beyond the obvious unfairness of excluding some groups from \n     enhanced protections, such as the elderly, homeless, veterans \n     and children--\n\n  They are not given enhanced protections of the hate crimes bill--\n\n     the proposed law advances an underlying ambitious agenda to \n     punish individuals and groups that hold traditional values.\n\n  This law:\n\n       . . . lays the groundwork for the concept of ``thought \n     crime,'' in which someone's views or beliefs are \n     criminalized. Violent acts are already illegal and punished \n     under criminal law. This law adds penalties based on thought. \n     In order to prove that the defendant holds particular beliefs \n     that motivated a criminal act, his or her speech, writing, \n     reading materials and organizational memberships would become \n     key evidence.\n\n  Brian Walsh, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \nsays this:\n\n       The criminal justice system is in great need of principled \n     reform . . . this reform should not be driven by some \n     partisan politics. Unfortunately, the HCPA fails to measure \n     up to this standard and would substantially undermine \n     constitutional federalism and the high regard in which the \n     American public should hold Federal criminal law.\n\n  The three main problems with this amendment are that:\n\n     . . . the Act's new ``hate crimes'' offenses are far broader \n     and more amorphous than any properly defined criminal offense \n     should be--\n\n  I agree with that, parenthetically. He goes on to say:\n\n     --and they thus invite prosecutorial abuse, politically \n     motivated prosecutions, and related injustices. The Act's \n     ``hate crimes'' offenses violate constitutional federalism by \n     asserting Federal law-enforcement power to police truly local \n     conduct over which the Constitution has reserved sole \n     authority to the 50 states. The Act's ``hate crimes'' \n     offenses would be counterproductive, for nearly all States \n     have--tough ``hate crimes'' laws\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\n     and the violent conduct underlying the Act's ``hate crimes'' \n     offenses has always been criminalized in all 50 states.\n\n  Nat Hentoff is a famous civil rights and libertarian attorney, a \nwriter well known in the country as being a passionate advocate for \ncivil liberties from an objective, I would say, point of view. He has \nrespect from both conservatives and liberals, but I guess his \nbackground has mostly been on a more liberal approach to law.\n  He starts off saying:\n\n       Why is the press remaining mostly silent about the so-\n     called ``hate crimes law'' that passed the House on April 29? \n     The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act passed in \n     a 249-175 vote--17 Republicans joined with 231 Democrats. \n     These Democrats should have been tested on their knowledge of \n     the First Amendment, equal protection of the laws . . . and \n     the prohibition of double jeopardy. . . . No American can be \n     prosecuted twice for the same crime or offense. If they had \n     been, they would have known that this proposal, now headed \n     for a Senate vote-- violates all these constitutional \n     provisions.\n       This bill would make it a federal crime to willfully cause \n     bodily injury--or try to--because of the victim's actual or \n     perceived ``race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, gender identity or disability''--as \n     explained on the White House Web Site, signaling the \n     president's approval. A defendant convicted on these grounds \n     would be charged with a ``hate crime'' in addition to the \n     original crime and would get extra prison time.\n       The extra punishment applies only to these ``protected \n     classes.''\n\n  He quotes a Denver, CO criminal defense lawyer:\n\n       As Denver criminal defense lawyer Robert J. Corry Jr. asked \n     . . . ``Isn't every criminal act that harms a person a hate \n     crime?'' Then, regarding a Colorado ``hate crime'' law, one \n     of 45 such state laws, Corry wrote:\n       ``When a Colorado gang engaged in an initiation ritual \n     specifically seeking out a `white woman' to rape, the Boulder \n     prosecutor declined to pursue ``hate crime'' charges. She was \n     not enough of one of its protected classes.''\n       Corry adds that the State ``hate crime'' law--like the \n     newly expanded House of Representatives Federal bill--``does \n     not apply equally,'' as the 14th amendment requires, \n     essentially instead:\n       ``Criminalizing only politically incorrect thoughts \n     directed against politically incorrect victim categories.''\n\n  Hentoff concluded:\n\n       Whether you're Republican or Democrat, think hard about \n     what Corry adds:\n       ``A government powerful enough to pick and choose which \n     thoughts to prosecute is a government too powerful.''\n\n  David Rittgers of the CATO Institute, a libertarian group, said this:\n\n       The Federal hate crimes being considered in the Senate \n     undermines the rule of law and shows casual disregard, if not \n     outright hostility, for the principles of limited government \n     and equality under the law. The bill Federalizes violent acts \n     against victims by reason of their actual or perceived race, \n     color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, \n     gender identity or disability.\n       Never mind that these acts are already prosecuted by the \n     states--45 of which have their own hate crime laws--and that \n     violent crimes of this nature are universally perceived as an \n     affront to justice. Matthew Shepard, a gay man brutally \n     killed in Wyoming, has provided one of the rallying cries for \n     passage of this legislation. His killers both received two \n     consecutive life sentences from a state court. James Byrd, \n     Jr., the African-American man dragged to death behind a truck \n     in Texas, is cited as another reason to pass the law. His \n     killers received death sentences or life imprisonment.\n       The federal government would also be authorized to \n     prosecute whenever ``the verdict or sentence obtained \n     pursuant to State charges left demonstratively unvindicated \n     the Federal interest in eradicating bias-related violence.'' \n     While this doesn't violate the letter of the Supreme Court's \n     double jeopardy jurisprudence--the federal and state \n     governments are considered separate sovereigns--it certainly \n     violates its spirit.\n\n  The National Religious Broadcasters write they are opposed to the \nconcept as well as the current legislative permutations of the so-\ncalled ``hate crimes.'' This legislation takes any conduct that is \nviewed as a threat to homosexuals or bisexuals or a threat to persons \nwho want to immunize their religion from public debate and turns that \nthreat or perceived threat into a species of criminal felony. As a \nconsequence, this legislation will inevitably stifle the free exercise \nof religion and freedom of speech, and brings with it the very real \nlikelihood of abusive prosecutions. Federal ``hate crimes'' laws also \nignore the fact that the underlying core offense, the causing of bodily \ninjury to another, is already criminalized in all 50 states.\n  The Research Council says this:\n\n       Hate crimes laws force the courts to guess the thoughts and \n     beliefs which lie behind a crime, instead of looking at the \n     crime itself.\n\n  The Family Research Council believes that all crimes should be \nprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and that every violent \ncrime has some form of hate behind it. All around the country, crimes \nare being prosecuted in the State justice systems. American justice is \nbeing done. There is simply no need for a Federal hate crimes law.\n  Violent attacks upon people or property are already illegal, \nregardless of the motive behind them. With hate crime laws, however, \npeople are essentially given one penalty for the action they engage in \nand an additional penalty for the particular and highly selective \nattitudes and thoughts that motivated these actions.\n  Motive-based analysis and intent-based analysis are not the same \nthing. For example, with the crime of manslaughter, intent-based \nanalysis looks at whether the perpetrator intended the result. Hate \ncrime legislation takes into account what the offender thinks, feels, \nor believes about the victim regardless of whether the perpetrator \nintended the result. This is why hate crimes may be referred to as \n``thought crimes.''\n  The Traditional Values Coalition says:\n\n       The so-called hate crimes bill will be used to lay the \n     legal foundation and framework to investigate and prosecute \n     and persecute pastors, business owners, Bible teachers, \n     Sunday School teachers, youth leaders, Christian counselors, \n     religious broadcasters, and anyone else whose actions are \n     based upon and reflect the truths found in the Bible, which \n     have been protected by the first amendment.\n\n  That is not accurate? Well, they are concerned about that. And they \nobject to the legislation.\n  The Concerned Women for America note that:\n\n       The legislation would violate genuine constitutional rights \n     in an attempt to address a nonissue, create a caste system of \n     victims, violate the spirit of the Double Jeopardy Clause of \n     the Constitution, and unintentionally extend privileges to \n     individuals who engage in illegal sexual acts even against \n     children.\n\n  I would share those thoughts and say that this is why this \nlegislation has been controversial. The predicate for this legislation \nis the interstate commerce tag that is very weak. The Supreme Court has \nalready found several Federal statues do not have sufficient interstate \nnexus to justify prosecuting a crime in Federal court.\n  I would say if a few people walk out in the pasture and one finds a \nrock and murders a person, as a Federal prosecutor for 15 years I will \ntell you, there is no jurisdiction federally to try and prosecute that \ncase. It is a criminal case in the State court only. And to make it a \nFederal case, you have to have some sort of peg to hang your hat on, so \nto speak.\n  In that case, I do not think there is any. But if you are on a \nrailroad train and you are traveling and you are in interstate \ncommerce, you murder someone, that can be a Federal crime. If you steal \nfrom an interstate shipment, that can be a Federal crime. If you murder \na postman, that is a Federal crime--or a Federal civil servant, and so \nforth. Those are Federal crimes. But normal murder, rape, robbery, \ntheft, that occur by the tens of thousands every day all over America \nare not Federal crimes. They are not prosecutable in Federal court.\n  The very small number of FBI agents, compared to the massive numbers \nof police and sheriffs, deputies, and State law enforcement officers is \nsuch that there is no way they can ever begin to prosecute or \ninvestigate these crimes. They have to focus on those crimes that are \nuniquely Federal, vindicate a uniquely Federal interest.\n  With regard to the Civil Rights Act that was passed in the 1960s, it \nhas some similarities, although it is more tightly written.\n  I will conclude with these thoughts: There was a demonstrable record \nof failure to prosecute violations of civil rights against African \nAmericans in the South, sad to say, and in other places in this \ncountry. It appeared that local law enforcement was ineffective, \nsometimes unwilling, to vindicate those rights, and so the Civil Rights \nAct said: If you are going to school or a legal activity at the city or \ncounty or Federal Government or voting and you are interfered with, \nthat can be a Federal offense.\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\n  There was a clear record to justify the need for Federal involvement \nin those cases. And most of those cases, I think virtually all, have \nbeen upheld as being sufficiently tied to interstate commerce to be a \nlegitimate Federal crime to prosecute.\n  We asked the Attorney General at a hearing recently, can he name any \ncases? He did not name a single one. But he said in his statement there \nwere four. After the hearing we submitted questions to the Attorney \nGeneral: Did he have any cases to show that these prosecutions are not \nbeing effectively prosecuted locally?\n  He stood by the four. That is all we ever got over a period, I think, \nof 5 years. At least that is what I asked him for. And the four cases \nwere very insubstantial. In each one of the four cases prosecutions \nwere initiated. I think in all but one convictions were obtained.\n  Some people were not happy with the results of the case, and they \nwould have liked the Federal Government to take it over and prosecute \nit again. But as I said, there are tens of thousands of cases \nprosecuted every day, and many victims in those cases felt that the \noutcome of the case was not sufficient. They would like also for the \nFederal Government to prosecute it again. But they might not have been \nin these ``special classes'' that got this ``special benefit'' in this \nbill.\n  Do you see then what it is all about? It is basically saying that the \nFederal Government sits up and hovers above the criminal justice \nsystem, and it can decide whenever, based on the length of the \nchancellor's foot, I suppose, when a case has not effectively resulted \nin justice.\n  They said in their answer, they want to make sure that there is \njustice every time. That is a pretty high goal, I have got to tell you, \nespecially when people might not agree. Juries make decisions. I hope \nwe in this Congress will understand the huge responsibility we have to \nthe historic concept that crimes of a local nature should be prosecuted \nlocally, and that the Federal Government does not need to be involved \nin everything to try to ensure perfect justice.\n  Indeed, it is not involved in every case and it never has been. It \nshould not be. I wanted to make these quotes a part of the Record, and \ncall on the Members of the Senate as we go forward in the future to \nmake sure that the legislation we pass is consistent with our heritage, \nwhich understands that the Federal Government does not have a general \ncriminal power, has only narrow limited enumerated power to make crimes \nFederal, and we ought not overreach and create a situation in which, \naccording to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in their letter to us: \nEvery single rape would be a Federal crime because the action would \nhave been carried out as a result of the gender of the person being \nassaulted.\n  Ms. Heriot said she had talked with the Department of Justice in \nprevious years about this, before she was on the Commission, and they \nrefused to narrow the language because they wanted that broader \nlanguage.\n  I think that is too broad. This bill is too amorphous and too broad \nand should not become law.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. HAGAN pertaining to the introduction of S. 1473 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it reflects well upon this body that the \nSenate late last week voted to include the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act of 2009 as an amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill with a strong bipartisan vote. This important legislation has also \npassed the Senate in 2007, 2004, 2000, and 1999. I am hopeful and \noptimistic that this time it will make it to the President's desk and \nbe signed into law.\n  This legislation will help to address the serious and growing problem \nof hate crimes. The recent tragic events at the Holocaust Museum, on \ntop of many other recent hateful and devastating acts, have made clear \nthat these vicious crimes continue to haunt our country. This \nbipartisan bill is carefully designed to help law enforcement most \neffectively respond to this problem. It has been stalled for far too \nlong. The Senate's action last week was the right step and long \noverdue.\n  I thank Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, and the other bipartisan \ncosponsors for their support. I particularly thank Senator Ted Kennedy, \nfor whom this important civil rights measure has long been a priority, \nand I commend him for his steadfast leadership over the last decade in \nworking to expand our Federal hate crimes laws.\n  I wish he could have been here for the vote on Thursday, but I know \nhe was proud of what the Senate did. I thank the many staff members who \nhelped with this effort--Roscoe Jones, Joe Thomas, Elise Burditt, Leila \nGeorge-Wheeler, Matt Smith, Noah Bookbinder, Kristine Lucius, and Bruce \nCohen on my staff--as well as the staff for Senator Kennedy--Christine \nLeonard and Ty Cobb--who worked so hard on this legislation.\n  I appreciate that Republicans were willing to come to an agreement to \nlet this hate crimes amendment move forward. As part of that agreement, \ntoday we vote on several additional related amendments from Senator \nSessions.\n  Senator Sessions proposed an amendment creating a new criminal \nstatute for attacks against U.S. servicemembers. While servicemembers \nare already appropriately covered by strong legal protections, I agree \nwith the purpose of this amendment, and I appreciate Senator Sessions' \nwillingness to work with us to improve it. I will support this \namendment.\n  Senator Sessions was also willing to work with us on another \namendment of his which would require that all hate crimes prosecutions \nbe undertaken pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the Attorney \nGeneral. With the improvements that we worked out, I am happy to \nsupport this amendment as well.\n  Finally, Senator Sessions proposed an amendment to apply the death \npenalty to a broad swath of hate crimes. This amendment, as offered, \nwould have applied the death penalty even to cases involving offenses \nlike attempted kidnapping where there was no intent to kill any person. \nSuch a broad application would have clearly violated the Constitution \nas set out in ruling Supreme Court precedent.\n  With regard to the death penalty, the Supreme Court recently held \nthat, ``As it relates to crimes against individuals, . . . the death \npenalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was \nnot taken.''\n  Whether or not Senators agree with that sentiment, we should not \npurposefully pass legislation that we know to be unconstitutional. As a \nresult of my criticism, I understand that Senator Sessions will be \nmodifying his amendment, and I appreciate that.\n  Adding an expansive death penalty provision to hate crime statutes \nwould also add new costs to enforcement since death penalty cases are \nconsistently far more expensive and difficult for the government to \nlitigate. Those increased costs could reduce the number of important \nhate crime investigations and prosecutions the government could \nconduct.\n  We should be facilitating more hate crime investigations and \nprosecutions, not restricting the number the government can bring. I \nshould also note that many proponents of hate crimes legislation, \nparticularly in the House, as well as other influential House Members, \nstrongly oppose the death penalty.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has written us to oppose \nthis death penalty amendment, and I know several of my fellow Senators \nshare my concerns with this amendment.\n  Senator Kennedy has proposed a further amendment which would add \nimportant guidelines about when the death penalty could be used. I \nsupport this commonsense measure.\n  I hope all Senators will join me in doing everything we can to ensure \nthat effective, meaningful hate crimes legislation can be signed into \nlaw this summer.\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express \nmy disappointment that the Senate failed to take advantage of an \nopportunity to debunk a false argument against the Matthew Shephard \nHate Crimes Prevention Act. If it were up to me, the debate never would \nhave gone in this direction, but since it has I have tried to do my \nbest to address the concern--though I believe it to be unfounded--that \nthis legislation protects ``pedophiles.''\n  Some, including some constituents of mine in Nebraska, are concerned \nthat a term used in this legislation, ``sexual orientation,'' could be \ninterpreted as including ``pedophiles.'' This is obviously not the \nintent of the bill, nor is it possible that any of the categories \nprotected by the bill could be read to include pedophiles. In short, \nnothing in this legislation is intended, nor can it be construed, to \nprotect pedophiles.\n  The Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer in the United \nStates, has rejected the argument that this bill covers pedophiles. In \nfact, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, \nexplicitly asked Attorney General Eric E. Holder a question for the \nrecord of the Judiciary Committee's hearing on this bill, which makes \nclear that the bill, as written, could not possibly be read to include \npedophiles. As the Attorney General stated:\n\n       Proposed U.S.C. Sec.  249(a)(2) would cover violent crimes \n     motivated by bias against the ``actual or perceived religion, \n     national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, \n     or disability of any person.'' This legislation would only \n     cover groups falling under these categories. The Department \n     [of Justice] does not believe that any group falling under \n     these categories should be excluded. The Department does not \n     believe that any of the listed categories could possibly be \n     read to include pedophiles, and therefore we do not believe \n     an amendment to exclude pedophiles is necessary.\n\n  Despite this assurance, my colleague from South Carolina offered just \nsuch an amendment, and I signed on as a cosponsor to express \nsensitivity to the concern he raises, even though I do not believe this \nlegislation protects pedophiles in any way.\n  Existing Federal law, codified at 28 U.S.C Sec.  534 defines sexual \norientation as consensual homosexuality or heterosexuality. A similar \ndefinition can be found in any dictionary of the English language. That \nand nothing more is what we are addressing in this bill.\n  I might add that in my view to claim that this law could somehow be \nused to protect pedophiles shows a lack of confidence in and respect \nfor local law enforcement, and the groups, such as the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, and \nthe National District Attorneys Association, which are strongly \nsupporting this bill and asking us to pass this legislation to help \nthem do their jobs in investigating and prosecuting these heinous \ncrimes.\n  In order for the hate crimes law to be used in the manner some groups \nclaim it could, a chief of police or local sheriff would have to \ndecide, in conjunction with the county attorney or district attorney, \nthat it was in their best interest and the best interest of the \ncommunity to bring such a prosecution, in contravention of existing \nFederal laws that protect children from predators. Federal law \nenforcement, which serves as a backstop to local efforts under this \nbill, would also not use the law in this way because the Department of \nJustice has already stated their policy that this legislation does not \nprotect pedophiles. As I quoted above, the Attorney General, the \nNation's top law enforcement official, made the Department's policy \ncrystal clear in Congressional testimony: ``the Department does not \nbelieve that any of the listed categories could possibly be read to \ninclude pedophiles.''\n  We can have an honest debate about this bill. I have heard several \narguments of reasons why this bill should be opposed, and I appreciate \nand respect the concerns which underlie those arguments. However, I \nfeel the need to reaffirm that in no way is this bill intended to, or \ncan be construed as, protecting pedophiles.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the July 15, \n2009, letter from Attorney General Holder to Senator McConnell and \nmyself be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: I understand that S. 909, \n     the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, is now before \n     the Senate in the form of an amendment to pending \n     legislation. On behalf of the Administration, I strongly urge \n     the Senate to approve this vital legislation.\n       As I stated in testimony before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on June 25, hate crimes victimize not only \n     individuals, but entire communities. Perpetrators of hate \n     crimes seek to deny the humanity we all share, regardless of \n     the color of our skin, the God to whom we pray, or whom we \n     choose to love.\n       Bias-motivated acts of violence divide our communities, \n     intimidate our most vulnerable citizens, and damage our \n     collective spirit. The FBI reported 7,624 hate crime \n     incidents in 2007, the latest year for which the FBI has \n     compiled such data. Recent numbers also suggest that hate \n     crimes against certain groups, such as individuals of \n     Hispanic national origin, are on the rise. Between 1998 and \n     2007, more than 77,000 hate crime incidents were reported to \n     the FBI. That is nearly one hate crime every hour of every \n     day over the span of a decade.\n       Most hate crimes in the United States are investigated and \n     prosecuted by our partners in state, local, and tribal law \n     enforcement, and this legislation will not change that \n     reality. Rather, this bill will give law enforcement \n     authorities at all levels the tools they need to effectively \n     investigate, prosecute and deter bias-motivated violence. \n     First, it will enable the Department of Justice to provide \n     our non-federal partners with technical, forensic, \n     prosecutorial, and financial assistance to bolster their hate \n     crimes enforcement efforts. Second, it will eliminate the \n     antiquated and burdensome requirement under existing Federal \n     law that prosecutors prove that a hate crime was motivated by \n     a victim's participation in one of six enumerated federally \n     protected activities. Third, it will expand coverage beyond \n     violent acts motivated by actual or perceived race, color, \n     religion, or national origin to those motivated by actual or \n     perceived gender, disability, sexual orientation and gender \n     identity.\n       Although local law enforcement agencies will continue to \n     play the primary role in the investigation and prosecution of \n     hate crimes, federal jurisdiction is a necessary backstop. \n     Federal resources may be better suited to address crimes \n     involving multiple jurisdictions, and there may be times when \n     local authorities request Federal involvement.\n       There also may be rare circumstances in which local \n     officials are unable or unwilling to bring appropriate \n     charges, or when prosecutions, even when successful, do not \n     fully serve the interests of justice. At the same time, there \n     are safeguards, both in the legislation and in the \n     Department's internal policies, to ensure that crimes will be \n     prosecuted at the Federal level only when necessary to \n     achieve justice in a particular case.\n       Some have raised concerns that Congress lacks the \n     constitutional authority to enact this legislation, as well \n     as concerns that it could infringe on First Amendment rights. \n     The Department addressed these issues at length in a June 23, \n     2009, views letter to Senator Edward Kennedy. As we explain \n     in that letter, the legislation is constitutional and would \n     not infringe on First Amendment rights because it would \n     criminalize no speech or association, but only bias-motivated \n     violent acts resulting in bodily injury (or attempts to \n     commit such violent acts). Finally, the legislation is \n     carefully tailored to address violence targeting members of \n     communities that have suffered a long history of bias and \n     prejudice.\n       This Administration strongly supports S. 909, the Matthew \n     Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and I urge its passage \n     without further delay. Now is the time to provide justice to \n     victims of bias-motivated violence and to redouble our \n     efforts to protect our communities from heinous acts of \n     violence based on bigotry and prejudice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

When \nthe Apollo 11 crew touched down in the Sea of Tranquility, our country \ncheered more than just a stunning success for science.\n  When 40 years ago tonight, man first set foot on another world, we \ncelebrated the fact that those first men were Americans.\n  On the evening of July 20, 1969, millions of Americans watched with \nWalter Cronkite, who passed away just 3 days ago. As Armstrong leaped \noff the ladder, the anchorman took care to note that the astronaut was \na ``38-year-old American.'' Because he was an American--a boy scout \nfrom Ohio and a pilot in our Navy--we all were proud.\n  We were proud that an American vehicle was the first manned \nspacecraft to make it to the Moon's surface, that an American's \nfootprint was the first to be pressed upon it, and that our American \nflag was the first to be planted within it. America was moving mankind \nforward, and we were proud to be leaders.\n  But the story of the journey we celebrate today did not begin on the \nbreathtaking night when the Eagle landed.\n  It began years before: in the imaginations of Americans everywhere, \nin laboratories and hangars in Florida and Texas, and in a stadium in \nHouston where President Kennedy told us that we will choose to reach \nthe Moon within the decade and do other great things, ``not because \nthey are easy, but because they are hard . . . because that challenge \nis one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to \npostpone.''\n  We now must be willing to accept today's challenges. We must be \nwilling to accept the challenge of making it easier to live a healthy \nlife in America. We must be unwilling to postpone our responsibility to \nfix what is broken.\n  We now have a chance to be proud once again. We have the chance to \nlead once again, and for our entire Nation to again achieve dramatic \ngoals, like making health care more affordable, more stable and more \nsecure.\n  America is the last major industrialized nation on the planet that \nrefuses to ensure all of its citizens can get health care. In the \ngreatest country and the largest economy the world has ever seen, \nhardworking Americans live in fear as they live one accident, one \nillness, or one pink slip away from losing their health coverage.\n  How much longer can the country that led the way to space be content \nto stay in last place? How much longer can we sit this one out? How \nmuch longer can we say no?\n  Our health care system is not healthy. The cost of doing nothing is \ntoo high, and not acting is not an option.\n  The story of the Moon landing did not begin with that one small step \nfor a man, and it did not end there either. President Reagan credited \nour willingness to reach for new heights with helping our country \n``recapture its spirit of vitality and confidence.'' He pointed to the \nspace program as proof that ``the pioneer spirit still flourishes in \nAmerica.''\n  Today that spirit must prevail over partisan passions. If we confront \nthis crisis together, we can once again restore the vitality and \nconfidence of America, and of all Americans.\n  Forty years ago, no political party had a monopoly on the lunar \nlanding. A conservative who looked to the heavens took no less pride in \nour achievement than did a liberal. It was not a Republican \naccomplishment or a Democratic accomplishment. It was an American \naccomplishment.\n  As we said at the beginning of this year, our strong preference is to \nfix health care as one collaborative Congress, not as two competing \nparties. As we have said throughout this debate, we will continue to \nwork with the other side in good faith and we want to pass a bipartisan \nbill.\n  I remain optimistic that both Republicans and Democrats recognize how \nurgent this is. The health of our citizens and our economy are at \nstake, and neither will be able to recover if we are unwilling to \naccept this challenge.\n  When we make it easier for people to stay healthy--when we make it \neasier for people to afford to care for their loved ones--when we \nchoose to do what is right, what is necessary and what is overdue--not \nbecause it is easy, but because it is hard--we will once again proudly \nrejoice together, as Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/20/senate-section/article/S7697-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7697-S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VETERANS VOTING SUPPORT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senators \nFeinstein and Kerr and others to reintroduce the Veterans Voting \nSupport Act. This legislation will enable the Nation to better preserve \nand protect the fundamental right to vote for veterans in facilities \noperated by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Our men and women in \nuniform have risked their lives to serve our country and spread \ndemocracy around the globe. We must do all we can to protect their \nright to participate in the democratic process when they return home.\n  When we introduced this legislation last Congress, I had hoped that \nit could be signed into law before last year's historic election. \nMillions of Americans went to the polls last November and yet far too \nmany of our wounded warriors were left behind. That is wrong, and I \nhope the Senate will consider this important legislation to remedy the \ndisenfranchisement of our disabled veterans. Senators Feinstein and \nKerry, the respective Chairpersons of the Rules and Foreign Relations \nCommittees, have been leaders on this important issue.\n  Today, veterans of the armed services who reside in a VA facilities \nface a voting rights crisis. Far too often in recent years, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs has neglected to assist veterans with \nvoting, or to allow nonpartisan groups access to VA facilities to \nregister voters. Until last year, for example, the VA's national policy \nwas silent on whether it could provide support to wounded warriors \nseeking to vote. There have also been reports that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs may have even prohibited its own staff from providing \nvoter assistance to veterans in VA hospitals. In addition, since 2004, \nreports indicate that the VA has often sided in Federal court against \nallowing nonprofit voter registration organizations access to VA run \nfacilities.\n  I welcome the recent strides the Department of Veterans Affairs has \nmade to correct its flawed policies, but it has not gone far enough. I \nam glad that last year, the Department changed its policy from a \nblanket prohibition against voter registration efforts to one that \nwould permit its patients to register to vote. That change, however, \nwas only a first step. We need legislative action to ensure that these \nchanges are permanent and complete. For example, I remain concerned \nthat the VA's voter registration policy stops short of mandating that \nVA facilities offer disabled veterans a chance to register to vote. To \nparaphrase Paul Sullivan, the Executive Director of Veterans for Common \nSense, the new policy directive only changed the Department from being \nin active opposition to veterans' voter registration to passively \nsupporting it. It is common sense that the Department of Veteran \nAffairs should make services available to wounded veterans who reside \nin VA facilities and yet face hardships in traveling off campus to \nregister to vote. This legislation will ensure that VA facilities have \nan affirmative duty to provide our wounded warriors with access to, and \nassistance with, voter registration materials in the same way they help \nveterans fill out other forms.\n  The Veterans Voting Support Act we introduce today would also require \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to provide voter registration forms \nto veterans whenever they enroll in, or make changes to, their status \nunder the VA\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\nhealth care system. It would also require the VA to provide assistance \nto veterans who wish to file absentee ballots. In addition, the bill \nwould require facilities to allow access for nonpartisan voter \nassistance organizations, subject to reasonable time, place, and manner \nrestrictions. To ensure accountability and transparency, the bill also \nprovides certain reporting requirements on the Department of Veteran \nAffairs. This legislation has the support of voting rights and veterans \ngroups, including the Brennan Center for Justice and Veterans for \nCommon Sense.\n  I believe it is essential for the Nation to do everything possible to \nhonor our veterans. Ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as \ninterventions across the globe, means more and more men and women are \ncoming home as veterans. These brave men and women must know that the \ncountry will honor their sacrifice when they return. Recognizing their \nservice not only means paying continual tribute through services on \nsuch holidays as Memorial Day and Veterans Day. It also means ensuring \nthat our veterans in Vermont and across the country have the ability to \nfully participate in the democratic process. This is not a Republican \nor Democrat issue it is an American issue. We should all be able to \nagree that Americans who have ventured into harm's way to defend our \nvalues and spread democracy abroad must also have full enjoyment of \nthose freedoms here at home.\n  The disabled veterans of the Nation have given extraordinary service \nto our country and have advanced democracy around the globe. Enactment \nof the Veterans Voting Support Act is the very least we owe our citizen \nsoldiers for their many sacrifices on our behalf. I urge all Senators \nto support the Veterans Voting Support Act and help us to enact this \ncritical measure into law before next November's midterm elections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/20/senate-section/article/S7698-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING SENATOR COLEMAN\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my distinguished \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Norm Coleman.\n  I worked with Senator Coleman since 2002 when he was elected U.S. \nSenator of Minnesota. Norm is a man of integrity and patriotism. He has \ndedicated most of his adult life to serve the people of Minnesota. \nWhile he served in the Minnesota Attorney General's Office for a large \nportion of his career and eventually became solicitor general, he is \nhighly praised in the city of St. Paul for his successes as mayor. His \nvision and execution to revitalize the city of St. Paul became a \nbenchmark for success in local governing. Because of his \naccomplishments as mayor, he gained higher approval ratings in \nMinnesota than most politicians in Washington ever receive in their \nentire careers.\n  During his tenure as U.S. Senator, Norm was a leader in strengthening \nour homeland security and national defense. He consistently supported \nand sponsored measures that provide our troops with the important tools \nthey need to defend our freedoms overseas and fought to make sure they \nreceive the proper care and services as they return home. Additionally, \nNorm remained a strong voice for alternative fuels and energy \nindependence. The Commonwealth of Kentucky and I are thankful for his \ndiligence in promoting clean energy.\n  He always fought for what he believes is best for Minnesotans and for \nAmerica. While we are sad to see him go here in the Senate, we are \ngrateful for his contributions. I am honored to know him and to have \nworked with him. I wish his wife Laurie, his children, Jake and Sarah, \nand him the best in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/20/senate-section/article/S7698-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/20/senate-section/article/S7698-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/20/senate-section/article/S7698-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:41 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 129.

1472. A bill to establish a section within the Criminal Division \nof the Department of Justice to enforce human rights laws, to make \ntechnical and conforming amendments to criminal and immigration laws \npertaining to human rights violations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Human \nRights Enforcement Act of 2009, which I am introducing today. This \nnarrowly-tailored, bipartisan legislation would make it easier for the \nJustice Department to hold accountable human rights abusers who seek \nsafe haven in our country.\n  I would like to thank the lead Republican cosponsor of the Human \nRights Enforcement Act, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. This bill is a \nproduct of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Human Rights and \nthe Law. I am the chairman of this subcommittee and Senator Coburn is \nits ranking member.\n  The end of the last century was marked by horrific human rights \nabuses in places such as Bosnia and Rwanda. The early years of this \ncentury have seen ongoing atrocities being committed in, among other \nplaces, Darfur and Burma.\n  While a growing number of perpetrators of human rights abuses have \nbeen held accountable in international, hybrid and state tribunals, a \nmuch larger number have escaped accountability for their crimes. Some \nof these human rights violators have fled to the U.S.\n  How we as a country treat suspected perpetrators of serious human \nrights abuses in the U.S. sends an important message to the world about \nour commitment to human rights and the rule of law. It also signals to \nperpetrators of human rights abuses considering seeking refuge in the \nU.S. what treatment they can expect to receive.\n  The U.S. has been a leader in holding the perpetrators of serious \nhuman rights violations accountable for their crimes. Over 60 years \nago, following the Holocaust, we led the efforts to prosecute Nazi \nperpetrators at the Nuremberg trials. We have also supported the \nprosecution of human rights crimes before the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal \nfor Rwanda, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n  In some circumstances, the U.S. Government has also made valiant \nefforts to hold accountable human rights violators who have found safe \nhaven in our country, but more must be done. Federal law enforcement \nreportedly has over 1,000 open cases involving suspected perpetrators \nof serious human rights abuses from almost 90 countries who are now in \nthe U.S. While no one knows the total number of human rights abusers \nliving in the U.S., the number of open cases presumably represents only \na small portion of the total number of such perpetrators.\n  In the last Congress, the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law \nheld hearings which identified loopholes in the law that hinder \neffective human rights enforcement. In order to close some of these \nloopholes and make it easier to prosecute human rights abuses, Senator \nCoburn and I introduced the Genocide Accountability Act, the Child \nSoldiers Accountability Act and the Trafficking in Persons Act, \nlegislation passed unanimously by Congress and signed into law by \nPresident George W. Bush that denies safe haven in the United States to \nperpetrators of genocide, child soldier recruitment and use, and human \ntrafficking.\n\n  We also examined the U.S. Government agencies which bear \nresponsibility for investigating human rights abusers and how to \nincrease the likelihood that human rights violators will be held \naccountable.\n  There are two offices within the Justice Department that investigate \nand prosecute suspected human rights abusers. The Office of Special \nInvestigations, established by Attorney General Richard Civiletti in \n1979, was assigned:\n\n       [T]he primary responsibility for detecting, investigating, \n     and, where appropriate, taking legal action to deport, \n     denaturalize, or prosecute any individual who was admitted as \n     an alien into or became a naturalized citizen of the United \n     States and who has assisted the Nazis by persecuting any \n     person because of race, religion, national origin, or \n     political opinion.\n\n  Over the years, the Office of Special Investigations, also known as \nOSI, has led the way in investigating, denaturalizing and removing \nWorld War II-era participants in genocide and other Nazi crimes. I want \nto commend OSI for its outstanding work tracking down and bringing to \njustice Nazi war criminals who have found safe haven in our country. \nSince 1979, OSI has successfully prosecuted 107 Nazis.\n  Just this year, OSI has succeeded in deporting two Nazi war \ncriminals. Josias Kumpf, who immigrated to the United States in 1956 \nand lived in Racine, Wisconsin, was a guard at the Sachsenhausen \nConcentration Camp in Germany and the Trawniki Labor Camp in Nazi-\noccupied Poland. Kumpf allegedly participated in the extermination of \n8,000 Jews in one day at the Trawniki camp. OSI Director Eli Rosenbaum \nsaid, ``The removal of Josias Kumpf to Austria has achieved a \nsignificant measure of justice on behalf of the victims of Nazi \ninhumanity and it reflects the unswerving commitment of the U.S. \ngovernment to continuing the quest for justice.''\n  OSI also deported John Demjanjuk to Germany, where last week he was \ncharged with involvement in the murder of 27,900 people at the Sobibor \nextermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Demjanjuk came to the \nUnited States in 1952 and lived in Seven Hills, Ohio. During World War \nII, Demjanjuk allegedly served as a guard at a number of Nazi \nconcentration camps. Lanny Breuer, the Assistant Attorney General of \nthe Criminal Division, said, ``The removal to Germany of John Demjanjuk \nis an historic moment in the federal government's efforts to bring Nazi \nwar criminals to justice. Mr. Demjanjuk, a confirmed former Nazi death \ncamp guard, denied to thousands the very freedoms he enjoyed for far \ntoo long in the United States.''\n  Due to OSI's outstanding work, the U.S. is the only country in the \nworld to receive an ``A'' rating from the Simon Wiesenthal Center for \nbringing Nazi war criminals to justice. I especially want to commend \nEli Rosenbaum, who has worked at OSI for more than two decades and has \nbeen OSI's director since 1995. OSI's success is due in large measure \nto Mr. Rosenbaum's leadership and personal dedication to holding Nazi \nperpetrators accountable.\n\n  In 2004, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act further \nstrengthened the Office of Special Investigations by statutorily \nauthorizing it and expanding its jurisdiction to include serious human \nrights crimes committed after World War II.\n  The Domestic Security Section, which was established more recently, \nseeks to investigate and prosecute major human rights violators and has \njurisdiction over the criminal laws relating to torture, genocide, war \ncrimes, the use or recruitment of child soldiers, and other atrocities. \nIn 2008, the Domestic Security Section and the United States Attorney's \nOffice for the Southern District of Florida obtained the first federal \nconviction for torture against Chuckie Taylor, son of former\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nLiberian president Charles Taylor, for committing torture in Liberia \nwhen he served as the head of the Anti-Terrorist Unit. Taylor and other \nAnti-Terrorist Unit members engaged in horrific acts of torture, \nincluding shocking victims with an electric device and burning victims \nwith molten plastic, lit cigarettes, scalding water, candle wax and an \niron. Then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey said, ``Today's conviction \nprovides a measure of justice to those who were victimized by the \nreprehensible acts of Charles Taylor Jr. and his associates. It sends a \npowerful message to human rights violators around the world that, when \nwe can, we will hold them fully accountable for their crimes.''\n  I commend the Office of Special Investigations and the Domestic \nSecurity Section for their successes in holding human rights abusers \naccountable.\n  The Human Rights Enforcement Act would seek to build on this \nimportant work by creating a new office in the Criminal Division that \nwould focus exclusively on enforcing human rights laws. My bill would \ncombine the Office of Special Investigations, which has significant \nexperience in investigating and denaturalizing human rights abusers, \nwith the Domestic Security Section, which has broad jurisdiction over \nhuman rights crimes. Consolidating these two sections would allow \nlimited law enforcement resources to be used more effectively and \nensure that one section in the Justice Department has the necessary \nexpertise and jurisdiction to investigate and, where appropriate, \nprosecute, denaturalize or deport perpetrators of serious human rights \ncrimes.\n  The Human Rights Enforcement Act also includes a number of technical \nan conforming amendments, including: technical changes to the criminal \nlaw on genocide, 18 U.S.C. 1091, that the Justice Department requested \nin 2007 to make it easier to prosecute perpetrators of genocide; \nclarifying that the immigration provisions of the Child Soldiers \nAccountability Act apply to offenses committed before the bill's \nenactment; a conforming amendment to the Immigration and Nationality \nAct required by the enactment of the Genocide Accountability Act; and a \nconforming amendment to the material support statute, made necessary by \nthe enactment of the Genocide Accountability Act and the Child Soldiers \nAccountability Act, making it illegal to provide material support to \ngenocide and the use or recruitment of child soldiers.\n  The United States has a proud tradition of leadership in the \npromotion of human rights and the world watches our steps in this field \nclosely. By holding perpetrators of serious human rights abusers found \nin the U.S. accountable, we will demonstrate our commitment to \nupholding the human rights principles we have long advocated and \ndiscourage human rights violators from fleeing to the U.S.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to catalyze change in the care and treatment of \ndiabetes in the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Catalyst \nto Better Diabetes Care Act, which is S. 1473. Without question, \ndiabetes is an epidemic in our country, and we have to do something. \nTwenty-three million adults and children suffer from diabetes. Another \n57 million Americans are prediabetic cases. In North Carolina, my \nState, 600,000 adults have been diagnosed with diabetes and another \n288,000 are undiagnosed and over 400,000 have prediabetes. But with our \nlifestyle choices, it is not surprising that these numbers are so high. \nNearly three in five North Carolinians are overweight\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\nor obese. Being overweight is a leading cause of diabetes. A quarter of \nour State's citizens do not exercise. Unfortunately, it is not just \nadults who are suffering from this disease. In North Carolina, there \nare over 4,000 children who have diabetes. While type 1 diabetes is the \nmost frequent diabetes in children, it is because of increasing obesity \nrates that the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes is growing.\n  Not only is diabetes wreaking havoc on people's health, it is also \ncosting the country millions of dollars to treat. In my State of North \nCarolina, diabetes costs $5.3 billion annually in medical \ninterventions, lost productivity, and premature mortality. Annually \ndiabetes accounts for 16,000 hospitalizations. People suffering from \ndiabetes have greater risk of renal disease, heart attack, stroke, and \nblindness. Diabetics also have a high risk of amputations if they fail \nto get appropriate foot care.\n  However, with proper prevention and treatment, we can curb the \nstaggering cost of diabetes and people can live healthier, happier \nlives. Lifestyle changes in diet and physical activity can reduce the \ndevelopment of diabetes in prediabetics. Early detection and treatment \nof diabetic eye disease can reduce blindness and lowering one's blood \npressure can reduce the decline in kidney function, thereby averting \nrenal failure. It is because of these proven interventions that I \nintroduce this important bill today.\n  The Catalyst to Better Diabetes Care Act will address five major \nissues to further the fight against this debilitating and deadly \ndisease. This bill creates a cross-agency, collaborative patient and \nprovider outreach program to increase the utilization of the Medicare \ndiabetes screening benefit. Although this screening program was \nestablished in 2003, at present, very few seniors are taking advantage \nof this benefit. Early screening allows diabetics to better monitor and \ncontrol their condition and prevent complications. This provision will \nsave money and lives. When employees have incentives to select more \nnutritious food and to exercise, not only are they more productive, \ntheir overall health is improved. Companies like Pitney Bowes are \nimplementing innovative practices to encourage their employees to live \nhealthier lives, and such initiatives have shown remarkable results.\n  Building upon these experiences, this bill establishes an advisory \ngroup to promote innovative private sector wellness and disease \nmanagement programs. Diabetes takes an enormous toll on society. Yet we \nhave very little consolidated data which measures the true impact and \noutcome of this disease. To address this gap, this bill creates a \nnational and State-by-State level diabetes report card which will track \nour progress toward beating diabetes. The report card will contain \ninformation on preventative care practices and quality of care, risk \nfactors, and outcomes of individuals who are diagnosed with diabetes \nand prediabetes.\n  Studies indicate that only 35 to 40 percent of diabetics who die have \ndiabetes listed anywhere on their death certificate, and only about 10 \nto 15 percent have diabetes listed as the underlying cause of death. \nWithout this information, our country is not able to grasp the full \nimpact that complications from diabetes has on our health care system \nand society.\n  In order to better understand the scope of this epidemic, this bill \nrequires the director of the CDC to promote the education and training \nof physicians on properly completing a birth and death certificate as \nwell as the possibility of promoting language to improve the collection \nof diabetes mortality data, despite estimates that nearly one in three \nchildren today will go on to develop diabetes. Today's medical students \nare only required to have 4 hours of education in diabetes to become a \nboard-certified physician. As diabetes touches more and more Americans, \nit will be critical that our doctors recognize this disease and have \nthe tools and understanding to discuss prevention and proper treatment \nwith their patients. That is why this bill requires HHS to collaborate \nwith the Institute of Medicine and other related entities to study the \nimpact of diabetes on the practice of medicine and develop \nrecommendations to appropriate levels of diabetes medical education \nthat should be required prior to licensure, board certification, and \nboard recertification.\n  Diabetes has taken an enormous toll on our society's health and our \neconomy. But in many cases, this disease can be preventable.\n  The Catalyst of Better Diabetes Care will address some of the \nfundamental obstacles that prevent us from tackling this disease head \non. Better outreach, better data, and better education of patients and \nphysicians are the keys to reducing morbidity and mortality from \ndiabetes and lessening the costly burden this condition has inserted \nupon our country.\n  I wish to thank my Republican colleague, Senator John Cornyn, for \njoining me in cosponsoring this measure. I urge my other colleagues to \njoin us in supporting this very important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/20/senate-section/article/S7704-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 217--COMMENDING CAPTAIN WEI JIAFU AND THE CHINA OCEAN \n SHIPPING COMPANY FOR INCREASING BUSINESS RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED \n                            STATES AND CHINA\n\n  Mr. KERRY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPOSING SANCTIONS WITH \n                   RESPECT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, combined with its development of \n     unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles and support for \n     international terrorism, represent a grave threat to the \n     security of the United States and United States allies in \n     Europe, the Middle East, and around the world.\n       (2) The United States and other responsible countries have \n     a vital interest in working together to prevent the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a \n     nuclear weapons capability.\n       (3) As President Barack Obama said, ``Iran obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon would not only be a threat to Israel and a \n     threat to the United States, but would be profoundly \n     destabilizing in the international community as a whole and \n     could set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that \n     would be extraordinarily dangerous for all concerned, \n     including for Iran.''.\n       (4) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly \n     called attention to the illicit nuclear activities of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, and, as a result, the United \n     Nations Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions \n     designed to encourage the Government of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran to cease those activities and comply with its \n     obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, \n     and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the \n     ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'').\n       (5) The Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on \n     several Iranian banks, including Bank Melli, Bank Saderat, \n     Bank Sepah, and Bank Mellat, for their involvement in \n     proliferation activities or support for terrorist groups.\n       (6) The Central Bank of Iran, the keystone of Iran's \n     financial system and its principal remaining lifeline to the \n     international banking system, has engaged in deceptive \n     financial practices and facilitated such practices among \n     banks involved in proliferation activities or support for \n     terrorist groups, including Bank Sepah and Bank Melli, in \n     order to evade sanctions imposed by the United States and the \n     United Nations.\n       (7) On April 8, 2009, the United States formally extended \n     an offer to engage in direct diplomacy with the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran through negotiations with the \n     five permanent members of the United States Security Council \n     and Germany (commonly referred to as the ``P5-plus-1 \n     process''), in the hope of resolving all outstanding disputes \n     between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States.\n       (8) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has yet \n     to make a formal reply to the April 8, 2009, offer of direct \n     diplomacy by the United States or to engage in direct \n     diplomacy with the United States through the P5-plus-1 \n     process.\n       (9) On July 8, 2009, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France \n     warned that the Group of Eight major powers will give the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran until September 2009 to accept \n     negotiations with respect to its nuclear activities or face \n     tougher sanctions.\n         (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran should--\n       (A) seize the historic offer put forward by President \n     Barack Obama to engage in direct diplomacy with the United \n     States;\n       (B) suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing \n     activities, including research and development, and work on \n     all heavy-water related projects, including the construction \n     of a research reactor moderated by heavy water, as demanded \n     by multiple resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council; and\n       (C) come into full compliance with the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty, including the additional protocol to \n     the Treaty; and\n       (2) the President should impose sanctions on the Central \n     Bank of Iran and any other Iranian bank engaged in \n     proliferation activities or support for terrorist groups, as \n     well as any other sanctions the President determines \n     appropriate, if--\n       (A) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran--\n       (i) has not accepted the offer by the United States to \n     engage in direct diplomacy through the P5-plus-1 process \n     before the Summit of the Group of 20 (G-20) in Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania, in September 2009; or\n       (ii) has not suspended all enrichment-related and \n     reprocessing activities and work on all heavy-water related \n     projects within 60 days of the conclusion of that Summit; and\n       (B) the United Nations Security Council has failed to adopt \n     significant and meaningful additional sanctions on the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1629.

ANNUAL COUNTERTERRORISM STATUS REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Success in Countering Al Qaeda Reporting Requirements Act \n     of 2009''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda and its related affiliates attacked the United \n     States on September 11, 2001 in New York, New York, \n     Arlington, Virginia, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, murdering \n     almost 3000 innocent civilians.\n       (2) Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri remain \n     at large.\n       (3) In testimony to the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate on February 12, 2009, Director of National \n     Intelligence Dennis C. Blair stated, ``al-Qa'ida and its \n     affiliates and allies remain dangerous and adaptive enemies, \n     and the threat they could inspire or orchestrate an attack on \n     the United States or European countries. . . . Although al-\n     Qa'ida's core organization in the tribal areas of Pakistan is \n     under greater pressure now than it was a year ago, we assess \n     that it remains the most dangerous component of the larger \n     al-Qa'ida network. Al-Qa'ida leaders still use the tribal \n     areas as a base from which they can avoid capture, produce \n     propaganda, communicate with operational cells abroad, and \n     provide training and indoctrination to new terrorist \n     operatives.''.\n       (4) The most recent authoritative National Intelligence \n     Estimate issued on the threat posed by Al Qaeda, released in \n     July 2007, states ``Al-Qa'ida is and will remain the most \n     serious terrorist threat to the Homeland''.\n       (5) Efforts to combat violent extremism and radicalism must \n     be undertaken using all elements of national power, including \n     military tools, intelligence assets, law enforcement \n     resources, diplomacy, paramilitary activities, financial \n     measures, development assistance, strategic communications, \n     and public diplomacy.\n       (6) In the report entitled ``Suggested Areas for Oversight \n     for the 110th Congress'' (GAO-08-235R, November 17, 2006), \n     the Government Accountability Office urged greater \n     congressional oversight in assessing the effectiveness and \n     coordination of United States international programs focused \n     on combating and preventing the growth of terrorism and its \n     underlying causes.\n       (7) Section 140(a) of the Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 2656f(a)) requires \n     that the Secretary of State submit annual reports to Congress \n     that detail key developments on terrorism on a country-by-\n     country basis. These Country Reports on Terrorism provide \n     information on acts of terrorism in countries, major \n     developments in bilateral and multilateral counterterrorism \n     cooperation, and the extent of State support for terrorist \n     groups responsible for the death, kidnaping, or injury of \n     Americans, but do not assess the scope and efficacy of United \n     States counterterrorism efforts against Al Qaeda and its \n     related affiliates.\n       (8) The Executive Branch submits regular reports to \n     Congress that detail the status of United States combat \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including a breakdown of \n     budgetary allocations, key milestones achieved, and measures \n     of political, economic, and military progress.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) 8 years after the attacks on September 11, 2001, Al \n     Qaeda and its related affiliates remain the most serious \n     national security threat to the United States, with alarming \n     signs that Al Qaeda and its related affiliates have \n     reconstituted their strength and ability to generate new \n     attacks throughout the world, including against the United \n     States;\n       (2) there remains insufficient information on current \n     counterterrorism efforts undertaken by the Federal Government \n     and the level of success achieved by specific initiatives;\n       (3) Congress and the American people can benefit from more \n     specific data and metrics that can provide the basis for \n     objective external assessments of the progress being made in \n     the overall war being waged against violent extremism;\n       (4) the absence of a comparable timely assessment of the \n     ongoing status and progress of United States counterterrorism \n     efforts against Al Qaeda and its related affiliates hampers \n     the ability of Congress and the American people to \n     independently determine whether the United States is making \n     significant progress in this defining struggle of our time; \n     and\n       (5) the Executive Branch should submit a comprehensive \n     report to Congress, updated on an annual basis, which \n     provides a more strategic perspective regarding--\n       (A) the United States' highest global counterterrorism \n     priorities;\n       (B) the United States' efforts to combat and defeat Al \n     Qaeda and its related affiliates;\n       (C) the United States' efforts to undercut long-term \n     support for the violent extremism that sustains Al Qaeda and \n     its related affiliates;\n       (D) the progress made by the United States as a result of \n     such efforts;\n       (E) the efficacy and efficiency of the United States \n     resource allocations; and\n       (F) whether the existing activities and operations of the \n     United States are actually diminishing the national security \n     threat posed by Al Qaeda and its related affiliates.\n       (d) Annual Counterterrorism Status Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than July 31, 2010, and every \n     July 31 thereafter, the President shall submit a report, to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives, the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, which contains, for the most recent 12-month \n     period, a review of the counterterrorism strategy of the \n     United States Government, including--\n       (A) a detailed assessment of the scope, status, and \n     progress of United States counterterrorism efforts in \n     fighting Al Qaeda and its related affiliates and undermining \n     long-term support for violent extremism;\n       (B) a judgment on the geographical region in which Al Qaeda \n     and its related affiliates pose the greatest threat to the \n     national security of the United States;\n       (C) a judgment on the adequacy of interagency integration \n     of the counterterrorism programs and activities of the \n     Department of Defense, the United States Special Operations \n     Command, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of \n     State, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\n     Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and other \n     Federal departments and agencies;\n       (D) an evaluation of the extent to which the \n     counterterrorism efforts of the United States correspond to \n     the plans developed by the National Counterterrorism Center \n     and the goals established in overarching public statements of \n     strategy issued by the executive branch;\n       (E) a determination of whether the National \n     Counterterrorism Center exercises the authority and has the \n     resources and expertise required to fulfill the interagency \n     strategic and operational planning role described in section \n     119(j) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 404o), \n     as added by section 1012 of the National Security \n     Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 (title I of Public Law 108-\n     458);\n       (F) a description of the efforts of the United States \n     Government to combat Al Qaeda and its related affiliates and \n     undermine violent extremist ideology, which shall include--\n       (i) a specific list of the President's highest global \n     counterterrorism priorities;\n       (ii) the degree of success achieved by the United States, \n     and remaining areas for progress, in meeting the priorities \n     described in clause (i); and\n       (iii) efforts in those countries in which the President \n     determines that--\n\n       (I) Al Qaeda and its related affiliates have a presence; or\n       (II) acts of international terrorism have been perpetrated \n     by Al Qaeda and its related affiliates;\n\n       (G) a specific list of United States counterterrorism \n     efforts, and the specific status and achievements of such \n     efforts, through military, financial, political, \n     intelligence, paramilitary, and law enforcement elements, \n     relating to--\n       (i) bilateral security and training programs;\n       (ii) law enforcement and border security;\n       (iii) the disruption of terrorist networks;

and\n       (iv) other efforts aimed at influencing public opinion;\n       (I) United States Government initiatives to eliminate \n     direct and indirect international financial support for the \n     activities of terrorist groups;\n       (J) a cross-cutting analysis of the budgets of all Federal \n     Government agencies as they relate to counterterrorism \n     funding to battle Al Qaeda and its related affiliates abroad, \n     including--\n       (i) the source of such funds; and\n       (ii) the allocation and use of such funds;\n       (K) an analysis of the extent to which specific Federal \n     appropriations--\n       (i) have produced tangible, calculable results in efforts \n     to combat and defeat Al Qaeda, its related affiliates, and \n     its violent ideology; or\n       (ii) contribute to investments that have expected payoffs \n     in the medium- to long-term;\n       (L) statistical assessments, including those developed by \n     the National Counterterrorism Center, on the number of \n     individuals belonging to Al Qaeda and its related affiliates \n     that have been killed, injured, or taken into custody as a \n     result of United States counterterrorism efforts;

periods of Arab-Israeli tension have sparked an \n     increase in attacks against Jewish communities around the \n     world and comparisons of policies of the Government of Israel \n     to those of the Nazis and that, despite growing efforts by \n     governments to promote Holocaust remembrance, the Holocaust \n     is frequently invoked as part of anti-Semitic harassment to \n     threaten and offend Jews;\n       Whereas, since the commencement of Israel's military \n     operation in Gaza on December 27, 2008, a substantial \n     increase in anti-Semitic violence, including physical and \n     verbal attacks, arson, and vandalism against synagogues, \n     cemeteries, and Holocaust memorial sites, has been reported;\n       Whereas, among many other examples of the dramatic rise of \n     anti-Semitism around the world, over 220 anti-Semitic \n     incidents have been reported to the Community Security Trust \n     in London since December 27, 2008, approximately eight times \n     the number recorded during the same period last year, and the \n     main Jewish association in France, Counsel Representatif des \n     Institutions Juives de France, recorded more than 100 attacks \n     in January, including car bombs launched at synagogues, a \n     difference from 20 to 25 a month for the previous year;\n       Whereas, interspersed with expressions of legitimate \n     criticism of Israeli policy and actions, anti-Semitic imagery \n     and comparisons of Jews and Israel to Nazis have been \n     widespread at demonstrations in the United States, Europe, \n     and Latin America against Israel's actions, and placards held \n     at many demonstrations across the globe have compared Israeli \n     leaders to Nazis, accused Israel of carrying out a \n     ``Holocaust'' against Palestinians, and equated the Jewish \n     Star of David with the Nazi swastika;\n       Whereas, in some countries, demonstrations have included \n     chants of ``death to Israel'', expressions of support for \n     suicide terrorism against Israeli or Jewish civilians, and \n     have been followed by violence and vandalism against \n     synagogues and Jewish institutions;\n       Whereas some government leaders have exemplified courage \n     and resolve against this trend, including President Nicolas \n     Sarkozy of France, who said he ``utterly condemned the \n     unacceptable violence, under the pretext of this conflict, \n     against individuals, private property, and religious \n     buildings'', and assured ``that these acts would not go \n     unpunished'', Justice Minister of the Netherlands Ernst \n     Hirsch Ballin, who announced on January 14, 2009, that he \n     would investigate allegations of anti-Semitism and incitement \n     to hatred and violence at anti-Israel demonstrations, and \n     parliamentarians who have voiced concern, such as the British \n     Parliament's All-Party Group Against Anti-Semitism, which \n     expressed its ``horror as a wave of anti-Semitic incidents \n     has affected the Jewish community'';\n       Whereas, despite these actions, too few government leaders \n     in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America have taken \n     action against the anti-Semitic environments in their \n     countries and in some cases have even promoted violence;\n       Whereas other leaders have made hostile pronouncements \n     against Israel and Jews, including the President of \n     Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, who called Israel's actions a \n     ``Holocaust against the Palestinian people'' and singled out \n     Venezuela's Jewish community, demanding that they publicly \n     renounce Israel's ``barbaric acts'' and in so doing implying \n     that the Jewish community is co-responsible for any actions \n     by the Government of Israel and thus a legitimate target, the \n     leader of Hamas, Mahmoud al-Zahar, who recently called for \n     Jewish children to be attacked around the world, and the \n     Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who vowed to \n     confer the status of ``martyr'' on ``anyone who dies in this \n     holy struggle against World Zionism'';\n       Whereas incitement to violence against Jews also continues \n     in state-run media, particularly in the Middle East, where \n     government-owned, government-sanctioned, or government-\n     controlled publishing houses publish newspapers which \n     promulgate anti-Jewish stereotypes and the myth of the Jewish \n     blood libels in editorial cartoons and articles, produce and \n     broadcast anti-Semitic dramatic and documentary series, and \n     produce Arabic translations of anti-Semitic tracts such as \n     ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' and ``Mein Kampf'';\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\n       Whereas Jewish communities face an environment in which the \n     convergence of anti-Semitic sentiment and demonization of \n     Israel in the public debate have fostered a hostile \n     environment and a sense of [global] insecurity in certain \n     countries[, especially in places such as Belgium, Argentina, \n     Venezuela, Spain, and South Africa].\n       Whereas, in response, the United States Government and \n     other governments and multilateral institutions have \n     supported international government and civil society efforts \n     to monitor and report on anti-Semitic activities and \n     introduce preventive initiatives such as tolerance education \n     and Holocaust Remembrance; and\n       Whereas challenges still remain, with the governments of \n     many countries failing to implement and fund preventive \n     efforts, accurately track and report anti-Semitic crimes, and \n     prosecute offenders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) unequivocally condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and \n     rejects attempts to rationalize anti-Jewish hatred or attacks \n     as a justifiable expression of disaffection or frustration \n     over political events in the Middle East or elsewhere;\n       (2) decries the comparison of Jews to Nazis perpetrating a \n     Holocaust or genocide as a pernicious form of anti-Semitism, \n     an insult to the memory of those who perished in the \n     Holocaust, and an affront both to those who survived and the \n     righteous gentiles who saved Jewish lives at peril to their \n     own and who fought to defeat the Nazis;\n       (3) calls on leaders to speak out against manifestations of \n     anti-Semitism that have entered the public debate about the \n     Middle East;\n       (4) applauds those foreign leaders who have condemned anti-\n     Semitic acts and calls on those who have yet to take firm \n     action against anti-Semitism in their countries to do so;\n       (5) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the Special \n     Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism; and\n       (6) urges the Secretary of State--\n       (A) to maintain the fight against anti-Semitism as a \n     foreign policy priority of the Untied States and to convey \n     the concerns of the United States Government in bilateral \n     meetings;\n       (B) to continue to raise with United States allies in the \n     Middle East their failure to halt incitement to violence \n     against Jews, including through the use of government-run \n     media;\n       (C) to urge governments to promote tolerance education and \n     establish mechanisms to monitor, investigate, and punish \n     anti-Semitic crimes, including through utilization of the \n     education, law enforcement training, and civil society \n     capacity building initiatives of the Tolerance and Non-\n     discrimination Department of the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);\n       (D) to swiftly appoint the Special Envoy to Monitor and \n     Combat Anti-Semitism of the Department of State;\n       (E) to ensure that Department of State Annual Country \n     Reports on Human Rights and International Religious Freedom \n     Reports continue to report on incidents of anti-Semitism and \n     the efforts of foreign governments to address the problem;\n       (F) to provide necessary training and tools for United \n     States embassies and missions to recognize these trends; and\n       (G) to ensure that initiatives of the United States \n     Government to train law enforcement abroad incorporate tools \n     to address anti-Semitism.\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN.
