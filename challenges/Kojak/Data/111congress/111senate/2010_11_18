Madam President, we are going to continue debate, as I \nannounced, on the food safety legislation. No one in America should \nhave to worry if their salad or sandwich is going to kill them. No one \nin the Senate should prey on that fear or play with it like a political \nfootball. Yet that is exactly what is happening.\n  If you follow the Senate every day, you might not be surprised to see \nour Republican friends turn food safety into a partisan political \nissue. But if you are trying to keep yourself and your family healthy, \nyou may be appalled, and rightfully so.\n  You might also be troubled to learn that our food safety system has \nnot been updated in almost 100 years, in almost a century. Food \nprocessing, production, and marketing have surely advanced over the \nlast hundred years, but\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\nour safety measures have not. New contaminants come up every day, but \nour safety measures do not keep up.\n  That is because our FDA does not have the authority or research it \nneeds to keep up. This bill will fix that. It will greatly improve this \nimportant system, and it will keep regulatory burdens on farmers and \nfood producers to a minimum. It simply gives the FDA the authority to \nrecall contaminated foods to find out where these dangerous foods come \nfrom and to stop them from getting into our grocery stores.\n  It is a bipartisan bill. The HELP Committee passed it unanimously. \nBut somewhere between the committee and the Senate floor, making sure \nthe food we eat is not poisonous has somehow become a partisan issue. \nThat should be unacceptable to everyone.\n  Food poisoning kills as many as 5,000 of us, we Americans, every \nyear. Foodborne illnesses sicken one in four people every year. I do \nnot how many people have been affected by food poisoning. The Presiding \nOfficer is from New York. My wife and I went to New York a number of \nyears ago with our son and his girlfriend. We were going to go to a \nplay. We had dinner at a nice restaurant. We both had chicken, the same \ndish. About 4 o'clock in the morning, I asked my wife if she would get \nme a drink of water. She said: No, I cannot; I am too sick. I was too \nsick too. We were so sick that day. We got out of the room we were \nstaying in sometime midmorning. And, frankly, my wife never, ever got \nover that completely. She had an illness to begin with called \nulcerative colitis. This exacerbated her symptoms so badly that \nultimately she was hospitalized for more than a month.\n  These illnesses affect everyone. Contaminated food affects people and \naffects people very badly. I repeat, 5,000 of us die every year as a \nresult of foodborne illnesses. The specialists say it is probably more \nthan that, because a lot of times when people die they do not know it \nis from food poisoning.\n  One of four of us every year gets sick. If 25 Senators, one-quarter \nof this Senate, got food poisoning this year, we would do something \nabout it, and we would not think twice about which political party \nthose Senators who got sick were from. People often think of food \npoisoning as an upset stomach that goes away in a few hours or a day. \nSometimes, yes, that is all it is. But sometimes it is much worse. I \nhave met with the families who have been seriously sickened by the food \nthey have eaten, people who are hospitalized for weeks and months and \nmonths, who came close to death.\n  In some cases they will deal with the results of their food poisoning \nfor the rest of their lives. One such person is a little girl named \nRylee Gustafson. She is from Henderson, NV. When she was 9 years old, \nshe ate a salad that almost killed her. It had spinach in it. That \nspinach had E. coli. Rylee got so seriously ill that she, of course, \nwas hospitalized, and for a long time. Three others who got E. coli \nfrom fresh spinach died. This little girl is a feisty little thing. But \nher growth has been stunted. She will never be the size she should be.\n  There are lots of stories, none of them pleasant. But a woman named \nLinda Rivera from Las Vegas ate some cookie dough. E. coli was in the \ncookie dough. She was in a coma for a long time. She is recovering but \nnot really well.\n  Then a few days ago, the CDC alerted us to another E. coli outbreak. \nThis was cheese. And 37 Americans so far had gotten sick from a brand \nof cheese sold in the western part of the United States, including two \npeople in Nevada.\n  So why have we waited this long to make our food safer? We are still \nplaying these games, political games. The answer is nothing more than \nvery base politics. It is shameful. I hope we can end that today. The \nvast majority of the Senate wants to pass this bill. And we should not \nhave just a few people standing in the way of doing something that will \nhelp the health and safety of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8002-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, health care--big issue. The health care \nreform bill that is current law--big issue. A lot of talk about repeal, \nfix what is wrong in the bill, what is right in the bill, depending \nupon your personal opinion.\n  I think that the Senate--more especially the committees of \njurisdiction, and I am talking about the Senate Finance Committee--has \na unique obligation, especially at this time, to conduct its oversight \nresponsibility. Unfortunately, that was not the case as of yesterday.\n  One of the major problems with the new health care law is the huge \namount of power and authority it grants to one man, the Administrator, \nperhaps we should call him the czar, of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS. Rest assured, every health care provider in the \ncountry knows what and who CMS is.\n  The Administrator is Dr. Donald Berwick. One of the major problems \nwith Dr. Berwick is his longstanding, well-documented support for \ngovernment rationing as a means of controlling health care costs--not \nmy words, his.\n  Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee finally had our very first \nchance to question Dr. Berwick. I say finally, because for months my \ncolleagues and I have requested this opportunity, a request which was \ndenied when President Obama provided a recess appointment for Dr. \nBerwick. So yesterday's hearing was a hollow one of sorts, since Dr. \nBerwick had already been installed at CMS, or maybe parachuted in would \nbe the right way to describe it, in that he has made many controversial \ncomments about his love for the British health care system and for \nrationing and other comments that certainly deserve a hearing in \nregards to a confirmation process. That did not happen.\n  He was also installed pretty much after the debate that we had on \nhealth care. Now, unfortunately, we were only given 5 minutes each \nyesterday to question the most important man in American health care as \nof today. This was 5 minutes, sandwiched in between lengthy remarks by \nthe chairman, the witness, and the floor votes we had yesterday.\n  I was not able to question Dr. Berwick on many things. I asked \nunanimous consent of the chairman if I could submit questions for the \nRecord. Obviously he agreed and that was it. But when Ranking Member \nGrassley asked Dr. Berwick if he would commit to appearing before the \ncommittee again--which I think the doctor would; he is a very affable \nand personal man. I do not agree with him, but he is affable and \npersonable--so we could continue our oversight, Chairman Baucus \ninterrupted his response and refused to make any further commitments.\n  How is that for transparency? How is that for finally getting to a \nhearing about the man who is the most important man today in regards to \nthe new health care law and implementing it?\n  Because I was not able to ask Dr. Berwick my questions yesterday, I \nam forced and am asking them here on the Senate floor. Dr. Berwick \nknows my No. 1 concern with President Obama's health care law is the \nenormous potential for the government to interfere in the treatment \ndecisions of the doctor and the patient. Dr. Berwick has a long history \nof statements supporting government control of treatment decisions, or \nwhat I would call ``rationing.'' I know some would say that is not the \ncase. But Dr. Berwick has said that:\n\n       Most people who have severe pain do not need advanced \n     methods; they just need the morphine and counseling that have \n     been around for centuries.\n\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\n\n  A most unique statement, to say the least. He has publicly stated an \naversion to new medical technology and health care advances, saying:\n\n       One of the drivers of low value in health care today is the \n     continuous entrance of new technologies, devices, and drugs \n     that add no value to care.\n\n  That is in his eyes. He refers to this as an ``excess supply'' of \nhealth care. And, of course, we have his infamous quote that ``the \ndecision is not whether or not we will ration health care. The decision \nis whether we will ration care with our eyes open.''\n  It should then come as no surprise that CMS under Dr. Berwick's \nleadership has embarked upon a path of increasing government control, \ncentralized decisionmaking, and top-down mandates that treat doctors as \nnothing more than cooks practicing ``cookbook medicine'' and patients \nas nothing more than numbers, despite their individual needs and \ndesires.\n  One example: attempts by CMS to restrict the number of times seniors \nwith diabetes can test their blood sugar by limiting them to one test \nstrip per day, regardless of what the doctor recommends. Doctors \nunderstand that diabetes care is an exceedingly complex and \npersonalized enterprise. My question that I could not ask yesterday: \nWhy is CMS replacing the judgment of a doctor on how many times their \npatient should test their blood sugar with a CMS-knows-best approach?\n  An even more egregious example of the government getting in between \npatients and doctors is Dr. Berwick's recent investigation into \nMedicare coverage of the life-extending prostate cancer therapy \nProvenge. Provenge is a therapeutic vaccine approved by the Food and \nDrug Administration to treat late-stage prostate cancer through an \ninnovative process that removes immune system cells from patients and \nexposes them to cancer cells and an immune system stimulator and then \ninjects them back into the patient. Provenge has been shown to increase \nlife expectancy by an average of 4 months but sometimes longer, with \none patient living an additional 7 years. In addition, Provenge is \nspecial because of its lack of side effects as compared to the \ntraditional chemotherapy methods. So not only can patients live longer, \nbut their quality of life will be better.\n  Medicare coverage for FDA-approved drugs is usually automatic. My \nnext question to Dr. Berwick would have been, had I had the opportunity \nin the committee yesterday but was denied because of scheduling: Why \ndid you initiate a coverage investigation so soon after Provenge was \napproved? Why is CMS seeking to substitute its judgment for not only \npatients and doctors but for the FDA, the gold standard for drug \napproval worldwide? Are you questioning the FDA's decision? When drug \ncompanies and research folks produce after many years of research and \neffort and cost, are they going to have to go through two hurdles--\nfirst, the FDA, which can take years, and then CMS--as to whether \nMedicare will approve it? It seems that is where we are headed.\n  I know or I think I know the answer as to why Dr. Berwick decided to \nconduct this investigation.\n  It is cost--$93,000 for a complete cycle of Provenge was the driving \nfactor behind this investigation.\n  The good news is that yesterday an advisory committee recommended \nthat CMS cover Provenge. But I am very concerned about the precedent \nthis sets not only for other cancer regimens such as the promising \nbreast cancer drug Avastin but for all new medical innovations.\n  Some may say that an extra 4 months of life is not enough to justify \nthis high price tag. It is a high price tag. First, the government \nshould not be in the business of placing dollar values on life, period. \nThat is what Great Britain is trying to move away from. That is why \nDavid Cameron made the unique statement that maybe we ought to have a \nsystem that puts the choice between doctors and patients. What a novel \nidea.\n  Secondly, the traditional chemo and all of its associated side \neffects costs Medicare upwards of $110,000 per patient per year. So \nProvenge is actually a cost saver when viewed in that context.\n  Third, this is exactly the type of innovative approach we need to win \nthe fight against cancer. Medical advances don't come in giant leaps; \nthey more often occur at the margins. We should not deny patients and \ndoctors treatment options simply because they don't offer a complete \ncure. That is shortsighted, not to mention cruel.\n  Finally, if we want companies and investors to continue to pour their \ndollars and efforts into developing a cure for cancer, this is the \nwrong approach. The investment into researching and developing Provenge \napproached $1 billion over 15 years, 15 clinical trials. Refusing to \nallow a return on this huge investment will send a chilling effect \nacross the health research industry, resulting in less investment, less \ninnovation, and worse care for patients. Maybe less innovation is \nactually the goal of this administration and of Dr. Berwick, who has \ntargeted the ``entrance of new technologies, drugs, and devices'' as \n``one of the drivers of low value in health care today.'' Value is a \nsubjective concept.\n  Another question I have for Dr. Berwick: I prefer that the value of \nhealth care be determined by the patient and doctor, not the \ngovernment. Would you agree?\n  Finally, from yesterday's news, I have been shocked by the number of \nObamaCare waivers coming out of the Department of Health and Human \nServices. According to the New York Times today, 111 waivers have been \ngranted to employers to allow them to avoid the new health care \nmandates. The only thing more shocking than the number of waivers is \nwho is getting them. Would you believe that they are some of the most \nardent supporters of health care reform? Unions such as the Service \nEmployees International Union, the United Federation of Teachers, and \nthe Transport Workers Union have all applied for and been granted \nwaivers from the rules. They don't have to follow the rules. They don't \nhave to follow the mandates. Guess who are the strongest supporters of \nhealth care. The fact is, ObamaCare is bad for business, bad for \nworkers, bad for seniors, bad for taxpayers.\n  My question to Dr. Berwick: When will the American people get a \nwaiver from ObamaCare? Of course, that decision would be under the \npurview of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Kathleen Sebelius, whom I know as a personal friend.\n  Kathleen, Kathleen, Kathleen, you are granting all these waivers to \npeople in regard to the mandate on health care. When will the American \npeople get a waiver from some of the things they choose not to take \npart in? This is, indeed, shocking news.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as I will be leaving the Senate in a few \nweeks, I ask my colleagues to indulge me as I speak for a few minutes \non a subject I believe is very important, and that is continuing the \npolicies and funding that help drive scientific advancement in new \nareas, particularly agricultural biotechnology.\n  It goes without saying that we are living in a time of breathtaking \nscientific discovery, whether the field is aerospace, information \nsystems, or biotechnology.\n  In the last hundred years, science has taken us from the Wright \nBrothers first flight to manned space flight. Science has taken us from \nHenry Ford's first car to today's vehicles hosting full-fledged \nentertainment systems and global positioning systems. Science has taken \nus from typewriters to supercomputer and from candles to electricity.\n  Science is moving even faster now. Advances in technology will \ncontinue to reach far into every sector of our economy.\n  Future job and economic growth in the areas of health care, life \nsciences, industry, defense, agriculture and transportation is directly \nrelated to scientific advancement. And America's\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\nfuture wealth and economic preeminence is tied to technological \nadvancement.\n  Technological advancement will continue to drive our economy, job \ngrowth and our quality of life.\n  While most of the work is being done by our scientists, engineers, \nentrepreneurs and educators, government can play a role in helping \ncreate the conditions for them to succeed: through research funding, \nthrough tax policy, and through free trade agreements. This is \nespecially true when it comes too agiotechnology.\n  Looking back about 15 years ago, I received a strong push for a new \nidea--mapping the corn genome, one of the first real biotech projects \nfor commercial agriculture. This push came not from leaders in \neducation, science or the corporate world--and we have many--but from \ncorn growers and soybean producers in Missouri.\n  Our producers convinced me that biotechnology was not only key to \nimproving farm incomes and the rural economy, but in revolutionizing \nthe world in the same way the steam engine revolutionized industry, and \nthe computer revolutionized the sharing of information.\n  At that time, it was tough to get anyone interested in the project--\nCongress, the media, even my own staff. Imagine running for reelection \nand telling your staff: hey, great idea, I'm going to campaign on the \ncorn genome.\n  As Mark Twain said:\n  A crank is someone with a new idea--until it catches on. Back then, \nthose of us peddling biotechnology sounded like cranks.\n  The first time I asked the Agriculture Appropriations Committee to \nfund biotech projects, I didn't get a single dime.\n  But we persisted, anyway. I teamed up with my colleague and good \nfriend, Senator Barbara Mikulski, on a bipartisan initiative to fund \nbiotech research through the National Science Foundation.\n  Through the years we have provided nearly a billion dollars to NSF.\n  With the help of Missouri's-own Chancellor Bill Danforth and Roger \nBeachy as well as others, Senator Tom Harkin and I sponsored \nlegislation creating the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to \nsupport the competitive research at the Federal level needed to advance \nagriculture science.\n  Fifteen years later, we now have the proof that this idea really is \nchanging the world, as promised.\n  Already, hundreds of millions of people have been helped by \nbiotechnology drugs and vaccines that can cure diseases and eliminate \nthe need for surgery. And there are many more drugs and vaccines being \ntested which will eventually help us treat other diseases.\n  Agricultural biotechnology is bringing hope to those in the \ndeveloping world by providing crops that are more pest and disease-\nresistant and more nutritious.\n  It helps our farmers by consistently increasing crop yields, \nespecially as our global population continues to increase while \navailable farmland decreases.\n  From an environmental perspective, the use of transgenic seeds has \nreduced pesticide application on our fields by tens of millions of \npounds annually in the United States alone.\n  And--especially important now during the tough recession we are in--\nagriculture biotech creates good, high-paying jobs and helps revitalize \nrural economies.\n  The sky is the limit for the future of biotech. Advances here will \ncontinue to impact the entire world.\n  Madam President, 2005 marked the year that the billionth acre of \ntransgenic crops was planted worldwide, a notable achievement in a \nfield of science that was at the time only a decade old.\n  In 2008, the second billionth acre of a biotech crop was planted only \n3 years after the first.\n  All this while a handful of professional antitechnology activists are \nstill, unsuccessfully in search of their first stomach ache. Their \npersistent Luddite-type hatred of ag biotech, though without any \nscientific support, has fueled fear of genetically modified, GMO, \nfoods, even in less developed countries, where near-term starvation is \na real prospect without a ag biotech.\n  The growth of biotech will continue to explode in future years. \nDeveloping countries using ag biotech out number industrial countries \nby a ratio of three to two.\n  In fact, resourceful farmers in some countries are approving \nbiotechnology before their lagging governments do.\n  Growth brings with it many opportunities for scientists from the \n``developed world'' to collaborate on biotechnology projects with \nscientists in the developing world.\n  But how do we ensure that all people, especially those who need it, \nare not left behind?\n  We must do it. There is a humanitarian imperative. People who are \nwell fed have many problems, a people who are hungry have only one \nproblem.\n  As Norman Borlaug put it:\n  Without food, man can live at most but a few weeks; without it, all \nother components of social justice are meaningless.\n  We simply cannot afford not to tap into the promise of biotechnology. \nBy 2050, developing countries will be home to 90 percent of the \nexpected population of 9 billion.\n  However, while the world is expected to increase its population by \nmore than 30 percent the area of productive agricultural lands in the \nworld remains relatively unchanged. Traditional agriculture cannot keep \nup.\n  Increasing crop yields--and income--is especially important in a \nworld where according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture \nOrganization, FAO, 925 million children go to bed hungry every day and \nseveral million of them die from nutrition-related illnesses every \nyear.\n  For these individuals, a crop failure can mean the difference between \nsurviving and starving.\n  We are not without challenges.\n  Although diminishing, a vocal and aggressive group of advocacy \norganizations continue to market fear rather than sound science, \nespecially in Europe.\n  When public policy decisions are based on fear, rather than sound \nscience, we are in trouble.\n  My good friend Dr. Martina McGloughlin has argued that some \nmultinational corporations operating as NGOs shamelessly hype fear of \nbiotech GMO and use fear to solicit funds for their salaries--these are \nthe modern-day Luddites who know how to profit from their self-\ngenerated hysteria.\n  The result: the science cannot get to the marketplace and improve \npeople's lives.\n  Fortunately the European Union is perhaps beginning to see they are \nmissing out. They have begun to soften their opposition--however \nslightly--on genetically- modified imports.\n  The stakes, of course, are higher in developing nations than in \nEurope, where most are well fed.\n  The late Dr. Norman Borlaug, the unassuming humanitarian credited \nwith feeding a billion people and saving the lives of hundreds of \nmillions, warned us about the biotech naysayers.\n  He worried that ``fear-mongering'' by environmental extremists \nagainst pesticides, fertilizers and genetically-improved foods would \nput millions at risk of starvation while damaging the biodiversity \nthose extremists claim to protect.\n  So we must do a better job, as policy makers, educators, business \nleaders, and scientists to communicate the value of biotechnology to \nthose around us.\n  As my colleagues know, we are struggling to find our way out of this \nrecession and create new jobs.\n  Some of the millions of jobs lost during the last 2 years are never \ncoming back.\n  Biotech shows the promise of replacing some of those jobs. And \nbiotech will provide the jobs of the future. Whether in the research \nlab, the incubator, in a small company or a large corporation, biotech \nis creating good, high-paying jobs. It is extremely important for \nproducing enhanced revenues and jobs.\n  That is why ongoing workforce development and job training in new \nfields like biotechnology is so important.\n  And it is good to see some of our educational institutions getting \ninvolved.\n  Missouri Western University in St. Joseph, MO, has built a biotech \nincubator to encourage new businesses in the area and to help train \nworkers.\n  Not long ago, I visited a St. Louis Community College program that is\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\ntraining young people to work in biotech labs. They are getting on-the-\njob training at an incubator known as BioBench.\n  That's a win-win. It's a win for young people trying to find jobs in \nthe new economy, and it is a win for the companies who need the skills \nof these workers.\n  Efforts like these keep high-paying, cutting-edge jobs right here in \nthe United States.\n  One key to making sure the benefits of biotech continue to grow is \nmaking sure the American public and press, beyond farmers, researchers, \na few company leaders and policy makers understand the value of \nbiotech. Those who understand biotech must make a conscious effort to \neducate their peers and leadership across the country.\n  We need to develop advanced science and technology curriculum that \nprepares our students for the high-tech jobs of the future. A growing \nindustry needs a pipeline of future talented workers. We need to \ncontinue to expand hands-on training opportunities to prepare and \ntransition our current workforce into these new high-tech jobs.\n  So there is good news on many fronts when it comes to the future of \nthe biotech movement. But we need a continued, strong, public-private \npartnership going forward.\n  As I mentioned earlier, in the last 12 or 13 years, Congress has \nprovided nearly a billion dollars to the National Science Foundation to \nconduct plant biotech research, building on the initiative Senator \nMikulski and I introduced in the VA-HUD-Independent Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  The need for continued investment in basic research is crucial to the \ngrowth of biotechnology and I hope Congress will continue to fund \nresearch in this area.\n  While I won't be around to beat the drum next year from the inside, I \nhave worked with my colleagues Senator Johanns and Senator Klobuchar to \ncreate a new Biotech Caucus. I hope those of you who understand the \nchallenge and promise of ag biotech will choose to join the ranks and \ncommunicate the benefits of ag biotech to our peers.\n  While we have much to be proud of when it comes to developments and \nadvancements in biotechnology--we cannot rest on our laurels. We must \ncontinue to support basic research in our Nation's labs. We must \ncontinue our investment in the buildings and equipment that make it \npossible. We must continue to create policies that allow biotech \nbusinesses to flourish--bringing critical research from the lab shelves \nto the marketplace and the benefits to our citizens. We must support \njob training for new workers and help transition the current workforce \ninto these high-tech jobs of the future. And, maybe most important, we \nneed to continue to educate those who do not understand the full \nmagnitude and benefit of biotech.\n  Only through effective communication can we ensure that sound \nscience--not myths and fear--guide public policy.\n  In closing, let me say that in 40 years of public life, I have seen a \nlot of great ideas come and go. I strongly believe ag biotech is here \nto stay and will grow. We are only just beginning to see the many \nexciting applications biotechnology can offer. It is truly changing \nlives, for the better.\n  In my opinion, a dedicated and collaborative investment by \npolicymakers, researchers, educators, and farmers will result in a \nvibrant industry that will fuel our economy, improve our environment, \nand feed our world for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8005-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8005-S8006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF JULIE DAMMANN\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I have a very sad message to bring to the \nbody today. It is with great sadness that I report that we have lost \none of our own, Julie Dammann, who lost her brave 11-year battle with \ncancer.\n  All of you who knew Julie knew of her superior abilities, high \nspirit, and unshakably impervious character in the face of adversity. \nAs she was struggling with this disease and going off for weekend \ntreatment on Friday, with a bright smile, she always insisted, when \nasked, that she was ``doing great.'' Her life was far too short, but \nfew on Earth live a life as fully as she did.\n  Julie was a rural kid from Minnesota and graduated from the \nUniversity of Minnesota. She worked for Rudy Boschwitz before I was \nfortunate enough to hire her in 1987. Most recently, she went to work \nas a senior vice president with Ogilvy Government Relations.\n  But in 1987, after joining my staff as legislative director, she met \nRolf Dammann at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, who was \napparently interested in more than her highly regarded legislative \nacumen. Rolf's newfound interest in budget and appropriations issues \neventually paid off, and they were married--after the 1988 election, of \ncourse.\n  They both enjoyed politics, history, golf, German beer, and their two \nlovely daughters Monika and Paula. Throughout her battle with cancer, \nthey were always by her side.\n  Within any successful enterprise, there is the heart of the \noperation. In the case of Julie, she was the heart, the legs, the mind, \nthe backbone, and the can-do spirit of my staff. For me, from the first \ntime she walked into my office, she was also my friend.\n  Remarkably, from that first day through 24 congressional sessions, \nthree reelections, marriage, motherhood, and her bravely defiant fight \nagainst cancer, she never stopped. She never rested. F. Scott \nFitzgerald once said, ``Action is character.'' In that case, Julie was \ncharacter. Now, some who dealt with her would say ``character'' is \nprobably an understatement.\n  Her ability to multitask was legendary. During her time as chief of \nstaff, she could simultaneously talk with me, listen to C-SPAN, \nBlackBerry instructions to her staff, check out statistics of the \nprevious Vikings game, and evaluate the potential draft picks 9 months \nin advance--not only for the Vikings, but she learned to do the same \nfor the Kansas City Chiefs and the St. Louis Rams. We tried to keep up, \nbut it was hard.\n  The fact that she was able to stay in my employ after the Twins-\nCardinals World Series of 1987--an epic tragedy for Cardinal fans--\nspeaks volumes to her otherwise high value.\n  There is seldom enough recognition of the high-caliber people who \nstaff us in the Congress and the government. Julie was exceptional \namong the exceptional. From 1987 to 2005 while on my staff she was a \nperfectly reliable source of sound judgment, energy, cheer, and \nfriendship.\n  She knew the budget, the whip count, the box scores, the news \nratings, the third down conversion rate, the poll numbers, the economic \nreport, the schedule, the process, the players, the politicians, as \nwell as every competing argument. But mostly she knew and loved people. \nShe was the ideal public servant.\n  Our sincere condolences go to Julie's husband Rolf and their \ndaughters Monika and Paula. The girls will carry on with the richest of \nall inheritances: having their mother's genes and love and guidance to \nremember. Julie could not have been in more diligent, loving hands than \nthose of her husband Rolf. We thank him for taking such special care of \nher. We have lost a special friend, but now we are blessed with a \nspecial angel.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of her \nobituary from the Washington Post printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Julie Ann Dammann, age 51, passed away on November 13, \n     2010, after a long battle with cancer. She was born in \n     Roseville, MN, on May 23, 1959, to Mrs. Ervina and the late \n     Dr. Paul Hasbargen. After celebrating their wedding \n     anniversary on November 12, Julie is survived by her loving \n     husband of 22 years, Rolf and their daughters, Monika (15) \n     and Paula (13) of Arlington, VA; as well as her sister Linda \n     Bazille, and husband, Brad, of Emerald, WI; mother-in-law, \n     Leslie Morton of Gainesville, VA; and her father-in-law Rolf \n     Dammann Sr. of Nashua, NH. Julie attended Alexander Ramsey \n     High School in Roseville, MN (1977), and then became a proud \n     Golden Gopher and graduate of the University of Minnesota \n     (1980), where she was an Economics and Political Science \n     major. After graduating, Julie commenced a long career in \n     service to the country she loved. Her career in the United \n     States Senate began as a Legislative Assistant to Sen. Rudy \n     Boschwitz (R-MN). Twenty-five years later, she retired from \n     the U.S. Senate as the Chief of Staff to Sen. Christopher S. \n     ``Kit'' Bond (R-MO), after serving on his staff since\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\n     1987. Throughout her career, Julie played a role in the \n     passage of major pieces of legislation including: The Federal \n     Highway Reauthorization Bills of 1992, 1998 and 2005; the \n     1987 Farm Credit Act; the 1991 Clean Air Act Amendments; the \n     1992 Family Medical Leave Act; and the 2002 Help America Vote \n     Act. In 2005, after retiring from the U.S. Senate, Julie \n     joined Ogilvy Government Relations as a Senior Vice \n     President, where she continued her work on various \n     transportation and appropriations issues. Throughout her \n     life, Julie was an accomplished athlete, including playing on \n     the University of Minnesota basketball team. Her lifelong \n     love of sports continued into her adult life as an avid \n     golfer and a formidable soccer player. She was a long-time \n     fan of all Minnesota sports, especially the Vikings and the \n     Minnesota Twins, having attended multiple games during the \n     1987 World Series. Julie's focus on family and work was only \n     equaled by the intensity with which she followed her \n     Minnesota teams, remembering every play from every game. The \n     passion with which Julie lived her life will be sadly missed \n     by all who knew and loved her. The family will receive guests \n     on Friday, November 19, 2010 from 10 a.m. until the time of \n     service at 10:30 a.m. at the Immanuel Lutheran Church, 1801 \n     Russell Road, Alexandria, VA with a private interment to \n     follow. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, gifts \n     will be received for the ``Julie Dammann Family Education \n     Trust''. Donations may be sent to: Redmon, Peyton & Braswell, \n     L.L.P., 510 King Street, Suite 301, Alexandria, VA 22314.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8006-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8006-S8008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EMPOWERING STATES TO INNOVATE ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I rise today and join my \ncolleague, Senator Wyden, to speak about legislation we have introduced \nthat will protect not only his State but my State of Massachusetts and \nother States by allowing them to waive out of specific requirements of \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  As my colleagues know, my single priority is and always has been to \nensure that what we do in Washington does not harm my State of \nMassachusetts or the rest of the country, and that we are responsible \nstewards with every tax dollar that flows from the States into the \nFederal Government.\n  This has been true when it comes to voting against raising taxes on \nfamilies and businesses. It has been true when it comes to fighting for \ncommonsense, progrowth policies that will create jobs in Massachusetts. \nIt has been true in my efforts to be sure that the Federal health care \nreform bill does not diminish or harm the health care innovations that \nhave occurred in Massachusetts.\n  It is my belief that Congress needs to be held responsible for its \nactions, for the policies it advocates, and the legislation that \nultimately passes through these Halls to become law. When Congress \npasses legislation that is harmful--in this case the Federal health \ncare reform legislation, which I did not support--or there is an \nunintended consequence--which I think is the case when it deals with \nMassachusetts and the innovations we have had for years, where we have \n98 percent of our people already insured--Members need to be bold \nenough to stand up and fix it regardless of party affiliation and \nregardless of whether it is popular.\n  I commend the Senator who is about to speak after me for his \nleadership on this matter. Senator Wyden has been working very \ndiligently on addressing the concerns for his State. Today I get a \nchance to do the same. Today we get an opportunity to make a correction \nto the Federal health care reform bill to be sure we are doing the \nright thing, not just for Massachusetts but for other States that seek \nto waive out of certain requirements of the Federal health care reform \nlaw.\n  In many ways, Massachusetts has been on the forefront of implementing \nhealth care reform: expanding access--as I mentioned, 98 percent of our \npeople are already insured--designing systems to increase market \nparticipation--from the Cadillac plan, all the way to the fully \nsubsidized Commonwealth Care Program--and increasing transparency for \nconsumers and providers. We continue to learn, however, lessons every \nday in Massachusetts about what works and what does not work, and we \nare continuing to work on those very issues to make sure we can do it \nbetter.\n  This is an important point because it speaks directly to the purpose \nof this piece of legislation that I have introduced in a bipartisan \nmanner with Senator Wyden from Oregon.\n  As you know, the health care reform efforts of Massachusetts are our \nown. We were one of the first States in the country to take this upon \nourselves to address the very serious problem we had in providing funds \nto hospitals that were providing care for people who were making a good \nwage but who were not paying the bills. As a result, the citizens had \nto subsidize the hospitals to the tune of over $1 billion. So we \nbelieved it was imperative for us to get something done.\n  As difficult as it is to admit this, not every State wants to be like \nMassachusetts. I understand that. They may not want to be like Oregon \neither. Massachusetts is a great State, with, I believe, the best \nhospitals, physicians, doctors, nurses, treatment facilities, research \nfacilities in the country and around the world. There is a reason why \npeople come to Massachusetts for the care and coverage they need so \nbadly.\n  But I recognize that my colleague from Oregon is interested in \nprotecting reform efforts in Oregon as well. He does not want to be \nlike Massachusetts because Oregon is different from Massachusetts. \nOregon's insurance market is different. Its provider network is \ndifferent. Its beneficiaries and population are different than in \nMassachusetts.\n  Oregon might want to implement reforms or create a coverage mechanism \nthat I do not like or that I would not want to work in the State of \nMassachusetts, but that is OK. That is what this bill is about. It \nallows the individual States to have the right to do what they believe \nis imperative and important for their particular State, which is why \nthe legislation we have introduced--the Empowering States to Innovate \nAct--is so important.\n  Right now, as provided under section 1332--the Waivers for State \nInnovation--of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, States \ncan waive out of provisions of the Federal reform law. That is the good \nnews. We are allowing States to participate in the process and allowing \nthem not to have duplicate processes or maybe potentially have lesser \ncare and coverage if the Federal health care bill is implemented. So it \nallows us to continue to provide the care and services we want to \nprovide to our citizens in Massachusetts. The bad news is, this waiver \nauthority is not scheduled to take effect until 2017. So what are we \ndoing until then--a full 3 years after the PPACA is scheduled to be \nfully implemented?\n  For me and my dear friend from Oregon it does not make any sense. \nWhen I see something that does not make any sense in Washington, I do \nmy best, regardless of party affiliation, to fix it.\n  The first thing our bill does is to allow States to waive out of \nspecific parts of the PPACA in 2014 rather than 2017. This makes sense \nnot only from an operational standpoint, because the PPACA takes effect \nin 2014, but also from an economic and fiscal standpoint. Why should \nMassachusetts be delayed in obtaining a waiver from the Federal reform \nbill when it may already have met or exceeded, in many cases, the \nprovisions of the act? So holding Massachusetts back by limiting my \nState's ability to continue to innovate and remain flexible and \nresponsive to the health care market costs money, and it costs the \ntaxpayers money at a point right now where we don't have a whole heck \nof a lot of money to go around.\n  The second piece our bill does is to provide States with certainty \nwith the waiver process. Not every State will be eligible. Let me \nrepeat that: Not every State will be eligible for a waiver and not \nevery waiver will be granted. But our bill provides some certainty for \nStates that apply for a waiver by requiring the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to begin reviewing applications within 6 months of the \nenactment of this bill. I hope this bill is enacted quickly. The \nearlier a State knows whether it has received a waiver, the earlier it \ncan begin implementing its specific plans and proposals. It makes \nfiscal sense.\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\n  Taken together, these two changes are not only good for Massachusetts \nbut potentially for other States. They are good for the other States \nthat are trying to innovate and advance in the areas of health care \nreform, cost containment, and coverage. That is what it should be. It \nshould be a symbiotic relationship between the Federal Government and \nthe States. The States should have the right to determine what they \nwant to do for their citizenry. Do we think maybe some States could do \nit better than the Federal Government? I believe when we deal with \nhealth care, Massachusetts is second to none, with all due respect to \nthe other Senators in this Chamber.\n  During Wednesday's Finance Committee hearing, Dr. Berwick, who is \nfrom the State of Massachusetts, I might add, said this about State \ninnovation and flexibility:\n\n       The cliche about states as laboratories of democracy is not \n     just a cliche, it's true. The diversity of approaches that \n     we're seeing emerge state by state has been there for long \n     time. I think we should be doing everything we can to \n     encourage it.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. I am a strong supporter of States rights, \nespecially when it makes sense, and for allowing States to solve \nproblems without the Federal Government's interference.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from the Massachusetts Hospital Association in support \nof my efforts today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Massachusetts Hospital\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                Burlington, MA, November 16, 2010.\n     Hon. Scott Brown,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: As you know, the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts has succeeded in expanding healthcare coverage \n     to more than 400,000 uninsured residents. We can be proud of \n     the fact that the state has the lowest rate of uninsured in \n     the country, which has improved the lives of so many \n     Massachusetts residents and allowed the healthcare system to \n     operate more efficiently. Our state was able to achieve \n     expanded coverage of this magnitude through innovative \n     programs like Commonwealth Care and Commonwealth Choice, \n     along with other provisions that were part of the \n     Commonwealth's 2006 healthcare reform law.\n       For these reasons, the Massachusetts Hospital Association \n     (MHA) supports the bill that you intend to introduce that \n     will advance the timeframe for waivers that were included in \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). As we \n     understand Section 1332 of PPACA, states may apply for a \n     waiver to certain requirements of the federal law so long as \n     the changes achieve healthcare coverage that is at least as \n     comprehensive as the federal law would have provided. The \n     changes are also required not to increase the federal \n     deficit. The law currently allows states to apply for such a \n     waiver beginning in January 1, 2017. Your proposed \n     legislation does not change the terms or process for \n     approving a waiver that currently exist in the PPACA but does \n     move up the date by which the waiver process may begin.\n       While the Commonwealth is still years away from decisions \n     that will be made in 2014 and beyond, we believe allowing \n     Massachusetts the opportunity to apply for such waiver \n     earlier than 2017 may allow the Commonwealth flexibility it \n     may desire to continue the success it has achieved thus far. \n     We note that Massachusetts is often referred to as a model \n     for national healthcare reform and we believe any waiver that \n     the Commonwealth would apply for, if it so chose, would seek \n     to achieve a similar goal of affordable, comprehensive health \n     insurance coverage as required by Section 1332.\n       Massachusetts hospitals have been and continue to be \n     supportive of the federal effort to expand coverage to the \n     uninsured and provide affordable health insurance for all \n     Americans. At the same time, we have stressed throughout the \n     national healthcare debate that national reform should \n     support the Commonwealth's own health reform achievements.\n       On behalf of Massachusetts member hospitals and the \n     patients they serve, we look forward to working with you to \n     preserve Massachusetts healthcare reform as the nation begins \n     to implement the national healthcare reform law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lynn Nicholas,\n                                                  President & CEO,\n                               Massachusetts Hospital Association.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Thank you, Madam President.\n  We should be encouraging State innovation and not hampering it, and \nthat is what the Empowering States to Innovate Act does. It helps \nensure that States are not held back from innovating and seeking \nsolutions that work for their citizens, their taxpayers, and their \ncommunities.\n  Finally, I wish to associate myself with the comments of the Senator \nfrom Oregon when he makes them about how our bill fits into the Federal \nhealth care reform debate. Enacting this legislation is the right thing \nto do because it is good for States such as Massachusetts and Oregon \nand Utah that have begun to make changes and reform at the State level \nthat make sense for their citizens.\n  The legislation provides flexibility and says one size fits all is \nnot appropriate and it does not always meet the needs of that \nindividual State. I know the Federal standard is not in the best \ninterests of the people of Massachusetts, which is why passing this \nbill is the right thing to do.\n  Let me say I deeply appreciate the Senator from Oregon and his effort \nto weed through the quagmire of rules and regulations and come up with \na commonsense solution. I am hopeful others in this Chamber will learn \nfrom our example, that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to \ntackle problems and try to solve them without the rhetoric and without \nthe bomb throwing and just solve problems. Because right now, we need \nmore people like the Senator from Oregon to do just that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let me commend the Senator from \nMassachusetts on a very fine statement, which I think highlights \nexactly what we are seeking to do.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has been a real pleasure to work with \non this matter. As he says, the whole point of this, as shown by the \nrecent election, is that people want to find some common ground. They \nare not interested anymore in food fights and bickering back and forth \nbetween the political parties. What Senator Brown and I are seeking to \ndo is to show it is possible on a significant issue--I think we all \nunderstand health care is about as important as it gets--that we can \ncome together, and the two of us have said we are going to come \ntogether to put the focus on innovation. It is pretty clear that what \nworks in Springfield, OR, may not be exactly ideal for Springfield, MA. \nBut what we can do is come up with a way to provide more flexibility \nand particularly more choice and more competition for our States and \nother States around the country.\n  So I am very grateful to the Senator from Massachusetts for his \neffort. It is early in the lameduck session, and it is my hope this \nwill be a signal in the Chamber that even on these difficult issues--\nissues that were so contentious in the political campaign--it is going \nto be possible to come together and find some common ground.\n  As the Senator suggests, if we can just move away from a Federal \ncookie-cutter approach and encourage the kind of creative thinking we \nhave seen in Oregon and in Massachusetts and other parts of the \ncountry, I think we will be well served and will be in a position to \nbetter contain health care costs. I think we all understand that how to \nrein in these medical costs that are gobbling up everything in sight is \nfirst and foremost on the minds of our constituents. Literally, for the \namount of money we are spending today in this country, one can go out \nand hire a doctor for every seven families in the United States and pay \nthe doctor more than $225,000 a year just for taking care of seven \nfamilies. I always bring up this as almost a metaphor for health care, \nbut usually after I am done, the physician who was listening in the \naudience comes up and says: Where can I go to get my seven families? It \nsounds like a pretty good deal. It just shows that we are spending this \nenormous sum of money.\n  What Senator Brown and I are seeking to do is to encourage additional \ninnovative approaches in States, approaches that are tailored to the \nneeds of States' own residents, that will help us, in my view, to \npromote choice and competition in the American health care system. The \nStates are free to do\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\nwhatever they choose. I just offer up my own judgment that right now, \nat a time when most Americans still don't get much choice in their \nhealth care coverage, this is an ideal opportunity that both Democrats \nand Republicans can support. As States seek to go forward with this \napproach, they can make their own choices.\n  I hope, in particular, States will take a look at what you, Madam \nPresident, the Senator from New York, and I have in our own health care \nplan. The Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan provides a lot of \nchoice, a lot of competition. You can go out and fire your insurance \ncompany if you don't think they are doing a good job. That is the kind \nof idea a State could pursue and do so, we hope, more quickly if we act \nlegislatively to speed up the waiver process. But as Senator Brown has \ncorrectly noted, this is about giving States the freedom to chart their \nown course, and I am very hopeful we will be able to get this \nlegislation passed.\n  In particular, what I have been concerned about, after talking to \nhealth policymakers over the last few months, is if, in the State of \nNew York, for example, you go out and set up a process to comply with \nthe legislation for purposes of 2014 and you see that the waiver, as \nnow constituted under 1332, starts in 2017, you say: How am I going to \nreconcile those two? Am I going to set up one approach for 2014 and \nthen do another approach in 2017? It is going to put us through a lot \nof bureaucratic water torture to try to figure out how to synchronize \nthose two dates. So it only makes sense to speed it all up and make it \npossible for everybody to get started in 2014.\n  One other point because my intentions have been much discussed. When \nI originally started talking about the State waiver, people questioned \nwhether this was something that was going to be a special opportunity \nfor Oregon and not for other States. For over a decade, I have been \npromoting the idea that all States--all States--be given the freedom to \ninnovate under health care reform legislation. In fact, to give a sense \nof how I got into this, going back and looking at the history of the \nClinton health care plan, in the early 1990s it was pretty evident that \nhad President Clinton and Republicans thought then about giving States \nthe kind of freedom Senator Brown and I envision, it might well have \nbeen possible back in the early 1990s to enact health care reform that \nwould have gotten all Americans quality, affordable coverage. That \nopportunity was missed. So I decided by the mid 1990s--if I had the \nopportunity, the honor, of representing Oregon in the Congress, I was \ngoing to use every single opportunity to let all States--and I want to \nunderline all States--have the opportunity to innovate in health care.\n  So in mid 2005 I started putting together a piece of legislation \ncalled the Healthy Americans Act. It was a bipartisan bill, that had 14 \nor 15 Senators as cosponsors, depending on when you look back at the \nlegislative history, that were almost evenly divided between the \npolitical parties. In the Healthy Americans Act, there was a specific \nsection called ``Empowering States to Innovate.'' There was a provision \nin that bill that was first introduced in 2006, and a similar provision \nwas included as section 1332 in the law the President signed.\n  So I have long been interested in letting all States have the \nopportunity to innovate. One of the reasons I have been interested--and \nmy good friend, Senator Merkley, is here--is that our State has been \none of the leaders in the whole effort to reform American health care. \nFrom time to time, folks have said I am the Senator from the State of \nWaiver rather than the State of Oregon because we have tried so often \nto pursue innovative approaches in health care waivers. We were, as \nSenator Merkley knows, one of the first States to say Medicaid dollars \nthat have been authorized for seniors to pay for services in \ninstitutions such as nursing homes should be used instead for home \nhealth care; thereby giving seniors more of what they want, which is to \nstay in their homes, at a cheaper price to taxpayers. We began those \nefforts, as Senator Merkley knows, with waivers from traditional \nFederal law. So we have a long history of doing this, and I have spent \nwell over a decade trying to establish the principle that all States \nought to have the opportunity to bring their creative juices to this \nissue of health care reform.\n  We have outlined the two key changes in the legislation that is law \ntoday. The first change is to make the waivers effective in 2014 rather \nthan in 2017 so States only have to change their systems once. The \nsecond thing the Empowering States to Innovate Act does is it requires \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to begin to review State \nwaiver applications within 6 months of enactment of the legislation. \nThis would allow States early notification of whether their State \nwaivers have been approved and would give them adequate time to roll \nout their State-specific plans. I think this, too, will help us create \nmore competition, more choice, and more affordability in American \nhealth care because it will give the States adequate time to gear up. \nThat is the philosophy behind the Empowering States to Innovate Act, \nwhether one likes one particular approach or another. Clearly, there \nwill be great diversity of approaches tried at the State level.\n  At a time when we are looking for ways to bring this country together \nto deal with the most contentious issues of our time, we ought to be \nsupporting innovation. We ought to be supporting unleashing creative \nkinds of approaches to deal with domestic issues. That is what Senator \nBrown and I propose in this legislation. I look forward to working with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I applaud the work my senior Senator \nfrom Oregon, Ron Wyden, has been doing in seeking affordable, effective \nhealth care for all Americans and, in particular, his work to utilize \nour State laboratories in developing smart health care strategies that \nthen, if successful, can become a model for the Nation.\n  This process of utilizing waivers isn't about a State wanting an \nexception so that it can be different; it is about recognizing that \nStates have powerful opportunities to form policies that work well \nunder particular circumstances but also may provide insights into our \nwhole national strategy for affordable, quality health care.\n  So for the work Senator Wyden and Senator Scott Brown are doing, I \napplaud them and support them, and I thank Senator Wyden for his \ndecades of advocacy for affordable health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8008-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8008-S8009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FOOD SAFETY\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, it is a pleasure to rise to speak about \nthe historic Food Safety Modernization Act.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin, who worked with me to include provisions to \nhelp small farms and processors and organic farms so that they have \nbefore them in this bill provisions that support them and will help \nmake them successful. The last thing we want to see is an effort to \nmake our food safety system work better be used as a tool to diminish \nthe ability of small farms and organic farms to thrive. That has been \neffectively addressed in the bill but also by provisions I will speak \nto in a while that Senator Tester is bringing forward.\n  I also compliment Senator Durbin, who has been advocating for this \nbill, working on the elements of the bill for a very long time, and his \ndetermined, tenacious advocacy is the reason this bill is on the floor \nbefore us at this moment.\n  I also appreciate the bipartisan problem-solving approach of the \nranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nSenator Enzi, and all of the members of the committee for coming \ntogether to say: This is not a Republican or a Democratic problem, this \nis a national health care issue, a national nutrition issue, and let's \ntackle it together.\n  The safety of the Nation's food supply is a serious concern for every \nfamily in Oregon and across this Nation. I wish to highlight one Oregon \nfamily in particular, Jake Hurley and his dad Peter. I am sure they are \nvery happy to see that we have this bill on the floor, and they will be \nparticularly thrilled when we have it on the President's desk because \nthe issue of tracing contaminated food is an issue that has affected \ntheir family very directly.\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\n  This picture is one of Jake taken when his father Peter came with him \nto Washington, DC, to testify before this Congress and share their \nstory. Jake's favorite food was peanut butter crackers. When he was 3 \nyears old, he became very, very ill. Those crackers he loved so much \nwere the source of his illness, but because we didn't have an effective \ntracking system, there was no recall and there was no understanding \nthat the crackers were contaminated. So in his illness, his family \ncontinued to share with him his favorite comfort food--those same \npeanut butter crackers that were making him extremely ill. It turns out \nthey were contaminated with salmonella, and the result was that a \nchild's snack ended up putting Jake's life in danger.\n  The Food and Drug Administration had already determined that peanut \nbutter was a cause of sickening people across the country, but they \nhadn't been able to trace the peanut butter and know it had made its \nway into processed products--in particular, the product Jake was \nconsuming. The Peanut Corporation of America, a peanut processing \nfacility in Georgia, had contaminated peanut butter that went into \nthousands of products, sickening 714 people in 46 States, including \nOregon, and killing 9. The Hurleys and countless other families have \nbeen waiting for Congress to pass this bill so that other families \ndon't have to be worried that their children will become terribly sick \nbecause we can't track contaminated food.\n  This bill requires the FDA to create rules for tracing processed \nfoods, such as the peanut butter crackers that made Jake sick last \nyear. It took the FDA over a year to trace all the products that the \npeanut butter went into during that outbreak in 2009. It is still not \nclear that they ever found all of the products. This is unacceptable. \nProvisions in this bill will help prevent not only future outbreaks but \nalso future problems tracking down the contaminated food products.\n  In my work in the HELP Committee, I secured a provision to ensure \nthat in addition to tracing produce, which was already in the bill, we \nset up a pilot project to calculate the best practices for tracing \nprocessed food, which is a more difficult undertaking. But after the \nbill came out of committee, Senator Sherrod Brown worked hard to build \non that, and he has strengthened the tracing provisions further in the \nbill. I certainly thank him for doing that. The bill now requires the \nFDA to create regulations ensuring quick and accurate tracing of all \ntypes of contaminated food.\n  Better tracing of contaminated food and better coordination between \nlocal, State, and Federal food safety officials can help prevent \nchildren like Jet Valenzuela from getting food poisoning. I turn now to \na picture of Jet. I met Jet earlier this summer in Oregon. This is a \npicture of him in the hospital 2 years ago, when he became violently \nill from contaminated food. He had a deadly form of E. coli. He was \nhospitalized in Bend, OR. He became so ill that he was flown to \nPortland for more intensive care. Jet underwent multiple surgeries, \nblood transfusions, and was eventually put into a medically induced \ncoma. He came within a hair's breath of dying twice. The scariest part \nof Jet's story is that we were never able to find what made him sick, \ndespite their best efforts, because we didn't have the type of produce \nand processed food procedures that could assist in tracking down the \nsource.\n  So for Jet and Jake, it is urgent to pass this bill. Not only does \nthis help respond, but it helps prevent food outbreaks. No family \nshould have to go through what these families went through. Most \nparents, including myself, have spent a lot of time worrying about how \nto keep their kids safe, but we should not have to worry about how to \nprotect our children from the food on our plates.\n  Implementing food safety provisions has to be done in a way that \nsupports our small farms, our family farms. We cannot have a process \nthat hinders them in operating successfully or puts unnecessary \nrestrictions in their path.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin for including language in the bill that I \nsuggested, so that no new regulations would conflict with or duplicate \nthe requirements of the National Organic Program. This ensures that \nthere will not be any food safety regulations that would put their \norganic certification in jeopardy.\n  I wish to draw attention to the work Senator Tester has done. He \nauthored provisions that provide reasonable exemptions for very small \nfarms and processors--farms that sell their products directly to local \nconsumers, farms that sell their products directly to local restaurants \nor to local grocery stores. This comprises only about 1 percent of our \nnational food production, but it is a very important part of our local \neconomies, a very important foundation for our family farms. So I am \nproud to support the work Senator Tester has done in making sure our \nsmall local farms are fully accounted for and supported in this \nlegislation.\n  Also in this bill are exemptions for farms that produce low-risk \nfood, no matter what their size. This is a type of logical flexibility \nto make regulations apply when they are needed and not provide \nunnecessary restrictions or hurdles when they are not.\n  In conclusion, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. It \nwill improve the tracing of contaminated food, whether that be produce \nor processed. It will increase inspections. It will create safety \nguidelines for farms and processors. It will protect organic farms, \nprotect small farms.\n  This bill works to prevent contamination as well so that we can avoid \nunnecessary illness and death. Improvements to tracing contaminated \nfood will not only prevent illness but will prevent costly recalls for \nfarms and food processors who are not at fault for a particular \ncontamination.\n  Most important, this bill will help other families avoid what Jake \nand Jet and their parents went through. Parents should be able to pack \ntheir children's lunch boxes without fear.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we have a lot to do and not much time \nto do it in before the end of the session. The American people spoke \nloudly and clearly on election day. They want us to put aside the \nliberal wish list and focus on jobs. The most important thing we can do \nto create jobs between now and January 1 is to send a message to job \ncreators that we are not going to raise their taxes. That is why I \noffered a bill back in September--S. 3773--that would make current tax \nrates permanent. This is the only bill that has yet been offered that \nwould prevent a tax hike on anyone. In other words, nobody in America \nwould get a tax hike at the end of this year.\n  The White House didn't seem to like that idea. They said we should \nraise taxes on small businesses. But this should be an easy one. We \nshould be promoting private job creation, not killing private job \ncreation. So I look forward to hearing any ideas the White House has to \nachieve that.\n  One thing we will need to do before we leave this year is to fund the \ngovernment because Democrats didn't pass a single appropriations bill \nthis year. So now we will have to mop up in the eleventh hour with an \nomnibus spending bill that covers all of it. This is one more sign they \naren't learning many lessons from the election.\n  If this election showed us anything, it is that Americans don't want \nCongress passing massive trillion-dollar bills that have been thrown \ntogether behind closed doors. They want us to do business differently. \nSo I will not be supporting an omnibus spending bill. We have seen what \nhappens when Democrats rush legislation and try to jam it through at \nthe last minute, with no time for review or for the American people to \nlearn what is actually in the bill. The ``Cornhusker kickback'' and\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\nthe ``Louisiana purchase'' are fresh on their minds.\n  Americans want us to take our time and get things right, and they \nwant us to spend less. The voters have spoken. We need to show that we \nheard them.\n\n\n                        Terrorist Ahmed Ghailani\n\n  Madam President, yesterday's acquittal in a Federal court of accused \nterrorist Ahmed Ghailani on all but 1 of 285 charges of conspiracy and \nmurder is all the proof we need that the administration's approach to \nprosecuting terrorists has been deeply misguided and, indeed, \npotentially harmful as a matter of national security.\n  You will recall that Attorney General Holder assured the American \npeople last year that Ghailani would not be acquitted of the charges \nagainst him. Holder said back then:\n\n       With his appearance in Federal Court today, Ahmed Ghailani \n     is being held accountable for his alleged role in the bombing \n     of U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and the murder of 224 \n     people.\n\n  Holder also said back then that Ghailani's prosecution in civilian \ncourt would prove its effectiveness in trying terrorists who were \npicked up on the battlefield.\n  At the time, most Americans wondered why we would even take the \nchance. Now they are wondering when the administration will admit it \nwas wrong and assure us, just as confidently, that terrorists will be \ntried from now on--from now on--in the military commission system that \nwas established for this very purpose at the secure facility at \nGuantanamo Bay or detained indefinitely if they cannot be tried without \njeopardizing national security.\n  When it comes to terrorism, we should err on the side of protecting \nthe American people.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I wish to make a brief statement about \nthe food safety bill. I very much appreciate the opportunity now that \nthis important legislation is shaping up to be a much better bill with \nthe inclusion of my amendment for family-scale producers. It protects \nthe jobs of family farmers and ranchers and processors. It is time to \nget this bill passed and strengthen food safety for all Americans.\n  There is little disagreement that the necessity of this bill is real. \nIf you take a look at the impacts of recent E. coli outbreaks, of \nsalmonella and those kinds of foodborne diseases out there, it is \nabsolutely critical we get this bill passed. I had some concerns with \nthis bill as it was originally introduced, on its impacts to family-\nsized growers and processors. The fact of the matter is, these are \nfolks who help build this country, and undue regulation on them--and I \ndo believe it would be undue regulation--would simply stop a movement \nin this country that has gone on since this country's inception, but \nmore recently we have gone back to it with locally produced foods.\n  It is critically important my amendment be part of this bill. I \nappreciate everybody who worked to make that happen. Here is why. We \ndeal with consolidation in our energy sector, we deal with \nconsolidation in our banking sector--we have done it since I have \ngotten here, and before. We have consolidation in our food industry \ntoo. The fact is, we need to not encourage that consolidation. If we \ncan get more locally grown food, if we get producers who connect up \nwith consumers eyeball to eyeball, that is a positive thing. I don't \nwant to diminish their ability to do that. My amendment protects the \nability for farmers markets to flourish and provide food for people \nlocally, without shipping it halfway around the world and back again. \nYet this bill also puts regulations on the industrialized folks \nbecause, frankly, with the size of their operations and because they \nare highly mechanized, when a mistake is made it can affect hundreds of \nthousands of people in 10, 20, 30 States. So this bill is a win-win for \nconsumers, both locally and consumers who deal with the more highly \nindustrialized food suppliers.\n  People have asked me why do you think the small guys can even be \nregulated by the local and State regulators in this country? First of \nall, they are small and there is a pride of ownership there that is \nreal. They raise food, they don't raise a commodity, as happens when \noperations get bigger and bigger. There is a direct customer \nrelationship with that processor or that farmer that means a lot. If a \nmistake is made--which rarely happens--it doesn't impact hundreds of \nthousands of people. We know exactly where the problem was and we know \nexactly how to fix it. So the traceability of the outbreaks is \nimmediate and is taken care of without impacting 20 or 30 States and \nhundreds of thousands of people.\n  As we move forward with this bill, I think it is incredibly important \nthat we do things as we did in the last farm bill--move forward with \nlocally grown food, move forward with that farmers market model that \nhelps people get to know the people who produce and process their food. \nWe don't want to throw undue paperwork on those folks. They don't have \nthe ability to do it. It takes them out of the field to do that, and \nhonestly, as they move forward, the consumer and the connection with \nthat consumer makes it so that local entities can do that regulation \nmuch better than we can, anyway.\n  We have been over a pretty long road here over the last many months. \nI very much appreciate the work Representative Dingell has done, in the \nHouse, on this bill. I very much appreciate the work that was done on \nmy amendment over here. Kay Hagan in particular, a great Senator from \nNorth Carolina, worked closely with me on this amendment and her input \nwas incredibly valuable. I also thank Senator Merkley and the work he \ndid on the amendment. I thank the consumers groups out there that I \nthink found a commonsense solution to this issue, and many of the \norganizations we worked with over the last many months to make sure \nthis bill meets the needs of the people, to make sure we do address the \nissue of foodborne illnesses and safe food but yet allows the little \nguys to grow, employ people, and allow that economy to get bigger and \nbetter as time goes on.\n  This is an important bill we need to get done. It makes sense for \nthis country and it makes sense for people in agriculture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\nremember the very first time I sat where you are sitting now, Madam \nPresident. Throughout my time as a Member of this august body, I have \nhad the opportunity to spend more than 200 hours in the Presiding \nOfficer's chair and have earned two Golden Gavels. I also had the honor \nof delivering our first President's--President George Washington's--\nFarewell Address on his birthday of this year to this august body. From \nthe chair, I have had the opportunity to listen to the words of my \ncolleagues and reflect upon the great debate that unfolds each and \nevery day--as it has always done throughout our Nation's history--in \nthis, the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n\n  We come to this Chamber from every State in the Union--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents alike. Each of us carries the solemn \nresponsibility of giving voice to the concerns of those we represent. \nAlthough we do not always agree, as the debate on this floor will often \nshow, I am always struck by the passion that drives each and every \nSenator to stand in this singular place in the world and to speak their \nmind. It is this passion that will always define this Chamber for me. \nFor all the weight of history--for all the great and eloquent \nsentiments that have been expressed by our forefathers--on a \nfundamental level this remains a very human place.\n  We stand today, as the Members of this body have done frequently \nthroughout our great Republic's history, at a critical moment. \nPartisanship and obstructionism threaten to somewhat paralyze this \ngreat institution. But it is a testament to the inherent wisdom and \ndurability of the Senate--of the rules and the tradition that govern \nthis institution--that even in the face of great discord we have had \nthe high privilege of serving in the most productive Congress in \ngenerations.\n  Despite our many differences, I believe the men and women who make up \nthis Senate remain its greatest strength. It has been the honor of my \nlifetime to once again represent the people of Illinois and to do so in \nthe Senate. First, as a cabinet member for our Governor, as the \nIllinois State comptroller, and as Illinois attorney general, the \npeople of my State placed in me a sacred trust and one that throughout \nmy 30 years in public service I made into my life's work: to serve the \npeople of my State to the very best of my ability.\n  In my younger years, shortly after graduating from law school at \nHoward University, not far from where we stand today, I was turned off \nby a city with far too much government. I headed to Chicago, convinced \nthat I would not return to this city unless I could be an effective and \nmeaningful part of the solution to the many challenges we face and \ndreaming of a time I might come back to Washington as a Senator or as \nVice President of the United States.\n  That dream took longer to achieve than I could have imagined that \nday, but in a towering testament to the vibrancy of the American dream, \nthat day came. After decades of experience in the executive branch of \nIllinois government, I was sworn in as a Senator for Illinois, and this \nbecame my first introduction to serving as a legislator. It was the \nsteepest of learning curves, but with the warm assistance of my Senate \ncolleagues, the steady support of my loving family, and the dedication \nof my tireless staff, I could not be more proud of what we have been \nable to accomplish together.\n  To my family, my friends, and my staff I owe the deepest thanks. My \nwife Berlean has always been by my side, and I will always be grateful \nbeyond words for her constant support. My son, Roland II and his wife \nMarty, and my daughter Rolanda are the pride and joy of my life. Of \ncourse, they were just here yesterday, my two grandchildren, Roland \nTheodore and Ian Alexander, to whom I dedicate my service and for whom \nI have the greatest hopes and even greater expectations.\n  To my friends and supporters from Chicago to Centralia, I will never \nforget your smiles and your kind words during even the most difficult \nof times. To my staff, in DC and those in Springfield, Moline and \nCarbondale, you have been some of the most dedicated, talented, and \nprofessional individuals with whom I ever had the privilege to serve. \nFrom the front office staff assistants and interns answering the \nendless ringing telephones, to my circle of senior advisers who gave me \nwise and thoughtful counsel throughout, my team has been indispensable \nto me, and they have all served the people of Illinois with \ndistinction. I am deeply grateful for their service.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete list of my \nstaff be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BURRIS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I wish to extend a special word of gratitude to my old friend who is \nsitting right there, the Sergeant at Arms, Terry Gainer; the Secretary \nof the Senate, Nancy Erickson; the secretary for the majority--where \ndid she go--Lula Davis; for their many kindnesses, and a thank-you to \nthe Senate Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black, for his counsel and prayers \nduring my time here.\n  I also wish to acknowledge my fellow freshman Senators: Senators \nBegich, Bennett, Franken, Gillibrand; the Presiding Officer, the North \nCarolinian, Senator Hagan; as well as Senators Merkley, Shaheen, Mark \nUdall, Tom Udall, Mark Warner, and our just departed Senator Kaufman \nfrom Delaware. They are tremendous individuals possessing incredible \ntalents and have been a very supportive group for me. Thank you, my \nfreshman colleagues.\n  In a broader sense I wish to also thank all of those who serve under \nthis hallowed dome with quiet and often unheralded dignity and duty. \nThe Senate floor staff, you all do a heck of a job--the maintenance \ncrews, the elevator operators, the Capitol Police, the Senate train \ndrivers, the dining room servers, and the scores of others whose hard \nand important work ensures the smooth and constant operations of the \nbusiness that takes place within our Capitol.\n  As I stand to address this Chamber for the last time, I cannot help \nbut reflect on the unlikely path that led me to this point and upon the \nchallenges we continue to face. When I first came to the Senate nearly \n2 years ago, our Nation was only days away from inaugurating an \nAfrican-American man from Chicago as the 44th President of the United \nStates of America. It was a national milestone I never thought I would \never live to see, an incredible moment that speaks volumes about the \nprogress our country has made even in my lifetime.\n  As a child, I knew the injustice of segregation. When I was only \nabout 15 years old, I helped integrate the swimming pool in my hometown \nof Centralia, IL. Although that incident drove me to pursue a life of \npublic service--dedicating myself to the goals of becoming both a \nlawyer and a statewide elected official--there was never any guarantee \nthat such a path would be open to me. There were no people of color in \nelected office in those days, especially not in Illinois and not in \nCentralia, and there was no path to follow. So I knew from the start \nthat I would have to blaze a trail.\n  Despite the lack of established role models, my parents provided \nnothing but support and encouragement. They nurtured my dreams and \nhelped me develop the skills to achieve them. In the end, they and my \nolder brother Earl, who is now deceased, and my sister Doris, God bless \nher, who is still living, were the only role models I needed. The \nvalues they instilled in me--of hard work, determination, and \nunwavering dedication to principle--have guided me throughout my life, \nand the same values have driven me to take an interest in the next \ngeneration.\n  It is that focus on the future that drives all of our legislative \nenergy, to constantly improve the quality of life for the generations \nto come.\n  Not too many generations ago, my family roots told a different story. \nI stand in this Chamber as the great-grandson of a man who was born \ninto slavery, in an era when this Senate debated whether he and others \nlike him were worthy of freedom and equal treatment under the law. Yet \ntoday I stand among my colleagues on the Senate floor, a Member of the \nhighest body of lawmakers in this land. In some ways, this is a \nremarkable testament to our Nation's ability to correct the\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\nwrongs of generations past, to move always toward that ``more perfect \nUnion.''\n  However, in other ways, it is a solemn reminder of how far we still \nhave yet to go. In a country as progressive and diverse as any on this \nplanet, I am today the only Black American Member of this Senate. Aside \nfrom myself, I can count the number of Blacks who have served in this \nbody on the fingers of a single hand: Blanche K. Bruce, Hiram Revels; \nEdward Brooke, the last from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, and our \nPresident, Barack Obama.\n\n  Throughout 220 years of Senate history and 111 Congresses, only six \nBlack Americans have been able to serve. This is troubling in its own \nright. But when the 112th Congress is sworn in this coming January, \nthere will not be a single Black American taking the oath of office in \nthis Chamber.\n  This is simply unacceptable. We can and we will and we must do \nbetter. In this regard, and in others, our political process has proven \nless successful and less representative than it ought to be. Although I \nhave never allowed my race to define me, in a sense it has meant that \nmy constituency as a Senator has stretched far beyond the boundaries of \nIllinois.\n  Letters, e-mails, and telephone calls have poured in to my office \nfrom Black Americans from all across the country, and at times, as I \nhave tried to bring their voices to this Chamber, I have acutely felt \nthe absence of any other Black person to represent them.\n  Our government hardly resembles the diverse country it was elected to \nrepresent. Partisan bickering has driven moderates out of both parties \nand made principled compromise more difficult for those who remain. Too \noften our politics seem to have become a zero-sum game. It is easy for \npeople to believe that the best argument or the plainest truth would \nnot necessarily win the day anymore. In such a destructive political \nenvironment, people are often left wondering who will speak up for \nthem. And the media certainly isn't blameless. News outlets which could \nplay a critical role in educating the American public with facts too \noften bow to ratings or quick sales and, in the process, end up \nchoosing to pursue the entertainment value of conflict over thoughtful \nanalysis.\n  This is the harsh reality we face.\n  America just can not afford this any longer. We should check these \nnotions at the cloakroom door.\n  This is a critical moment.\n  So I believe it's the responsibility of everyone in this chamber to \ntake ownership of this process once again, to demonstrate leadership, \nand pledge a return to more responsible rhetoric, and more responsive \ngovernment.\n  What we face is a test--not only of our willingness to meet the \nchallenges we face, but of the democratic institutions designed to cope \nwith these challenges.\n  Here in the U.S. Senate, this question is paramount.\n  Have our destructive politics left this great body locked in a \nstalemate--unable to move forward, because of the petty obstructionism \nthat has taken root?\n  Or can this Chamber be made to address these problems once again? Can \nit be redeemed, by the good people who serve here?\n  I have confidence that it can.\n  It will require the concerted effort of all one hundred Senators to \novercome the partisanship that has paralyzed this chamber, and the \nobstructionist tactics that have become the rule rather than the \nexception.\n  Colleagues, this is the moment to summon the strength of our \nconvictions, and fight for what we believe in.\n  This is the hour for principled leadership, originating right here in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  But even as we look to the future and debate the agenda for the \nupcoming year, I must note with regret that my time here is nearly at \nan end.\n  Serving as a Member of this body, alongside so many fine colleagues \nwho have become good friends, has been the honor of a lifetime.\n  Together we have achieved passage of the most ambitious legislative \nagenda since the Great Depression. And a great deal of the credit for \nour success is owed to Leader Harry Reid.\n  And I am proud of every vote I cast in the name of the people of \nIllinois, and proud of the more than the 60 bills I sponsored and over \n300 I have cosponsored.\n  In the 22 months I have been a Member of the Senate, I have advocated \nfor comprehensive health care reform designed to meet the goals of a \npublic option, and fought to address health care disparities that \nseparate minority communities from the population as a whole; pushed \nfor redirection of subsidized funds that made $68 billion available for \nnew Pell grants and extended new opportunities for minority students to \nattend historically Black colleges and universities, and predominantly \nBlack Institutions; stood up for minority-owned businesses, and made \nsure they will have equal opportunity to share in America's renewed \nprosperity as our economy continues to recover; worked hard to extend \nunemployment insurance, improve access to COBRA benefits, and create \njobs for the people of Illinois and across the country; voted for the \nsweeping stimulus package that brought this country back from the brink \nof economic disaster and started us on the road to recovery; introduced \nlegislation that would improve transparency and accountability as \nstimulus dollars are spent, so the American people can keep their \nelected officials honest; cosponsored legislation to repeal the \nmilitary's discriminatory don't ask, don't tell policy, so all of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and marines can serve openly and had a press \nconference on that.\n  I say to my colleagues, don't filibuster that issue. We need all of \nour individuals to have an opportunity to serve in the military \nservice, regardless of their sexual orientation. Don't be surprised if \nI come back for that vote. I am from Chicago, and I will vote twice. I \nsupported major credit card reforms, to prevent credit card companies \nfrom abusing their customers; fought for equal pay and benefits for \nwomen, to cut down on workplace discrimination; fought for additional \nimpact aid funding, to shore up federal support for school districts \nthat serve military communities and other Federal activities; honored \nthe accomplishments of pioneers like Vice Admiral Samuel Gravely, the \nfirst African American to serve as a flag officer in the Navy, and the \nMontford Marines, the first African-American Marine division; supported \nthe Matthew Shepard Act, which will help make sure those who target \npeople based on sexual orientation, race, or other factors are brought \nto justice; raised my voice on behalf of Main Street, and all those who \nhave been left behind in our continuing economic recovery, so that \neveryone can share in the benefits; introduced legislation calling for \nthe Department of the Interior to study a historic site called New \nPhiladelphia, IL--the first settlement founded by a freed African-\nAmerican slave--for its preservation as part of the National Park \nsystem.\n\n  I hope, as a legacy to Burris, that someday that legislation will \npass.\n  I raised awareness of youth violence, which threatens our children \nand tears our inner cities apart--and must be stopped; fought for \nveterans' benefits, including the implementation of the new GI bill, so \nwe can honor the service of those who defend our freedom.\n  And now, as we ready to close the books on the one hundred and \neleventh Congress and the long and significant chapter of legislative \naccomplishment, it is time for a new class of Senators to join this \nfight.\n  I am deeply grateful to my friends on both sides of the aisle for the \npassion they bring to their work every day.\n  I have witnessed it from the Presiding Officer's chair--and have had \nthe privilege not only to watch the debate but to take part.\n  But now it is time for me to find new ways to serve.\n  This is the arena where great ideas are put to the test, on a \nnational stage. This is where our identity is forged anew, every day, \nand where our principles are challenged.\n  It is the heart of our democratic process. And although there will be \nfew easy solutions for the problems we face, I will never forget the \ncourage and patriotism that I have seen from countless citizens of \nIllinois and America over the course of my time here.\n  This is a trying time for our Nation. But as long as the American \npeople have the wisdom to elect leaders like the ones I have come to \nknow in this Chamber--and as long as this Senate remains true to the \npeople we serve--I\n\n[[Page S8013]]\n\nwill never lose faith in our ability to overcome these challenges \ntogether.\n  These are my parting remarks from this body. I treat this as an \nopportunity of a lifetime, and I treat this with great respect and \ndignity for all of those I have worked with and have come to know in \nthis body.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, I thank all my colleagues, and I yield \nthe floor for the final time. God bless you all. Thank you.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Office of Senator Roland W.

Mr. President, as I see my colleague, Senator Burris, \nstill on the floor, I wish to thank him for his excellent work and his \ncomments today. He will certainly be missed by all of us.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I thank the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 510, the FDA \nFood Safety Modernization Act, and also in support of an amendment I \ncosponsored with my colleague from Montana, Senator Jon Tester. \n  Each year, upwards of 70 million Americans are sickened from \nfoodborne illnesses. Thousands of the most vulnerable, including \nchildren and the elderly, die. I do not think there is anyone who has \nnot heard of the massive recall of millions of tainted eggs that \nsickened nearly 1,500 people. We need to find a better way to protect \nAmericans from these tragic deaths.\n  During the HELP Committee's consideration of the bill late last year, \nwe had the opportunity to hear from Dan Ragan, director of the North \nCarolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Food and Drug \nProtection Division, about the innovative steps that North Carolina is \ntaking to prevent and address food safety problems. North Carolina was \none of the first pilot States for the Manufactured Food Regulatory \nProgram Standards, MFRPS. And North Carolina has a robust training \nprogram for those dealing with food safety issues. I am proud that my \nState is leading the way forward in trying to prevent and quickly \naddress foodborne illnesses.\n  At the same time, North Carolina is a farming State. And in my State, \nwe have honest farmers who work very hard to make a living. \nUnfortunately, oftentimes when there is a food safety breach followed \nby a massive recall, the producers or farmers suffer dire financial \nconsequences. Farmers are at the front of the food supply chain and \nfrequently are not responsible for the food safety breach further down \nthe line.\n  Many farmers in North Carolina are still struggling, particularly \nafter the salmonella outbreak at the Peanut Corporation of America and \nafter the massive recall of tomatoes nationwide in 2008.\n  One such farm is Patterson Farms, a third generation family-run farm \nin China Grove, NC. The family has been growing tomatoes since 1919 \nwhen James A. Patterson began growing vegetables.\n  Currently, Patterson Farms, Inc., operated by James A. Patterson's \ngrandsons, Doug and Randall, grows about 350 acres of tomatoes, \nincluding mature green, vine ripe, and Roma tomatoes. In addition to \ngrowing tomatoes, the Pattersons grade, pack, and ship their tomatoes \nacross the United States and Canada. Patterson Farms is currently the \nlargest tomato grower in the State of North Carolina.\n  The 2008 erroneous safety citation for tomatoes by the Food and Drug \nAdministration cost the Pattersons dearly. While consumer demand for \ntomatoes dropped between 50 and 60 percent, Patterson Farms lost \nhundreds of thousands of dollars. The damage was so severe that Doug \nand Randall could not pay back their farm operating loan at the end of \nthe year--marking the first time in the history of Patterson Farms that \nthey were not able to pay back their operating loan.\n  In fact, they had to borrow more money to stay in business. With very \nnarrow profit margins, the massive recalls such as this certainly can \njeopardize the financial stability of farms that have been in families \nfor generations. That is why I think the FDA needs to be very sure \nabout the source of a foodborne illness when it institutes a recall, \nand why I fought hard to include a provision in this bill to look at \nnew and existing mechanisms available to provide restitution.\n  Specifically, the language in this bill directs the GAO to conduct a \nreview within 3 months on new and existing mechanisms available to \nprovide restitution in the event of an erroneous mandatory food safety \nrecall. If such mechanisms do not exist or are inadequate, then within \n90 days the Secretary of Agriculture must conduct a feasibility study \non implementing a restitution program.\n  One false recall can put a family farm out of business. And while I \nsupport giving the FDA mandatory recall authority, I want to make sure \nthere are enough protections in place for farms such as the Patterson \nfarm, which were brought to the brink of bankruptcy through no fault of \ntheir own. This study language is an important step in ensuring that \nfarmers are treated fairly.\n  I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment by my colleague \nSenator Tester, which will be included in the final bill. While I \nbelieve strengthening our food safety standards and giving FDA the \nenforcement authority it needs is critical to ensuring public safety, \nthis bill would have imposed Federal regulation on even the smallest \nfood producers, including family farms.\n  Take, for example, a small family farm in North Carolina that \nproduces homemade jams and jellies to sell on their farm, at the \nfarmers market, or to the local food co-op. This farm would have to \nregister with the FDA and develop a costly hazard analysis and risk-\nbased preventive control plan, similar to the plans required of large \nfood companies. Small producers in North Carolina already have to use a \nNorth Carolina Department of Agriculture-approved commercial kitchen to \nmake these products.\n  To allow small producers to remain in business, this amendment \nensures that the smallest producers selling directly to consumers can \ncontinue being regulated at the State level. Also, farmers raising \nproduce to sell directly to consumers at farmers markets and food co-\nops face significantly different issues and pose less risk than those \nselling into the industrial supply chain, and should not be regulated \nin the same way.\n  North Carolina is a farming State, and I value farming as an \ninstitution that is central to my State and America's history and our \nculture. In my\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\nState we have honest farmers who work very hard to make a living.\n  I believe, with the restitution study language, and with the adoption \nof the Tester-Hagan amendment, this food safety bill strikes the right \nbalance between protecting the public health from foodborne illnesses \nwhile ensuring our Nation's farmers can continue to feed Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8014-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to spend a few minutes \ndiscussing the bill that is before us. Having been a manufacturing \nmanager for 10 years, producing products that came through the medical \ndevice industry, and having dealt with the FDA as a manufacturer and \nthen having dealt with the FDA and the consequences of the FDA as a \nphysician over the last 25 years and then looking at this bill that is \non the floor today, I think it addresses three things I have talked \nabout, especially in Oklahoma over the last year.\n  Everybody recognizes this Nation is at a critical point--fiscally, \ninternationally. From the standpoint of foreign policy, it has been \nimpacted by our fiscal problems. But there are three structural reasons \nwhy I think we are there, and I think we need to learn from them. This \nbill provides us a great example.\n  The first is, as a physician--and I knew it as a business manager--\nyou have to fix real problems. If you fix the symptoms that have been \ncreated or the circumstances that have been created by the real \nproblems, you will make things better for a while, but you actually \nwill not solve the underlying problem. What happens when you do not \nsolve the underlying problem and fix the symptoms is, you delay the \ntime and you also increase the consequences of not fixing the real \nproblems.\n  Second, if you only think short term, you do not have the planning \nstrategy with which to do the best, right thing in the long term. We \nconsistently do that in Washington. Consequently, the CBO put out the \nunfunded liabilities for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security \nyesterday. It is now $88.9 trillion. It was $77 trillion last year. It \nwas $63 trillion the year before. So we are up $26 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities that we are going to pass on to our kids in 3 years because \nwe continue to think short term instead of long term.\n  Then, the fourth thing is to have the courage to stand and say: No, \nwe should not do things that address the symptoms; we should address \nthe underlying problems. No, we should not think short term or \nparochially; we should think long term and address that issue.\n  As to the food safety bill, all my colleagues are very well intended \nin terms of what they are trying to accomplish with it. But there are \nsome facts we ought to be realistic about. We could spend $100 billion \nadditionally every year and not make food absolutely safe. There are \ndiminishing returns to the dollars we spend. But if you look at what \nthe case is: In 1996, for every 100,000 people in this country, we had \n51.2 cases of foodborne illness--the best in the world, by far. Nobody \ncomes close to us in terms of the safety of our food. But, in 2009, we \nonly had 34.8 cases--three times better than anybody else in the world. \nSo the question has to be asked: Why are we doing this now when, in \nfact, we are on a trendline to markedly decrease it? The second \nquestion that should be asked is: No matter how much money we spend, is \nthere a diminishing return?\n  There are a lot of things in this bill that I agree with--a lot. I \nthink foreign food ought to be inspected before it comes into this \ncountry and I think those who want to sell products in this country \nought to have to demonstrate the quality of it and I think the cost of \nthat ought to be on the person selling the food, not on the American \ntaxpayer. But ultimately that cost will be added to the cost of the \nfood.\n  I think the recognition of peanut allergy is a realistic one, and I \nunderstand the purpose for wanting a grant for that. But as I read the \nConstitution, that is a State function. That is not our function. The \nother thing that bothers me about the grant proposals--I walked out of \nthe deficit commission to come over here. I have spent 8 months in that \ncommission looking at the problems in front of this country. We cannot \nafford another grant program. We do not have the money.\n  So we can say we are going to authorize it in this bill, but, do you \nknow what, it is not going to get funded next year because we do not \nhave the money. When the interest rates skyrocket in less than a year \nfrom now because of our misplaced spending over the past 20 years and \nour continued short-term decisionmaking instead of long-term \ndecisionmaking, our situation is going to grow even darker. So this \nbill provides a wonderful example of how we ought to fix the real \nproblems instead of the symptoms of the problems.\n  The other thing that truly is not addressed is the long-term \ncriticisms the GAO has continually made on our food safety. Senator \nHarkin has the best idea of all, but he could not get everybody to do \nit; that is, an independent food safety agency, to where we are not \nrelying on the CDC, we are not relying on the FDA, we are not relying \non the Department of Agriculture, that we put them all into one and \nsay: You are responsible for food safety. But he could not sell that.\n  Ask yourself the question: If you had three different agencies \nstepping all over each other with different sets of rules with \nagreements between themselves that they will do certain things, and \nthen they do not do them--that, by the way, is why we had the \nsalmonella problem; they did not follow their own protocols to notify \nthe FDA of the problem--most commonsense thinking people would say: \nWell, maybe you ought to put all those things into one agency, with one \nboss and one line of accountability and responsibility.\n  So Senator Harkin is absolutely right in where he wants to go. We are \ngoing to spend $1.5 billion over the next 5 years on this bill that \ndoes not accomplish what we need to accomplish, which is what Senator \nHarkin wants to do--and he is right--and we are not going to fix the \ncriticisms that have been leveled against the agencies by the GAO for 8 \nyears, in spite of the fact, as I stand here and am critical of \ndifferent agencies, they actually have done a very good job. That is \nknown by the fact that our incidence of foodborne illness is now less \nthan 34 per 100,000 people. Think about that. Think about all the \nsources of food we get in this country and the diverse places they come \nfrom. Yet only 34 people get a staph poisoning or a nontoxigenic E. \ncoli poisoning or a salmonella poisoning or a Yersinia poisoning or a \nShigella poisoning in a year. So that is the incidence of illness.\n  The question is, How do we stop the 10 or 20 deaths a year from \nfoodborne illness? Can we do that? Well, as a physician trained in \nepidemiology, we could do it. But I will posit we do not have the money \nto do that because it would take billions upon billions upon billions \nof additional dollars to ever get there. So we find ourselves in a \ndilemma.\n  I commend to my colleagues the reports GAO-09-523, GAO-09-873, and \nGAO-05-213.\n  The GAO does a wonderful job telling us where we are failing, and we \nought to address everything they raised in these reports.\n  Even further than that, Dr. Hamburg, around the time we were having \nthe salmonella with the eggs problem, released an egg standard. The \nbureaucracy took 11 years to develop that standard. That falls on the \nshoulders of President Bush's administration as\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\nwell as this one. I am proud of her that she got it out. But the fact \nis, 11 years to do what you are responsible for, to get an egg standard \nso we do not have significant salmonella poisoning coming from eggs? \nThen, lo and behold, after the egg standard is out, the FDA inspectors \non farms in Iowa are violating their own protocols, cross-contaminating \negg farms, as documented in the press.\n  It is not a matter that we do not have enough rules and regulations. \nThat is borne out by the fact that we are continually seeing a decline \nin foodborne illness. That is not the real problem. The problem is \neffectively carrying out the regulations that are there today. So we \nhave a bill on the floor that has 150 to 170 pages--I cannot recall \nexactly how many it is--here it is. It is 266 pages of new regulations, \nnew rules, new requirements.\n  Let me tell you something else I learned about dealing with the FDA. \nThe FDA overall in this country does a fantastic job. They do. They are \nvery professional. They are very slow sometimes, but they are very \nprofessional, and they are very cautious. In this bill is a mandate to \nrequire recalls. Not once in our history have we had to force anybody \nto do a recall. It has always been voluntary, and you can check with \nthe FDA on that. They do not need that authority. Why don't they need \nthat authority? Because if you have a problem with your product in the \nfood system in this country, you are going to get sued. You are going \nto get fined if you do not recall that product.\n  What is wrong with a potential mandatory recall? What is wrong is it \nis going to markedly raise the cost of foods. Let me explain why. It is \ncalled Coburn's bureaucratic principle: Do what is safe first in the \nbureaucracy rather than what is best.\n  Here is what I imagine happening with a mandatory recall. Because we \nhave a problem, we are going to recall something and we are going to \nforce a mandatory recall. Even though they may recall it voluntarily, \nsomebody is going to pull the trigger earlier, because they don't want \nany criticism. There is a great example for that. How many people \nremember the toxigenic E. coli jalapeno pepper episode? Voluntary \nrecall for tomatoes, because we said it had to be in the tomatoes, so \nthey did that. That cost $100 million to the tomato farmers in this \ncountry and didn't save one life, because they got it wrong. They \ndiscovered about 10 days after that, it wasn't the tomatoes, but the \ndamage was already done. I can remember I ordered my hamburger in my \nspecial place in Muskogee, My Place BBQ, and I couldn't get a tomato on \nit. The reason we couldn't get a tomato--there wasn't anything wrong \nwith tomatoes in this country; it was because a recall had been \nsuggested by the FDA and the tomato growers responded.\n  So what we are going to see is a heavy hand rather than a working, \ncoordinated foundation upon which we do recalls, as we do now. We have \nnot had one instance ever when a food needed to be recalled that wasn't \nvoluntarily recalled.\n  What I worry about is the fact that we will have recalls that are \nmandated much too soon on the wrong products at the wrong time. We \ndon't have a track record that says the government needs additional \npower. As a matter of fact, the FDA doesn't say they need additional \npower.\n  So let's summarize for a minute. Where is the crisis in food safety, \nwhen the science demonstrates that we have the safest food in the world \nand we are on a trendline to have it even safer? Where is the cost-\nbenefit analysis in terms of what we are going to get from spending \nanother $1.5 billion in terms of lowering that number? There is nothing \nin this bill to show that. What is in this bill are tremendous new sets \nof regulations and authorities on top of the authorities that both the \nCDC, FDA, and Department of Agriculture already have, that I don't \nbelieve--and I agree I am in the minority on that, but I am trained in \nthe area of medicine, science, and epidemiology--I don't believe we are \ngoing to get a significant cost-benefit from it.\n  We are going to feel better because we did something. But, again, \nthat goes back to the first three principles. If we don't treat the \nunderlying problem--in other words, have the oversight hearings to make \nsure the agencies are actually carrying out their functions every day \non a thorough basis that can be vetted and making sure we are doing the \nright things to create the opportunities to have safe food--we are not \naccomplishing anything, but we are going to feel better. But do we know \nwho is going to feel worse? Our kids. Because they are going to pay--if \nwe appropriate this money, and I highly doubt a good portion of it will \nbe appropriated--they are going to pay for it. If you followed last \nweek in international finance, the scare over Ireland's ability to \nrepay its debt, and the pressure it had--and we got good news on the \neconomic front today--good news, and it is welcome news by all of us. \nBut the fact is, what is happening in Ireland and in Greece and Spain \nand Portugal is getting ready to happen to us. And this is a small \nexample of why--very good-intentioned, well-intentioned people trying \nto do the right thing, fixing the symptoms instead of the underlying \nproblem.\n  Our answer is more regulation has to be the answer. That is what we \ndid in the financial regulation bill. That is what we did to the SEC \nafter Bernie Madoff. Everybody knows the SEC was alerted several times, \nbut they didn't do their job. Consequently, we put all of these new \nrules and regulations to not let another Bernie Madoff scandal happen \nwhen we should have been holding people accountable for not doing their \njobs.\n  I am not against regulation, but I think it ought to be smart, \ntargeted, and focused to real problems, not the symptoms of the \nproblems. It is my personal belief--that we are targeting symptoms and \nnot the real problems with this bill.\n  Senator Harkin has bent over backward to work with me. He is an \nhonorable man. He is interested in food safety and the welfare of this \nNation. Nobody should ever say otherwise. But my experience leads me to \nbelieve it isn't going to accomplish the very purpose he wants to \naccomplish, and my recommendation is to go back and work in the new \nCongress to develop a true food safety center organization within the \nFederal Government that combines all the factors.\n  Do my colleagues realize right now when we buy a pizza at the grocery \nstore, if you buy a cheese pizza it comes through the FDA, but if you \nbuy a pepperoni pizza, it gets approved by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture? How many people in America think that makes sense?\n  The other thing with this bill--and I will finish with this and then \nyield the floor--is this bill wants more inspections. That is great. \nThere is no question that inspections will help; the question is what \nis the return on the dollars we spend for it. But if we are going to \nuse more inspections, there is not nearly enough money in this bill to \ndo it effectively. That is what we are going to trust.\n  Let me tell my colleagues why I think we have the safest food in the \nworld: because we have the best legal system in the world. That is why \nwe have the safest food, because the market forces applied on somebody \nselling food into our commerce are so great and the consequences \nlegally are so negative that it is only in their best interests to \nbring a safe product to the market. When we have food scares, most of \nthe time it is not an intentional act that created the problem, it is \nan unintentional act. It is a failure of someone in carrying out a \nprotocol that should be established.\n  Under this bill, anybody who sells more than $500,000 worth of food--\nthat is almost every Amish farmer in America--a co-op of Amish at every \nfarm--will have to have a detailed, laid-out plan, written down, double \nchecked, cross checked and everything else. What do my colleagues think \nthat is going to do to the cost of food? Do my colleagues think as we \nimplement new regulations, those costs aren't going to be passed on? So \nas we grow the government, if, in fact, we are treating symptoms and \nnot underlying problems--and I don't have any problems with regulations \nthat address real problems--all we are doing is raising the costs and \nmaking ourselves less competitive, decreasing the number of jobs that \nare available in this country, and not truly ensuring an increased \nlevel of safety with our food supply.\n  It is hard to dispute the facts about our incidence of foodborne \nillness. One case is too many. But we don't have\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\nthe resources to make it where there is not one case, even. It is the \nsame question on homeland security. Can we ever spend enough money to \n100 percent guarantee that we won't have another terrorist attack? \nAnybody who looks at it says no, we can't do that. It is the same with \nfood. For every additional dollar expended, what is the return to the \nAmerican consumer for that?\n  If it were an achievable goal to eliminate all foodborne illness, I \nwould be right there with you. It is not achievable. It is going to \nhappen. The question is: Can we continue on a slope to continue to \ndecrease the frequency where we have the least amount for the dollars \nwe spend? There is a balance, and we need to be there. I will take the \ncriticism of my colleagues that they think we need to spend this \nadditional $1.5 billion to get it further down the road. But I still \nraise the question of how we cut it in half over the last 9 years--or 5 \nyears--and didn't spend anything. So we are on a good trend.\n  We are, unfortunately, going to have complications with our food \nsupply, but we have a great legal system where we have bad actors such \nas the peanut butter factory in Georgia which is now shut down, in \nbankruptcy, and people are going to jail, because they intentionally \nviolated the rules we have today. But how did they intentionally do it? \nBecause we didn't have effective carrying out of the regulations we \nhave today.\n  I appreciate the great manner in which Senator Enzi and Senator \nHarkin have worked with me. I have another amendment I wish to offer on \nthis bill. Everybody knows what it is. It is an earmark amendment. I \nunderstand the disdain for having to vote on that and I understand the \nprocedural moves that will be made for that, but we are going to vote \non it. We are going to suspend the rules to get the first vote, but I \ncan assure you in the next Congress we are going to get an up-or-down \nvote on it, and it is going to pass in this body because the American \npeople expect it to pass. It is something we ought to put away until we \nget out of the problems we are in nationally.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to highlight the \nurgency of passing the legislation to overhaul our Nation's food safety \nsystem. The last time the FDA's law related to food was changed in any \nsubstantial way was 1938. Think of how things have changed since that \ntime: food coming in from all over the world. We think about all of the \nnew producers and the new processing plants and the new kinds of food \nwe have that weren't available in 1938. An overhaul of the food safety \nsystem is long overdue, and so is the passage of the Food Safety \nModernization Act. Food safety reform should have passed Congress and \nshould have been signed into law months ago. I have stood in this \nChamber many times saying the same thing. Each time, each month, \nsomething new comes up where people get hurt or people die. Whether it \nis jalapeno peppers or peanut butter or more recently eggs, these \noutbreaks of foodborne illness and nationwide recalls of contaminated \nfood highlight the need to better protect our Nation's food supply. We \nneed to fix it.\n  The good news is we know how we can do it and we have legislation \nsitting right here on the table that could go a long way toward helping \nfamilies at their own kitchen tables. The bad news is this legislation \nhas been stalled in the Senate since last November.\n  This legislation is, first of all, comprehensive. It covers \neverything from ensuring a safe food supply at the front end to \nensuring a rapid response if tainted food gets into the supply chain.\n  I wish to respond to a few points my colleague from Oklahoma raised. \nFirst he noted that somehow the FDA didn't need the authority to \nrecall. In fact, right after the last outbreak, the egg issue, the eggs \nin Iowa, the FDA Commissioner came out and said she needed additional \nauthority to do a recall. So let's set the record straight on that. \nThat was wrong.\n  Secondly, I would point out that this legislation is bipartisan. It \nhas both Democratic and Republican sponsors and it passed through the \ncommittee, the committee on which the Presiding Officer serves, last \nNovember with bipartisan support. Food safety is not a partisan issue \nand it shouldn't be. It is a national issue of public health and public \nsafety. Do my colleagues know what else? It is a business issue. So \nwhen I heard my colleague from Oklahoma talk about how somehow it was \ngoing to hurt the bottom line, I wish to know why the grocery stores of \nAmerica support this bill. Does anyone think they are not worried about \ntheir bottom line?\n  I would like to know why companies such as General Mills support this \nbill, and why companies such as Schwan's in Marshall, MN, one of the \nbiggest frozen producers in the country--the No. 1 issue they raised \nwith me was passing this bill. Do you think Schwan's is a company that \ndoesn't care about the bottom line?\n  You haven't met their business executive, I say to my friend from \nOklahoma. Their focus is on jobs, making money, and producing a good \nproduct.\n  So why do these businesses that are so clearly concerned about their \nbottom line care about passing this bill? Guess what. These bad \nactors--whether it is the peanut butter factory in Georgia or whether \nit is the egg place that had rats in it--these bad actors hurt all the \ngood actors out there, the good food producers and good farmers and all \nof the companies that put in safety measures. That is why the \ncompanies, the grocery stores, SuperValue, and these kinds of companies \nwant to get this bill passed. They think having bad food out there is \nnot only bad for consumers when they get sick or die, but it is bad for \ntheir bottom line. That is why there is industry support for the bill.\n  Finally, this legislation addresses a very serious issue--and this \nwas the most difficult thing to hear from my friend from Oklahoma. You \nall know in our State about the case of Shirley Ahlmer, a grandmother. \nShe fought cancer and survived it. She was ready to go home for \nChristmas, and she ate a little piece of peanut butter toast. That \ngrandmother died because of that peanut butter toast.\n  I don't want to hear about how it is not worth it for the people of \nAmerica, that it is going to cost the people of America, until you talk \nto Shirley's son Jeff and find out what it cost his family because \nthere wasn't an adequate food inspection system in this country. That \nis what this is about.\n  One other thing that was not true was when my colleague from Oklahoma \ntalked about the tomato recall. That was true, and it was misdiagnosed. \nThey said the wrong thing. It was actually jalapeno peppers. They said \nit was tomatoes.\n  Why should we keep the same food system in place now if people are \nout there calling the wrong card and saying tomatoes caused this and \ntomato prices go down and people who produce them get hurt and instead \nit is jalapeno peppers? Meanwhile people are getting sick across the \ncountry. Why would the answer be that we have a great system and let's \nnot change it? The answer is we have to change the system.\n  The other thing is, both the peanut butter contamination and the \njalapeno peppers, do you know who called it right? The State of \nMinnesota. It was the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Health \nDepartment. None of it got identified until people got sick in the \nState of Minnesota. That makes us proud of our State. But we would have \nrather not lost three people in the peanut butter crisis and said: \nGuess what, we got it right.\n  What we can do is take the system we have in Minnesota, which is \ncommon sense, and instead of just having this problem sit on a county \nnurse's desk, we have graduate students who can work together and make \ncalls and figure out what caused this when people got sick, and ask: \nWhat did you eat yesterday? It is that simple.\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\n  The part of the bill which Senator Chambliss and I sponsored is to \nuse that model--not make every State do it but say, let's look at the \nbest practices in four regions of the country and see if we can improve \nthe system so we can catch these illnesses quicker and respond better \nand have less people die or get sick.\n  When I look at all of the issues raised by my colleague, the bottom \nline for businesses is this: Businesses in this industry support this \nbill. When I look at the issue of consumer safety, all you have to do \nis go and look at what happened to Shirley Ahlmer.\n  When I look at the issue of what is better for the consumers of this \ncountry, I don't think anybody wants to get sick from eggs that have \nSalmonella. It is unacceptable, Mr. President.\n  I hope anybody who was listening to my colleague from Oklahoma has \nalso listened to this because it is very easy to make these claims. Let \nme tell you, one, the people who do this work say they need more \nauthority to do recalls and to do it right. The businesses that are \naffected by the food safety outbreaks need a better system. They don't \nwant to get stuck in one from back in 1938. The people hurt by this, or \nfamily members killed by this, say we need improvement. That is why \nthis bill has bipartisan support and why three-fourths of the Senate \nsupported moving forward on the debate.\n  I hope this delay will end and that we will get this done so that \nwhen families sit down for Thanksgiving dinner, they will at least know \nthere is hope in the future that we are not set back in the inspection \nsystem that we had in 1938.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business for such time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as Mark Twain might have characterized \nwhere we were a short while ago, reports of the death of cap and trade \nhave been greatly exaggerated.\n  It is true we defeated all the bills. This was after the Kyoto \nTreaty, which failed to even get recognized for discussion, let alone \nratified. We had all the bills--the McCain-Lieberman bill, the \nLieberman-Warner bill, the Waxman-Markey bill, and all of the others, \nand they were all killed.\n  I can remember way back 8 years ago when I was the only bad guy, the \none everybody hated. That is when I made an honest statement at the \ntime that perhaps what they were trying to do with the global warming \nwas the ``greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.''\n  As time went by, more and more people agreed. A lot of things have \nhappened. Just in the past year, we have had the revelation of \nClimategate, the failure in Copenhagen, the admission of the futility \nof unilateral climate action, the year of the skeptic, and the \nvindication at the ballot box that took place November 2.\n  With all this, one might be tempted to declare victory, and I have to \nadmit that for a short while I did. It was a year ago today that I gave \na speech right here on the Senate floor, at this same podium, noting \nthat the tide turned decisively against global warming alarmism. The \nyear of the skeptic took place.\n  Just 2 days later, Climategate exploded into view as thousands of e-\nmails were released that showed, at a minimum, the very scientific \nspokesmen for alarmism were scheming to block open and honest \nassessments of their work. Behind the veil of e-mail, they showed their \ntrue colors: They weren't acting as scientists but as political hacks. \nThey were scientists defending a political agenda. The agenda would \nvirtually shut down America.\n  A lot of people realize and recognize that fossil fuels are necessary \nto run this machine called America. Right now, 53 percent of our energy \nis generated from coal. Coal is necessary. We have clean coal \ntechnology, and the releases are much less than they used to be. Oil \nand gas are both fossil fuels. It is necessary. You cannot run this \nmachine called America without them.\n  The damage has been done in terms of what was going on at Copenhagen. \nI think the chapter on the climate science wars has closed. Climategate \nscientists and the allies want to keep fighting. They are particularly \nbegging us to bring them before committees to question their work. But \nwe will not because they are now irrelevant. The time to talk about \nthis science is over.\n  I will say this: Five years before Climategate, I gave a speech in \nthe Senate and talked about what they were trying to do to cook the \nscience. Instead of talking about science, we are talking about the \neconomics of what is happening now. We are talking about jobs, about \ncompetitiveness, and manufacturing and small businesses and real people \nwho have to pay more for electricity, food, and gasoline. What do I \nmean? Even with all of the progress we have made--and while cap and \ntrade is dead, bureaucratic cap and trade is alive and well--what is \nhappening in this country is that we have an administration with a \nmajority in Congress who tried to pass this legislatively, tried to \npass cap and trade. The cost of cap and trade, we were finally able to \nconvince the American people--if you look at it not from what Senator \nJim Inhofe says but what the economists say, what they said at MIT and \nwhat they said at Wharton, if you pass any of these cap-and-trade \nschemes, the cost to the American people will be in the range of $300 \nbillion to $400 billion a year. That is what they decided they were \nable to do legislatively. They thought we will do this--because we \ncontrol EPA, we will do it through the regulations.\n\n  What Senator Reid said may be true for the massive 1,000-page bills \nfilled with mandates, taxes, regulations, bureaucracy, and not much \nelse. But it is not true for the more subtle strain of cap and trade \nnow moving through the EPA.\n  That is right; this backdoor cap and trade hidden behind an \nadministrative curtain. I can hear already what my friend, the EPA \nAdministrator, Lisa Jackson, would say: Senator Inhofe, you know we are \nregulating in broad daylight, and we are inviting public comment and we \nare providing guidance. It is all aboveboard and out in the open.\n  That may be true, and I trust that Administrator Jackson wants the \nEPA to be transparent. Unfortunately, this bureaucracy has gotten to \nthe point where transparency is virtually impossible.\n  The reality is that backdoor cap and trade is hidden behind acronyms \nsuch as PSD, BACT, SIPs, FIPs, BAMM, GHGRP, and the like and arcane \nlegal provisions in the Clean Air Act. It is all a great muddle for \nbureaucrats and lawyers, but it is a profound disaster for jobs and \nsmall businesses in America.\n  Make no mistake, the intent and ultimately the effect is no different \nthan Waxman-Markey, which is to eliminate fossil fuels and impose \ncentralized bureaucratic control over America's industrial \nmanufacturing base. Unless we stop them, that is what they will \nachieve.\n  Of course, President Obama would say we could have avoided all this \nif we passed cap and trade. That is true. If we had done that, we also \nknow it would not have preempted what EPA would be doing.\n  That is wrong on two counts. First, what kind of a deal involves \naccepting a bad bill in place of bad EPA regulations? That is no deal \nat all. Secondly, the supposed deal wasn't an either/or proposition. \nWaxman-Markey didn't fully eliminate EPA's ability to regulate under \nthe Clean Air Act. President Obama and cap-and-trade supporters wanted \nboth options--cap and trade including regulation under the Clean Air \nAct.\n  Keep in mind we are talking about something that is very massive--the \nlargest single tax increase on the American people. When you talk about \n$300 billion or $400 billion a year, you have to bring that down and \nsay: What does that mean to me?\n  To the taxpayers in Oklahoma, it would mean over $3,000 a year. What \ndo they get for it? Nothing. One thing I like about Administrator Lisa \nJackson, the Administrator of the EPA, is she is honest in her answers. \nI asked her the question: If we were to pass something like this, pass \nWaxman-Markey and do something legislatively, how would it affect \nworldwide emissions of CO2. She said it wouldn't have much \nof an effect at all. The reason is we can't do that in the United\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\nStates: This isn't where the problem is. It is in China, India, Mexico, \nand other places around the world. As we tighten our availability of \npower, they have to go someplace--our manufacturing base--to find \npower. Well, now they would be going into areas where we have less \ncontrols. So that could very well have--by banning it here, it would \nhave an increase in the effect of CO2 emissions. Most people \nunderstand and agree with that.\n  We have a long, difficult fight ahead. It goes back to December of \n2009 when EPA promulgated the endangerment finding that CO2 \nendangers public health and welfare. We know that finding is wrong and \nbased on flawed science.\n  Before I went to Copenhagen last December--first of all, what \nCopenhagen is, that is the annual big party that the U.N. puts \ntogether--and they have done it for 15 years now--and they always have \nit at exotic places. Next month it will be in Cancun. Last year, before \nI went there, I asked Administrator Jackson the very question: What \ndoes your endangerment finding--the way it happened, I say to you, was \nthat we had a hearing, a public hearing, live on TV, and Administrator \nJackson was in our hearing room.\n  I said: I am getting ready to be the one-man truth squad in \nCopenhagen. I have a feeling when I leave, you are going to have an \nendangerment finding. What would that be based on? The IPCC.\n  To make sure everybody understands, that is the U.N. That is what \nstarted this thing way back in the 1980s. And so now that is \nestablished and we know the science on which an endangerment finding is \nbased, we go to Copenhagen. It was almost the next day that climategate \nbroke. Oddly enough, the timing couldn't have been better--I had \nnothing to do with it; I was as surprised as anyone--because they came \nout and talked about the flawed science that was there and the fact \nthey were cooking the science.\n\n  I have to say this. Five years ago this week, in 2005, I gave a \nspeech on the Senate floor talking about how they were cooking the \nscience at the United Nations--the IPCC--to make people believe that \ngreenhouse gases--anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane--were \ncausing catastrophic global warming. That was their mission. They \nstarted with that conclusion and they tried to get science to support \nit. Well, all that was exposed.\n  The list of IPCC errors is so long I won't repeat it here, because I \ndid so in my speeches before. We know the claim that the Himalayan \nglaciers would melt by 2035 was off by about 300 years. What is \nimportant now is that the endangerment finding triggered regulations \nthat will eventually reach out into every corner of the American \neconomy. This will be the greatest bureaucratic intrusion into American \nlife we have ever seen.\n  Let us put some specifics on that. We are talking 6.1 million sources \nsubject to EPA control and regulations. With regard to EPA control and \nregulations, I don't think I have to tell you how onerous that would \nbe, what that would be doing to all these institutions that would be \naffected. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has put together a list as to \nwho would be affected by these new regulations and that thousands and \nthousands and thousands of new bureaucrats would be crawling all over \nin America. The list includes 260,000 office buildings, 150,000 \nwarehouses, 92,000 health care facilities--that is hospitals and so \nforth--71,000 hotels and motels, 51,000 food service facilities, 37,000 \nchurches and other places of worship, and 17,000 farms.\n  The EPA understands the political peril of regulating all these \nsources so they decided to change the law without congressional \nauthorization to exempt many of the sources I have mentioned, but that \nis a front. It sounds good, and they will stand up and say, no, we are \nnot talking about 250 tons of CO2. But the Clean Air Act \nspecifically says that the major sources are those that have the \npotential to emit 250 tons or more of given pollutants. All the farms, \nall the churches, as I mentioned, are going to be in that category.\n  Two hundred fifty tons of, say, sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide is a \ngood deal of pollution. But when it comes to CO2, it is not. \nLots of facilities emit that amount and more. We are talking schools, \nnursing homes, restaurants, even individual residential sources, mind \nyou, that were never contemplated to be regulated when Congress passed \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  So what did EPA do? Well, they promulgated something called the \ntailoring rule. This gets in the weeds here, but it is something they \ncreated to say, well, no, we are not going to use 250 tons of \nemissions, we are going to use 75,000 tons. That means we are talking \nonly the giants--the refineries and some of these groups. Well, the \nproblem with that is that is not what the Clean Air Act says.\n  Sources emitting above those amounts have to get permits that require \nso-called best available control technology to reduce CO2. \nOf course, we don't know what that is. It has never been defined. The \nEPA issued draft guidance on what they call the BACT--best available \ncontrol technology--last week, but it provided no help, just more \nconfusion and uncertainty on what the requirements would be.\n  Of course, they talk about the EPA has a law in front of it that says \nclearly the major sources are those that have the potential to emit 250 \ntons or more. Yet it says the new number is 75,000 tons or more. So now \nthe EPA can conveniently say that schools, hospitals, and the like \nwon't be regulated, at least not until 2016, when the agency says it \nwill consider whether to regulate such sources.\n  There is the catch. This supposed exemption through the tailoring \nrule only lasts for a few years, not to mention the fact that it \nblatantly violates the Clean Air Act, which subjects it to litigation. \nOn that last point, the tailoring rule, along with the endangerment \nfinding and other greenhouse gas rules, is being litigated, so we will \nknow eventually whether the tailoring rule survives. I think it will be \nthrown out, but the fact it can be thrown out should be enough for us \nto be honest with the American people and say we are going to regulate \neverything that falls within the 250 tons--all the residences, the \nchurches, and the farms I mentioned before.\n  Again, I want everyone to understand: The regulation of global \nwarming by EPA, backdoor cap and trade, begins on January 2. It is \nhere, a month away. I am not the only one concerned about it. On \nFebruary 19, Senator Rockefeller, joined by seven of his other \nDemocratic colleagues, wrote Administrator Jackson. Keep in mind, this \nis coming from the Democrats here in this Chamber. He wrote:\n\n       We write with serious economic and energy security concerns \n     relating to the potential regulation of greenhouse gases from \n     stationary sources under the Clean Air Act. We remain \n     concerned about the possible impacts on American workers and \n     businesses in a number of industrial sectors, along with the \n     farmers, miners and small business owners who could be \n     affected as your agency moves beyond regulations for vehicle \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  We need to address this, because employers and small businesses are \nafraid to hire and expand right now, in large part because of the EPA's \nglobal warming regulations. They do not know what to expect. They are \nlooking at the Clean Air Act, that has a very small threshold. Yet \nstatements are being made that this is going to affect everyone and \nthey don't know what to do.\n  I want my colleagues and the American people in general to know that \nEPA is moving in all directions, beyond just implementing job-killing \nglobal warming regulations. EPA is threatening jobs on a host of \nfronts. A few months ago, I released an oversight report examining the \nthousands of jobs at risk. And by the way, this is a good report. It \ntalks about four major areas of concern, and they are all on my Web \nsite at inhofe.senate.gov. Read them over, if you want to be scared. \nBut here is what I found:\n  The new standards for commercial industrial boilers, for example, put \nup to 798,000 jobs at risk. The revised National Ambient Air Quality \nStandard for ozone puts severe restrictions on job creation and \nbusiness expansion in hundreds of counties nationwide. New standards \nfor Portland cement plants put up to 18 cement plants at risk of \nshutting down, threatening nearly 1,800 direct jobs and 9,000 indirect \njobs.\n  I think we should be concerned enough about the unemployment rate \nthat we have right now without exacerbating that problem, which is what \nwe do with these rules. I think everyone knows that. Where are these \nrules\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\ngoing to hurt the most? In the heartland. By that I mean Pennsylvania, \nOhio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Nebraska, \nMinnesota, and Montana. Of course, my own State of Oklahoma is feeling \nthe brunt, and others will as well.\n  Here is the bottom line. Backdoor cap and trade is alive and well. It \nis moving forward. The fight over the future of America's industrial \nbase is under way. I want to put the administration on friendly notice \nthat I will investigate these rules vigorously in my capacity as the \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I do this \nto expose their impact on jobs, energy prices, competitiveness, small \nbusinesses, energy security, and the true extent of their environmental \nbenefits.\n  It is my sincere hope the EPA will pull back, revise, reform, and \nbalance its regulatory agenda to protect jobs as well as the \nenvironment. If the EPA persists on moving down a more extreme path, \nthen our 9.6 unemployment rate will be even worse in 2012.\n  In an attempt to stem the impending economic harm facing thousands of \nsmall businesses, the EPA has developed its so-called tailoring rule. I \ndon't want to elaborate on this. I will only say that the tailoring \nrule is to make people think we are only going to be regulating those \nentities that emit 75,000 tons or more, when the law clearly says 250 \ntons or more.\n\n  In some cases, these rules will have no meaningful environmental \nbenefits. Consider EPA's rules to regulate greenhouse gases. They would \nreduce global temperatures by 15 one-hundredths of 1 degree by 2100. \nThat same figure goes all the way back to the consideration of Kyoto. \nThis is back in the 1990s. I remember at that time it was Vice \nPresident Al Gore's own scientist--Tom Prigley, I believe his name \nwas--who came out and the question was if all of the developed nations \nwere to comply with Kyoto's emission requirements, how much would it \nreduce the temperatures in 50 years. The answer was 7 one-hundredths of \n1 degree Celsius. So you can talk about all the sacrifice we are making \nand nothing good can come from it.\n  I want to conclude, because there are a lot of people here wanting to \nspeak, saying that the Administrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, talks \nabout the fact that what we do unilaterally, here in the United States, \nis not going to have a major impact on emissions nationwide, yet we \nknow what it is going to cost. I want to say we are going to quit \ntalking about the science. We understand how the science is not on \ntheir side; that the things we said on the floor of the Senate 5 years \nago were verified with climategate. They have been cooking the science, \nand it is very convenient.\n  Lastly, I went to Copenhagen, as I mentioned earlier. That is the big \nU.N. party each year. That was probably the most productive 2\\1/2\\ \nhours of my life, the 2\\1/2\\ hours I was on the ground in Copenhagen. I \nwas preceded by Senator Kerry, Hillary Clinton, President Obama, and \nseveral others--Nancy Pelosi--and they were all assuring the other 191 \ncountries present that we were going to do something about cap and \ntrade. I went there to make sure they knew we were not. I will always \nremember that, because we had 400 people and the 120 cameras were \nzeroing in on me. I say to my good friend from Virginia, they all had \none thing in common: They all hated me.\n  That is behind us now and we have to now look at the regulators. This \nregulation would put America out of business.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before I get to my remarks, Madam President, I want to \ncommend my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, for his comments. I don't \nalways agree with him, but I have had the opportunity to sit in the \nPresiding Officer chair and listen to his views over the last 2 years, \nand let me make sure I make clear that his characterization of some of \nthose folks with those cameras, I would not fall into that category.\n  I also want to wish the Senator a very happy birthday. I understand \nit was yesterday, and I wish him all the best. Our offices are next to \neach other and we are good neighbors.\n\n\n                      Tribute To Federal Employees\n\n  Madam President, I rise today to continue a recent tradition of the \nSenate--the tradition of honoring exemplary Federal employees--my \nfriend Senator Ted Kaufman began last year. Senator Kaufman believes, \nas I do, that our Federal employees deserve recognition for their \nadmirable patriotism which drives them in their daily work as civil \nservants.\n  Senator Kaufman highlighted 100 Federal employees in his close to 2 \nyears of service--100 Federal employees with significant \naccomplishments in the fields of medicine, science, technology, \ndiplomacy, and defense. Today I will start to continue that tradition. \nI am very proud that the first Federal employee I am going to have a \nchance to honor is currently a resident of Virginia who combined his \nengineering expertise with his past experiences in the Navy to help \nsave 33 Chilean miners after they had been trapped 2000 feet \nunderground for 69 days. This was an incident that captured the \nattention of the world, as we all watched the rescue of those miners. \nAgain, I will only take a couple of moments to describe this employee \nand how he contributed to that remarkable worldwide success story.\n  Clint Cragg served in the Navy for 26 years. He, as I mentioned, is \ncurrently a resident of Virginia. His lifetime of service to our \ncountry led him to many exciting opportunities, including serving as \nthe Chief of Current Operations, U.S. European Command. While in \nEurope, he participated in a number of operations, including the wars \nin Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Today, Cragg is principal engineer \nfor NASA's Engineering and Safety Center, a center which NASA \nestablished after the 2003 Columbia Space Shuttle tragedy. Clint has \ngiven a lifetime of service to his country since his graduation from \nthe Naval Academy in 1978, and his service was never more important \nthan it was when he took part in the worldwide effort to save the \nChilean miners.\n  Clint and his colleagues were asked by the Chilean Government to \nassist in rescuing their 33 countrymen trapped underground in a \ncollapsed copper and gold mine. Clint rose to the challenge and flew to \nChile with three fellow NASA employees to examine the scene. Using his \nexperience as a commanding officer of a submarine in the Navy, Clint \nprovided valuable insight to the miners on how to cope with the \nunderground existence they were in for a sustained period of time. \nClint and his team also met with Chilean officials to discuss the \ndevelopment of a rescue squad capsule that at that time was a \ncompletely untested idea.\n  Upon his arrival home, Clint received a message from the Chilean \nHealth Minister in which the Minister asked for NASA's help in thinking \nof specific features that would make the rescue capsule idea a reality. \nClint assembled a team of 20 engineers, 10 from NASA Langley and 10 \nfrom around the country. They commenced brainstorming innovative ideas \nfor a capsule design. This was thinking whole cloth. The only \ninformation the team had available was the capsule's maximum length and \nthe diameter of the rescue shaft through which the capsule was required \nto fit. Seventy-two hours later, the team had a written, comprehensive \nreport that included 75 proposals for the rescue capsule. The paper \nconcluded that the rescue capsule should include a harness inside the \ncapsule that can hold a miner in case the miner fell unconscious during \nascent.\n  I think we all remember those images on CNN as they kind of drew up \nthe capsule. I didn't know, but that capsule was designed by a Federal \nemployee and his team we honor today.\n  As the 33 men rose from beneath the Earth, Clint could take pride in \nhis work for NASA and in the knowledge that he and his colleagues had \nmade the reunion between these men and their families possible.\n  I was privileged to meet Clint Cragg and his family and other members \nof the rescue team during a visit to NASA Langley last week and present \nthem with a framed American flag that had flown at the U.S. Capitol in \nhonor of their contributions. The successful rescue of the miners was a \ntestament to the American spirit of cooperation and ingenuity, a spirit \nexemplified by the NASA team.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Clint for his service \nand his leadership team at NASA as this\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nweek's example of a great Federal employee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing my and Senator Grassley's colloquy, the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Major Tax Issues\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, my colleague, Senator Grassley, and I \ncome to the floor to discuss very urgent business for the American \npeople that has been put off for far too long. I am talking about the \noutstanding tax issues this Congress has so far failed to address. As I \ncount them, there are five major tax issues that collectively represent \na looming crisis for the economy. These are, first, the set of tax \nprovisions that expired almost a year ago on December 31, 2009, and \nhave yet to be extended. Second is another set of important tax \nprovisions due to expire at the end of this year, which is only 44 days \nfrom now. The third item is the need to once again address the \nthreshold of the alternative minimum tax so that about 25 million more \nAmerican families are not caught in its clutches for the tax year about \nto end. Fourth is the estate tax issue which has been haunting us and \nthe American people all year long. I submit it is way past the crisis \nstage and is about to enter into even a worse stage. Finally, and \ncertainly not least, is the looming expiration of the tax relief \nprovisions we passed in 2001 and 2003 which are swinging over the \nfuture of our economy like a hangman's noose. It is this situation that \nI particularly would like to address the bulk of my remarks to, but \nbefore doing so, let me turn to my colleague for his initial comments, \nthe ranking member on the Finance Committee and a great friend, Senator \nGrassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, Senator Hatch has long been a leader \non a lot of these tax provisions, particularly in research and \ndevelopment. I thank him for his leadership.\n  I think Senator Hatch has clearly outlined the gravity of the \neconomic consequences of a continuing failure to finish time-sensitive \nlegislative tax business.\n  There is a chart I will put up that shows where we are on these \ncategories of expiring tax provisions. Said another way, here are the \ncategories of tax hikes that congressional inaction will put in place. \nI have used this chart before, so I think Members will be familiar. In \nfact, several months ago, I used it. The congressional Democratic \nleadership paid no attention to the seriousness of these issues then. \nUnfortunately, the to-do list is exactly the same today as it was \nseveral months ago.\n  If we go down through the chart, Members can see that we have had \npartisan votes on extender packages negotiated between the bicameral \nDemocratic leadership but no effort to reach out to the Republican side \nto find bipartisan common ground.\n  On this year's alternative minimum tax patch, as Senator Hatch noted, \ninaction on the AMT will force a ``gotcha'' tax hike on millions of \nmiddle-income families when they start to file their tax returns 6 \nweeks from now.\n  On death tax reform, the House passed a permanent reform almost 1 \nyear ago, but it has languished in the Senate during that period. On \nour side, we would like to improve that bill to protect more small \nbusinesses and farm families from the death tax.\n  On the 2001-2003 tax relief packages, there is no bill from the other \nside that would serve as a starting point on preventing this massive \ntax hike. On our side, if the Democratic leadership permitted us, we \nwould like to start with Senator McConnell's bill. Senator Hatch and I \nare cosponsors of that legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Grassley has been the ranking Republican or \nchairman of the Finance Committee for a long time now. We have seen \ntimes when the expiring tax provisions have been dealt with in as \ntimely a manner as they should have been, but have we ever seen a state \nof affairs like we have now with the extenders? What has this meant for \njob creation and economic growth?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, my colleagues probably know that my \nfriend from Utah is going to advance as the incoming ranking member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, and I congratulate him on that. I know he \nis going to do a very good job.\n  One needs only to look to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nto assess the harm that could be done to the economy if we don't get \nthis tax legislation passed. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, not addressing these very time-sensitive tax issues will reduce \neconomic growth by as much as 1.7 percent on average for the years 2011 \nand 2012. If Members didn't hear that, it is not some political leader \nsaying that economic growth will be harmed by 1.7 percent; it is the \nnonpartisan experts in the Congressional Budget Office saying that if \nwe don't pass these tax bills, economic growth is going to get hit 1.7 \npercent. Some private forecasters put that hit even higher--at 2 \npercent. When we consider that the last report has the economy growing \nat an annualized rate of 2 percent, then it is quite obvious.\n  We can see that this single failure to prevent these great big tax \nincreases could wipe out what little economic growth is currently \noccurring. I don't know how policymakers can sleep at night, let alone \nbe so casual when we haven't dealt with these time-sensitive tax issues \nat a time when coming back here we heard nothing from our constituents \nother than concern about the economy, about jobs, and about the legacy \nof debt we are leaving.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. We ought to listen to Senator Grassley. He is one of the \nleaders in this body and somebody we all look up to as totally honest \nand sensitive on these issues. He has done a wonderful job on the \nFinance Committee.\n  According to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, perhaps the most \ntime-sensitive problem waiting for congressional action is the so-\ncalled patch for the alternative minimum tax. I understand that if we \ndo not take care of this very soon, we could see major delays in the \ntax filing season that will start on January 1. Is that the \nunderstanding of Senator Grassley?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Absolutely. We have a track record on that. Just a few \nyears ago, it didn't get done on time, and people had to wait for their \ntax refunds. That is the biggest thing. But it also created a terrible \nbureaucratic problem for IRS to get the forms out.\n  My friend from Utah is correct. Fortunately, the chairs and ranking \nmembers of the tax writing committees wrote to the Commissioner of IRS \nlast week indicating our intention to pass an AMT patch. The letter \nspecified what the AMT patch would look like. But as helpful as the \nletter was, we still need to change the law. As a matter of fact, the \nfiling season could become very complicated if we don't act. During our \nyears in the majority, we never let the AMT patch legislation slip past \nMay of any tax year that it applied to. That only happened once.\n  The death tax is another overdue tax legislative item that has been \nreferred to. Maybe the Senator from Utah could bring up the issue of \nthe estate tax.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is the third item on the to-do list. If we do not \nact, 6 weeks from now the reach of the death tax will greatly expand. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, 10 times the \nnumber of estates will be taxable versus the number that would be \ntaxable in the bipartisan Lincoln-Kyl compromise. In the case of farm-\nheavy estates, 13 times the number of those farm families would be hit \nby the death tax. That would be unfair because the families would have \nto either borrow the money or sell the farm in order to pay the death \ntaxes. That is just crazy.\n  The issue of extending the expiring tax relief provisions enacted in \n2001 and 2003 has been a central question all this year, but we are \njust now beginning to discuss this in earnest. This lack of action on \nthis vital topic has been a major factor in the low performance of our \neconomy.\n  The outcome of this debate is exceptionally important to the future \nof this Nation. Its implications go well beyond what many on the other \nside of this issue might want Americans to believe. This is not merely \na question of how well the rich in our society will live if we raise \ntheir taxes.\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\n  Rather, this debate goes to the heart of the burning questions facing \nAmerican families of all income levels today: Will I keep my job? How \nand when can I get a new or better job? Will the economy grow enough to \nallow my family to pay its bills and make progress toward our dreams? \nCan we afford to educate our children? Will America continue to prosper \nin the years ahead, or are we in a permanent decline?\n  The President and most of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have decided that the answer to the question of fully extending \nthe tax relief provisions that are set to expire in just about 44 days \nis no. While they are willing to extend them for those Americans \nearning less than $200,000 per year if a single individual or $250,000 \nper year if a family, their position is that anyone above these \nthresholds should get a tax increase.\n  However, the right answer for our country's future is that all the \ntax relief provisions should be extended.\n  The reasons the President and his allies give for their position \nlargely boil down to the general supposition that the well-off among us \ncan afford to see their taxes go up, and that the Nation cannot afford \nto forego the revenue lost to the Treasury from these taxpayers \ncontinuing to have their taxes as low as they are.\n  Ironically, this second point implies that we can afford the revenue \nloss from extending the tax relief to those making under the $200,000 \nand $250,000 thresholds, even though this loss is upwards of 80 percent \nof the total amount of lost revenue from extending the tax relief for \neveryone.\n  In other words, the President and his congressional supporters would \nhave us believe that this debate is solely about whether the so-called \nwealthy among us deserve continued tax relief. They either fail to see \nan economic connection between the finances of those at the top of the \nincome scale and the rest of us, or they refuse to admit that such a \nlink exists.\n  This may sound somewhat counterintuitive, but it is, nonetheless, \ntrue. The essential element to this conundrum is that good permanent \njobs, which are the heart and soul of the American dream, are \ninextricably linked to those in our economy who have wealth. When the \nincome of the wealthy is taxed, particularly in a way that reduces the \nincentives for saving, investment, and entrepreneurship, that tax is \nnot just paid by those who write the check to the government. Indeed, \neven those Americans who pay no income tax at all, which is now upwards \nof half of all adults, can be badly hurt by tax increases on the so-\ncalled rich. This is through the loss of opportunities, the lack of \njobs or better jobs, and slow or nonexistent economic growth.\n  One vital fact that many citizens do not realize is that a high \npercentage of this Nation's business enterprises pay their taxes \nthrough the tax returns of their individual owners. Taxes on sole \nproprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, and limited liability \ncompanies are all passed through these entities and assessed on their \nindividual owners. Higher taxes on these entities results in less money \nfor investment and expansion, which translates into fewer jobs created \nand fewer opportunities for those who want to move up the economic \nladder.\n  Tragically, especially in this time of economic stress and high \nunemployment, the real cost of taxation is paid by a group of \nunintended victims. These are the men and women and their families who \ndo not get a chance to have a job or a higher paying job because the \ntax destroys the economic growth that might have provided for such an \nopportunity.\n  A study recently released by the nonpartisan Heritage Center for Data \nAnalysis highlights these facts. This study, which utilizes an economic \nmodel owned by the leading economic forecasting firm in the country, \nconcludes that the President's tax plan to allow the tax relief \nprovisions to expire for the so-called well-off would have very serious \nconsequences for millions earning far less than those targeted.\n  Here are just a few of the highlights of these conclusions. First, \nthe President's tax plan would reduce economic growth for at least the \nnext 10 years. Over the 10-year period, our gross domestic product \nwould fall by a total of $1.1 trillion compared to where it would be \notherwise if all the tax provisions were extended.\n  This slower economic growth would directly translate into fewer jobs \ncreated. In fact, the study projects that 238,000 fewer jobs would be \ncreated next year and as many as 876,000 lost jobs in 2016. For the 10-\nyear period, the average would be 693,000 jobs each year that would not \nbe created had we extended the tax relief for everyone. This projection \nalone should be enough to give anyone pause. In this critical time of \njob shortage, do we want to purposefully choose a course that would \nlead to even fewer jobs for Americans?\n  Other economic indicators would also turn negative compared to \nextending the tax rates as they currently stand. Business investment, \npersonal savings, disposable income, and consumer spending would all be \nlower. This is exactly the wrong direction we need as the U.S. \nstruggles to recover from this nasty recession.\n  My home State of Utah will not be spared, despite the fact that the \ndownturn has been less pronounced there than in many other States. The \nBeehive State would lose an average of 6,200 jobs each year, and \nhousehold disposable income would drop by $2,200. For a relatively \nsmall population State, this is nothing but bad news.\n  Another recent study highlights the effect on the economy of \nincreases to the capital gains tax rate as is called for under the \nPresident's tax plan. This one was prepared by the respected economist \nAllen Sinai. In this study, Dr. Sinai concludes that increasing the \ncapital gains tax rates to 20 percent from the current 15 percent, as \nis called for in the President's plan, would cut the number of jobs \navailable by 231,000 per year. Again, this is exactly the wrong \ndirection for a Congress that is supposed to be focused on job \ncreation.\n  If we were really serious about creating jobs, we should be doing \njust the opposite; that is, lowering the capital gains tax rate. The \nSinai study concludes that a reduction from the current 15-percent tax \nrate on capital gains to a 5-percent rate would increase the number of \njobs by 711,000 per year. That is the kind of job growth we need right \nnow. By lowering the rate down to zero percent, Dr. Sinai says we could \nturbocharge this rate of job growth to 1.3 million new jobs per year.\n  Of course, this capital gains tax reduction would not be free since \nthe Treasury would lose some revenue. The Sinai study indicates that \nthis loss would be about $23 billion per year after the effects of \nstronger economic growth are taken into account. While this is not an \ninsignificant number, it works out to a cost of about $18,000 per job. \nI call this a bargain, particularly when it is compared with the cost \nper job from the so-called stimulus bill we passed last year. The \nCongressional Budget Office projected last year that the cost of each \njob saved or created from the stimulus bill would be between $414,000 \nand $1.3 million. And most or all of these jobs are temporary, not \npermanent. Last year, the CBO also projected that the net increase in \nthe number of jobs from the stimulus bill by 2015 would be zero. In \nother words, we would get no permanent job increase from this \ngargantuan stimulus bill. I do not believe the contrast between the two \napproaches to job creation and economic growth could be any more \nstriking.\n  Let me refer back to Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, I say to Senator Hatch, the only thing I would \nadd to the good work you put out there is maybe to say a little bit \nmore about the estate tax; that is, if we do not do anything--as you \nsee from this chart, you can see the House passed death tax reform but \nnot the Senate. Obviously, we do not have a final bill. If we do not \nget a final bill by the end of this year, instead of having no estate \ntax like this year or a $3.5 million exemption like last year, we are \ngoing to have only a million-dollar exemption and a 55-percent tax \nrate. That is going to be catastrophic on small business. It is going \nto be catastrophic in the rural areas. So I hope that emphasizes the \nimportance of getting something done on the estate tax ahead of time.\n  The only other thing I would add, because the Senator did such a good \njob of saying what the economic consequences are, if we let the biggest \ntax increase in the history of the country happen by sunset December \n31, and\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\nthen that means you go back to the tax rates and tax policy of the year \n2000, it is going to be very destructive on job creation for small \nbusinesses and very destructive as far as bringing the certainty that \nbusinesses, particularly small businesses, need if they are going to \nhire people.\n  I had a news conference last month in my State, and I brought in some \nsmall businesspeople. One of the small businesspeople testifying for me \nsaid to the media of Iowa that they would like to hire five or six \npeople, but as long as there is all this uncertainty about what the tax \npolicy is, they are not going to move forward.\n  So what we have to do--and I say to Senator Hatch, I think you have \nsaid it several times--and particularly for small business, we have to \nbring certainty to the Tax Code. You cannot have this uncertainty of \nwhat is going to happen after December 31, particularly when you are \ncertain you are going to have the biggest tax increase in the history \nof the country without even a vote of Congress.\n  So I compliment Senator Hatch. I will not have anything more to say \non this subject until we get one of these pieces of legislation before \nthe Senate. But I thank the Senator very much for his leadership.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my leader on the Finance \nCommittee on the Republican side. I appreciate all the work he has done \nto try to keep this economy going, and we ought to listen to him.\n  Let me just say that the President and congressional Democrats and \nRepublicans agree that small business is the key to a job-based \nrecovery. As the President himself says, small business creates about \n70 percent of all of our new jobs.\n  If we fail to prevent the marginal rate hikes, small businesses will \nbe especially hard hit. The Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that \nhalf of the flowthrough small business income would be hit by the \nreimposition of the top two brackets. Ironically, this is what all the \nresistance from the other side is about. They insist on raising the top \nmarginal rates on small businesses by up to 17 to 24 percent--all of \nthis during a time when we ought to be going the other way and assuring \nsmall businesses that they should take steps to grow without paying a \ntax penalty.\n  There is a bipartisan group that recognizes the merits of preventing \nthese tax hikes on small businesses. But I think the President and the \nDemocratic leadership need to see the light. We are talking about \nsomewhere between 750,000 and 800,000 small businesses, where 70 \npercent of the jobs are created. If we do not handle this right, we are \ngoing to have a pretty long time of an economic system that really does \nnot work in this country. So it is important that we get going here in \nthis lameduck session and resolve this issue.\n  There are people all over the map on this issue, but I think the \nsmartest thing to do would be to keep the tax relief the way it is. I \nwould move it at least 2 years and hopefully 3 years. I would like to \nmake it permanent for everybody in our society because we are a high-\ntaxed society under the current circumstances, but apparently we do not \nhave the votes to make it permanent. But we should have the votes to be \nable to put it over at least until we can get out of the rough politics \nof a lameduck session, and hopefully we will be able to resolve these \nproblems in the future in a way that both sides can feel good.\n  Having said all this, let me just say that I have really appreciated \nserving under the distinguished Senator from Iowa. He is a hard-nosed, \npractical leader in this body. Everybody knows he is totally honest and \ntotally effective in so many ways. He is a dear friend of mine. I want \nhim to know how much I appreciated serving next to him on the Finance \nCommittee. And we will be serving next to each other on the Judicially \nCommittee in this upcoming year. I look forward to seeing him, as a \nnonlawyer, take over the controls from the Republican standpoint on the \nJudiciary Committee because even though the distinguished Senator from \nIowa is a nonlawyer, he brings a practical balance to the Judiciary \nCommittee--and to the Finance Committee up until now--that is sorely \nneeded. He is one of the most respected people, by me, in this whole \nbody of very, very strong minds and people. So I am grateful to him. I \nam grateful he is my friend, and I am grateful we can work together \nside by side in both of these committees.\n  I thank the Senator for all the hard work he has done in the Finance \nCommittee all these years. I have watched him, I have sat beside him, \nand I have seen the products he has done, and the Senator has worked in \ngood faith with both sides, and certainly with total honesty, and that \nis a high accolade right there.\n  Madam President, these are important issues. I know that not just the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa and myself feel deeply about them, but \nI hope we can get our colleagues together on both sides, and the \nPresident, who has indicated he is willing to compromise on this issue, \nand get this put over. If we could do that, I think the President will \nbe better off, jobs will be better off, and in the end, our country--\nwhich is the ultimate goal--there is no doubt in my mind would be much \nbetter off.\n  With that, I thank my distinguished friend from North Dakota and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                                 Taxes\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I decided some long while ago that I was \ngoing to leave the Congress after serving 30 years. So at the end of \nthis year, I will conclude my work here in the U.S. Congress. But I was \nthinking--sitting in the Chamber, listening to my two colleagues, for \nwhom I have great respect and profound disagreements with--I was \nthinking about how interesting it is that people of good faith--and \nthey are two Senators of good faith--can feel very strongly about an \nissue. I feel differently about some of the issues they just described, \nand I sat here and resisted the urge to jump up every 5 or 10 minutes \nand engage in that discussion.\n  It is not a difference of opinion about whether we would like the \nAmerican people to pay the lowest rate of taxes possible; it is, \nrather, in my judgment, about the rearview mirror of history, when \nhistorians gather 50 and 100 years from now and look back at this \nmoment and say: All right, where was America then?\n  Well, America had a $13 trillion debt, a $1.3 trillion deficit. We \nare sending men and women off to war by the hundreds of thousands, \nstrapping on body armor in the morning, getting shot at in the \nafternoon. About 20 million people are either unemployed or not working \nup to their potential because they could not find the job that fits \nthem. There are record numbers of people on food stamps. So that is \nwhere America was then. And what was the debate on the floor of the \nCongress? How can you further cut revenue? How can you borrow money \nfrom the Chinese in order to give those who make $1 million a year a \n$100,000 a year tax cut? They are going to say: Are you kidding me? \nThat is what the discussion was? Wasn't there discussion about whether \nit was wise to borrow $4 trillion more to extend tax cuts that came in \n2001 because the President--then-President George W. Bush--felt we were \ngoing to have surpluses forever? The first surplus was the year before \nhe took office, the last year of Bill Clinton, the first budget surplus \nin 30 years. Then they said: OK, we predict we are going to have \nsurpluses for the next 10. President Bush said: Well, let's give them \nback, with very big tax cuts, the bulk of which go to upper income \nfolks. I didn't vote for that. I thought: Why don't we be a little \nconservative? What if something happens? Well, it did--a terrorist \nattack, a recession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, debt as far as the \neye can see, soldiers at war--and the discussion is how to further cut \ntaxes, especially for upper income Americans. I am telling my \ncolleagues, it is going to confound and confuse some future economists, \nhow on Earth that could have been the major debate of the day in the \nCongress at this moment.\n\n  There is no preordained destiny for this country that this country \nwill always be the dominant world power. That is not preordained. That \nwill happen if this country begins again to make good decisions and \ntough decisions. People think times are tough now. They have been \ntougher in this country. Our parents and grandparents and those who \ncame before them, those who homesteaded in sod huts, those\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nwho traveled and populated this country out of wagon trains under the \nHomestead Act to go and buy a place and build a farm and raise a \nfamily, they had it tough, but they built communities and built a \ncountry and they did the right things. They made tough decisions. It is \nnot a tough decision for us to say all 100 of us want tax cuts--well, I \nwould like it if nobody paid taxes, if nobody had to pay taxes. But who \nis going to pay for the cost of things we do together, such as build \nschools to educate kids, build roads to travel, pay for defense so we \ncan protect this country and on and on and on?\n  So I didn't come to talk about that, but I couldn't resist at least \nthe urge to say our requirement for this country is to look well ahead \nand to ask: How do we retain the capability in this country so we will \nstill remain a world economic power? This country needs jobs. This \ncountry needs the resurrection of a manufacturing base. We will not \nlong remain as a country, a world economic power, if we don't have \nworld-class manufacturing capability--making stuff--making things that \nsay ``Made in America.'' That ought to be the discussion: how to put \nAmerica back to work. There is no social program as important as a good \njob that pays well, and too many Americans are out of work at this \npoint with a sick economy. The solution is not a tax cut for everybody. \nThat is akin to going to a quack doctor who has only one recipe. He has \na jug of thick brown liquid, and no matter what you have--the hiccups, \ngout, liver trouble--he ladles out some thick brown liquid, and he \nsays: There it is. Take that and it will make you better.\n  We have people who have that vision here. Any urge, any itch, give \nthem a tax cut. How about the Federal budget deficit? How about \ncontrolling spending? Yes, we have to control some spending and cut the \ndeficit. Let's cut some spending and let's ask people who should be \npaying taxes and aren't now to pay their fair share of taxes. That is \nwhat we ought to do.\n  All right. I have that at least a little bit out of my system today.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  I came to talk about something else. I came to talk about unfinished \nbusiness toward the end of this year. There is still the ability to \nreclaim some success in an area that I think is very important. It is \ntrue, as I have just described, that jobs are very important in this \ncountry. It is also true that the economy, fiscal policy, debt, and \ndeficits are very important and we need to get a hold on them and deal \nwith them and respond to them and fix this country's economy. But it is \nalso important that we need to address the subject of energy, and we \nhave tried; we have tried so hard. We can decide it doesn't matter \nmuch. We can act as though it is irrelevant. But then tomorrow morning, \njust for a moment, what if all the American people couldn't turn on or \noff the alarm clock or turn on the light or turn on the hot water \nheater to take a hot shower or turn on the toaster or the coffee maker? \nWhat if they couldn't turn on the ignition to get to work? What if they \ndidn't have lights at work? We use energy 100 ways before we start work \nand never, ever think about it. What if the switch didn't work? What if \nthe tank wasn't full?\n  Let me describe the danger because this is not irrelevant. It is not \nan idle issue that this country could very well find itself belly side \nup with an economy that couldn't work because we couldn't find the \nenergy we need. About 60 percent of the oil we need and use in this \ncountry comes from other countries. I have described hundreds of times \non the floor that we stick little straws in the Earth and we suck out \noil. About 85 million barrels a day is sucked out of this planet. On \nthis little spot called the United States of America, we need to use \none-fourth of it. One-fourth of everything we suck out of this Earth \nhas to come to the U.S.A. We are prodigious users of oil. Much of that \noil comes from areas of the world that are very troubled. There are \nsome that don't like us very much. We send them over $1 billion, in \nsome cases $1.5 billion a day, every single day to buy their oil. My \ncolleagues know and I know that in some parts of the world enough money \nspills from that oil barrel to help fund terrorism. We know it. If we \nare that vulnerable, if our economy is in that much need of oil from \nothers, particularly troubled parts of the world, if tomorrow that \nsupply were interrupted or shut off and if that meant that this \ncountry's economy would be belly up just like that, do we then decide \nto do nothing about it or do we do something about it to address it in \nthe context of national security?\n  We have armies. We commit armies to trouble spots around the world to \nprotect our interests. Those armies can only operate if they have food \nand fuel. They need both. Energy security is the same as national \nsecurity, and we have ignored for so long this issue of vulnerability \nthat exists with respect to our energy future.\n  I wish to talk about what we need to do, and I wish to talk about my \ndisappointment that we come now to November, almost December, 3 weeks \nleft perhaps in December, and last June a year ago we passed an energy \nbill out of the Energy Committee that was bipartisan. It did a lot to \naddress our energy security. Yet we will likely end this year with \nunfinished business, leaving behind that progress.\n  I wish to talk a little about the unbelievable progress in this \ncountry. In 1830, it took 3 weeks to travel from Chicago to New York--3 \nweeks from Chicago to New York City. Twenty-five years later, you could \ndo it in 3 days: the transcontinental railroad. The transcontinental \nrailroad changed everything. Then the automobile, the automobile came \nalong, first with an electric engine and then the internal combustion \nengine and then it needed a substantial amount of oil. Then our \ngovernment said: We understand that, so anybody who is going to look \nfor oil or gas, we want to give you a big, permanent tax benefit. It \nwas in the public interest to do that. So for a century we have said to \npeople: Go find oil and gas because we need it. We have incentivized \nthat drilling here in this country.\n  If we think of what has happened over this period I have described in \ntravel and technology, including the automobile, the light bulb--I \nmean, think of the impact both those innovations have had in our lives; \npretty unbelievable.\n  One day on a Saturday I was in Grand Forks, ND, and I met with our \noldest resident, Mary Schumacher, 111 years old. She was spry--I \nshouldn't say ``spry'' because she wasn't moving very well, but she had \na very keen mind and we were able to have a very good visit--111 years \nold. She talked to me about her memories of when she was 6 and watched \nthe barn burn. She has a great memory. We talked about how things have \nchanged in 100 years of her lifetime. By the way, I stopped at that \nnursing home to see Mary because I wasn't able to be there some months \nbefore when I was invited to go to her birthday party, and I was \ninvited by her niece who showed up when I showed up that Saturday to \nvisit Mary. Her niece put on the birthday party and her niece was 103 \nyears old, in even better shape than Mary, moving around and fussing \nand making sure this visit with Mary was going well.\n\n  So we talked about the big changes in her life. I thought after I \nleft there: Here is a person who has now lived over a century and she \nhas seen everything. So let me think about her life.\n  In 1909--and she would have been nearly 10 years old then--in 1909, \nPresident Howard Taft, 5 foot 11 inches tall and 300 pounds, decided to \nget rid of the horse and buggy at the White House as the mode of \ntransportation. He was the first President to decide he was going to \nbuy an automobile. He bought a Baker electric car. President Taft might \nnot have fit into a Mini Cooper had there been one back then, but he \nbought a Baker electric car, which goes to show batteries have a lot of \npower. There has been a lot of discussion about that these days. But \nisn't it interesting that an electric car for the White House in 1909--\nthat is 100 years ago--that electric car, now a century later, 100 \nyears later, is the subject of legislation I have on the floor of the \nSenate, along with Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Senator \nMerkley of Oregon; the Electric Vehicle Deployment Act, 100 years \nlater. It is the new new thing. It is what we knew 100 years ago \nworked.\n  I wish to talk a little about these things and all the changes we \nhave seen and why this issue is critical and why I feel so disappointed \nif we don't, in the final 3 weeks, at least take a\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nportion of that which we know needs to be done and do it because there \nis bipartisan agreement on a couple of these issues.\n  Let me mention them quickly. One, a renewable electricity standard so \nwe try to induce more renewable energy production in this country. That \nis bipartisan. We have cosponsors in the Senate, including Senator \nBrownback, who is a very strong supporter of that, a renewable electric \nstandard. The Electric Vehicle Deployment Act, which I have described, \nSenator Alexander and I and others, bipartisan; and the natural gas \nprovision that Senator Reid and Senator Menendez have sponsored, that \nis also bipartisan. Those are things we can do and should do at the end \nof the year that is bipartisan that will advance our interests.\n  Why is it that energy is important? Well, one, the vulnerability to \nour economy if we were to see the supply of energy that is necessary \nshut off to this country at any point. So it is national security. No. \n1, national security. No. 2, it is the issue of the domestic energy use \nand the conversion as a part of this national and energy security to \nconservation, No. 1, and the production of different kinds of energy, \nNo. 2, and then, finally, the issue of environmental benefits of some \nof the changes that are necessary. We are coming to an intersection for \nthe first time when we debate energy in which energy production and \nnational security resulting from that comes to the same intersection as \nthe issue of climate change. So everything is going to change. The \nquestion isn't whether, it is how. So I wish to talk just a bit about \nsome of the things we can do, it seems to me, to address these matters.\n  Let me talk about electricity. We produce a lot of electricity from \ndifferent sources, including coal and natural gas, and so on. Coal is \nour most abundant resource. Fifty percent of the electricity in this \ncountry comes from coal, but we have to use it differently because when \nwe burn coal, we throw carbon into the air and we understand we can't \ncontinue to do that. So we need to find innovative ways to extract the \ncarbon from coal to continue to use that resource. We can and we will, \nin my judgment. I chair the appropriations subcommittee that funds \ncarbon capture technology. There are all kinds of people around this \ncountry doing innovative, wonderful, breathtaking things to find a way \nto decarbonize coal. It is going to happen, if we decide to make the \ninvestment in order to allow it to happen.\n  So electricity that comes from coal or natural gas and electric \nplants, one of the problems we have dealing with the electricity is the \ndelivery from where it is produced to where it is needed. Back in the \nearly days of moving electricity around, we would build a plant to \nproduce the electricity and then a spiderweb network of transmission \nwires in a circle largely around the planet and that became the service \narea and they were not connected one to another. That is the way it \nwas. Then, finally, we decided we needed to move electricity from one \narea to another, so we connected the grids, barely, but we never did go \nback and build a modern transmission system. The result is we have a \nsystem now that is not very reliable and can't effectively move power \nfrom where it is produced to where it is needed, particularly in the \narea of renewable power, where the wind blows and the Sun shines. Where \nyou can produce wind energy and solar energy, we can't at this point \nhave full effective capability to where you can move it to where you \ncan produce it and where you need it.\n  So we need to build an interstate transmission system. We can't do \nthat now. We need legislation to do that. We can't do it now as \ndemonstrated by the fact that in the last 9 years, we have built 11,000 \nmiles of natural gas pipeline to move natural gas around this country, \nand we have been able to build only 668 miles of interstate high-\nvoltage transmission lines. Why? Because we have all kinds of \njurisdictions that can say no and will say no, so you can't build \ntransmission. So the legislation we passed out of the Energy Committee \na year and a half ago now solved that problem, put us on the path to be \nable to build an interstate transmission system, a modern, rich system. \nWe shouldn't lose that. We should proceed to get that opportunity in \nthat legislation.\n  Let me talk a bit about oil and gas. We are actually producing more \noil, for the first time--it has been a long while since we have been on \nthe decline in production. Part of it is from my State. The Bakken \nformation is the largest formation of oil ever assessed in the history \nof the lower 48 States. There are up to 4.3 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. With that, \nplus the role shale plays in much of the country, we are beginning to \nproduce a bit more oil and gas at this point. That will stop quickly if \nwe can't continue what is called hydraulic fracturing. We have to deal \nwith that big problem. Most of us in this Senate, who come from areas \nwhere we produce fossil energy, believe this has been done for 50 years \nwithout a problem, and now it is under some siege. If we can't do \nhydraulic fracturing, that promise of natural gas supplies and new oil \nwill evaporate. We need to continue--and we will--with the production \nof oil and natural gas in this country.\n  I also am a supporter of the production of ethanol and the biofuels. \nI think it makes sense to extend our energy supply, if we can do it \nevery single year, using biomass, corn-based ethanol. That makes a lot \nof sense to me. The other issue I mentioned is coal. We are going to \nhave to find a way to use coal by extracting the carbon. I believe we \ncan do that. We need to make a much greater effort. We have tried to do \nthat in legislation in the last year or two.\n  Then we have nuclear energy. We will build some nuclear plants. We \nare going to do that. I believe we ought to do everything, and do it \nwell, including wind, solar, geothermal. All of the renewables have \ngreat promise. I understand that in this country, for a long while, it \nwas that real men dig and drill, and if you are somebody who supports \nwind or solar energy, go smoke your pipe, read a few books, and have a \nleather patch on your jacket. Real men dig and drill, and the rest of \nyou are a bunch of nuisances. That was the thought that existed for a \nlong time. It is not true anymore. We are going to dig and drill and do \nit differently and protect this country's environment. We are also \ngoing to incentivize and see the production of substantial amounts of \nadditional energy from the wind and the Sun. It makes sense to do that, \nin order to expand our energy supply, protect our environment, produce \nadditional jobs. All of these issues I have talked about are very job \ncreating.\n  Yet, in many ways, the legislation we have worked on languishes \nbecause we are told we don't have time. This is urgent. It is about the \nvulnerability of our economy, about our national security, and it is \nabout jobs. We ought to get about the business of deciding this is a \npriority.\n  If I can describe, in summary, here is how we address energy issues: \nProduce more, yes, in every area. Produce more wind and solar energy, \nincentivize it. Produce more oil--and we are doing that--and natural \ngas. Expand ethanol capabilities and geothermal. We can do all of these \nthings. We are building nuclear plants now. We will see some new ones \ncome online. As a country, we ought to do what the French are doing \nwith respect to reprocessing and recycling and reduce that 100-percent \nbody of waste down to 5 percent. That is what they have been doing for \nsome while. We ought to do that--the renewables are so important--and \nthen move toward the electric vehicle deployment, so we can take \nadvantage of all of this. I mentioned to you that we produce about 85 \nmillion barrels a day of oil--about 21 million barrels here in the \nUnited States, about one-fourth of the oil, and 77 percent of the oil \nwe use in this country is used in vehicles.\n  If you are going to reduce the use of oil and reduce our \nvulnerability from too many exports of oil, then you have to do \nsomething about transportation. That is why this electric vehicle issue \nis so very important. It is the same with respect to natural gas \nvehicles and long-haul trucking across a network in this country. \nElectric vehicles are important. I have always been a fan, as well, of \nhydrogen and fuel cells. I think it is probably just beyond electric \nvehicles. Also, a fuel cell vehicle runs on electricity. It is \ninteresting to get in and drive a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and find \nthat you can put your nose right down at the exhaust pipe, because it \nis just water vapor. It doesn't have a sound. It puts water\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\nvapor out the back and has twice the power at the wheel. I think that \nis what our grandchildren and great-grandchildren are going to drive. \nAll of these issues are so important to this country's future.\n  Again, I end as I started, by saying how profoundly disappointing it \nis that at the end of the session we understand how important this \nissue is and how little has been able to be done. There is still time. \nWe could pass legislation called the Electric Vehicle Deployment Act. \nWe could do that. We could pass legislation calling for a renewable \nenergy standard, renewable electricity standard. This isn't rocket \nscience. These are not complex issues that people can't understand. \nThey understand them. Both political parties have strong supporters for \nthese things. As we turn to December, it seems to me that as we \ncontemplate probably 3 weeks in December on the floor of the Senate, we \nought to at least consider what portion of an energy system and energy \nfuture can we embrace that came out of the Energy Committee in the \nSenate. The Electric Vehicle Deployment Act is the legislation that \ncame out most recently and passed 19 to 3 by the Energy Committee--\nstrongly bipartisan. Why wouldn't we take that up? Why would we not \ncomplete work on that and advance this country's future?\n  The other day I talked about the two dune-buggy-size vehicles on the \nsurface of Mars. I did it because I was talking to some people in North \nDakota, who said nothing is going right, everything is going to hell in \na hand basket, and nothing the government touches works for sure. They \nwere down. I told them the story about the two dune-buggy-size vehicles \nwe are driving on the surface of Mars. Five years ago, 1 week apart, we \nignited rockets, and they lifted off on the west coast of the United \nStates, and they were on their journey to Mars--1 week apart. The first \nrocket transported its payload to the surface of Mars, which landed on \nMars with a thump and a bounce. It was in a shroud. When it stopped \nbouncing and stayed still, the shroud opened, and out of the shroud \ndrove a dune-buggy-size vehicle on the surface of Mars. One week later, \nthe second payload was deposited on the surface of Mars. The shroud \nbounced, opened, and the second vehicle drove off to the surface of \nMars. That was 5 years ago. One's name is Spirit and one is \nOpportunity--two little vehicles, Spirit and Opportunity. They were \nsupposed to last 90 days on the surface of Mars, giving us information \nabout what we could learn about this strange planet.\n  Five years later, Spirit and Opportunity are still moving. It takes \nus 9 minutes to communicate with Spirit or Opportunity, to send them a \nmessage. At one point, Spirit fell dead asleep, and we communicated \nwith a satellite orbiting Mars and had the satellite communicate with \nSpirit, and Spirit woke up. Spirit, they say, has an arm that was used \nto sample the soil of Mars. That arm has become just like old men \nbecome, rheumatoid and arthritic, and now hangs at a strange angle \nbecause of that machine arthritis it has, apparently. Also a wheel \nbroke, among the five wheels, but it didn't fall off; it is hanging. As \nSpirit traverses the surface of Mars, it drags one wheel that digs a \nslightly deeper 2-inch hole in the surface of Mars, and the arthritic \narm reaches back and tells us what is happening on Mars.\n  How is all of this happening? First of all, it is unbelievable \nengineering, right? Can you imagine the people who put this together, \nto send dune buggies we could drive on the surface of Mars, and then \nthey last 5 years when they were supposed to last 90 days? How are they \npowered? Do they have a Briggs and Stratton engine and somebody pulls \nit and gets them started? No. They are powered by the Sun. They have \nsolar cells that allow us to have the power to drive dune buggies on \nthe surface of Mars. Is it beyond our reach to believe that if we can \npower dune buggies with solar cells on Mars, we can fix a few of these \nthings here on planet Earth? Of course that is not beyond our reach. Of \ncourse we can do that. In fact, the very names of these dune buggies--\nSpirit and Opportunity--ought to be the names on these desks in this \nChamber: Spirit and Opportunity.\n\n  I started by saying there is no preordained destiny for this country \nto do well. It always has done well. When I grew up, I knew we were the \nbiggest, the strongest, the best, and had the most. We could beat \nanybody with one hand tied behind our back. That will not always be the \ncase. We will not remain a world economic power, unless we make smart \ndecisions. Our parents and grandparents did. Every parent in this \ncountry has sacrificed for their kids. I don't know what is in second, \nthird, or fourth place to most people, but first place is their kids. \nThe question is whether it is on fiscal policy or energy policy. The \nquestion is, what are we willing to do for our kids? What kind of \nfuture do we want to leave our kids? Do we want to leave them deep in \ndebt or vulnerable on energy production, which may leave us in the dark \none day? I don't think so. This country can do much better than that.\n  Neither party has been much of a political bargain recently. Both \nparties need to do better. I have strong feelings about which has \nbetter ideas at the moment, and I will not be partisan on the floor, \nexcept to say that this country deserves more. It is not just coming \nout here talking about how can we cut taxes for everybody; it is how do \nwe tighten our belts and ask those who are supposed to pay taxes to pay \nthem, getting deficits under control, and getting people back on \npayrolls, and incentivizing businesses to create jobs.\n  How do we address energy issues? It is time for this country to be \nserious--this Congress--about doing things that are necessary, which \nmay require sacrifice from all of us. If young men and women are \nwilling to leave their homes to go to Afghanistan today for a year \nbecause their country asks them to, we can do no less than make \nsacrifices that are thoughtful on behalf of our future, so they won't \ncome home and find a bigger deficit and more unemployment, but instead \nthat we made the tough decisions to fix these things. We are going to \nfix this because it is important for the country's future.\n  As I said when I started, this issue of energy is so very important \nand is unfinished business. In my judgment, we ought not to include at \nthe end of this year an energy bill, or components of one, that I think \ncould be very important to this country's future, to jobs, and to our \nnational security.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, in a very short while here--literally, \nin about 40 minutes--the time will be expired and we will be voting on \nthe motion to proceed to the Food Safety Modernization Act. The Food \nSafety Modernization Act. One can wonder why did we have to go through \na cloture motion and a vote on that the other day. We got 74 votes on \nit. But it looks as though now we are going to have to have another \nvote on the motion to proceed after we have had 74 votes.\n  A lot of effort has gone into this bill by a lot of people--\nRepublicans and Democrats--and, Lord knows, our staff. This bill has \nbeen germinating and being put together over the course of at least the \nlast 3 or 4 years anyway, and probably a little before that when we \nstarted. I know Senator Durbin has been working on this for several \nyears, as have Senator Gregg, Senator Dodd, and others. So this has all \nbeen put together over a period of several years. But I would say over \nthe last 4 years, diligent work has gone into this bill, and certainly \nagain in the last year.\n  It was 1 year ago, November 18--1 year ago today--that this bill was \nreported out of our HELP Committee, which I chair. It was reported out \nwithout one dissenting vote. It is a bill that is supported by so many \ndifferent groups and so many different people. Here is a list of the \npeople supporting this bill. We worked hard to get a broad base of \nsupport from both industry and consumers. As I have said, this may be \none of the only bills I have seen around here that has the support not \nonly of the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers \nInstitute and the Center for Science in the Public Interest. So we have \nboth consumer groups and the business groups\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\nsupporting this--the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Public \nInterest Research Group. When have those two ever been together on a \nbill? And the Snack Food Association and the Pew Charitable Trusts. I \nmean, we have wide support for this.\n  The industry wants this. They want it because they know our food \nsafety laws have not been upgraded in seven decades--since 1938, before \nI was born. Think about how our food has changed in our society and how \nwe produce it and how we process it and how we ship it, not to mention \nthe amount of foreign foods coming into this country. Consumers want it \nbecause we know a lot of people are getting sick.\n  I will hasten to add that we do have one of the safest food supplies \nin the world. But that is not good enough, because we know how many \npeople get ill every year. Thousands of people are contaminated by food \npoisoning every year--E. coli, salmonella. I have met with families \nhere from Safe Tables Our Priority. I have met with families of kids \nwho are damaged for life because they happened to eat the wrong thing--\nthey ate some spinach or a tomato or fish, shellfish, or something such \nas that. These kids are maimed for life.\n  We have worked very hard to put this bill together. As I said, 1 year \nago it came out of our committee without one dissenting vote. But there \nwere still some problems out there, and so we worked very hard since \nlast November to try to reach an agreement on this bill. And we have a \nbroad agreement. As I said, we had 74 votes on the floor of the Senate \nthe other day.\n  One of my colleagues has raised a lot of issues on this bill. My good \nfriend from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, is on our committee, and he has \nraised a lot of concerns about this bill. I have met with him several \ntimes and we have had good discussions. I know he said some nice things \nabout me on the floor earlier, and I appreciate that, and I would repay \nthose in kind; that Senator Coburn is a very thoughtful person and he \nfocuses on these things. He reads these bills and he gets involved. \nThis is not something off the seat of his pants. He has focused on \nthis. Some of the suggestions he made I thought were valid. We looked \nthrough them and we incorporated a lot of the suggestions made by my \nfriend from Oklahoma into this bill.\n  We were also willing to go to the consumers and say, look, this is \nokay. None of us--not any one Senator around here--has infinite wisdom. \nOnly one person has infinite wisdom. No Senators have infinite wisdom. \nI can't say I have ever written a bill in its entirety that got through \nhere without having anything changed, because we don't know everything. \nSo we rely upon one another in good faith to suggest changes, to point \nout things maybe we didn't see due to our blinders. We help each other \nput together bills that have broad support and broad consensus so that \nwe move ahead as a society. To me, that is the way I think we ought to \noperate.\n  So when other people were making suggestions--and I didn't mean to \nsingle out Senator Coburn, because others too had made suggestions--we \ntried to work with them to incorporate certain provisions in the bill. \nSenator Tester, for example, on our side had suggestions about \nexempting certain small producers. That raised the consternation of \nmany on the consumer side. It also raised the consternation of many on \nthe business side. A lot of the bigger businesses said: Well, if we \nhave to do this, you can get just as sick from eating things from small \nproducers too. So we had to work through that. But we did work through \nit. It took us several months but we worked through and we got an \nagreement.\n  Quite frankly, we had good input from the Republican side--from \nSenator Gregg, Senator Enzi, and Senator Burr. I mention those \nindividuals because they have been very integral to this process on our \ncommittee. We have worked through that and we got an amendment that \nsatisfies the small producers and the consumers and the business \ncommunity and the large producers. Not easy. Not easy. But compromises \na lot of times aren't very easy. It is a compromise that we worked \nthrough. We worked through Senator Tester's amendment too. That took a \nlong time.\n  We were not able to reach an agreement on Senator Feinstein's \namendment. We agreed not to incorporate it because we could not reach \nan agreement on it--on the BPA amendment, even though it is very \nimportant to her and very important to a lot of people.\n  We have tried to get something together that would have this broad \nconsensus and yet move us forward in making our food safer, and I \nbelieve this bill does that. This bill does this in four ways:\n  It improves the prevention of food safety problems. That is key. For \nmany years, I served as chair or ranking member on the Agriculture \nCommittee--35 years, both here and in the House. Many years ago, we \ncame up with a program of prevention. Rather than solving the problem \nlater, the question was: How do we prevent pathogens from entering the \nmeat supply? We came up with this proposal of finding the access \npoints. Where are the points in the process where contaminants and \npathogens can come in? Let us have the industry come up with plans on \nhow to prevent that on their own. That has worked. Does it work 100 \npercent every single time? No. But nothing is ever perfect.\n  I would hasten to add that even if we pass this bill, will it prevent \nevery single foodborne illness forever and ever? Probably not. Probably \nnot. But it is going to be a lot better than what we have right now, a \nlot better, because we are going to look at prevention--preventing the \npathogens from entrance in the first place. So that is one way we do \nit.\n  Secondly, it improves the response to detection of foodborne illness \noutbreaks when they do occur. In other words, we will be able to detect \nit earlier and respond earlier than we have been able to do in the \npast.\n  It enhances our Nation's food defense capabilities. Every year, 76 \nmillion Americans get sick from foodborne illnesses--76 million. So the \nstakes are too high not to act.\n  These are the critical ways in which we have moved the ball forward. \nAgain, I know my friend from Oklahoma has said to me many times that it \nwill not solve all your problems. I understand that. It is not perfect. \nBut there is an old saying: Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the \ngood. This is a good bill. It is going to help keep our people from \ngetting sick. Everyone? No. I would never stand here and say this is \ngoing to solve every single foodborne illness problem in America. But \nit is sure going to do a lot more than we have been doing.\n  Again, I want to make it clear that if anyone says we are trampling \non the rights of the minority, I ask you to consider all we have done. \nWe have a bipartisan team in place, we have modified the bill dozens of \ntimes to get the right balance, we have all made tremendous \ncompromises--Democrats and Republicans, consumers and business. As I \nsaid, we agreed to compromises just lately. The mandatory inspection \nschedule, which is so important to the public health community, has \nbeen reduced tenfold--tenfold--since that bill was reported out of our \ncommittee unanimously 1 year ago. We accepted language, as I said, \nwhich exempted the small facilities from these new requirements--the \nTester amendment. We agreed to changes in the section on traceback, \nwhich limits the application of the new rule to farms and restaurants. \nThere is no registration fee to help pay for the bill. The routine \naccess to records the FDA wanted, we don't do that either.\n  That is a short list. I can go on and on. I think one of my friends \non the other side said we have bent over backward, and we have. We \nwanted to reach a point where we could move ahead with the bill, even \noffering to let some amendments be offered and we would vote on those \namendments. But what has happened now, I understand, is that the \nSenator from Oklahoma, my friend, has now said he wanted to offer an \namendment dealing with earmarks.\n  Look, earmarks is an issue. It is an issue that the next Congress, I \nwould say--probably the next Congress--is going to have to address. But \nit should be done in the spirit of debate. It should be done in the \nspirit so committees that have relevant jurisdiction can look at this, \nmake recommendations. We should not do it in the heat of passion, right \nnow. We just came off of a very heated election. There have been a lot \nof changes made. I understand that.\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nWe live with that. That is fine. But now is not the time to start \nthrowing up red-hot issues that were in the campaign. Let's let things \ncool down a little bit and approach an issue such as earmarks \nthoughtfully, with due diligence and with due debate.\n  This bill that is going to protect our people from getting sick and \nour kids from being injured for lifetimes because they eat contaminated \npeanut butter--this is not the bill to deal with something dealing with \nearmarks. I hope my friend from Oklahoma will relent. There will be \nplenty of time and plenty of opportunities when we come back in January \nwith a new Congress, I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, to bring up \nthe matter of earmarks and have it debated fully and have some kind of \nresolution by both the Senate and the House on that issue--but not \nright now. This is not the time to do it, not in the heat of coming off \nthe campaign.\n  Let's keep our eye on the ball. This is a food safety bill. We have \ncome so close. We have an agreement from the House that what we pass \nhere, the bill we have put together, that we reached all these \ncompromises on--we have an agreement from the House, if we pass it and \nwe do get significant--we get bipartisan support, that the House would \ntake it and pass it and send it right to the President. What more could \nyou ask for than that? We get to decide what the President actually \nsigns into law.\n  Without going into every little thing we have done here, let me just \nmention a few.\n  Senator Coburn was concerned about the authorization level, so we \noffered in good faith to reduce it by 50 percent. That is kind of a \ncompromise--we just reduced the authorization by 50 percent on the \ngrants. We offered to modify the sections on performance standards and \nsurveillance. It is completely done. We completely struck section 510. \nWe called for increasing the hiring of FDA staff. In our bill, we \ncalled for increasing staff to conduct certain inspections. My friend \nobjected to that. In the spirit of compromise, we struck it. We said \nno, we are not going to call for increasing hiring of field staff. Mr. \nCoburn had some concerns--rightfully so, by the way--about improving \ncoordination between FDA and USDA, so we offered to add his language \nthat would force them to get together and not duplicate efforts, and on \nthe customs side, too, so we would eliminate any kind of duplication of \ninspections. We put that in the bill.\n  We offered to do all this and to put it in the bill, and we did, and \nthat will be in our amendment that we offer. We will in good faith put \nthose things in our bill. But then I am told that now we are probably \ngoing to have to file cloture, fill the tree, and do all that stuff \nwhich I was hoping we would not have to do. That is not the way to do \nbusiness here. I don't like doing it that way. That is why we worked so \nhard to try to reach these agreements. But I guess we are going to be \nforced to do that. I hope that is not so.\n  I also heard that maybe someone might want to read the bill. That is \n4 hours of reading the bill. That bill has been out here for a year. If \nanybody wanted to read it, they could have read it by now. But that is \njust another delaying tactic we really do not need.\n  Again, on this issue of saying we cannot vote on this bill unless we \nwill vote on earmarks, I say earmarks is an important issue. I am happy \nto have the debate and to have a vote on that but not now. This is a \nfood safety bill. We have it ready to go. We have all our compromises \nin place. This is not the time and this is not the bill on which to \ndebate the whole issue of earmarks.\n  You might say, why are we so willing to compromise, why am I so \npassionate on this bill? Because people are dying. We have Thanksgiving \ncoming up. People will be gathered around with their families--except \nfor all those people in homeless shelters. Mr. President, 950,000 \nchildren in America who go to elementary, middle, and high school will \nnot have a home to go to this Thanksgiving because they are living in \nhomeless shelters. Think about that. They are living in cars and \nhomeless shelters. They are being shunted around--950,000. Am I going \nto stand here and say that if we pass this bill and get it to the \nPresident, that is going to keep any one of them from getting sick on \nwhat they might eat on Thanksgiving Day? I am not here to say that. But \nwhat this bill will do is send a strong signal that we are going to \ntake the steps necessary in the coming months and years to upgrade our \nfood safety system so that the chance, the likelihood of them ever \ngetting sick from eating contaminated food is going to be greatly \ndecreased. Surely we can at least send that hopeful message out to our \nfamilies before Thanksgiving. Surely we could do that and not get \nbollixed up around here in politics and political debate.\n  I know of no politics on this bill. I know of no politics. I mean \nDemocrat, Republican, left, right, liberal, conservative--I don't know \nof anything like that. There is not. I do know that this issue of \nearmarks, regardless of the substantive issue, is a political issue \ntoo. They may have substantive reasons, but there is also a lot of \npolitics hanging around that.\n  Let's take the bill that has no politics, knows neither left nor \nright, conservative, liberal, Democrat, or Republican. It has nothing \nto do with earmarks or what we ever do with earmarks or anything else. \nIt has to do with the safety and welfare of our American families, of \nour kids. I am just asking people to be reasonable.\n  There is a time and place for political debate, even here on the \nSenate floor. We may say it does not happen, but we know it does. There \nis a time and place for that. That will happen--not now, not on this \nbill. We have come too far. We are too close. We have too many \ncompromises that we made that are so widely supported. I am afraid that \nif we lose this, all the good work that has gone in in the last year, \nthe last 2 years, the last 4 years putting this together, it is going \nto be very hard to put it back together again. So people will continue \nto roll the dice when they buy food. Maybe it is safe and maybe it is \nnot.\n  We will continue to see more things happen like what happened to \nKayla Boner, Monroe, IA, age 14. On October 22, 2007, she turned 14 and \npassed her learner's permit. The next day, she stayed home. She had a \nfoodborne illness due to E. coli contamination. She was admitted to the \nPaella, IA, Community Hospital. Her symptoms worsened. She didn't \nrespond to antibiotics, and within a week her kidneys began to fail. \nKayla was transferred to Blank Children's Hospital for dialysis, but \nher condition continued to deteriorate. She suffered a seizure and \nbegan to have heart problems. A few days later, Kayla's brain activity \nstopped, and her parents made the painful decision to take their \nbeautiful daughter off life support.\n  For Kyle Allgood--spinach. His family is going to have an empty seat \nat their Thanksgiving table this year. Kyle, a playful 2-year-old, fell \nill after eating bagged spinach contaminated by a deadly strain of E. \ncoli. They thought it was flu. He began to cry from excruciating \nabdominal pain. He was flown all the way to a Salt Lake City hospital. \nHis kidneys failed, he had a heart attack, and he died--from eating \nbagged spinach.\n  Stephanie Bartilucci's family is also going to have an empty seat at \ntheir Thanksgiving table this year--killed by listeria, eating lettuce. \nShe was 30 weeks pregnant, Stephanie was. She felt that something was \nwrong. When she went for an ultrasound, it showed that the baby was not \nmoving. She had contractions, and eventually her heart began to beat \ndangerously fast and she had to undergo an emergency C-section. When \nshe awoke, she found that her baby boy had bleeding in his brain and \ncouldn't breathe on his own. He was intubated and brain dead. Stephanie \nsoon discovered she had been suffering from a bacterial infection from \neating contaminated lettuce. The bacteria was so deadly that she became \nseptic and almost lost her own life. Her newborn baby, Michael, died in \nher arms that night.\n  There are also families who have had loved ones survive foodborne \nillnesses, but their lives will never be the same, such as Rylee \nGustafson and her family. On Rylee's ninth birthday, she began to \ncomplain of stomach pain after eating E. coli-contaminated spinach. \nWithin 72 hours, she had been admitted to UCSF Children's Hospital. Her \nkidneys began to fail, and dialysis treatments were started. In \naddition to kidney failure, she experienced hallucinations and \ntemporary loss of vision,\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\ndeveloped high blood pressure and diabetes, and had fluid buildup in \nher lungs and around her heart. On the 10th day of hospitalization, \nRylee's condition had deteriorated to the point where the doctors \nbelieved it necessary to prepare her family that she might not pull \nthrough. Rylee spent 35 days in the hospital and will have to endure \nthe memories of that traumatic time for the rest of her life. The long-\nterm effects of her illness are currently unknown.\n  How many Americans will have to die, how many of these kids will \nbecome sick before we fulfill our responsibility to modernize our \nwoefully outdated food safety system?\n  How many families will have to endure a tragic loss before we pass \nthis legislation? One more tragedy is one too many. I urge my \ncolleagues, as they think about their holiday plans and their \npreparations, to take a moment to think about families who have had \ntheir holidays disrupted by contaminated food. Five thousand people die \nevery year in this country because of contaminated food. Among them are \nmany children. As they spend the day with their loved ones preparing \nThanksgiving banquets, the last thing people want is to be jeopardized \nby the threat of food contamination. Yet many families are haunted by \nthis. It is unacceptable. It is past time we do something. We have come \ntoo far. We have reached compromises. We have the support of many \nsectors of society.\n  Again, if we pass this bill, will it ensure that no kid like Rylee \nwill ever get sick again? I can't make that promise. Or that no one \nwill ever die? I can't make that promise. But I can promise this: With \nthe passage of this bill, putting it into law, the chances there will \nbe another Rylee Gustafson will be diminished greatly.\n  Let's not get this caught up in politics. Let's get the politics out \nof this. Let's vote on the bill. Let's get it through. Let's go home. \nLet Senators go home for Thanksgiving grateful that we have done a good \nthing, that we have done something good for our country, and that we \ndidn't let it get all boxed up in politics. Isn't that the least we can \ndo for the country on this Thanksgiving week?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nfavor of my amendment No. 4693 to the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act \nS.510 to permit emergency scheduling of designer anabolic steroids.\n  Anabolic steroids--masquerading as body building dietary \nsupplements--are sold to millions of Americans in shopping malls and \nover the Internet even though these products put at grave risk the \nhealth and safety of Americans who use them. The harm from these \nsteroid-tainted supplements is real. In its July 28, 2009, public \nhealth advisory, the FDA described the health risk of these types of \nproducts to include serious liver injury, stroke, kidney failure and \npulmonary embolism. The FDA also warned:\n\n       [A]anabolic steroids may cause other serious long-term \n     adverse health consequences in men, women, and children. \n     These include shrinkage of the testes and male infertility, \n     masculinization of women, breast enlargement in males, short \n     stature in children, adverse effects on blood lipid levels, \n     and increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n  New anabolic steroids--often called designer steroids--are coming on \nthe market every day, and FDA and DEA are unable to keep pace and \neffectively stop these products from reaching consumers.\n  At the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs hearing I \nchaired on September 29, 2009, representatives from FDA and DEA, as \nwell as the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, testified that there is a cat and \nmouse game going on between unscrupulous supplement makers and law \nenforcement--with the bad actors engineering more and more new anabolic \nsteroids by taking the known chemical formulas of anabolic steroids \nlisted as controlled substances in schedule III and then changing the \nchemical composition just slightly, perhaps by a molecule or two. These \nproducts are rapidly put on the market--in stores and over the \nInternet--without testing and proving the safety and efficacy of these \nnew products. There is no prenotification to, or premarket approval by, \nFederal agencies occurring here. These bad actors are able to sell and \nmake millions in profits from their designer steroids because while it \ntakes them only weeks to design a new steroid by tweaking a formula for \na banned anabolic steroid, it takes literally years for DEA to have the \nnew anabolic steroid classified as a controlled substance so DEA can \npolice it.\n  The FDA witness at the hearing, Mike Levy, Director of the Division \nof New Drugs and Labeling Compliance, acknowledged that this is a \n``challenging area'' for FDA. He testified that for FDA it is \n``difficult to find the violative products and difficult to act on \nthese problems.'' The DEA witness, Joseph T. Rannazzisi, Deputy \nAssistant Administrator for DEA, was even blunter. When I questioned \nhim at the hearing, Mr. Rannazzisi admitted that ``at the present time \nI don't think we are being effective at controlling these drugs.'' He \ndescribed the process as ``extremely frustrating'' because ``by the \ntime we get something to the point where it will be administratively \nscheduled [as a controlled substance], there's two to three [new] \nsubstances out there.''\n  The failure of enforcement is caused by the complexity of the \nregulations, statutes and science. Either the Food Drug and Cosmetic \nAct, which provides jurisdiction for FDA, or the Controlled Substances \nAct, which provides jurisdiction for DEA, or both, can be applicable \ndepending on the ingredients of the substance. Under a 1994 amendment \nto the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, called the Dietary Supplement Health \nand Education Act, DSHEA, dietary supplements, unlike new drug \napplications, are not closely scrutinized and do not require premarket \napproval by the FDA before the products can be sold. Premarket \nnotification for dietary supplements is required only if the product \ncontains new dietary ingredients, meaning products that were not on the \nU.S. market before DSHEA passed in 1994.\n  If the FDA determines that a dietary supplement is a steroid, it has \nseveral enforcement measures available to use. FDA may treat the \nproduct as an unapproved new drug or as an adulterated dietary \nsupplement under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Misdemeanor violations \nof the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act may apply, unless there is evidence \nof intent to defraud or mislead, a requirement for a felony charge. \nHowever, given the large number of dietary supplement products on the \nmarket, it is far beyond the manpower of the FDA to inspect every \nproduct to find, and take action against, those that violate the law--\nas the FDA itself has acknowledged.\n  The better enforcement route is a criminal prosecution under the \nControlled Substances Act. However, the process to classify a new \nanabolic steroid as a controlled substance under schedule III is \ndifficult, costly and time consuming, requiring years to complete. \nCurrent law requires that to classify a substance as an anabolic \nsteroid, DEA must demonstrate that the substance is both chemically and \npharmacologically related to testosterone. The chemical analysis is the \nmore straightforward procedure, as it requires the agency to conduct an \nanalysis to determine the chemical structure of the new substance to \nsee if it is related to testosterone. The pharmacological analysis, \nwhich must be outsourced, is more costly, difficult, and can take years \nto complete. It requires both in vitro and in vivo analyses--the latter \nis an animal study. DEA must then perform a comprehensive review of \nexisting peer-reviewed literature.\n  Even after DEA has completed the multiyear scientific evaluation \nprocess, the agency must embark on a lengthy regulatory review and \npublic-comment process, which typically delays by another year or two \nthe time it takes to bring a newly emerged anabolic steroid under \ncontrol. As part of this latter process, DEA must conduct interagency \nreviews, which means sending the studies and reports to the Department \nof Justice, DOJ, the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS--provide public \nnotification of the proposed rule, allow for a period of public \ncomment, review and comment on all public comments, write a final rule \nexplaining why the agency agreed or did not agree with the public \ncomments, send the final rule and agency comments back to DOJ,\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nOMB and HHS, and then publish the final rule, all in accordance with \nthe Administrative Procedures Act. To date, under these cumbersome \nprocedures, DEA has only been able to classify three new anabolic \nsteroids as controlled substances and that process--completed only \nafter the September 29, 2010, Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing--\ntook more than 5 years to finish.\n  It is clear that the current complex and cumbersome regulatory system \nhas failed to protect consumers from underground chemists who easily \nand rapidly produce designer anabolic steroids by slightly changing the \nchemical composition of the anabolic steroids already included on \nschedule III as controlled substances. The story of Jareem Gunter, a \nyoung college athlete who testified at the hearing, illustrates the \nsystem's failure. To improve his athletic performance 4 years ago, \nJareem purchased in a nutrition store a dietary supplement called \nSuperdrol, a product he researched extensively on the Internet and \nbelieved was safe. Unfortunately it was not. Superdrol contained an \nanabolic steroid which to this day is still not included in the list of \ncontrolled substances. After using Superdrol for just several weeks, \nJareem came close to dying because this product--which he thought would \nmake him stronger and healthier--seriously and permanently injured his \nliver. He spent 4 weeks in the hospital and has never been able to \nreturn to complete his college education.\n  To close the loopholes in the present laws that allow the creation \nand easy distribution of deadly new anabolic steroids masquerading as \ndietary supplements, I filed amendment No. 4693 to the FDA Food Safety \nModernization Act S.510 to permit emergency scheduling of designer \nanabolic steroids. The amendment simplifies the definition of anabolic \nsteroid to more effectively target designer anabolic steroids, and \npermits the Attorney General to issue faster temporary and permanent \norders adding recently emerged anabolic steroids to the list of \nanabolic steroids in schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  Under the amendment, if a substance is not listed in schedule III of \nthe Controlled Substances Act but has a chemical structure \nsubstantially similar to one of the already listed and banned anabolic \nsteroids, the new substance will be considered to be an anabolic \nsteroid if it was intended to affect the structure or function of the \nbody like the banned anabolic steroids do. In other words, DEA will not \nhave to perform the complex and time consuming pharmacological analysis \nto determine how the substance will affect the structure and function \nof the body, as long as the agency can demonstrate that the new steroid \nwas created or manufactured for the purpose of promoting muscle growth \nor causing the same pharmacological effects as testosterone.\n  Utilizing the same criteria, the amendment permits the Attorney \nGeneral to issue a permanent order adding such substances to the list \nof anabolic steroids in schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  The amendment also includes new criminal and civil penalties for \nfalsely labeling substances that are actually anabolic steroids. The \npenalties arise where a supplement maker fails to truthfully indicate \non the label--using internationally accepted and understandable \nterminology--that the product contains an anabolic steroid. These \npenalties are intended to be substantial enough to take away the \nfinancial incentive of unscrupulous manufacturers, distributors, and \nretailers who might otherwise be willing to package these products in a \nway that hides the true contents from law enforcement and consumers.\n  Finally, the amendment adds to schedule III 33 new anabolic steroids \nthat have emerged in the marketplace in the 6 years since Congress \npassed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004. It also instructs the \nU.S. Sentencing Commission to review and revise the Federal sentencing \nguidelines to ensure that where an anabolic steroid product is \nillegally manufactured or distributed, and that product is in a tablet, \ncapsule, liquid or other form that makes it difficult to determine the \nactual amount of anabolic steroid in the product, the sentence will be \nbased on the total weight of the product.\n  Amendment No. 4693 simplifies and expedites the process for \nscheduling anabolic steroids as controlled substances. By making this \nsimple procedural change, we can protect the health and lives of \ncountless Americans and provide an effective enforcement mechanism to \nhold accountable those individuals and their companies which \npurposefully exploit the current regulatory system for their selfish \ngain. I urge my colleagues to pass amendment No. 4693 to the FDA Food \nSafety Modernization Act S. 510.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, section 311(c) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the allocations of a committee or committees, \naggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in the resolution \nfor legislation that would improve the safety of the food supply in the \nUnited States. This adjustment to S. Con. Res. 13 is contingent on the \nlegislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the period of the total of \nfiscal years 2009 through 2019.\n  I find that S. 510, a bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act with respect to the safety of the food supply, fulfills \nthe conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for food safety. \nTherefore, pursuant to section 311(c), I am adjusting the aggregates in \nthe 2010 budget resolution, as well as the allocation to the Senate \nHealth, Labor, Education, and Pensions Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n13 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--S.

Madam President, I rise to address one of the most \nimportant issues facing our Nation, the safety of America's food \nsupply. I support the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act that will help \nreduce the rash of contaminated foods that have recently entered our \nfood supply. Every person should have confidence that their food is fit \nto eat.\n  While the FDA has always been the gold standard in maintaining the \nsafety and efficacy of our food and drugs, the salmonella outbreak in \neggs over the summer made it painfully clear that we need to do more--\nand that the law needs updating. The outbreak resulted in as many as \n79,000 illnesses, 30 deaths, and the recall of roughly one half billion \neggs. Beyond that, the Centers for Disease Control informs us that 76 \nmillion people get sick, and 5,000 die, each year from foodborne \nillnesses. Just last week the FDA warned Marylanders about a potential \noutbreak of E. coli in apple cider sold in the State.\n  I applaud the quick action by the FDA in responding to these food \noutbreaks, but we can do better. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg has \ntold us that she needs more resources and more authority to oversee the \nway our food is produced and monitored. That is why, as a committed \nadvocate of food safety nationwide, I support the FDA Food Safety \nModernization Act.\n  This bipartisan bill would give the FDA authority to order mandatory \nfood recalls for unsafe foods if companies don't do it themselves. It \nsets FDA safety standards for produce, creates stronger FDA regulations \nfor sanitary food transportation from our producers to our grocery \nstores, and establishes FDA pilot projects to better track where fruits \nand vegetables come from.\n  This bill also emphasizes prevention and taking action to prevent \nfood outbreaks from occurring in the first place. It ensures that \nfacilities have food safety plans in place to identify, evaluate, and \naddress food safety hazards. With the growing amount of food that is \nimported globally, this bill ensures imported food meets the same \nsafety standards as domestic food by requiring importers to verify the \nsafety of foreign suppliers and imported food. This bill would grant \nthe FDA the authority it needs to protect the health of our families.\n  It is time we get serious about the safety of our Nation's food. The \nhealth of Americans is not something to take a chance with. It is \nimportant that we make food safety a top priority. We must pass the FDA \nFood Safety Modernization Act and empower the FDA to set safety \nstandards and hold food producers accountable.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to say a few words on this \nlegislation because it is something I have worked on for many years. I \ncan't thank Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi and others enough for their \nhard work in bringing this issue to this moment in time. Several things \nhave been stated during the course of the debate which I would like to \naddress. Most of them were stated by my friend from Oklahoma, Senator \nCoburn. At this point he is the only Senator holding up this bill from \nconsideration, one Senator.\n  At this point 89 percent of the American people support food safety \nreform to make our food safer and to have more inspections of imported \nfood so our children and family members don't get sick; 89 percent \nsupport it. The bill has substantial bipartisan support. Twenty \nRepublican and Democratic Senators are committed to this bill. Seventy-\nfour Senators, almost three-fourths of the Senate, voted to move \nforward on this bill, a strong bipartisan roll call. The House passed a \ncompanion bill with the support of 54 Republicans. We know it is a \nbipartisan issue. This should not be a partisan fight.\n  Senator Coburn objected to giving the Federal Government the \nauthority to recall a dangerous food product. Most people believe if \nthere is a dangerous food product in stores across America, the Federal \nGovernment sends out a notice, and it is brought in. That is not the \ncase. The Federal Government does not have the legal authority to \nrecall any food products. All it can do is publicize that the products \nare dangerous and hope that grocers and retailers and manufacturers \nwill take them off the shelves. That is it. That is the existing state \nof law. We give the government that authority.\n  Senator Coburn said it is not necessary. He claims not one company \nhas ever refused to recall contaminated food. He is just wrong. There \nare many instances of companies that just flatout refuse to recall \ntheir food or delay a recall, and many people get sick and die. That is \na fact.\n  Last year Westco Fruit and Nut Company flatout refused FDA's request \nto recall contaminated peanut products. A few years ago, GAO released a \nreport entitled ``Actions Needed by FDA to Ensure Companies Carry Out \nRecalls'' which highlighted six other companies that flatout refused to \nrecall contaminated food when they were told it was dangerous. Even the \nBush administration realized how important this was and formally \nrequested mandatory recall authority in the 2007 food protection plan.\n  Senator Coburn has his facts wrong when he claims the FDA does not \nneed the mandatory recall authority.\n  Senator Coburn also claims our bill does not address the real problem \nin our Nation's food safety system.\n  Once again, he is mistaken. The National Academy of Sciences \ndisagrees. In June, the National Academy released a report entitled \n``Enhancing Food Safety, the Role of the FDA.'' The report contained \nseven critical recommendations for improving food safety. This is not a \npartisan group. Every single one of the key recommendations from that \ngroup is addressed in our bill, including increasing inspections and \nmaking them risk related, giving FDA mandatory recall authority, \nimproving registration of food facilities, and giving the FDA the \nauthority to ban contaminated imports. Our bill fills all of the \ncritical gaps in the FDA's food safety authority that have been \nidentified by the National Academy of Sciences.\n  For Senator Coburn to say it is unnecessary is to ignore science and \nfact and, I guess, the reality that if we are going to make food safer, \nwe need to do our job better. That is why all the key consumer \nprotection and public health groups support this bill--all of them.\n  He thinks this bill is not good for business. He says it hurts their \nprofits and their productivity. He is just wrong. The number and \ndiversity of the industry and business groups that support the bill \nspeaks for itself. Listen to the groups that support the food safety \nbill and tell me they are acting against their best business interests: \nthe Grocery Manufacturers Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe American Beverage Association, the American Frozen Food Institute, \nthe Food Marketing Institute, the International Dairy Foods \nAssociation, National Restaurant Association, Snack Food Association, \nNational Coffee Association, National Milk Producers Federation, \nNational Confectioners Association, Organic Trade Association, the \nAmerican Feed Industry Association.\n  If Senator Coburn is right, every one of these associations' \nleadership should be removed tomorrow because, under his analysis, they \nhave decided to support a bill that hurts their business. They know \nbetter. Safe food is good business. Think about what it costs these \ncompanies when they have to recall a product, when it damages their \nreputation and all the things they will go through to try to clean up \ntheir act.\n  Senator Coburn says there are 10 or 20 deaths per year caused by \nfoodborne illness. The Senator is just wrong. He uses this number to \nsupport his assertion that there are not enough victims to justify a \nbill. Here are the facts. According to the Center for Disease Control, \nthere are not 10 or 20 deaths per year, there are 5,000 deaths in \nAmerica every single year caused by foodborne illness--5,000. Senator \nReid can tell some stories about his State which was hit particularly \nhard by food illness.\n  Moreover, every year 76 million Americans contract a foodborne \nillness; 325,000 are hospitalized. A few weeks ago I told you about one \nof the victims, a young man named Richard Chatfield from Owasso, OK. At \nage 15, he was on a camping trip and was diagnosed with E. coli. For 8 \nyears, he suffered pain, migraine headaches, dry heaves, and high blood \npressure, and after going on dialysis, kidney failure. When we were \nlast debating this bill, Richard was lying in the hospital and his \nmother Christine had rushed to be by his side. That hospital turned out \nto be the scene of Richard's death.\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\n  On Monday, October 18, while we were still holding up the food safety \nbill, Richard Chatfield died from foodborne illness. The complications \nfrom an E. coli infection he got 8 years ago proved to be too much for \nhim.\n  When I hear Senator Coburn on the Senate floor saying there are not \nenough people dying for us to go to work here, he is just plain wrong. \nRichard Chatfield of his State is dramatic evidence of that fact.\n  As we stand here today, one Senator is blocking a bill to protect \nmillions of Americans. Moms and dads across America making dinner \ntonight, if they happen to have missed the channel they were looking \nfor and ended up on C-SPAN and are following this debate, we are \ntalking about an issue that goes right into their refrigerator and \nstove and kitchen as to whether the food they are putting on the table \nis safe for their kids. One Senator from Oklahoma says it is not a big \nenough problem. It is. It is a problem that is a life-and-death issue.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his leadership on this issue and \nSenator Reid for bringing this up. If we save one life, it is worth the \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin. He has been the leader on this issue for \nseveral years. We have been working on this bill for a number of years. \nIt is Senator Durbin who has led the charge on this going back \nliterally several years. We have come so close. We have made all the \ncompromises. We have consumer groups, the Chamber of Commerce, U.S. \nPIRG. We never get those people to agree on anything, and they all \nagree on this bill.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for all his great leadership. Hope springs \neternal, and I still hope we will get the votes to pass this and keep \nthe politics out of it.\n  I wish to correct something I said earlier. Earlier today I had met \nwith Senator Coburn, and we had a number of things he wanted that I \nsaid I would try to put in the amendment on which we will be voting. In \ngood faith, I said I would do that. But then, of course, we had to send \nit out to various offices to get Senators to sign off on it. We \ncouldn't get Republican Senators to sign off on it. So I wish to \ncorrect the record.\n  The changes I had mentioned earlier that I was willing to put in the \nbill for Senator Coburn were not objected to by anybody on our side. It \nwas objected to by Republicans and not Democrats. It is not in the \nbill. These were changes I was willing to make to accommodate the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, is the 30 hours postcloture gone?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Menendez), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller), the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter), and the Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Webb) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for setting \nup this period of time. This will be my last speech, probably, to the \nbody. It is a speech I wish to give in talking about leaving the Senate \nof the United States.\n  I was just elected to be Governor of Kansas, and I am very excited \nabout that post. I have served here a period of 14 years, which has \nbeen a wonderful chance to be able to serve the people of Kansas--the \npeople of the United States. I love this body and I love this country.\n  A lot of folks, when they leave, talk about partisanship and the \nbickering. I like to think about the beauty of the country and the \nability to come together because it does happen. The predecessor of the \nperson sitting in the Presiding Officer's seat and I worked on one of \nthe flagship pieces of legislation on human rights protection. It was \non human trafficking, the initial bill. That was with Senator Paul \nWellstone, who was from Minnesota. He was a delightful individual. It \nwas a great chance for us to work together on something, and we \ncouldn't have been further apart. I think he was ranked the second most \nliberal Member of the Senate. He aspired to be No. 1, but he was \nsecond. But he was a delightful man and he dealt from the heart and we \ngot things done.\n  I say that because I think that is how we work in this place; that we \nfight on about 20 percent of the issues--and they are important, big \nissues--and then we cooperate and work together on a whole host of \nbroad bipartisan issues, such as dealing with things like human \ntrafficking. You do that primarily with people who deal from the \nheart--people such as Paul Wellstone, Ted Kennedy, and Jesse Helms. \nThere are a lot of others, and many people get many things done in this \nbody, but I think it is best when people deal from the heart. When they \ndo that, then there is a chance for us to come together around key and \nheartfelt things. This has been a great body to serve in and I have \ndelighted in being able to do that.\n\n  There is much to be done, much to be done for the country. We have to \ndeal with the creation of jobs in America. We have to deal with our \ndebt and our deficit. We have many issues to deal with. My hope for \nhere, and my hope for our country, is that we go back to the virtues of \nthe ``greatest generation'' and look to them for ways to move forward. \nIt is looking back at the old path of what worked in tough times and \nmoving it forward on the new path.\n  I came into this seat after Bob Dole served in this body. He served \nin this seat. Senator Dole from Kansas is the iconic figure of the \nWorld War II generation, of that ``greatest generation.'' He just got \nout of Walter Reed Hospital. He has been very sick and ill this year. \nHe is coming back, recuperating. I think he is 87 years old this year.\n  Most everybody in America would agree about the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' They would say that World War II generation hit the mark \nof what it is to be an American, what it is to sacrifice, what it is to \nfight for a good cause. They did it with a set of virtues that are \ntimeless, that are known, and I think we have to emulate this time for \nus to deal with the problems we have now. They were courageous; they \nwere selfless; they were courteous; they were people who would fight \nfor a cause. They were the ones who exhibited charity, thrift. That was \ncertainly known in that generation. I think these are things we have to \nbring back--hard work, compassion.\n  It seems to me, when I think of that generation--and nobody is \nperfect and that generation is not perfect--those are ideals I saw in \npractice, whether it was them on the battlefield in World War II or if \nit was them raising their families at home or if it was their educating \nof their families, if it was saving for future generations; that is \nwhat they did.\n  I don't know, if you ask people of that generation, did you do this \non purpose, they might say we did or didn't. Most of them would say \nthis was the right thing to do and it is the thing we needed to do. I \nthink it is what we need to do now. I think we need to emulate those \nvirtues of the ``greatest generation'' and apply them to our problems.\n  Their problems were more foreign than ours. Ours I believe are more \ndomestic, dealing with our own debt and deficit as a country and as a \nsociety and as individuals and individual households; us creating and \nsaving for that next generation in the country and investing to do \nthat, and being selfless and sacrificial in doing that. Building family \nstructure and doing that which is for the good of our families is what \nwe need to do, and that virtue and that old, ancient path they \nfollowed, that they said we did because it was a thing we needed to do, \nI think we have to do the same thing. I hope we will as a country.\n  There has been a debate that started in America that I do not agree \nwith, and it is whether this is a special country and whether America \nis an exceptional land. I for one fully embrace the notion that this is \na special place. I believe in American exceptionalism and I have been \nin many places over the world where you see this in action. I have been \nin many places in America where you see this in action, where somebody \nselflessly takes care of other individuals.\n  Last night I was at the Korean Embassy and we were talking about what \nis taking place in North Korea, and one of the people working there at \nthe South Korean Embassy was amazed that people in the United States \nwould care what happens to people in North Korea. I said one of the \npeople with me was saying that is how we look at the world. If somebody \nelse is in bondage, if somebody else is in difficulty, we feel that and \nwe want to help to deal with it. That, to me, is part of what American \nexceptionalism is all about.\n  This is a special place and has a special calling. If it is not us \ndoing it, in many cases around the world it does not get done. I have \nbeen in the Sudan and they are not calling on the Chinese to lead Sudan \ninto a freer time period. I have been in other places--in Africa, on \nthe North Korean border. If you are looking for somebody to solve the \nproblem, it is the Americans who go in and do it.\n  Our task now is to not only do that around the world, but it is to do \nit domestically. I think we have to look more and more at ourselves and \nsay we are a special place and I think we have to look at ourselves as \nthe baby boomer generation that I am a part of and say you have to \nprove and earn your exceptionalism. I think we have to step up to the \nmark as the ``greatest generation'' did and be willing to serve in a \ntough way, in a sacrificial way, in the best interests of the future of \nour country. We have to do it and now is the time to do it.\n  I am appreciative that the President had a deficit task force he \nappointed and that they came up with some ideas, with some of which I \nagree, with some of which I disagree. But I am glad they started the \ndiscussion and the debate. If the figures I have seen are accurate, \nhalf the American households receive an entitlement check from the \nFederal Government--half of the American households. We have a deficit \nand debt that is structural. It is not based upon one-time war funding, \nalthough war funding has contributed to it, but it is structural in \nthat we have more going out than we have coming in. It is time this is \ndealt with. I think that is part of the message from this last election \ncycle. The American people are ready to have an intelligent discussion, \na difficult discussion of what we are going to do to be able to save \nourselves fiscally. Now is the time to do it.\n  We actually have the structure set up to do it. With a Republican \nHouse, Democratic Senate, Democratic Presidency. This would be the time \nand the structure to talk about this sort of difficult issue. Our \ngeneration should step up and deal with it. I am not going to be here \nfor that discussion and debate, but it is time we have it and it is \ntime we bring back these timeless virtues to deal with our domestic \nproblems the way we have dealt with international problems in the \n``greatest generation.''\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\n  As I leave this body, one of the rites of passage is to sign your \ndesk, and I just did that. I did it in pencil. I figure that all of us \nwill fade with time and that signature will fade with time as well. But \nthe things you remember are what you touched and that touched you and \nthe souls that are touched. It is people who deal from the heart who \nare the ones who touch your life and the ones who touch your soul. I \nwant to express my deep appreciation to my colleagues who have touched \nmy heart. I hope I have been a positive statement to many of them.\n  The psalm that comes to mind is one that says: ``And his place knew \nhim no more.''\n  The psalmist wrote: ``His place knew him no more.''

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 1118, the \nnomination of Jack Lew to be Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, and that the nomination be confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\n       Jacob J. Lew, of New York, to be Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been working for several days--\nactually longer--trying to work things out on the situation involving \nthe State of Louisiana. The State of Louisiana has struggled. They had \nthe hurricane. The economic situation in Louisiana was going very well \nwhen the BP oilspill occurred. As a result, action taken by the \nadministration, and other situations that developed, have hurt \nsignificantly the economic viability of the State of Louisiana.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has worked tirelessly to get the work \ngoing again in the shallow water off the coast of Louisiana. She will \nbe able to speak on the record better than I can--and I have been in \nsome of the negotiations--the progress she has made regarding that. Not \nonly has the administration stepped forward but industries have stepped \nforward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Louisiana be recognized \nto make a statement on the matter regarding Jack Lew.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. His day has \nbeen much busier than mine, but both of our days have been filled with \nquite a few matters before us.\n  The vote that will take place in the Senate would not have taken \nplace without my acquiescence. I thought it was important to speak \nbriefly on my hold on Jack Lew.\n  Jack Lew is a terrific nominee, and he has the support of many people \nin this body for his new position, and we are grateful to him for \nwanting to be the budget director for a country that has serious \neconomic challenges. We are very grateful.\n  As you know, we have extremely serious economic challenges right now \nin the Gulf of Mexico. It has been 5 years since Katrina. Three weeks \nlater, we had Rita, and then Gustav and Ike--four of the toughest \nstorms the gulf coast has faced. Then a few years later, we had an \noilspill, with more than 5 million barrels of oil spilled in the gulf, \nwhich was bad enough. But then this administration placed a hold--or a \nmoratorium, if you will--on an entire industry because of that \naccident. It was a horrible accident, but I think to place a moratorium \non an entire industry because one company and its contractors made some \nserious and terrible mistakes is really unprecedented, it is unwise, \nand it is extremely harmful to the gulf coast.\n  I tried many things over the last several months to call attention to \nthis matter. I called several hearings in Louisiana, several hearings \nhere in Washington, and I sent several letters, set up several \nmeetings, and nothing seemed to be getting through to this \nadministration about the catastrophe they were causing along the gulf \ncoast. So I put this hold on a nominee. It was, in many ways, \nunprecedented. I didn't know that when I did it. I was told later that \nit had never been done on a budget director. I figured it would get \ntheir attention, and I think it has.\n  I have had three meetings in the last 24 hours with the Secretary \nhimself. We have talked through some of these issues in a way that I \nthink we can make progress. In the last week, there have been two \npermits issued. I am told there will be additional permits issued in \nthe next few days. The Secretary has also committed to me that he \nhimself will be in the gulf coast--in Louisiana, actually--on Monday, \nexpressing his commitment, and in no uncertain terms, to the future \nrobustness of this industry.\n  Mr. President, this isn't just about Louisiana and the importance to \nLouisiana. I will submit this report for the Record, ``The Economic \nImpact of the Gulf of Mexico Offshore Oil and Natural Gas Industry and \nthe Role of the Independents,'' released in July of 2010. I will read \nonly one figure, but it is big enough that it should capture people's \nattention. People are looking for money in this Chamber to solve our \nbudget issues and bring this budget into balance. One figure I will \ncite from this report is that the independents--not big oil--I am not \ntalking about Chevron, Shell, or BP; I am talking about independent oil \nand gas operators that are sidelined because of this policy by the \nadministration--independents will bring in more than $147 billion in \nFederal, State, and local revenue in the next 10 years. So the stakes \nare very high, which is why I took the action I did and why today I \nhave released the hold, because notable progress has been made, permits \nhave been issued, and the Secretary has committed, on Monday, to be in \nthe State to give a path forward for this industry.\n  I am convinced that, at this moment, that was the right thing to do \nfor the country and the gulf coast. But we have more progress that \nneeds to be made. This industry is a valuable, critical, important \nindustry to this Nation. It has been for over 100 years, and it will be \nfor the next 100 years. We have to realize the importance of producing \noil and gas here at home. Yes, it was a terrible accident. Yes, we need \nto have safety and rules and regulations that are in force. But there \nhas to be a way to accomplish that without shutting down the entire \nindustry and putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk. Again, this \nisn't about big oil specifically; it is about contractors and small \nbusinesses all along the gulf coast and throughout the United States.\n  I appreciate the Secretary's commitment, his renewed focus, and his \nunderstanding of the urgency of the situation. I thank my colleagues, \nmany of whom were supportive of this action, as we have worked through \nthese last 6 weeks. I appreciate the courtesy of the majority leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record ``How Big an \nImpact?'' from the study ``The Economic Impact of the Gulf of Mexico \nOffshore Oil and Natural Gas Industry and the Role of the \nIndependents'' done by IHS Global Insight (USA), Inc., dated July 21, \n2010.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\n                           How Big an Impact?\n\n       In this study, we analyze the economic contribution of the \n     independents and potential loss as a result of policies that \n     effectively prevent them from participating in future \n     development in the offshore Gulf of Mexico and, in \n     particular, in the deepwater. Our analysis for the 2009-20 \n     forecast period indicates that the exclusion of the \n     independents from the offshore GOM would mean:\n       The following lost jobs in the four-state Gulf region \n     (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas)--direct, \n     indirect, and induced: 2009--202,502; 2015--289,716; 2020--\n     300,974.\n       Additionally, 40,777 construction-related jobs would be \n     lost in the four-state Gulf region during 2009-20. This \n     activity includes construction of rigs, platforms, pipelines, \n     and production facilities.\n       The following lost taxes and royalties to the federal \n     government: 2009--$7.34 billion; 2015--$10.13 billion; 2020--\n     9.98 billion.\n       The following lost state and local tax revenues in the \n     four-state Gulf region: 2009--$3.18 billion; 2015--$4.59 \n     billion; 2020--$4.68 billion.\n       Altogether, more than $147 billion in federal, state, and \n     local revenues would be lost in a 10-year period if \n     independents are excluded from the Gulf of Mexico. These \n     estimates only include revenues collected from the four-state \n     Gulf region.\n       Within the deepwater, the exclusion of the independents \n     would mean:\n       The following lost jobs in the four-state Gulf region--\n     direct, indirect, and induced: 2009--121,298; 2015--230,241; \n     2020 -- 265,113.\n       The following lost taxes and royalties to the federal \n     government: 2009--$3.64 billion; 2015--$726 billion; 2020--\n     $8.33 billion.\n       The following lost state and local tax revenues in the \n     four-state Gulf region: 2009--$1.63 billion; 2015--$3.35 \n     billion; 2020--$3.94 billion.\n       Altogether, more than $106 billion in federal, state, and \n     local revenues would be lost in a 10-year period if \n     independents are excluded from the deepwater.\n       Overall, the exclusion of the independents would \n     significantly shrink offshore oil and gas activity, reduce \n     the dynamism of the industry, and dilute U.S. technological \n     and industry leadership.\n       The reason for all these effects is that independents \n     represent a much larger share of total activity than is \n     generally recognized. Independent producers are an integral \n     part of shelf, as well as deepwater, drilling and discovery.\n       Independents are the largest shareholder in 66% of the \n     7,521 leases in the entire Gulf of Mexico and in 81% of the \n     producing leases.\n       In the deepwater portion of the Gulf of Mexico, \n     independents are the largest shareholder in 52% of all leases \n     and in 46% of the producing leases. They operate over half of \n     the developing and producing deepwater fields.\n       Independents have drilled 1,298 wells in the deepwater, and \n     they currently account for over 900,000 barrels a day of oil \n     equivalent (oil and natural gas together).\n       Independents are responsible for an average of 70% of the \n     ``farm-ins'': the partnerships formed following the original \n     lease agreement that enable prospects to be drilled and oil \n     and gas produced.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that any \nstatements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record as if \nread; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action \nand the Senate resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Cruttenden\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of SGT Aaron B. Cruttenden. \nSergeant Cruttenden, assigned to the 27th Engineer Battalion, based in \nFort Bragg, NC, died on November 7, 2010, of injuries sustained when \nhis dismounted patrol encountered small arms fire. Sergeant Cruttenden \nwas serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Kunar Province, \nAfghanistan. He was 25 years old.\n  A native of Mesa, AZ, Sergeant Cruttenden earned his graduate \nequivalency diploma and worked for 2 years as an apprentice \nelectrician. He then enlisted in the Army in March 2008. Sergeant \nCruttenden hoped to defend his country, make a better life for his \nfamily, and pursue opportunities for higher education. He served a tour \nof duty in Afghanistan with decoration.\n  During his 2\\1/2\\ years of service, Sergeant Cruttenden distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to \ntake on one of the most dangerous and skillful jobs in the Army--\ndetecting and eliminating improvised explosive devices. Throughout \nSergeant Cruttenden's time in the Army, family members recall that his \nforemost concern was protecting the men and women under his command.\n  Sergeant Cruttenden worked on the front lines of battle, serving in \nthe most dangerous areas of Afghanistan. He is remembered by those who \nknew him as a consummate professional with an unending commitment to \nexcellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated son and loving \nfather to his young daughter. Both in service and civilian life, \nSergeant Cruttenden's warmth and caring for others were always on \ndisplay.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Sergeant \nCruttenden's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a \nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Sergeant Cruttenden will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Sergeant Cruttenden's entire family--I cannot imagine the sorrow \nyou must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss will \nbe eased by your pride in Aaron's service and by your knowledge that \nhis country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and \nhis sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8050-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8050-S8051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak in relation to the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010 \nand to congratulate my colleagues on its unanimous passage. This \nlegislation is vital not only to sanction Iran for bad behavior but to \nsignal to the Government of Iran our determination to keep them from \ndeveloping or acquiring nuclear weapons and from supporting terrorism \nthroughout the Middle East region and around the world.\n  It did not have to be this way. Iran has been given every opportunity \nto change its ways and has chosen not to do so. Iran represents one of \nthe biggest threats to our security, and these sanctions should help \nrestrict Iran's ability to operate.\n  Specifically, this legislation will expand sanctions on foreign \ncompanies that do business in Iran. It will ban U.S. banks from \nconducting financial transactions with foreign banks that are connected \nto the Iranian nuclear program or Iran's terrorist enterprises.\n  It imposes a variety of new financial sanctions on Iran, limiting the \nmullahs' access to the international banking system. And, among other \nprovisions, provides a framework for U.S., state, and local governments \nto divest their portfolios of foreign companies that work in the \nIranian energy sector.\n  In the past, the United States has not fully utilized its sanctions \nauthority when it comes to Iran. Obviously, enforcement is crucial. \nSanctions are only effective when they are actually applied. I urge the \nadministration, in the strongest terms possible, to make full use of \nthe sanctions Congress has authorized in this bill.\n  It is no secret that Iran is openly hostile to the United States and \nour important allies, and failing to act would be foolish and \nirresponsible. The Government of Iran has rejected every opportunity to \ndevelop good relations with the rest of the world and sanctions are a \nlogical and necessary response.\n  We must send a strong, unified message to Tehran and to those who aid \ntheir tyrannical ambitions. Terrorism, oppression, and subjugation \nought not have any place in society. This legislation imposes financial \nsanctions and travel restrictions on human rights abusers in Iran. \nPassage of this legislation helps demonstrate that we reject the \nrepression of the rulers in Tehran and support the efforts of the \nIranian people to change their government.\n  And, I hope that the people of Iran will understand that is our goal \nhere. We support the people of Iran. We support their right to chose \ntheir own leaders and chart their own future. We stand with them \nagainst the tyranny of the mullahs.\n  Iranians have a long and proud history, and are some of the most \npassionate and courageous people I have met. They are just as opposed \nto the actions of the Iranian regime as we are.\n  In fact, a little over a year ago, the people of Iran went to the \npolls to vote for a leader and saw their hopes for a democratically \nelected leader brutally crushed by a regime unwilling to cede its \npower. People around the world stood breathlessly, hoping the brave men \nand women of the Green Revolution would see their efforts rewarded.\n  Instead of listening to the people of Iran, Ahmadinejad and his \ncronies killed, imprisoned, and tortured those who were brave enough to \nspeak out in opposition to tyranny.\n  Unfortunately, this violent course of action is not a recently \ndeveloped tactic. To this day, there are members of the Green \nRevolution sitting in prison. Christians are killed for worshiping the \nGod of their choosing, the free press has been silenced, women are \nbrutally oppressed. The human rights abuses of Iran are extensive.\n  These sanctions are necessary because of the terrible nature of the \nregime. The rulers in Tehran have demonstrated that they cannot be \ntrusted. They have subverted the interests of the Iranian people. They \nhave manipulated the political process.\n  We in the United States of America have a duty to stand with the \nthousands of men and women in Iran who long for the basic rights that \nwe in America take for granted. Freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, \nfreedom of religion, freedom of the press. These are the things the \nIranian people long for, and these are the things I am confident they \nwill one day enjoy.\n  Obviously, freedom for the Iranian people will require much more than \nlegislation from the U.S. Congress, but we ought to do what we can, and \nthis bill sends a strong signal at a key time for our efforts to halt \nIran's nuclear program and for the people of Iran who seek a more \nrepresentative government. I hope we take additional steps to support \nthe Iranian people's free and unfettered access to the internet, boost \ntheir ability to receive unbiased news and information and provide the \nsupport and assistance they need to sustain the reform movement in the \nface of a hostile and repressive government.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have introduced the Iran Democratic Transition \nAct, which supports the transition to a freely elected democratic \ngovernment in Iran by assisting eligible Iranian democratic opposition \norganizations with communications and distribution of information. It \nis an important bill to aid the courageous people of Iran, and it is my \nhope that in the coming weeks the Senate will be able to bring this \nbill to the floor for a vote.\n  Today is a great step forward. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on other ways that we can strengthen\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\nopposition to the regime, halt the development of nuclear weapons, and \nsupport the Iranian people's drive for freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8051-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss \nthe need for Congress to resolve an issue of importance to millions of \nAmericans: specifically, the need for a bipartisan agreement on taxes.\n  As the end of the year approaches, Americans face an extraordinary \nlevel of uncertainty regarding a number of tax issues: the 2001/2003 \ntax cuts, including the tax rates on dividends and capital gains, the \nalternative minimum tax, the estate tax, and last but not least, the \nextension of many expiring tax provisions affecting individuals, \nbusinesses, nonprofit organizations and even members of the U.S. Armed \nForces. During this lameduck session, Congress and the White House have \nan opportunity to work together to develop a package that addresses all \nof these.\n  In my view, we should not be raising taxes on any business or \nindividual during a fragile economic recovery. The private sector--this \ncountry's job creation engine--continues to struggle, lacking the \nrequired stability and confidence needed to expand and hire new \nworkers. Individuals, in turn, have been significantly impacted, \nfurther inhibiting economic growth. Uncertainty is a major factor, and \none way to reduce uncertainty is to lock down our tax policy for the \nnext few years, giving taxpayers a clear sense of what to expect as we \nenter 2011.\n  On the tax extenders, I bring to the Senate's attention a letter just \nsent to Congress today from over 1,200 organizations located around the \ncountry. These are businesses, nonprofit organizations, and \norganizations representing our men and women in uniform. It points out \nthe crucial nature of the expiring provisions, and asks Congress to \nextend them before the end of the year. This is a remarkable letter. We \noften hear from the business community about the importance of tax \nextenders for job creation, but here we have not only the business \ncommunity speaking up, but also affordable housing organizations, \ncommunity development organizations, and the National Education \nAssociation and the National Science Teachers Association. The letter \nis signed by the Alliance to Save Energy and numerous renewable energy \norganizations. It includes the Association of the United States Navy \nand the Reserve Officer Association. It includes agricultural \norganizations and technology councils.\n  In short, this is a statement from a breadth of organizations which \ndo not often work together. I think we have to take this kind of letter \nvery seriously and consider its message carefully. And its message is \nthat these provisions are very important to millions of Americans, and \nthat our failure to extend them could have a significant dampening \neffect on the economy. And I also want to be clear about something: \nthis should be a ``clean'' extension of these policies--we shouldn't be \nraising taxes on other businesses at the same time and thereby blunting \nthe impact of this important action for the economy.\n  One of the best known of the extenders is the R tax credit. It \nactually expired at the end of 2009, so America's innovative \ncompanies--many of them with operations in Massachusetts--have been \nwondering all year if Congress is going to reinstate the most visible \npublic policy that encourages new ideas and technologies in this \ncountry. This is an area where our commitment should not be in doubt.\n  There are incentives for the production of domestic alternative \nenergy sources and energy efficient products such as hybrid vehicles, \nenergy efficient appliances, homes, and windows. Without these \nincentives, many producers will not be able to make these products. In \nfact, many have already discontinued operations in the absence of \ncredits which expired at the end of 2009. The deductions for donations \nof funds, property, food, and equipment to charities is also hanging in \nthe balance of this package.\n  There is the deduction for State and local sales taxes. Think about \nindividuals losing the ability to deduct State and local taxes from \ntheir Federal taxes. There is the deduction for teacher classroom \nexpenses. Teachers spending their own money for their classrooms is \nmore common than we like to think about, and the least we can do is \nallow them to deduct those expenses from their tax bill. There is the \ncredit for employers who continue to pay employees while on active duty \nin the U.S. Armed Forces. This is an important support mechanism for \nour men and women in uniform, and we should ensure that it remains in \nplace. These are just a few of the tax provisions which have expired or \nwill soon expire. I invite my colleagues to review the Joint Tax \nCommittee's list of the expiring provisions. It is crucial for Congress \nto act this year to extend as many of them as possible.\n  Ultimately, I believe we need to reform our Tax Code to lower tax \nrates and broaden the base. I know Senators Baucus and Grassley have \nalready begun that process with a Finance Committee hearing on tax \nreform earlier this year, and I salute them for starting that \nconversation. We look forward to working on such a package of reforms \non a bipartisan basis in the 112th Congress, but for now, extending the \nexpiring provisions should be a top priority for the remainder of this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe November 16 letter from over 1,200 organizations from around the \ncountry to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 16, 2010.\n       To the Members of the U.S. Congress: The undersigned \n     represent millions of individuals, businesses, organizations \n     and members of the U.S. Armed Forces. We urge Congress to \n     pass legislation in the lame duck session to extend critical \n     tax provisions that, while temporary in nature, are critical \n     to our economy. It is of the utmost importance to all of us, \n     and to the health of the U.S. economy, that this extension be \n     enacted before the end of the year and apply seamlessly, at \n     least through 2011.\n       Expiration of many of these provisions has already caused \n     job losses, and the uncertainty around their extension will \n     lead to further dislocations just as the fragile economic \n     recovery is beginning. We all look forward to working with \n     you on this issue in the coming weeks.\n           Sincerely,\n       (Signed by over 1,200 organizations)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8051-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8051-S8052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, each November we set aside a day of \nhealing for those who have lost someone to suicide. I rise today to \nagain recognize Saturday, November 20 as National Survivors of Suicide \nDay. In 1999, a Senate resolution created this annual event through the \nefforts of Senator Harry Reid who lost his father to suicide. This \nyear, on November 20, over 270 conferences will take place in the U.S. \nand around the world to allow survivors of suicide the opportunity to \nconnect with others who have experienced the tragedy of suicide loss \nand to allow for healing interactions.\n  The importance of this day is amplified by the shocking statistics on \nsuicide--suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the United \nStates. Nationwide, approximately 90 lives are lost to suicide each day \nand over 34,000 die by suicide each year. Suicide is truly an epidemic \nthat devastates thousands of families in the United States each year.\n  In my State of South Dakota, one suicide occurs every 3 to 4 days and \n107 lives are lost each year. These statistics place South Dakota among \na group of Western States that consistently has a higher rate of \nsuicide than the rest of the country. Suicide is the fourth leading \ncause of death among all South Dakotans and is the second leading cause \nof death of South Dakotans between the ages of 15-34. Suicide among \nAmerican Indians in South Dakota is of particular concern--the suicide \nrate for American Indians ages 15-34 is more than three times higher \nthan the national average and the suicide rate for\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\nthe Rosebud Sioux Tribe is the highest in the world.\n  Last year, 16-year-old Dana Lee Jetty, a tribal member from the \nSpirit Lake Dakotah Nation in North Dakota, who lost her 14-year-old \nsister to suicide spoke before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs:\n\n       We need to make sure that our communities and our people \n     know how to reach out for help if they need it and we need to \n     make sure that the help is there when they ask.\n\n  We must take Ms. Jetty's words to heart and provide tribes with the \nresources they need to implement effective suicide prevention programs. \nIt is critical to strengthen the social fabric to help improve mental \nhealth with effective and culturally sensitive prevention programs.\n  It is necessary to expand access to mental health services \nnationwide, including a focus on education, prevention and \nintervention. Furthermore, we need to acknowledge the obstacles that \nsuicide survivors face during their grieving and encourage the \ninvolvement of survivors in healing activities and prevention programs. \nI believe with appropriate support and treatment, suicide survivors can \nlead effective advocacy efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide and \nfind healing themselves.\n  The loss of so many lives to suicide is truly a crisis, and it is \nimperative to provide support for all those left behind. It is my hope \nthat National Suicide Survivors Day will promote the broad based \nsupport that each survivor deserves and increase awareness of the need \nfor greater efforts in addressing the root causes of suicide in Indian \nCountry and throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8052-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8052-S8053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEW START TREATY\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition \nto the administration's New START Treaty. I do so after great \ndeliberation and after initial disposition to support the treaty \nbecause of the generic importance of these types of treaties for our \nNation. But with what I have learned from classified intelligence \ninformation, I cannot in good conscience support this treaty. I have \nwritten a classified letter summarizing my views that is available to \nall members in Senate security; I urge them to read it, even as I try \nnow with a few unclassified comments to explain my position.\n  When the administration announced this new treaty, we were told that \nits goal was to reduce strategic nuclear forces in a manner that would \nmake America safer and enhance nuclear stability. That goal may be \nadmirable, but unfortunately, the deal the administration has struck \nwith Moscow falls well short. Consequently, I believe the \nadministration's New START Treaty has been oversold and overhyped.\n  The first thing we must all understand about this treaty is that it \nforces the United States to reduce unilaterally our forces, such as \nmissiles, bombers, and warheads, in order to meet treaty limits. On the \nother hand, the Russians will actually be allowed to increase their \ndeployed forces because they currently fall below the treaty's limits. \nThis raises a crucial question: exactly what does the United States \ngain from this treaty in exchange for a one-sided reduction in our \ndeployed forces?\n  Defenders of this treaty have argued, first, that the treaty places \nno limits on America's plans for missile defense systems, and second, \nthat our own military will have the flexibility to deploy our strategic \nforces, such as bombers, submarines, and missiles, in ways that best \nmeet our security interests.\n  Unfortunately, these explanations simply do not stand up to scrutiny. \nThe United States does not need a treaty with Russia, or any other \ncountry, to be free to pursue the missile defense system we need to \nkeep America safe. The United States does not need a treaty to give us \nthe flexibility to deploy our strategic forces as we wish.\n  Interestingly, the administration's justifications completely dismiss \nthe unilateral statement Russia has made to this treaty that claims the \nright to withdraw if we expand our missile defenses. This Russian \nstatement is pure and simple manipulation.\n  At some point down the road, our Nation will need to expand its \nmissile defenses. Because of this unilateral statement, however, the \nreaction from some in the administration or in Congress will be to \nreject any expansion lest we upset the Russians and cause them to pull \nout of this new Treaty. The Russians surely are counting on this \nreaction. Yet in all the rhetoric in support of this treaty, I have not \nheard any reasonable explanation for why we would give Russia this \nlever to use against our legitimate and necessary right to defend \nourselves against ballistic missile attack.\n  For several months, we have listened to the administration's claims \nthat New START will make America more secure by strengthening nuclear \nstability. In the ``Show Me'' State, where I come from, and I suspect \nthroughout the rest of the country, claims like this need to be backed \nup by facts. But if we cannot verify that the Russians are complying \nwith each of the treaty's three central limits, then we have no way of \nknowing whether we are more secure or not.\n  The Select Committee on Intelligence has been looking at this issue \nclosely over the past several months. As the vice chairman of this \ncommittee, I have reviewed the key intelligence on our ability to \nmonitor this treaty and heard from our intelligence professionals. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that the United States cannot reliably \nverify the treaty's 1,550 limit on deployed warheads.\n  As an initial hurdle, the ten annual warhead inspections allowed \nunder the treaty permit us to sample only 2 to 3 percent of the total \nRussian force. Further, under New START, unlike its predecessor, any \ngiven missile can have any number of warheads loaded on it. So even if \nthe Russians fully cooperated in every inspection, these inspections \ncannot provide conclusive evidence of whether the Russians are \ncomplying with the warhead limit.\n  Let's take an example: say that the United States found a missile \nthat was loaded with more warheads than the Russians declared. While \nthis would be a faulty and suspicious declaration by Russia, we could \nnot necessarily infer from it that they had violated the 1,550 warhead \nlimit--especially because the Russians could always make some excuse \nfor a faulty declaration.\n  Compounding this verification gap is the current structure of the \ntreaty's warhead limits which would allow Russia to prepare legally to \nadd very large numbers of warheads to its forces in excess of the \ntreaty's limit. For example, the Russians could deploy a missile with \nonly one warhead, but legally flight-test it with six warheads to gain \nconfidence in the increased capability--a practice they could not \nemploy under the original START. The Russians could then store the five \nextra warheads for each such missile nearby, ready to mate them to the \nmissile on a moment's notice. All of this would be legal.\n  Further, unlike START, this new treaty places no limit on the number \nof nondeployed missiles, so the Russians legally could store spare \nmissiles to be mated with the spare warheads. This potential for Russia \nto ``break-out'' of the treaty in a short period of time--perhaps \nwithout adequate warning to the United States--may undermine the very \nnuclear stability this administration claims this treaty provides.\n  Arguably, it also means that, despite the opportunities to cheat, it \nmay be even easier for Russia to circumvent legally the limits of this \ntreaty. That does not sound to me like a great bargain for the United \nStates.\n  Because the details on verification and breakout of this treaty are \nclassified, I have prepared a full classified assessment that is \navailable to any Senator for review. The key points, however, are not \nclassified and I believe the Senate and the American public need to \nunderstand them fully.\n  Common sense suggests that the worse a treaty partner's arms control \ncompliance record with existing and past treaties, the stronger \nverification must be for any new treaties. So, exactly what is Russia's \nrecord? According to the official State Department reports on arms \ncontrol compliance, published by this administration and the previous \nadministration, the Russians have previously violated, or are still \nviolating, important provisions of most of the key arms control \ntreaties to which they have been a party, including the original START, \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, the Biological Weapons Convention, the \nConventional Forces in Europe Treaty, and\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nOpen Skies. I recommend that my colleagues review the classified \nversions of these reports before any further Senate action is taken on \nthis treaty.\n  Despite Russia's poor compliance record, the administration has \ndecided that we will rely primarily on good Russian cooperation to \nverify New START's key 1,550 limit on deployed warheads. This brings to \nmind the famous adage: fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame \non me.\n  One of the persistent Russian arms control violations of the original \nSTART was its illegal obstruction of U.S. on-site inspections of \nwarheads on certain types of missiles. The only reason these Russian \nviolations did not prevent us from verifying START's warhead limits was \nbecause START limited the capability to deploy warheads through a \n``counting rule'' that could be verified primarily with our own \nintelligence satellites. Unfortunately, New START has discarded this \ncritical counting rule, designed to work hand-in-glove with our \nsatellites, in favor of reliance on no more than ten sample inspections \na year--again, just 2 to 3 percent of Russia's force.\n  The warhead limit in New START is calculated from the actual number \nof warheads loaded on a missile, and unlike START, this new treaty \npermits any missile to have any number of warheads loaded on it. But no \nsatellite can tell us how many warheads are loaded on missiles. \nTherefore, if this treaty is ratified, we will have to rely primarily \non on-site inspections to verify actual warhead loadings the very same \nkind of inspections that the Russians violated in START. If the \nRussians continue their poor compliance record and obstruct our warhead \ninspections under New START, the consequences will be much more serious \nand will substantially degrade verification.\n  The administration is surely aware of these verification and breakout \nproblems as there is no shortage of verification gimmicks in this \ntreaty. But not even all of them together permit us to verify reliably \nthe treaty's warhead limit. So how have treaty enthusiasts responded to \nthese problems?\n  First, they discard the military significance of possible Russian \ncheating. Our own State Department's verification assessment states \nthat:\n\n     any Russian cheating under the Treaty would have little if \n     any effect on the assured second-strike capabilities of U.S. \n     strategic forces. In particular, the survivability and \n     response capabilities of [U.S.] strategic submarines and \n     heavy bombers would be unaffected by even large-scale \n     cheating.\n\n  This is not exactly a ringing endorsement. I think it is pretty clear \nthat a large-scale breakout would have a seismic impact from a \ngeopolitical perspective. It would escalate tensions between the \nsuperpowers and lead to extreme strategic instability. Even more \nfundamentally, the State Department statement raises a pivotal \nquestion: If no level of Russian cheating under New START is deemed \nmilitarily significant, then what is the value of this treaty in the \nfirst place?\n  Second, treaty proponents attempt to draw a parallel to the \n``Moscow'' arms control treaty, signed by President Bush and approved \n95-0 by the Senate. They argue that this treaty has the same kind of \nwarhead verification difficulties as New START, therefore critics of \nNew START are applying a double-standard. This argument fails on two \ncounts: the first being that the Moscow arms control treaty was placed \non top of the verification measures already in effect for START; and \nsecond, that the United States had decided unilaterally to move to the \nlimits imposed in the Moscow treaty, whether or not Russia reduced to \nthem. This is simply not the case for New START. Clearly, the two \ntreaties are not comparable from a verification standpoint.\n  The administration also argues that our ability to monitor Russian \nforces will be greater with the new treaty than without it. As a \ngeneral proposition, this is true. In actuality, however, the extent of \nthe treaty's monitoring benefits could be insignificant or only modest \nin some important respects. This disparity between generalization and \nreality is explained more in my classified paper.\n  The bottom line is this: if the chief benefit of this treaty is that \nwe will know more about what Russia is doing with its nuclear forces, \nthen the same benefit could have been achieved with a much more modest \nconfidence-building protocol, one which would not require unilateral \nU.S. force reductions, give Russia a vote on our missile defenses, or \npresent impossible verification problems.\n  The administration claims that New START is indispensible to reap the \n``Reset'' benefits with Russia. If a fatally flawed arms control \nagreement is the price of admission to the Reset game, our Nation is \nbetter off if we this one out.\n  Similarly, any suggestion by treaty advocates that rejecting the \ntreaty weakens the ``good'' Russian leader, Medvedev, and strengthens \nthe ``bad'' Russian leader, Putin, should be met with healthy \nskepticism. Now is not the time to fall for a ``good cop--bad cop'' act \nfrom Moscow.\n  In many cases, concerns about particular treaties can be solved \nduring the ratification process. I respect my colleagues who are \nattempting to do so with this treaty. Unfortunately, New START suffers \nfrom fundamental flaws that no amount of tinkering around the edges can \nfix. I believe the better course for our nation, and for global \nstability, is to put this treaty aside and replace it with a better \none.\n  The United States needs, and we in the Senate should demand, a treaty \nthat can be reliably verified by our own intelligence assets without \nrelying on Russia's good graces, not one that requires unilateral \nreductions or gives Russia a vote on our strategic defenses. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject anything less and to take a strong stand for \nAmerica's defense and America's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8053-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RESTORE ONLINE SHOPPERS' CONFIDENCE ACT\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to engage my colleague \nSenator Rockefeller in a colloquy. There have been some questions \nraised about how S. 3386, the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act, \naffects a company that sells its business entirely or enters into a \ndeal with another company to ``step into the first company's shoes'' \nand provide the products or services to consumers that were previously \nprovided by the first company. I would ask the chairman to explain the \nintent of the legislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This legislation is not intended to limit a \ncompany's ability to provide its customers with a seamless transition \nwhen a company sells its assets or arranges to have a new entity \nprovide the products and services it previously provided to its \ncustomers.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator. Questions have also been raised \nabout how this bill would affect an online company that bills its \ncustomers monthly for an ongoing service and decides to enter into a \ndeal with another company to provide the backend billing and other \nservices to those same customers. What is the intent of the \nlegislation?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The bill would not consider the company providing \nbackend billing and other services for the initial merchant to be a \nposttransaction third party seller. Therefore, the provisions of the \nbill governing post-transaction third party sellers would not apply.\n  This legislation is intended to prevent the kind of fraudulent \ntransactions the Commerce Committee exposed in its recent \ninvestigation--where a consumer intentionally purchases products or \nservices from one company and ends up unknowingly purchasing products \nor services from a different, unrelated company. As we have discussed, \nthis bill is not intended to prevent a company from making a business \ndeal that would provide continuity of service to its customers by \nentering into a business arrangement that gives another company the \nright to deliver products and services intentionally purchased by \nconsumers and to bill for those products and services.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, a year ago this month I was privileged to \nagain meet with the Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I. His \nimpassioned call for support for the reopening of the Theological \nSchool of Halki promoted\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nme to introduce S. Res. 356, a bipartisan measure calling upon the \nGovernment of Turkey to facilitate the reopening of the Ecumenical \nPatriarchate's Theological School of Halki without condition or further \ndelay. As we approach the 40th anniversary of the forced closure on \nthat unique institution by the Turkish authorities, I renew my call for \nthe Government of Turkey to allow the seminary to reopen.\n  Founded in 1844, the Theological School of Halki, located outside \nmodern-day Istanbul, served as the principal seminary of the Ecumenical \nPatriarchate until its forcible closure by the Turkish authorities in \n1971. Counted among alumni of this preeminent educational institution \nare numerous prominent Orthodox scholars, theologians, priests, and \nbishops as well as patriarchs, including Bartholomew I. Many of these \nscholars and theologians have served as faculty at other institutions \nserving Orthodox communities around the world.\n  Past indications by the Turkish authorities of pending action to \nreopen the seminary have, regrettably, failed to materialize. Turkey's \nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with the Ecumenical Patriarch \nin August 2009. In an address to a wider gathering of minority \nreligious leaders that day, Erdogan concluded by stating, ``We should \nnot be of those who gather, talk and disperse. A result should come out \nof this.'' I could not agree more with the sentiment. But resolution of \nthis longstanding matter requires resolve, not rhetoric.\n  In a positive development this August, the authorities in Ankara, for \nthe first time since 1922, permitted a liturgical celebration to take \nplace at the historic Sumela Monastery. The Ecumenical Patriarch \npresided at the service, attended by pilgrims and religious leaders \nfrom several countries, including Greece and Russia. Earlier this \nmonth, a Turkish court ordered the Buyukada orphanage to be returned to \nEcumenical Patriarchate. If the transfer of the property occurs, this \nwould be another welcome development, potentially paving the way for \nthe return of scores of other church properties seized by the \ngovernment. In 2005, the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, convened a \nbriefing, ``The Greek Orthodox Church in Turkey: A Victim of Systematic \nExpropriation.'' The Commission has consistently raised the issue of \nthe Theological School for well over a decade and will continue to \nclosely monitor related developments.\n  Yesterday's release of the 2010 Report on International Religious \nFreedom is a reminder of the challenges faced by Orthodox and other \nminority religious communities in Turkey. I urge the Turkish Prime \nMinister to ensure respect for the rights of individuals from these \ngroups to freely profess and practice their religion or beliefs, in \nkeeping with Turkey's obligations as an OSCE participating state.\n  The 1989 OSCE Vienna Concluding Document affirmed the right of \nreligious communities to provide ``training of religious personnel in \nappropriate institutions.'' The Theological School of Halki served that \nfunction for over a century until its forced closure nearly four \ndecades ago. The time has come to allow the reopening of this unique \ninstitution without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8054-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO KEN FLANZ\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

His thoughtful \napproach, patience, and knowledge have been instrumental to the Senate \ncommunity.\n  Ken's achievements through the Stennis Congressional Fellows Program \nwill serve him well and be beneficial to my office and the Senate. The \nStennis Program seeks to enhance senior congressional staff members' \nleadership skills and communications abilities for those committed to \npublic service. Senior fellows advance congressional staff development \nand serve as significant resources for Members of Congress, fellow \nstaff, and the public. The program's emphasis on nonpartisanship and \nthe long-term effectiveness of Congress provides for an essential \ndiscourse.\n  I have great appreciation for Ken's experience and circumspection. He \nhas served as a trusted adviser and has been a great asset to me and my \nstaff.

Mr. President, as dean of the Senate Women, I \nrise on this day to bring attention to the life and work of fellow \nMarylander Anna\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\nElla Carroll, 1815-1893. Our recognition of her achievements is long \noverdue.\n  Anna Ellen Carroll was born in Somerset County, the daughter of \nMaryland Governor Thomas King Carroll. She was one of President Abraham \nLincoln's closest advisers and a senior strategist during the Civil \nWar. And though she is nearly absent from history books, Anna was one \nof the most influential American women of the 19th century.\n  Anna believed in justice and fairness. She was a free thinker and an \nabolitionist. In 1853, she freed the slaves she inherited from her \nfather's estate and persuaded her abolitionist friends to accompany the \nnewly freed men and women to Canada, ensuring they would remain free.\n  Anna's belief in freedom and humanity led her to campaign \npassionately on behalf of the abolitionist movement. In fact, many \nbelieve that Anna's hard work and strong voice helped motivate \nPresident Lincoln to end slavery in America.\n  Anna formally joined the ranks of President Lincoln's top advisers in \n1861, after writing a political pamphlet that impressed the President \nso much that he requested an interview with its author.\n  After the meeting, President Lincoln sent Anna on a reconnaissance \nmission to the secessionist South. When she arrived, Anna immediately \nknew the proposed Union strategy of sending troops down the Mississippi \nwould fail. She recommended an alternative--send troops to divide the \nSouth by using the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. The President \nlistened, and ultimately, Anna's strategy helped the Union win the war.\n  Anna served as a consultant to Lincoln's War Department and, after \nhis assassination in 1865, as an advisor to President Ulysses S. Grant. \nShe also was a recognized political essayist, an avid writer, and an \ninfluential member of the Maryland and Washington political circles \nbefore and after her role in wartime politics.\n  During her life, Anna was recognized by her contemporaries as a top \nadviser to President Lincoln. In the 1864 painting of Lincoln and his \nCabinet by Francis B. Carpenter, a chair sits empty. It is surrounded \nby maps and notes similar to those carried by Anna during her time \nadvising Lincoln, implying her place at the table. Still, despite \nmultiple petitions, she was never formally acknowledged for her \ncontributions.\n  Anna Ella Carroll was a woman who had a profound impact on the \ntrajectory of our country's reunification, helping make decisions at a \ncrossroads that were critical to America's survival. I am proud to \ncount her among the ranks of Maryland's most influential women. It is \ntime we give her a proper place in our history books.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8055-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO RON HAYES\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am honored to bring to the \nattention of the Senate the work of a remarkable American and \nconstituent of mine, Mr. Ron Hayes, of Fairhope, AL.\n  As blessed as we are to be living in America, we would do well to \nremember that our society continues to be enhanced through the noble \nefforts of those who tirelessly and passionately pursue a better \nquality of life for us all. These often unsung heroes seek only the \nreward of knowing they have transformed our laws and our land for the \nbetter.\n  Today I wish to honor one such individual who has spent nearly two \ndecades advocating for strengthened workplace safety regulations and \ntimely communication between the government and accident victims and \ntheir families. His efforts have made a difference.\n  Ron Hayes began his journey to improve workplace safety in 1993 when \nhe lost his beloved 19-year-old son, Patrick, to a grain silo accident \nin Florida. Facing tremendous emotional pain, Ron and his wife Dot \nsought details of their son's death as well as survivor's benefits from \nlocal, State and Federal agencies, only to be met with delays and few \nanswers. After 2 years of navigating the bureaucracy, they resolved to \nlearn everything they could about workplace safety standards and sought \nways to improve both job safety rules and enforcement.\n  Ron Hayes' dedication resulted in the revision of the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration's, OSHA, grain handling standards. But \nthis was only the beginning. Ron and his wife founded the Families In \nGrief Hold Together ``FIGHT'' Project, a nonprofit group devoted to \nassisting families and workers cope with the consequences of workplace \naccidents and deaths.\n  Some 10,000 people lose their lives while working each year. Ron \nHayes worked with OSHA to create a policy which the agency often uses \nin communicating with family members after a workplace accident.\n  Since its founding, the FIGHT Project has reached out to nearly 800 \nfamilies, providing valuable help in the grieving process, negotiating \nthe red tape and ultimately in healing.\n  Ron Hayes could have stopped there, but his dedication to improving \nworker safety has motivated him to speak to almost 50,000 workers and \ntaken him to some of the largest companies in the world. He has \ntestified before Congress on numerous occasions and has served as a \nspecial adviser to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee.\n  In the process, Ron Hayes has received many awards for humanitarian \nefforts.\n  I commend Ron Hayes' selfless dedication to worker safety while \nproviding comfort and valuable counsel to families.\n  In our society it is possible for one person, or in this case a \nhusband and wife, to make a difference that will positively impact the \nlives of millions. Ron Hayes has shown us that a lone voice for good \ncannot only be heard but it can change society for the better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8055-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8055-S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING TILSON TECHONOLOGY MANAGEMENT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is essential that today's small \nbusinesses be flexible and responsive when it comes to changing demands \nand conditions if they wish to be successful and truly distinguish \nthemselves. My home State of Maine boasts a number of these highly \ninnovative companies, which are poised to lead our economic recovery in \nthe coming years. I rise today to recognize one of these firms, Tilson \nTechnology Management, a small independent information technology \nproject management company based in Portland, which is helping \nbusinesses grow through the creative and comprehensive training it \noffers its customers.\n  Mike Dow founded Tilson Technology Management in 1996 with the goal \nof improving the day-to-day operations of construction companies \nthrough the unique technology consulting training it offers to its \nclients. Tilson quickly met this goal and, adjusting to the needs of a \nvariety of other industries, set its sights on providing technology \nsolutions to businesses on a broader, global scale. As such, Tilson \nexpanded its expertise, offering its critical technology services to a \nwider range of markets, including the biotechnology, banking, and \nmanufacturing industries. All the while, Tilson has maintained its \nreputation as a leading example of solid and principled business \nmanagement.\n  At its core, Tilson is a company of solutions, helping businesses \nmeet their customers' needs while also helping to improve Maine's high-\ntech infrastructure. As a result of the company's hard work and \ndetermined success, Tilson was recognized this year with the Governor's \nAward for Technology Company of the Year. This honor is bestowed \nannually on a business that takes great pains to ensure that Maine is a \ncutting-edge technology State.\n  The company's work to find solutions to everyday technology problems \nis never-ending. In Maine, this includes constructing 1,100 miles of \nfiber optic cable that will expand the reach of broadband and the \ncountless opportunities that will come as a result. I look forward to \nthe completion of this project and the doors it will open for the \ncitizens of Maine and local industries seeking a wider, global reach. \nAt the same time, Tilson is helping to improve the lives of Americans \nabroad. The company is taking on the crucial task of developing ways to \nfurnish U.S. troops with the food and supplies they need while serving \nour country in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  A member of such organizations as the Portland Regional Chamber of\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\nCommerce, the Maine International Trade Center, and Maine's Software \nand Information Technology Industry Association, Tilson has been a \ndriving force in the vitality of Maine's business community. On a daily \nbasis, this impressive company makes the lives of the people of my home \nState easier by helping businesses better serve their customers. There \nare no bounds to what the future holds for Tilson and its remarkable \ninnovations that are helping Maine become a more competitive and global \nState. I thank Mike Dow and everyone at Tilson Technology Management \nfor making their company an outstanding example of a successful \nbusiness, and I offer them best wishes for continued growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8056-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL AND EMILY BECK\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Michael and Emily \nBeck of Keystone, SD, as my nominees for the 2010 Angels in Adoption \nAward. Since 1999, the Angels in Adoption program through the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute has honored more than \n1,600 individuals, couples, and organizations nationwide for their work \nin providing children with loving, stable homes.\n  Michael and Emily Beck were high school sweethearts, and decided \nearly in their relationship that they would eventually start a family \nthrough adoption. The Becks have done exactly that through the adoption \nof four children. Tehya, 6, was adopted when she was just a baby, and \nthis year the Beck family grew by three more. In July, Michael and \nEmily finalized the adoption of their foster children, John, 7, and his \nsisters, Emily, 5, and Shyanne, 4. Michael and Emily worked diligently \nto reunite John, Emily, and Shyanne who had been separated in the \nfoster system.\n  I admire the Beck's desire to promote foster care and advocate \nadoption as a way of life. A significant driving force behind their \nphilosophy on adoption is their belief in the call God has placed upon \nHis family to care for those who have no family to care for them. The \nBeck's goal is to provide permanency--a stable home and loving family--\nfor children who can often spend their entire childhood in the foster \ncare system.\n  The Becks also exemplify selfless service to our Nation. Michael and \nEmily both serve our country through the Army National Guard, and \nMichael has orders to deploy to the Middle East in 2011.\n  As a father myself, I can speak to the sacrifices that parents \nwillingly make for the well-being of their children. It is apparent \nthrough their stories that Michael and Emily make significant \nsacrifices to provide for their children and find joy in the small \naccomplishments of parenting. Michael and Emily are committed to \nproviding a promising and loving future for their family.\n  National Adoption Day this year is November 20, 2010, and I can think \nof no better family to serve as a role model for others who seek to \nadopt than Michael and Emily Beck, my nominees for the 2010 Angels in \nAdoption Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8056-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8056-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8056-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8056-S8057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:36 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 6397.

A bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Blue Alert plans \nthroughout the United States in order to disseminate information when a \nlaw enforcement officer is seriously injured or killed in the line of \nduty; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nBlue Alert Act of 2010.\n  Having just concluded Crime Prevention month it is important to \nremember our law enforcement officers that put their lives on the line \nevery day. There are more than 900,000 police officers in the United \nStates dedicated to stopping crime and making our communities safer. \nEvery day they go out onto the streets, and unfortunately become \ntargets for criminals who have no regard for law and order.\n  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \nofficer deaths have surged by 43 percent in the first half of 2010. \nEighty-seven officers died in the line of duty between January 1 and \nJune 30 of this year. If this rate continues, 2010 could become one of \nthe deadliest years for U.S. law enforcement in two decades. We need to \nmake sure our officers have all the tools they need to protect \nthemselves and each other.\n  This is why I, along with Senator Graham and Senator Leahy, am \nintroducing the National Blue Alert Act in an effort to provide law \nenforcement with an additional tool in fighting crime. The Blue Alert \nsystem is intended to provide rapid dissemination of information about \nsuch offenders to help facilitate capture of violent offenders and \nreduce the risk those offenders cause to our communities and law \nenforcement officers. The National Blue Alert will encourage, enhance \nand integrate blue alert plans throughout the United States in order to \neffectively disseminate information notifying law enforcement, media \nand the public that a suspect is wanted.\n  Currently there is no national alert system that provides immediate \ninformation to other law enforcement agencies, the media or the public \nat large. Many states have created a state blue alert system in an \neffort to better inform their local communities. For example, after the \nunfortunate murder of Maryland State Trooper Wesley Brown, Maryland \nGovernor O'Malley immediately signed an executive order establishing \nthe Maryland blue alert system. But Maryland is not alone. Florida was \nthe first state to implement the alert system in 2008. They were \nfollowed by Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, and Delaware.\n  My bill creates a national blue alert program within the Department \nof Justice. Currently, under the COPS technology program, Congress \nauthorizes funds for the continued development of technologies and \nautomated systems that help tribal, state and local law enforcement \nagencies prevent, respond to, and investigate crime. My bill authorizes \n$10 million out of this program to be appropriated for the creation of \nblue alert plans throughout the United States. This new technology will \nprovide police officers and other emergency units with the ability to \nreact quickly to apprehend violent offenders.\n  Based on the success of the AMBER Alert and the SILVER Alert, I \nbelieve this BLUE Alert will be equally successful in helping to \napprehend criminal suspects who have injured or killed our law \nenforcement officers. This legislation has received the support of the \nFraternal Order of Police and the Concerns of Police Survivors National \nOffice.

Res. 683\n\n       Whereas, since independence 19 years ago, the people of \n     Moldova have made extraordinary progress in transitioning \n     from authoritarian government and a closed market to a \n     democratic government and market economy;\n       Whereas, for 19 years, the constitution of Moldova has \n     guaranteed its citizens freedom to emigrate confirmed by \n     years of successive Presidential waivers concerning the \n     Jackson-Vanik amendment;\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2010, the Government of Moldova \n     initiated negotiations with the European Union on an \n     Association Agreement between the European Union and the \n     Republic of Moldova, an important step towards European Union \n     accession;\n       Whereas, in order to comply with the criteria of the \n     Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the Government of \n     Moldova implemented far-reaching legal reforms to curb \n     corruption, introduce budgetary transparency, and strengthen \n     the capacity of civil society and the media, resulting in the \n     successful conclusion of negotiations and the signing of an \n     MCC Compact on January 22, 2010;\n       Whereas the Government of Moldova initiated a visa dialogue \n     between the Republic of Moldova and the European Union aiming \n     at visa liberalization on June 15, 2010;\n       Whereas, on August 26, 2010, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton praised progress in Moldova in ``advancing \n     transparent governance, human rights, and economic reform'';\n       Whereas, on October 20, 2010, Reporters Without Borders \n     reported an improvement in the freedom of press in Moldova, \n     with Moldova rising from the 114th position in 2009 to the \n     75th position in 2010;\n       Whereas, in November 2010, the Government of Moldova \n     concluded a treaty with Romania important to the assertion of \n     its sovereignty and its future development;\n       Whereas Assistant Secretary of State for European and \n     Eurasian Affairs Philip H. Gordon noted in testimony before \n     the Subcommittee on Europe of the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on June 16, 2009, \n     ``We will continue to work for a negotiated settlement of the \n     separatist conflict in the Transnistria region that provides \n     for a whole and democratic Moldova and the withdrawal of \n     Russian forces.''; and\n       Whereas the Republic of Moldova has made commitments to the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to \n     conduct elections according to international standards: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the development of an enduring democratic \n     political system and free market economy in Moldova and a \n     parliamentary election process on November 28, 2010, that \n     comports with international standards of fairness and \n     transparency;\n       (2) recognizes that the commitment of the Government of \n     Moldova to economic and political reforms since 2009 has \n     resulted in tangible progress towards integration into \n     European institutions;\n       (3) acknowledges that continued reform and commitment to a \n     free and fair election process will remain necessary for \n     Moldova's full integration into the Western community of \n     nations;\n       (4) notes that continued reforms in Moldova could provide \n     for an additional basis for the repeal of the Jackson-Vanik \n     trade restrictions;\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\n       (5) encourages ongoing negotiations between the European \n     Union and the Republic of Moldova concerning visa \n     liberalization and an Association Agreement;\n       (6) urges fulfillment by the Government of Moldova of \n     commitments it has made to the OSCE with respect to the free \n     and fair conduct of its upcoming parliamentary elections; and\n       (7) expresses the belief that the free and fair conduct of \n     parliamentary elections in Moldova will contribute to a \n     strong and stable government that is responsive to the vital \n     needs of its people.\n\n                              S. Res. 684\n\n       Whereas the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975 (Public Law 94-142) was signed into law 35 years ago on \n     November 29;\n       Whereas the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975 established the Federal policy of ensuring that all \n     children, regardless of the nature or severity of their \n     disability, have available to them a free appropriate public \n     education in the least restrictive environment;\n       Whereas the Education of the Handicapped Act (Public Law \n     91-230), as amended by the Education for All Handicapped \n     Children Act of 1975, was further amended by the Education of \n     the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986 (Public Law 99-457) to \n     create a preschool grant program for children with \n     disabilities 3 to 5 years of age and an early intervention \n     program for infants and toddlers with disabilities from birth \n     through age 2;\n       Whereas the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of \n     1990 (Public Law 101-476) renamed the Education of the \n     Handicapped Act as the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.);\n       Whereas IDEA was amended by the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997 (Public Law \n     105-17) to ensure that children with disabilities have equal \n     access to, and make progress in, the general education \n     curriculum and are included in all general State and \n     district-wide assessment programs;\n       Whereas IDEA was amended by the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law \n     108-446) to ensure that all children with disabilities have \n     available to them a free appropriate public education that \n     emphasizes special education and related services designed to \n     meet their individual needs and prepare them for further \n     education, employment, and independent living;\n       Whereas IDEA currently serves an estimated 342,000 infants \n     and toddlers, 709,000 preschoolers, and 5,890,000 children 6 \n     to 21 years of age;\n       Whereas IDEA has opened neighborhood schools to students \n     with disabilities and increased the number of children living \n     in their communities instead of institutions;\n       Whereas the academic achievement of students with \n     disabilities has significantly increased since the enactment \n     of IDEA;\n       Whereas the number of children with disabilities who \n     complete high school with a standard diploma has grown \n     significantly since the enactment of IDEA;\n       Whereas the number of children with disabilities who enroll \n     in institutions of higher education has more than tripled \n     since the enactment of IDEA;\n       Whereas IDEA requires partnership among parents of children \n     with disabilities and education professionals in the design \n     and implementation of the educational services provided to \n     children with disabilities;\n       Whereas the achievement of students with disabilities is \n     integrally linked with the successful alignment of special \n     and general education systems;\n       Whereas IDEA has increased the quality of research in \n     effective teaching practices for students with disabilities; \n     and\n       Whereas IDEA continues to serve as the framework to marshal \n     the resources of this Nation to implement the promise of full \n     participation in society of children with disabilities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 35th anniversary of the enactment of the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public \n     Law 94-142);\n       (2) acknowledges the many and varied contributions of \n     children with disabilities and their parents, teachers, \n     related services personnel, and administrators; and\n       (3) reaffirms its support for the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act so that all children with \n     disabilities have access to a free appropriate public \n     education in the least restrictive environment and the \n     opportunity to benefit from the general education curriculum \n     and be prepared for further education, employment, and \n     independent living.\n\n                              S. Res. 685\n\n       Whereas sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that \n     affects red blood cells leading to significant morbidity and \n     mortality in nearly 80,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas sickle cell disease causes blockage of small blood \n     vessels which can lead to tissue damage resulting in severe \n     pain, infection, or stroke;\n       Whereas scientific breakthroughs over the past century have \n     improved the lives of millions of people suffering from \n     sickle cell disease;\n       Whereas scientific advances in treatment for sickle cell \n     disease began with Dr. James B. Herrick, an attending \n     physician at Presbyterian Hospital and professor of medicine \n     at Rush Medical College in Chicago, Illinois, who discovered \n     sickle cell disease and published the first recorded case in \n     Western medical literature in November of 1910 in the journal \n     Annals of Internal Medicine;\n       Whereas the hemoglobin mutation responsible for sickle cell \n     disease was discovered by Linus Pauling in 1950;\n       Whereas penicillin was proven to be effective as a \n     preventative strategy against pneumococcal infection in 1986, \n     sparing patients with sickle cell disease from contracting \n     this particularly dangerous infection;\n       Whereas in 1995, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n     Institute reported the first effective drug treatment for \n     adults with severe sickle cell disease;\n       Whereas the anticancer drug hydroxyurea was found to reduce \n     the frequency of painful crises of sickle cell disease and \n     patients taking the drug needed fewer blood transfusions;\n       Whereas in 1996, bone marrow transplantation was discovered \n     to improve the course of sickle cell disease for select \n     patients;\n       Whereas in 1997, blood transfusions were found to help \n     prevent stroke in patients with sickle cell disease;\n       Whereas the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine in 2000 \n     revolutionized the prevention of lethal infections in \n     children and adults with sickle cell disease;\n       Whereas the first mouse model demonstrating the usefulness \n     of genetic therapy for sickle cell disease was developed in \n     2001;\n       Whereas in 2007, scientists from the University of Alabama \n     at Birmingham and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n     developed an animal model for curing sickle cell disease;\n       Whereas improvements in treatments have substantially \n     improved quality of life for patients with sickle cell \n     disease and led to an increase in overall life expectancy \n     from 14 years in 1973 to the mid to late 40s in 2010; and\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health sponsored a \n     symposium on November 16 and 17, 2010, to commemorate the \n     100th anniversary of Dr. James Herrick's initial description \n     of sickle cell disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the contributions of the biomedical research \n     community to the improvement in diagnosis and treatment of \n     sickle cell disease; and\n       (2) commemorates the 100th anniversary of the discovery of \n     sickle cell disease in November 1910.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/18/senate-section/article/S8108-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 3975\n\n  Mr. REID.
