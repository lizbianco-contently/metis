Mr. President, following leader remarks, if any, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of S. 160, the District of Columbia House \nVoting Rights Act. Rollcall votes are expected to occur today and \ntomorrow in an effort to advance this bill to passage this week so we \ncan turn to the consideration of the omnibus appropriations bill next \nweek.\n  Mr. President, you will note that we have had no morning business. \nThe reason for that is we are very in tune to finish this legislation. \nI want everyone to have ample opportunity to offer any amendment that \nthey want on this bill. There should be no excuse. We have got all \nmorning, all afternoon, all evening, all day tomorrow, but we are going \nto finish the bill one way or the other.\n  I hope we can do it the right way, the easy way, so we do not have to \nfile cloture on it. This is a bill that should advance. Senator \nLieberman is so knowledgeable about Senate procedures that he will \nprotect everyone's rights. But we cannot imagine what the amendments \nare going to be; they have to be offered. We have heard a lot of talk \nabout amendments being offered, some germane, some not germane. But \nlet's get it done and move on.\n  I do not want to have to file cloture on this bill. There is no \nreason to file cloture. If people have amendments, they want to improve \nthe legislation, let them offer the amendments. But if we do not have a \nlot of activity on this legislation, I will file cloture today for a \nFriday cloture vote. If we are unable to complete action on the bill \ntomorrow, Senators should be prepared to vote on Friday, even though it \nwas previously announced that there would be no votes on that day. So \neveryone should be alerted that we may have votes on Friday.\n  There is no reason in the world that this simple piece of legislation \ncannot be completed. I am surprised we have to go into this tomorrow, \nquite frankly. We should finish it today--that would also be good--and \nwe could do our work that we have scheduled for the weekend, and we \ncould move this bill so we can start on that on Friday, because, as I \nsaid yesterday, we have to complete action on the omnibus spending bill \nby next Friday, the reason being that the continuing resolution runs \nout at that time.\n  Senator Cochran and Senator Inouye have worked hard to get the bill \nto this point. It has been available for everyone for days now. It is \non our Web site. Everyone can read every word of it. All of the so-\ncalled earmarks, the congressionally directed spending are there. We \ncan look at them, know who asked for them.\n  The earmarks are down by 50 percent from what they were. The amount \nof dollars in earmarks, congressionally directed spending, is way down \nfrom 4 percent to 1 percent. So let's move forward on the legislation \nwe are dealing with here today and get this done as quickly as \npossible.\n  Because this is a 6-week work period, we have a lot of work to do. \nSome of us were out late last night at President Obama's speech.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2433-7", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2433-S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 160, which the clerk will report \nby title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 160) to provide the District of Columbia a \n     voting seat and the State of Utah an additional seat in the \n     House of Representatives.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the majority \nleader for his statement on this bill, S. 160, the DC House Voting \nRights Act. I think he got right to the point. This measure has been \nbefore Congress for quite a long time. The bill before us is the result \nof a bipartisan compromise that was worked out in the House of \nRepresentatives last year between Delegate Norton and then-Congressman \nTom Davis.\n  There are questions about the bill. Obviously, there are different \npoints of view. I am very grateful that yesterday 62 Members of this \nbody, including 8 Republicans, voted to stop a filibuster to invoke \ncloture to get to this bill. I think people are ready to debate it on \nits merits.\n  I feel very strongly that this bill rights a historic injustice. It \nis hard to believe, when you stop to think about it; maybe we become \naccustomed to things and forget how unacceptable they are and how \nunaccustomed we should be, but 600,000 Americans are deprived of having \nvoting representation in the Congress of the United States because they \nhappen to live, of all places, in the capital of this greatest \ndemocracy in the world.\n  There are a lot of historic reasons for this originally, but then \nthey became political reasons, frankly partisan. But none of them holds \nany real sway against the ideal that animates our country. This is a \nrepresentative democracy. And finally the residents of the District got \na delegate in the House, but the delegate cannot vote.\n  Think of it. If any one of us, the 100 of us who are privileged to be \nSenators were told for some reason that we could be Senators, we could \nrepresent our States, we could participate in debates, but then when \nthe roll was called, we could not vote--it is unbelievable. This is \nwhat we have done to the 600,000 residents of the District of Columbia \nand to their Delegate in the House.\n\n  This bill would right that wrong. I would say that few, if any, of \nour colleagues would argue that somehow the status quo is acceptable; \nthat is, that 600,000 people do not have a voting representative in \nCongress.\n  We are the only democracy--and, of course, we believe we are the \ngreatest democracy in the world. Historically, we began the moment of \ndemocracy throughout the world. We are the only democracy in the world \nwhere the residents of our capital do not have any voting \nrepresentation in Congress.\n  So I think, generally speaking, Members of the Senate understand and \naccept the injustice of the status quo. The objections are primarily \nconstitutional as I have heard them. I believe the arguments on behalf \nof the constitutionality of this proposal are strong and convincing, \ncertainly to me.\n  My cosponsor of this legislation, the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Orrin Hatch, who has, generally speaking, been acknowledged as a \nwonderful lawyer, a great constitutional scholar, in fact, has written \nan essay for the Harvard Law Journal, making the case for the \nconstitutionality of this proposal. I commend that to all of our \ncolleagues, particularly those who have doubts about the \nconstitutionality of this measure.\n  But I honestly think that most people have accepted the injustice \nquestion. The constitutionality, okay, let's have some amendments. As \nSenator Reid said, we have got today, tomorrow. We are here. Let's have \nsome amendments and put it in issue, give the Senate the choice that \ndeals with the constitutionality. Some think there ought to be a \nconstitutional amendment to achieve voting representation in the \nCongress. I do not think that is necessary.\n  Some think the District of Columbia, the residents should, for \npurposes of representation in Congress, become part of Maryland or \nVirginia. There is some historical precedent for that argument, way \nback. Let's debate it. But let's get it done. This measure has strong \nsupport and it has the urgency of justice delayed about it.\n  So the question before the Senate, as it so often is, are we going to \nface the differences here and debate them and then have a vote so we \ncan conclude this debate and go back to our States Thursday evening and \nhave a good weekend with our constituents at home or are we going to \ndelay this and use this as a vehicle for unrelated matters that will \nachieve nothing? That, as usual, is the challenge before us.\n  I am here, and I look forward to colleagues coming as soon as \npossible to speak, and hopefully to offer amendments, with the goal \nthat Senator Reid has set--we can finish this goal by tomorrow, \nThursday. Senator Reid has made it clear that if he gets the sense \nduring the day today that there is going to be delay, and there are \namendments that are not relevant to the bill, he is going to file \ncloture. That will mean we will have to stay here on Friday to vote on \ncloture, and we will not be able to finish this bill presumably until \nthe first part of next week. I hope that does not happen. Please come \nto the floor and let's talk about it.\n  I do want to, while I have a moment--I am sure Members are rushing \nfrom their offices right now to come to the floor to offer amendments--\nI do want to talk for the record about the interesting compromise that \nDelegate Norton and Congressman Davis achieved last year, and this \nanswers the question of: Why Utah?\n  This bill would increase the size of the House of Representatives to \n437, adding two new Members to the House. This is quite historic both \nin terms of righting the injustice suffered for now more than two \ncenturies by the residents of our Nation's capital, but also that we \nare adding Members to the House of Representatives. That does not \nhappen too often in our history.\n  One of those seats would go to the District of Columbia, the other as \npart of the compromise would, for the next 2 years, until the \nreapportionment of the House that will follow the 2010 census, go to \nUtah. I would say to clarify, that after the 2010 census, the District \nwould retain its seat because of the injustice that we are correcting. \nBut the second seat would go to whichever State deserves it; that is, \naccording to the population found in the 2010 census.\n  So let me explain why Utah now. Utah has had an objection to the \noutcome of the 2000 census and the Congressional apportionment that \nfollowed it. According to the 2000 census, the State of Utah missed out \non getting a fourth seat in the House of Representatives by 857 people.\n  This was a very thin margin of error, particularly when one considers \nthe methodology of the count and the way it uniquely affected Utah. \nRemember, 857 people short of getting a fourth seat as compared to \nanother State. According to officials of the State of Utah, somewhere \nbetween 11,000 and 14,000 members of the Church of Latter-day Saints, \nMormons, missionaries living abroad but citizens of the United States, \nresidents of Utah, were not counted. It is true, however, that members \nof the military who are abroad are counted.\n  In two separate court cases, the State of Utah argued that the \nmethodology of the count of the census was flawed because government \nofficials, including military personnel, were counted in the census, \nwhile other Americans, including the LDS missionaries, were not. Our \ncolleagues in the House had an insight. It was one of those moments of \ncompromise. Perhaps it seems we are combining apples and pears, but--\nand I will stop the metaphor and not go on to a sweet fruit salad--the \nfact is, this made a lot of sense. Our colleagues in the House \nrecognized that in these two sets of complaints--the historic one for \nthe District and the one for Utah, more current--there was a potential \nsolution to the longstanding impasse on DC voting rights.\n  Let's state what is implicit. Over time, I fear people concluded, \nnotwithstanding the justice of the argument made by residents of the \nDistrict that they deserve voting representation, it is clear, and we \nmust acknowledge what is clear, the registration of voters\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\nin the District is overwhelmingly Democratic. So in terms of partisan \nbalance in the House, the feeling, obviously, was that when the \nDistrict of Columbia gets a voting representative in the House of \nRepresentatives, that representative will almost always be Democratic. \nUtah tends to be Republican, though not totally; there is one Member of \nthe House from Utah today who is a Democrat.\n  There was another judgment involved, an interesting one which we tend \nnot to think of. If we just added one seat for the District of \nColumbia, a voting representative, we would end up with 436 Members of \nthe House, an even number, and no constitutional mechanism for breaking \na tie. Obviously, presumably a motion that resulted in a tie would \nfail, but it seems an unsatisfactory resolution to the problem. Without \nan odd number of Members of the House, gridlock would ensue in too many \ncases. How would the House, for instance, organize itself if the split \nbetween the political parties was even? Clearly, the Vice President \ndoes not serve as a tie-breaking vote for the House, as is the case in \nthe Senate. It could be impossible to elect a Speaker or appoint \ncommittee chairs. So the solution devised by our colleagues in the \nHouse in the last session of Congress increased the size of the House \nby two Members to 437, which pairs a new seat for the District of \nColumbia with a new seat for Utah. That simultaneously gives the \nDistrict the representation it deserves, keeps the House as an uneven \nnumber of seats, and balances a likely Democratic seat from the \nDistrict with a likely Republican seat from Utah.\n  This is the balance that resulted in the legislation that is before \nus. It is a compromise but, as in so many cases--and it is a pragmatic \ncompromise--it results in a good solution, frankly, to two problems, \none longstanding for the District, the other more current and brief for \nUtah.\n  In submitting this legislation from the committee, we are not judging \nthe manner in which the 2000 census was conducted or the outcome of \nlegal disputes that followed. That is a matter of record. However, it \nis a statistical fact that Utah was the next State in line to receive \nan additional seat in the House of Representatives. Given that fact, it \nis a reasonable bipartisan compromise to create the two voting seats \nproposed in S. 160. I stress, again, that Utah only receives this seat \nunder this bill for 2 years. The bill has no impact on the conduct of \nthe next census in 2010 and subsequent reapportionment. Once \nreapportionment is conducted for the 2012 election, the Utah seat will \nbe awarded based on population increases to the State that thereby has \nearned it. It could be Utah. It could be another State. If Utah's 2010 \npopulation does not entitle the State to a fourth congressional seat, \nit will not retain the seat it will receive under this bill.\n  The bill offers an opportunity to right the wrong Utah believes it \nsuffered in 2000, the closeness of its numbers and also the fact that \nMormon missionaries, way beyond the 857 gap between Utah and the State \nthat got the additional seat, way beyond that number, 11,000 to 14,000. \nI think this is a very fair compromise that ensures, bottom line, every \ncitizen of the country is given the most precious right democracy can \nprovide, the right to vote for someone who can represent him or her \nwith a vote in Congress. When one doesn't have that, as is the case \nwith the District of Columbia, apart from the frustration I described \nearlier that Delegate Norton must experience every time the roll is \nopened in the House, we have the inequity of residents of the District \nvolunteering and being sent to war. Yet the Delegate of the District in \nthe House has no vote on questions of war or peace. We have soldiers \nreturning as veterans, and yet the representative from the District has \nno vote on the benefits we will confer or not confer on veterans. The \nresidents of the District are not only taxed without representation, \nwhich is, as our Founders asserted, a form of tyranny, but they are \ntaxed very heavily. They pay the second highest rate of Federal \ntaxation per capita. Yet they have no voting representation in Congress \non the rate of taxation, the manner of taxation or, of course, where \nthe revenue goes.\n  They are the only governmental entity, outside of a Federal agency, \nthat has to have its budget approved by the Congress. When we are tied \nup in gridlock and the budget doesn't pass, it means the District of \nColumbia is in a terrible predicament because it can't get the money it \nneeds to operate. Yet the District has no voting representation on \nmatters of appropriations in Congress. This is the moment to end this \nantiquity, a profoundly unjust and, frankly, un-America antiquity.\n  I urge colleagues to come to the Chamber. Let's have some amendments \nand debate, and let's get this done by tomorrow afternoon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in consultation with the managers, the \nSenator from Connecticut and the Senator from Arizona, I make a \nconstitutional point of order against this bill on the grounds that it \nviolates article I, section 2, of the Constitution, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the precedent and practices \nof the Senate, the Chair has no power or authority to pass on such a \npoint of order. The Chair, therefore, under the precedent of the \nSenate, submits the question to the Senate: Is the point of order well \ntaken?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand that now the motion is \ndebatable.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a statement on this issue, and I \nlook forward to debating it and a vote at the wishes of the majority \nand Republican leader on this constitutional point of order.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much that Senator \nMcCain came to the floor to raise this point of order. As I said \nearlier, this is a matter that concerns people. I feel strongly that \nthe measure is constitutional. But this is exactly what we should be \ndebating. I look forward to his arguments and to responding to them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, through whose committee this legislation is \nproceeding.\n  I appreciate the frustration felt by the residents of the District of \nColumbia at the absence of a vote in Congress. I fully understand and \nappreciate that. I also believe it is important that we look back at \nboth the Constitution itself and the intention of our Founding Fathers, \nwhich was to create the District of Columbia as a base of Government.\n  According to many experts, the District of Columbia is not a State, \nso therefore is not entitled to that representation. Also, one has to \nraise the obvious question: If the District of Columbia is entitled to \na Representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, then why isn't \nit also entitled to two Senators? If the District of Columbia is \nentitled to a Member of Congress, why isn't Puerto Rico, which would \nprobably entail 9 or 10 Members of Congress? Why are other territories \nof the United States not entitled to full-fledged Members of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and, indeed, the U.S. Senate?\n  After great deliberation and debate, our Founding Fathers enshrined \nin the Constitution, 222 years ago, a unique form of government that \nproposes a distribution of power and checks and balances on each \nbranch. So, too, the Founding Fathers considered and provided for a \nunique Federal city to serve as our Nation's seat of government. No \nsingle Member would represent the interest of the District but all \nMembers of Congress would share responsibility for the city's well-\nbeing. I believe that when you look at distribution of tax revenues and \nwhen you look at other measurements, the District of Columbia has been \nwell represented by all Members of Congress.\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\n  The Framers specifically limited voting representation in the House \nof Representatives to States. Article I, section 2, of the Constitution \nprovides unequivocally:\n\n       The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members \n     chosen every second year by the People of the several States.\n\n  If they had wanted the District of Columbia to have the \nrepresentation, they would have designated so in the Constitution. \nAsked to opine on the meaning of the word ``States'' in the context of \nHouse representation, Federal courts have consistently accorded that \nword its plain meaning, concluding that the word ``States'' does not \ninclude territories or possessions or even the District of Columbia.\n  Again, I express my sympathy for the residents of the District of \nColumbia. But to now act in direct contravention to the intent and \nwords of our Founding Fathers, I believe, is a violation of the \nConstitution of the United States. And to somehow work a deal that \nincludes the State of Utah having an additional seat in return for that \nis an incredible violation. I will talk more about that.\n  First, I wish to say that it is very clear the Congress simply cannot \namend the Constitution by legislation--no matter how noble the cause. \nCongress has once before pursued an appropriate constitutional \nresolution to this issue. In 1978, Congress passed a joint resolution \nproposing to amend the Constitution to provide for the representation \nfor the District of Columbia in Congress. Seven years later, that \nresolution failed to obtain the required approval of the 38 States \nnecessary for ratification under article V of the Constitution. There \nis no reason proponents of voting rights for the District can't pursue \nthis process again. There is a process for amending the Constitution of \nthe United States. There is no reason why those residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia, and other supporters, should not pursue the \nlegitimate process of amending the Constitution of the United States. \nIt should not be done and, in my view, cannot be done. The courts will \ndecide, if we don't decide here, that it is unconstitutional to do so. \nI welcome such a process, rather than the consideration of this bill, \nwhich is clearly unconstitutional--not only in my judgment but in the \noverwhelming body of legal opinion.\n  In addition to being unconstitutional, as I said, I am concerned that \nthis bill is more a product of politics than of principle. Look at what \nthis legislation before us does. It doesn't simply grant the District \nof Columbia a voting seat in the House; it adds another congressional \nseat for the State of Utah. The obvious question is, Why Utah? Why not \nArizona or Nevada or New Jersey? As a representative of the people of \nthe State of Arizona, who, I believe, legitimately and continuously, as \none of the fastest growing States, have been deprived of additional \nseats because of the way the census was conducted--and now we are going \nto give a seat to the State of Utah on the grounds that the census was \nnot accurate. I don't know of any fast-growing State in America that \ndoesn't believe we were undercounted--and legitimately--in the census.\n  Now, as I understand it--and maybe the proponents of an additional \nseat for Utah can more eloquently and convincingly describe it than I \ncan--they are saying it is because they came closest in the census to \nbeing eligible for another seat in the Congress. The State of Nevada is \nthe fastest growing State in America. Arizona has been among those that \nare fast growing. But why Utah? What in the world does an additional \nseat for Utah have to do with representation for the District of \nColumbia? It can only be interpreted in one way, and that is an attempt \nto buy votes. We are talking about the Constitution of the United \nStates here, about representation in the Congress of the United States \nof America, not some political deal.\n  I have sympathy for the State of Utah if they think they were \nundercounted in the census. I have sympathy for all States that were \nundercounted in the census. What some supporters of the bill argue is \nthat Utah is the next State in line to receive a House seat after the \nlast census in 2000 and reapportionment. Nevada was the fastest growing \nState from 1986 to 2004, until Arizona overtook Nevada as the fastest \ngrowing State in 2006, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nevada, \nonce again, regained this title for its high growth between 2006 and \n2007. For the first time in over 25 years, Utah was listed this year as \nthe fastest growing State, as its population climbed 2.5 percent, with \nArizona being second, with a population growth of 2.3 percent. Despite \nthis percentage growth, Texas, California, North Carolina, and Georgia \nadded more people than Utah, Nevada, or Arizona between 2007 and 2008. \nMr. President, we are getting on a slippery slope here. Do you judge it \nby percentage of growth, numbers of votes?\n  It brings us back to a final question: What in the world would \nawarding an additional seat to another State have to do with voting \nrights for the District of Columbia?\n  I have provided those statistics to illustrate there are other States \nthat have experienced far more phenomenal growth than Utah. I love \nUtah. It is a wonderful State. But the wheels were greased for Utah to \nreceive an additional seat well before it was listed as the fastest \ngrowing State this year. And if the State of Utah or any other State \nwas undercounted, that should be taken into consideration; we should \nfix the census in the year 2010 and make sure any injustice is \ncorrected. But to somehow say we are going to award a State an \nadditional seat not in keeping with the process of how reapportionment \nis conducted every 10 years is remarkable and certainly \nunconstitutional.\n  In 2004, lawmakers began floating an idea of a compromise bill to \nbalance a House seat for the District of Columbia, which obviously we \nassume would be won by a Democrat, with a seat for a congressional \ndistrict in Utah, which most assume would be won by a Republican. The \nMay 3, 2005, editorial in the Washington Post called this a ``win-win \nsituation.'' While this may be a win-win situation for Washington, DC, \nand Utah, it is hardly a win for the millions of Americans who are \nliving in high-growth States.\n  In fact, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, \nif the District was considered to be a State during the last \napportionment, North Carolina would not have gained a seat. According \nto a study by the Republican policy committee, if this bill is enacted \nand the House of Representatives is expanded to 437 seats, then New \nJersey would keep a congressional seat it would otherwise lose. Again, \nthis illustrates there are winners and losers in an apportionment, but \nthese districts should be chosen based on concrete data from the \ncensus, not by political parties attempting to craft legislation that \nflies in the face of our Founding Fathers' intentions.\n\n  In a February 6, 2009, editorial, the Los Angeles Times states:\n\n       This is obviously partisan horse-trading.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times is right. Yes, partisan horse trading happens \nall the time, but this time partisan horse trading would do grave \nviolence to our Constitution.\n  A commentator wrote in the February 13, 2009, edition of the \nWashington Times:\n\n     . . . the enactment of blatantly unconstitutional legislation \n     to bypass the constitutional amendment process and give the \n     District of Columbia a seat in the House of Representatives \n     in a crass triumph of raw political power over the rule of \n     law.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Again, I regret I am unable to support this legislation to provide \nthe residents of the District voting representation in the House of \nRepresentatives. However, I took a solemn oath to defend our \nConstitution as a U.S. Senator. In testifying before the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee in 2007, Professor Jonathan \nTurley described this horse trading as ``the most premeditated \nunconstitutional act by Congress in decades.''\n  We, as Senators, cannot avoid the constitutional issue. While the \nSupreme Court may be the final arbiter of constitutionality, Congress, \nas the first branch of Government, has an independent duty to consider \nthe constitutionality of the bills we pass, especially where, as here, \nour own independent Congressional Research Service advises that \n``although not beyond question, it would appear likely that the \nCongress does not have authority to grant voting representation in the \nHouse of Representatives to the District of Columbia'' as contemplated \nby this bill.\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\n  We really have two aspects of this legislation. First of all, does \nCongress have the constitutional authority to grant voting rights or an \nadditional seat in the House of Representatives by legislation rather \nthan amending the Constitution of the United States?\n  As I pointed out earlier in my statement, the fact is, it was tried \nin 1978 in the proper fashion and did not receive the approval of the \n38 States necessary to amend the Constitution. So now we are trying to \nbasically amend the Constitution of the United States by legislation. \nThat is not in keeping with the authority and responsibility of the \nCongress of the United States of America.\n  The second is, of course, what in the world does granting voting \nrights to the District of Columbia have to do with granting another \nseat to another State? One can only interpret that, as one of the \neditorials did, as political horse trading. There is no constitutional \nbasis for granting a seat to any State in the United States of America \nwithout it being backed up, as laid out by our Founding Fathers, by the \nresults of a census.\n  I will agree, as I have said before, coming from a State that has \nbeen consistently undercounted in our population, the census needs to \nbe fixed to more accurately reflect the true population of every State \nin America, and that has not happened with the fastest growing States. \nBut to grant a seat to a State because they were ``fastest growing'' \nand maybe closest to the requirement for an additional seat turns \neverything on its head.\n  What kind of a precedent would we be setting by legislation allowing \na State to have another seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, with \nthousands of votes that would be taken?\n  I also would like to mention, again, if the District of Columbia \ndeserves a voting representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, \ndoesn't the District of Columbia also deserve two U.S. Senators? How \nintellectually do you make the argument they deserve a vote in the \nother body, a coequal body--although we certainly do not recognize that \nvery often. But the fact is, it is a coequal body. They are going to \nhave a vote over there, but they are not going to have representation \nover here.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that we have territories in which \ncitizens of the United States reside. Those who were born in those \nterritories, according to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, are citizens \nof the United States. In fact, they are even eligible to run for \nPresident of the United States if they are born in a U.S. territory.\n  What about Puerto Rico? What about the Virgin Islands? What about the \nMarianas? What about other territories that are part of the United \nStates of America and in which our citizens also reside who then vote \nfor Representatives in the other body, but those Representatives \nobviously do not have voting power?\n  I conclude by saying this is a serious issue. It is a serious issue. \nIt has been clouded by the understandable concern that Members of \nCongress have for the people who reside in the District of Columbia. We \nsee their license plates every day: ``Taxation without \nRepresentation.'' But the way to give them those voting rights is \nthrough amending the Constitution of the United States, not a \nlegislative act that clearly is not within the constitutional authority \ngranted by our Founding Fathers to the Congress of the United States.\n  I look forward to a spirited debate on this issue. I think it is an \nimportant one. If this DC voting rights bill does pass and this \nconstitutional point of order is rejected by a majority of the Senate, \nI have very little doubt that the courts of the United States of \nAmerica will reject this proposal.\n  Again, I appreciate and admire and respect the manager of this bill, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, and the \nsenior ranking member, the Senator from Maine. But I think there is a \nhuge credibility problem when you add on a provision for adding a seat \nto a State for which there is not any factual or, frankly, rational \nargument for except that perhaps this measure will gain more support.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a very close look at what we are doing. \nThe most sacred obligation we have is to respect and preserve the \nConstitution of the United States of America in everything we do. I \nhave very little doubt this legislation before us violates the \nConstitution of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona for his \nkind words and also for the serious constitutional questions he raised.\n  As I said earlier, this is exactly what we ought to be debating on \nthis bill. I take it as a given that neither he nor anyone else I heard \nspeak in this Chamber would say that it is fair or just or consistent \nwith the first principles of our representative democracy, this great \nRepublic of ours, that 600,000 Americans be denied the fundamental \nright to be represented in Congress by somebody who can actually vote. \nPretty much everybody will agree that is wrong, all the more \nunacceptable because these 600,000 people happen to live in the Capital \nof this great democracy of ours.\n  The question is, in one sense, the constitutionality of S. 160, the \nHouse District Voting Rights Act that is before us, and in a second \nsense, which the Senator from Arizona has raised, the wisdom, if you \nwill, of combining the voting rights for residents of the District with \nan extra seat, in the short run, for the State of Utah. I wish to take \nsome time to respond to these serious arguments.\n  As I understand it--and I think I do--what the Senator from Arizona \nand other opponents of the constitutionality of this bill say is that \nthe question of the District of Columbia's voting rights in the House \nshould be settled by section 2 of article I of our Constitution, which \nsays the House shall be made up of Members chosen ``by the People of \nthe several States.'' And they argue that because the District of \nColumbia is not a State, its residents cannot have representation in \nthe House, presumably at least not without a constitutional amendment.\n  Those of us who feel strongly that this measure before the Senate is \nconstitutional base our claim on the District clause of the \nConstitution which states that the Congress has the power ``To exercise \nexclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District,'' \nreferring, of course, to the Federal District that was created at the \ntime of the Constitution as the National Capital.\n  Our courts have described in the centuries since this authority in \nthe District clause as a ``unique and sovereign power'' and ``sweeping \nand inclusive in its character.'' Unlike many congressional powers, it \nis not balanced against the countervailing rights of the States.\n\n  As former, I believe he was Associate Attorney General, maybe Deputy \nAttorney General during the previous administration, the Bush \nadministration, Viet Dinh, stated in his testimony before the House of \nRepresentatives on this matter:\n\n       [W]hen Congress acts pursuant to the District Clause, it \n     acts as a legislature of national character, exercising \n     ``complete legislative control as contrasted with the limited \n     power of a state legislature, on the one hand, and as \n     contrasted with the limited sovereignty which Congress \n     exercises within the boundaries of the states, on the \n     other.''\n\n  That is a very interesting argument about the unique powers of \nCongress pursuant to this District clause.\n  Then Mr. Viet Dinh concludes in support of this legislation and the \nconstitutionality of this legislation:\n\n       In few, if any, other areas does the Constitution grant any \n     broader authority for Congress to legislate.\n\n  That is what we are doing here.\n  Those who question the constitutionality of the legislation, as I \nmentioned, rely on section 2 of article I. They rely uniquely and \nalmost totally on the word ``States,'' that the Members of the House \nshall be chosen by ``the People of the several States.'' So they say \nthe District of Columbia is not a State; therefore, without amending \nthe Constitution, we, in Congress, even under the powerful District \nclause, do not have the power to grant voting rights in Congress to the \nRepresentative of the District of Columbia.\n  But there is a very clear and powerful line of Supreme Court cases in \nwhich the High Court and other courts have upheld Congress's right to \ntreat the District of Columbia as a State and\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\nto treat it as a State for matters that are extremely consequential: \nfor Federal taxation; in other words, the right to tax residents of the \nStates might free the residents of the District from this obligation.\n  Yet the courts have said the District itself can be treated as a \nState for purposes of Federal taxation, for purposes of Federal court \njurisdiction. This was the question of diversity of jurisdiction. I \ndon't have to go into the details. The courts have said it would be an \nanomaly to say because you happen to be an American living in the \nDistrict, you cannot gain access to the Federal courts because the \nConstitution says the various States with regard to diversity and \njurisdiction. The same with the right to a jury trial and, very \npowerfully, the same with regard to interstate commerce. There it is \ninterstate commerce. We have the interstate commerce clause of the \nConstitution which has given birth to probably thousands of pieces of \nlegislation, a very active role of oversight for the Government. And \neven though it is the interstate commerce clause, the courts have said \nvery clearly that the District should be considered a State, \nnotwithstanding the literal words in the Constitution. Because \neffectively, if you don't, you will create an enclave where people \ncan't be taxed, people can't gain access to the Federal courts, people \ndon't have a right to a jury trial, and people can't be protected by \ngenerations of legislation and regulation passed pursuant to the \ninterstate commerce clause.\n\n  For instance, as long ago as 1805, in the case of Hepburn v. Ellzey, \nJustice Marshall--the great Justice Marshall--ruled that the District \nof Columbia could not be considered a State for purposes of diversity \njurisdiction under the Constitution, which allows Federal courts to \nhear disputes between residents of different States. His opinion, \nnonetheless, remarked on the incongruity of such a result, and Justice \nMarshall invited Congress to find a solution. Many years later--\nunfortunately, many years later--Congress did so, and in 1949 the \nSupreme Court, in the Tidewater case, upheld a congressional statute \nthat said the District should be treated as a State for purposes of \ndiversity jurisdiction.\n  Citing such cases, former Federal Circuit Court Judge Patricia Wald \nhas testified--and again she testified on behalf of this legislation \nand its constitutionality:\n\n       The rationale of the courts in all these cases has been \n     that Congress, under the District Clause, has the power to \n     impose on District residents similar obligations and to grant \n     similar rights as the States claim power to do under the \n     Constitution itself.\n\n  So Congress is saying because the States get certain powers from the \nConstitution, if we don't treat the District as a State, its residents \nwill be deprived of protections, or the Federal Government will be \ndeprived of the right to tax them, for instance. And Judge Wald \ncontinued:\n\n       Given that the District is in reality what I might call a \n     City-State of 600,000 people--\n\n  Where the population, as I indicated in my opening statement \nyesterday morning, is just about equal to or greater than four States--\n\n     engaged in a multitude of private businesses and occupations, \n     there is realistically no other way that a federalist union \n     can do business under the Constitution.\n\n  It is also true that Congress has already extended the right of \nFederal representation, voting representation in Congress, to those who \nare not citizens of any State. I know this is an unusual statement and \nan exception, but there is the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Voting \nAct. And in that, Congress authorized American citizens overseas to \ncontinue to vote for Members of Congress in their last domestic State \nof residence, regardless of whether they had been citizens of that \nState and no matter how long they stay overseas. Indeed, as I mentioned \nyesterday, these people would lose this unusual right to voting \nrepresentation here in Congress, in States they no longer reside in--\nand they may not have been there in quite a while--by absentee ballot \nfrom elsewhere in the world, only if they renounced their American \ncitizenship or they returned to the United States and came to live in \nthe District of Columbia. Now, that is an anomalous and unacceptable \nresult. Citizens of Federal enclaves within a State are also free to \nvote in Federal elections held by the State--a right upheld by the \nSupreme Court.\n  Notably, Congress has already used this vast authority that I have \nreferred to under the District clause to extend voting rights to \nresidents of the District of Columbia. Between 1789 and 1800, Congress, \nacting under the District clause, granted residents of the new \nDistrict--the Nation's capital--the right to vote in their former \nStates of Maryland and Virginia, even though they were actually no \nlonger residents of those States--the land having been formally ceded \nto the Federal Government to form the new capital district.\n  Let me now address a few of the other arguments that have been raised \nby Members, constitutional arguments that have been raised by those who \noppose the bill on constitutional grounds.\n  It has been argued that because the constitutional amendment XXIII \nwas required to grant the District Presidential electors in the \nelectoral college, likewise a constitutional amendment should be \nrequired to provide the District with voting representation in the \nHouse. But these two issues are distinct. The XXIII amendment worked a \nfundamental change to the electoral college under Article II of the \nConstitution. As such, Congress could not legislate with the same \nlatitude it has within Article I, where the District clause is found \nalong with the clause governing composition of the U.S. House.\n  Some opponents of our proposal also cite the 1990 case of Adams v. \nClinton to argue that it would be unconstitutional to grant DC citizens \nvoting rights in the House. That is not the case, in my opinion. In \nAdams, the DC Government and residents brought a case alleging it was a \ndenial of their constitutional rights to exclude them from \nrepresentation in Congress. The majority opinion of the three-judge \ncourt stated, ``We are not blind to the inequity of the situation \nplaintiffs seek to change,'' but concluded that the court itself could \nnot grant the District residents voting rights in Congress as a matter \nof constitutional right. But the court did not address whether Congress \nwas empowered to provide voting rights through exercise of the District \nclause.\n  As former Solicitor General and Federal Circuit Court Judge Kenneth \nStarr testified before the House in 2004 on legislation similar to the \none before us now, S. 160:\n\n       While the Constitution may not affirmatively grant the \n     District's residents the right to vote in congressional \n     elections, the Constitution does affirmatively grant Congress \n     plenary power to govern the District's affairs.\n\n  In fact, the majority opinion in Adams arguably invited such an \napproach by stating that for plaintiffs to obtain Federal \nrepresentation, ``they must plead their cause in other venues.'' And \npresumably that meant the Congress.\n  Another concern raised by opponents of the bill is that it is a \nslippery slope, as the Senator from Arizona said. If Congress has the \nauthority to grant the District a voting representative in the House, \nwhat is to stop it from adding two Senators or extending full voting \nrights to the U.S. territories? I respectfully suggest that these \nconcerns are unfounded. The legislation before us only addresses DC \nvoting rights in the House, and the legal case for this action and its \nvalidity is unique.\n  First, with respect to the Senate, this bill could not be clearer. In \nSection 2(a)(2) it states:\n\n       The District of Columbia shall not be considered a State \n     for purposes of representation in the United States Senate.\n\n  But our colleagues have argued: Could some future Congress, using the \narguments used on behalf of this bill, pass similar legislation to give \nDC full voting rights in the Senate? To me, that is a very debatable \nargument at best. Even some of the legal experts who support this bill \nbelieve a different and much more difficult analysis would apply to a \nbill regarding Senate representation because of the distinct language \nand history of the constitutional provisions governing composition of \nthe Senate and the greater emphasis on the States as such.\n  The territories are also a distinct and different case. Different \nconstitutional provisions provide for the creation of the District and \nthe Federal territories. The District enjoys a unique legal and \nhistorical status, and one\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nthat largely mirrors the rights and responsibilities of the States. Its \nresidents pay full taxes and face military conscription. The same is \nnot true of the residents of the territories. Amendment XXIII extended \nthe right to vote in Presidential elections to residents of the \nDistrict but not to residents of the American territories.\n  As legal expert Richard Bress concluded in testimony on our \nlegislation last session:\n\n       Taken together, these differences between the territories \n     and the District render highly unlikely the suggestion that \n     granting voting rights to District residents would lead, as a \n     legal or policy matter, to granting similar privileges to \n     residents of the U.S. territories.\n\n  Finally, in his comments, Senator McCain questioned: How do we put \ntogether voting rights for the District of Columbia with an extra seat \nfor Utah; isn't this just a pragmatic political agreement? Well, in \nsome sense it is. But in another sense, like so many pragmatic \nagreements around here--and this is one of the best of them because it \nis bipartisan--it achieves a just result: Finally, after all these \nyears in which this outrageous anomaly has been allowed to exist, \nDistrict residents will get voting representation in the House, and it \nalso corrects what I think was an injustice done to the State of Utah \nin the last census--and which is one that I referred to earlier--when \nit came just 857 votes short of another seat, but the census did not \ncount what was estimated--or proven in the court case--between 11,000 \nand 14,000 Mormon missionaries who were clearly residents of Utah but \nwere elsewhere in the world on their years of missionary service.\n  The truth is that for too long now partisan concerns have stopped \nMembers of Congress from doing what they knew was right, which is to \ngive residents of the District voting rights. And the partisan concerns \nare understandable, even if they should not have blocked the result. It \nis a matter of fact that the residents of the District are \noverwhelmingly registered as members of the Democratic party. So in the \nnormal course, it would be extremely likely that any Member of the \nHouse from the District would be voting and organizing with the \nDemocrats. And I suppose if the shoe were on the other foot and this \nwas a largely Republican voting population, to be fair about it, \nDemocrats would probably have a similar feeling.\n  Last session, acknowledging the inequity of the District's case and \nthe understandable if ultimately unacceptable partisan concerns, two of \nour colleagues in the House--Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of the \nDistrict and Tom Davis former Republican Congressman from Virginia--\ntried to work this out. Acknowledging the inequity that I referred to \nwhich Utah felt it suffered, and actually went to court on in the last \ncensus, a decision was made to put these two together.\n  There was also an institutional necessity, if I can add to this. It \nwasn't a kind of apples and oranges--two problems, let's bring them \ntogether and have a bipartisan result, because the new Member of the \nHouse from Utah is likely to be a member of the Republican Party. If we \nonly added the one seat for the District, the House would have an even \nnumber of Members. One can imagine the gridlock that you would not want \nto see in the House. You could have an equal number of Members of both \nparties and a failure to organize, failure to be able to select a \nSpeaker, or a failure to be able to organize committees. On a tie vote, \nthere is no one in the House to exercise tie-breaking authority, \nsimilar to the Vice President here in the Senate. So legislation could \nfail as a result of a tie vote, and that is not a good result \neither. There was that institutional benefit that if you are going to \nadd one, you really should add two to bring the total back to an uneven \nnumber and avoid the problems we have talked about.\n\n  I do want to make clear that this kind of equitable grant of an \nadditional seat to Utah, based on what happened after the last census, \nis only for 2 years. Obviously, if we give the District voting rights, \nit will go on forever, but it is only for 2 years because another \ncensus is coming in 2010 and there will be a reapportionment following \nthat census. If Utah is next in line for that extra seat based on \npopulation, of course Utah will hold that extra seat. But if there is \nanother State that, based on population, has a greater claim for that \nextra seat, then they will get it as well.\n  I am happy to acknowledge that the bill before us is the result of a \npolitical compromise, a bipartisan compromise in the House, but I am \nnot embarrassed by it. I do not think it taints the result because the \nresult is so profoundly just in the case of the District, and I believe \nalso just in the case of Utah, and it only lasts for this one time.\n  I have tried to argue here, No. 1, on the constitutionality of this \nmeasure under the District clause; No. 2, that, yes, this is a \nbipartisan political agreement, but it is done for good reasons, and \nthat does not taint it at all; and No. 3, I would say that in the bill \nbefore us there is provision for an expedited appeal to the courts on \nthe constitutionality. We know there are constitutional differences \nthat have been argued by the Senator from Arizona and myself this \nmorning. We assume they will be tested in court. In the interests of \nefficient functioning of our Government, we provide in this measure for \nan expedited appeal.\n  This is not the first time this would happen. The most significant \ncase I remember, and I am sure it is one of many, is the landmark \ncampaign finance reform legislation that bears the name of my friend \nfrom Arizona and our friend from Wisconsin, the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation. Some argued vociferously on the floor that it was \nunconstitutional. So within the legislation, in a way quite similar to \nwhat we have done here on this, it was provided that there be an \nexpedited appeal. That was a way of saying, even if you believe this \nlegislation may be unconstitutional, we are a legislative body, we do \nnot know, really. I believe this legislation is constitutional, but \nultimately--I feel that very strongly, I said that it is, but the \nultimate arbiter of that, of course, is the courts.\n  So I urge my colleagues who have constitutional questions about this \nlegislation but really want to stop the inequity imposed on the \nresidents of the District, that they do not have voting representation \nhere, to vote for this measure because it contains with it an expedited \nappeal which will occur on the constitutionality of the legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nConnecticut--in particular, his comments at the conclusion of his \nremarks about the appropriateness of an expedited appeal. We are both \nvery certain of our constitutional judgment on this. We are both \nlawyers. We each come to a totally different conclusion about what is \nconstitutional or not. Fortunately, we have the courts to resolve the \nissues. As with previous legislation, we had the good sense to include \nan expedited appeal to the courts so that the issue can be resolved one \nway or the other. I would note there is one thing that is needed to \neffectuate this--to be sure that, as it was in the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation, an appeal can be facilitated by ensuring pro bono counsel \ncan represent plaintiff in the case.\n  Let me also reference a fact that my colleague from Arizona is \nusually quick to point out. He likes to say he is unburdened by a law \ndegree. That certainly can be a burden for those of us who have the \ndegree, but what he has argued illustrates not only the sensibility of \nour Constitution but also his extensive knowledge of it. I always \nappreciate his point of view on these issues because of his wide-\nreaching experience which helps us understand the reasons for the \nconstitutional provision. I support the constitutional point of order \nhe has raised because I do deeply believe the action the Senate is \nbeing asked to take here is unconstitutional.\n  The creation of a House seat for the District by legislation rather \nthan constitutional amendment is what is before us here, and we believe \nthat only by constitutional amendment can the additional representation \nbe appropriately granted.\n  I would like to respond briefly to the comments of my colleague from \nConnecticut. They are all well stated. They are the arguments in \nopposition to the proposition. I referred to a couple of them \nyesterday, but let me refresh those and then discuss one other matter.\n  The primary argument of the proponents of the bill is to rely on the \nso-\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\ncalled District clause, which is article I, section 8, clause 17. The \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court actually interpreted this clause in \na case called Neild v. District of Columbia in 1940. What the court \nnoted in that case was that the District clause does indeed allow \nCongress to legislate within the District for ``every proper purpose of \ngovernment'' and gives Congress ``full and unlimited jurisdiction to \nprovide for the general welfare of citizens within the District of \nColumbia by any and every act of legislation which it may deem \nconducive to that end,'' subject, of course, to the negative \nprohibitions of the Constitution.\n  But proponents argue that because the District clause allows Congress \nto do things in the District of Columbia that States themselves cannot \ndo, then it must also follow that Congress, with regard--that it must \nalso allow Congress to do things with regard to the District that only \nStates can do. For example, article I, section 10, of the Constitution \nbars States from doing things such as coining money, entering into \ntreaties, and keeping troops. But none of these restrictions apply to \nCongress in the exercise of its power to govern the District.\n  Proponents of this bill argue that it follows from this sweeping \npower that Congress may also grant District residents the rights of \ncitizenship in a State, including the right to congressional \nrepresentation. But this argument does not follow. Congress has some \npowers in the District that are broader than the powers of a State, but \nthis does not mean that every power of a State must also extend to the \nDistrict. States and the District of Columbia are different under the \nConstitution, and each has some rights and powers that the other lacks.\n  I note in this regard that the Senator from Connecticut quoted from \nan opinion of Justice Marshall in a very early case in which Justice \nMarshall saw a problem with the commerce clause and, because of his \nview that the District of Columbia was not equivalent to a State, \ninvited Congress to solve the problem, which, many years later, as the \nSenator noted, Congress did do. But, of course, what this case stands \nfor is the proposition that Justice Marshall, who was there at the time \nand well understood the intent of the Framers, appreciated that he \ncould not do it from the bench. He could not say that the District was \nthe same as a State and therefore he had the ability to fix the \nproblem. That had to be done in another way.\n  There is a big difference between those kinds of problems dealing \nwith adversity jurisdiction or the commerce clause, and so on, and the \nfundamental status as a political entity, which would change the \nrepresentation of the House of Representatives. Moreover, it would make \nno sense, in the same document where the Framers specifically composed \nthe House of Members of the several States and then specifically \ndesignated the District of Columbia as something other than a State, \nthat the Framers then forgot to give the District representation in the \nHouse. The Framers had the opportunity to provide the District with a \nRepresentative in the House but, of course, declined to do so.\n  The text of the Constitution on this matter is clear. It says \nCongress shall be composed of Representatives from States and States \nalone. Here is the exact wording:\n\n       The House of Representatives shall be composed of members \n     chosen every second year by the people of the several states, \n     and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications \n     requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the \n     state legislature.\n       No person shall be a Representative who shall not have \n     attained to the age of twenty five years . . . and who shall \n     not . . . be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be \n     chosen.\n\n  And finally:\n\n       [E]ach state shall have at least one Representative. When \n     vacancies happen in the Representation from any state, the \n     executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to \n     fill such vacancies.\n\n  So any act by Congress purporting to grant a seat in the House of \nRepresentatives would contradict this plain text and would be \nunconstitutional.\n  My colleague from Connecticut also noted that we have, for Americans \nresiding abroad, enabled them to vote. But, of course, it is tied to \ntheir last domestic residence to a State. It is the State to which \nthese votes go. So, even in those situations where there has been a \nneed to accommodate the fact that Americans are not all residing at \nthat moment in a State, we have tied their vote to the State from which \nthey have come.\n  I mentioned one case, but I would also like to briefly discuss some \nother cases because judicial precedent has accumulated over the years \nand strongly supports the point my colleague from Arizona makes with \nregard to the constitutionality of this legislation.\n  In Bolling v. Sharpe, the companion case to Brown v. Board of \nEducation, the U.S. Supreme Court expressly recognized that when it \ncame to the application of the fundamental constitutional principles, \nthe District could not be considered to be the same thing as a State. \nThe Bolling petitioners had challenged the constitutionality of racial \nsegregation in the DC public schools. The Court held that such \nsegregation was unconstitutional in the District, but the Bolling Court \nwas very careful to make clear that the District was not equivalent to \nthe States and not subject to the same legal strictures.\n  Brown v. Board of Education was based on the 14th amendment, which by \nits own terms applied only to the States. Because the District is not a \nState, the Bolling Court reasoned different rules had to apply to this \ncase.\n  Here is how the Court explained it:\n\n       We have this day held that the Equal Protection Clause of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the states from \n     maintaining racially segregated public schools. The legal \n     problem in the District of Columbia is somewhat different, \n     however. The Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the \n     District of Columbia, does not contain an equal protection \n     clause, as does the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies only \n     to the states.\n\n  So the Court obviously had a dilemma. It went on to reach the same \nresult as in Brown v. Board of Education and strike down racial \nsegregation, but on different grounds. It was careful to emphasize that \nthe law that applies to the District is different because the District \nis not a State.\n  Other courts have also emphasized that the District is not a State.\n  My colleague mentioned Adams v. Clinton. DC residents there argued \nthat they had a constitutional right to elect a Representative to \nCongress but the three-judge district court, examining the text and the \nhistory, determined that the District is not a State under article I, \nsection 1, and therefore the plaintiffs did not have a judicially \ncognizable right to congressional representation.\n  In another case from the DC Circuit Court, Michel v. Anderson, the \ncourt affirmed the constitutional principle that Congress cannot grant \nvoting rights to citizens of the District. The court considered \ncongressional rule changes that will allow Delegates from the District \nand U.S. territories the right to vote in committees and even the \ncommittee of the whole in the House. Some Members of Congress sued, \nclaiming these rules went too far. Although the District of Columbia \nCircuit Court upheld the new rules, it noted that the rules passed \nconstitutional muster only because they did not give the essential \nqualities of representation to the Delegates; namely, according to the \ncourt, it was acceptable to allow the Delegates to participate in \ndeliberations and secondary votes--for example, in committees and the \ncommittee of the whole--as long as their votes would not be decisive in \nthe final vote on final passage of the bill. There was a reason for \nthat. The bottom line: The District has a voting Representative in the \nHouse to the full extent that it can be granted by the Congress short \nof a constitutional amendment. At that point, for full representation \nthere would need to be a constitutional amendment.\n  In a similar vein, in United States v. Cohen, then-Judge Scalia \nexplained, again in a DC Circuit Court decision, that the District \nclause ``enables Congress to do many things in the District of Columbia \nwhich it has no authority to do in the 50 States.'' But Judge Scalia \nwent on to emphasize ``[t]hat there has never been any rule law that \nCongress must treat people in the District of Columbia exactly as \npeople are treated in the various States.''\n  Finally, in Banner v. United States, the DC Circuit, in a panel that \nincluded now-Chief Justice Roberts, rejected a constitutional challenge \nto congressional legislation that prevents the DC\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\ngovernment from imposing a ``commuter tax'' on people who work in the \nDistrict but reside in Virginia or Maryland. The Court stated that \nCongress had broad authority to legislate under the District clause but \nalso noted:\n\n       None of this is to say that Congress can legislate for the \n     District without regard to other constitutional constraints.\n\n  And of particular relevance to the present debate, the DC Circuit \npanel stated:\n\n       [T]he Constitution denies District residents voting \n     representation in Congress.\n\n  These cases are all clear, and they all reach either the same result \nor are all based upon the same reasoning. The final constitutional \nargument was also addressed by the Senator from Connecticut. This has \nto do with the 23rd amendment. Let me discuss that.\n  When Congress in the past has addressed the District's special \nstatus, it has acknowledged that status is dictated by the \nConstitution, and it recognized that a constitutional amendment was \nnecessary to change the status, as we have just seen. So when Congress \nsought to give the District a vote in Presidential elections, it passed \nthe 23rd amendment to the Constitution. When Congress dealt with this \nissue before, it dealt with it correctly. Congress does have the power \nto grant the District representation in the House if it deems that it \nis necessary and desirable. But the proper way to do this is through \nthe mechanism that the Framers provided in the Constitution: the \namendment process in article V.\n  Prior to the ratification of the 23rd amendment in 1961, District \nresidents could not choose electors for purposes of choosing the \nPresident and Vice President; but because of this amendment, District \nresidents are now able to select electors ``equal to the whole number \nof Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would \nbe entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least \npopulous State.''\n  Congress thus recognized in the 1960s that it did have the authority \nunder the District clause and without amending the Constitution to \nallow District residents to choose Presidential electors.\n  The 23rd amendment to the Constitution itself recognizes that the \nDistrict is not a State and cannot be treated as one. First, it ensures \nthat the District, even if otherwise entitled by population, may not \nappoint a number of electors greater than that of the least populous \nState. As a consequence, even if the District grew enough in population \nthat as a State it would be entitled to three Representatives and two \nSenators, let's say if a smaller State than was not entitled to three \nRepresentatives existed, the District's electors would be limited to a \nnumber equal to those of the smaller State.\n  Even under the 23rd amendment, for the purpose of selecting \nPresidential electors, the Constitution recognizes that the District is \nnot the same as a State and is not entitled to be represented in the \nNational Government in the same way.\n  So where does that leave us? What is next were we to pass this \nconstitutional amendment? There has been an argument made, I think, \nthat the proponents of this legislation would perhaps try, for example, \nto extend this to representation in the Senate as well. My colleague \nfrom Connecticut has said: No, there are totally different historical \nreasons that would not be so. I accept that there are, in fact, \nhistorical reasons that would preclude us from doing that. But I would \nalso suggest the very reasons which caused Congress, the political \nreasons which caused some in Congress to change from the previous \nposition--which has also been a constitutional amendment is required--\nto a legislative proposal here, would be very likely to occur in the \nfuture on this particular issue as well. I think the same thing could \noccur with respect to representation in territories, such as the \nTerritory of Puerto Rico, for example.\n  So if, in fact, today we say, no, that could not possibly be because \nof tradition and the historical understanding, that is not necessarily \nthe case given the fact that we have now at least some in this body who \nhave thrown over the historical tradition and case law and \nunderstanding that only by constitutional amendment could the \nConstitution--could there be an amendment to allow the District \nrepresentation.\n  So I am going to urge my colleagues to vote against the resolution. I \nam going to urge them to vote to sustain the point of order that my \ncolleague from Arizona has made. There is a constitutional issue, and \nwe need to be on record as to what we believe to be the correct \ndecision. If we believe it is constitutional, then there will be an \nopportunity to express that in this amendment. If we believe it is \nunconstitutional, we will have the opportunity to express that. Many of \nus want to express that proposition.\n  At the end of the day, however, as my friend from Connecticut has \npointed out, the ultimate resolution is not going to be what we believe \nbut, rather, what the courts say with respect to the issue. Again, for \nthat reason, it is important to have a workable, expedited procedure \nfor resolution of this issue in the courts. And I am hopeful we can \nachieve that in the legislation, even should the legislation pass over \nthe objections of those of us who disagree with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I so yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the distinguished Chairman I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate now considers a bill to provide \nvoting rights to citizens of the Nation's Capital city. I am proud to \ncosponsor the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009. \nThis important legislation would end over 200 years of unfair treatment \nto nearly 600,000 Americans living in the District of Columbia, a \npopulation roughly equal to the size of Vermont, and give them a vote \nin the House of Representatives. Earlier this week, the Senate finally \nbroke through the Republican filibuster of this legislation that \nstalled its consideration in the last Congress. That filibuster \nprevented its passage, despite the bipartisan support of 57 Senators, a \nmajority of the Senate. The vote earlier this week to overcome that \nfilibuster is an encouraging step toward guaranteeing all citizens \nrepresentation in our Government.\n  Last Congress, President Bush threatened to veto this bill. This \ntime, when the Congress passes this bill, I am confident President \nObama, who cosponsored and voted for the bill when serving in this body \nas a Senator from Illinois, will sign it into law.\n  I commend Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and Senator Hatch for \nhaving worked out a voting rights bill for the District of Columbia \nthat can and should pass with bipartisan support. The bill we consider \ntoday would give the District of Columbia delegate a vote in the House \nof Representatives. To remove partisan political opposition, it accords \nUtah an additional vote in the House, as well.\n  As a young lawyer, Congresswoman Norton worked for civil rights and \nvoting rights around the country. It is a cruel irony that as the \nDistrict of Columbia's longtime representative in Congress, she still \ndoes not yet have the right to vote. She is a strong voice in Congress, \nbut the citizens living in the Nation's Capital deserve her vote on \ntheir behalf to count.\n  I believe this legislation is within congressional power as provided \nin the Constitution. This is not a partisan conclusion. Lawyers from \nacross the political spectrum, from Judge Patricia Wald to Kenneth \nStarr and former Assistant Attorney General Viet Dinh, agree that this \naction is constitutional. After careful study, we have all concluded \nthat Congress has the constitutional authority to grant voting rights \nin the House of Representatives to the representative of the citizens \nof the District of Columbia.\n  Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this issue, \nand heard compelling testimony from constitutional experts that such a \nbill is constitutional. They highlighted the fact that Congress's \ngreater power to confer statehood on the District certainly encompasses \nthe lesser action to\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\ngrant District residents voting rights in the House of Representatives.\n  Moreover, Congress has often treated the District of Columbia as a \n``State'' for a variety of purposes. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes \nNorton reminded us that ``Congress has not had the slightest difficulty \nin treating the District as a State, with its laws, its treaties, and \nfor constitutional purposes.''\n  Examples of these actions include a revision of the Judiciary Act of \n1789 that broadened Article III diversity jurisdiction to include \ncitizens of the District, even though the Constitution expressly \nprovides that Federal courts may hear cases ``between citizens of \ndifferent States.'' Congress has also treated the District as a \n``State'' for purposes of congressional power to regulate commerce \n``among the several States.''\n  The sixteenth amendment, the Federal income tax amendment, grants \nCongress the power directly to tax incomes ``without apportionment \namong the several States'' and that taxing power has been interpreted \nto apply to residents of the District. The District of Columbia car \nlicense plates or tags remind us every day that District residents \nsuffer from ``Taxation Without Representation,'' a battle cry during \nthe founding days of this Republic.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans residing in the District of \nColumbia are required to pay Federal taxes. In fact, the District of \nColumbia residents pay the second highest Federal taxes per capita in \nthe Nation, yet residents have no say in how those dollars are spent. \nWe must also remember that many who serve bravely in our armed services \ncome from the District of Columbia. The brave men and women who defend \nour values and freedoms abroad must also enjoy those same rights here \nat home.\n  Opponents of this bill claim that the citizens of the District of \nColumbia do indeed have representation, that they fall under the \njurisdiction of all 100 Senators and 435 Representatives and are \nsufficiently provided for by Congress. To that argument I say that \nthere is no substitute for direct representation in Congress. How many \nof us in either party would be willing to go back to our State and say \n``You do not need your representatives because other States are going \nto represent you?'' I do not believe that would go over well in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. Chairman Lieberman knows that would not \ngo over well in his State of Connecticut. I guarantee you that would \nnot go over well in the State of Vermont. Similarly, the citizens of \nthe District of Columbia also deserve the chance to elect a \nrepresentative who has not only a voice in Congress, but a vote as \nwell.\n  Over 50 years ago, after overcoming filibusters and obstruction, the \nSenate rightfully passed the Civil Rights Act in 1957 and the Voting \nRights Act in 1965. Let us build on that tradition and extend the reach \nand resolve of America's representative democracy. I am pleased that we \ntook the first step in overcoming the filibuster of this legislation, \nand I urge all Senators to support the final passage of this bill \nwithout further delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote on \nthe McCain constitutional point of order occur at 2 p.m. today; that \nthe 10 minutes immediately prior to the vote be equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators McCain and myself or our designees; and \nthat no amendments or motions be in order to the constitutional point \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 574\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto consider an amendment at the desk and that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 574.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for expedited judicial review for Members of \n                               Congress)\n\n       On page 27, strike line 21 through the end of the bill and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8.

Mr. President, I understand this amendment has been cleared \non both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will not object. I just wish to say \nthis amendment is supported not only by myself but the majority leader. \nIt adds language to the bill. It is similar language that was in the \nso-called McCain-Feingold bill. So we support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 574) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KYL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, while we are here debating the \nconstitutional implications of this bill, I want to take this time to \ndiscuss a 30-year constitutional injustice happening right here in \nWashington, DC.\n  On June 26 of last year, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling \naffirming the second amendment right to bear arms as an individual and \nconstitutionally protected right. In District of Columbia v. Heller, \nthe Court\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\naffirmed that the District of Columbia's ban on ownership of handguns \nwas an unconstitutional restriction on that right. Prior to this \ndecision, Washington, DC, had enforced the most prohibitive gun control \nlaws of any city in the nation. Not only did the District prohibit \nownership of handguns, it also required that allowed firearms, such as \nrifles and shotguns, be ``unloaded and disassembled'' or ``bound by a \ntrigger lock.''\n  Millions of Americans were supportive of Mr. Heller, who was simply \nwishing to excise his constitutional right to protect himself. \nRecognizing the District's restrictions were not only unreasonable but \nalso unconstitutional, the majority of the Supreme Court held that \n``the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the \nSecond Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful \nfirearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-\ndefense.''\n  Despite the Court's ruling in June, the District of Columbia City \nCouncil has continued to exact onerous and unconstitutional firearm \nregulations on law-abiding residents.\n  In response to the District's obstruction of the text and spirit of \nthe Court's decision, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6842, \nthe National Capital Security and Safety Act. Last year, almost half \nthis body joined me in a letter to the majority leader urging prompt \nconsideration of this bill, which was denied and the bill died. That \nbill would have unequivocally restored the Second Amendment rights of \nthe District residents, and that is why I offer this updated bill as an \namendment to S. 160 and encourage my Senate colleagues to join me to \naddress this real injustice.\n  Mr. President, the residents of the District have waited long enough, \nand it is time for us to ensure that they realize their constitutional \nright to bear arms. We must pass this amendment so the Second Amendment \nrights of the citizens of DC are protected.\n  This amendment is substantively identical to the bipartisan \ncompromise that passed the House last year, with the exception that it \nrepeals the 2008 DC anti-gun law that was enacted in the interim, and \nthe inclusion of a severability clause. As I said, these are merely \ntechnical changes to this widely supported bill that 47 of my \ncolleagues supported in a letter to the Democratic leader in the 110th \nCongress and two of our new Senate colleagues voted for while they were \nin the House, when it passed by a vote of 266 to 152 including 85 \nDemocrats.\n  These changes were necessary to guarantee the second amendment rights \nto DC residents are adequately protected. Instead of abdicating our \nconstitutional duties as a co-equal branch of Government, we should \nenact legislation such as my amendment, to defend and protect the \nconstitutional rights of American citizens. It is high time we address \nthis real constitutional injustice and adopt my amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is high time that we address this real \nconstitutional injustice and pass my amendment. According to the Census \nBureau, Washington, DC, is the 27th largest city, with close to 600,000 \nresidents. Similarly large cities, however, have not enacted comparably \nrestrictive gun laws. For example, both Las Vegas proper and the \nDistrict of Columbia are cities with populations between 500,000 and \n600,000 residents. According to the Census Bureau, in 2007, Las Vegas \nwithout incorporated areas, was the 28th largest city, just behind DC. \nThese cities, however, have very different gun-control laws.\n  According to FBI Criminal Justice Information Service Division, in \n2007, the murder and non-negligent manslaughter rates were higher in DC \nthan Las Vegas, including all the incorporated areas. When you include \nthe incorporated areas, this more than doubles the population count in \nLas Vegas. In fact, if you total all the population of Nevada, DC still \nwould reigns in this category. Can you honestly tell me gun control in \nDC has been effective?\n  According to the FBI, murder rates in the United States peaked at \naround 10.2 per 100,000 persons in 1980. Despite the strictest gun ban \nin the country, however, murder rates in the District continued to \nclimb well into the 1980s and 1990s, peaking in 1996 at about 80.6 per \n100,000--nearly 8 times the average of what the rest of the United \nStates had experienced.\n  Since then, the murder rate in DC has declined somewhat and is now \nfairly level, following a national trend of decreasing violence. As \nthis chart shows, however, the murder rate in DC still remains over 250 \npercent higher relative to the 48 largest cities in America.\n  Law-abiding, Nevada residents only need to register handguns if they \nlive in Clark County, the home of Las Vegas. And then, to do so, they \nsimply bring an unloaded handgun to any police substation--unlike the \nDistrict of Columbia's single location--where they receive a cursory \nbackground check and are given a gun registration card. There are no \nfees or other onerous hurdles to infringe on the Second Amendment \nrights of law-abiding citizens.\n  The DC gun registration laws for lawfully permitted firearms are even \nmore restrictive than Nevada laws for concealed-carry permits. Yet, I \nrepeat, even with a gun ban, DC crime rates are significantly higher. \nDisarming the law-abiding residents of DC has made them easy prey for \ncriminals to target. Furthermore, most criminals who use guns get them \nthrough unregulated channels. According to the Bureau of Justice \nstatistics, most criminals get guns via theft or the black market. \nAccording to the ATF, almost 90 percent are acquired through \nunregulated channels, and the median time between a gun's acquisition \nand its use in a crime is over 6 years.\n  Mr. President, it is high time we address this real constitutional \ninjustice and let DC citizens lawfully defend themselves. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment to protect the Second Amendment \nrights of DC residents.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleague \nfrom Nevada for bringing up this very important issue. Those of us who \nare strong supporters of second amendment rights clearly are looking at \nthis issue and appreciate his leadership.\n  Earlier this morning, the Senator from Arizona raised a \nconstitutional point of order as it relates to the bill before us, S. \n160. I have to admit, I kind of took a step back and said: Well, a \nconstitutional point of order--I am not sure I am familiar with that. \nSo we went to Riddick's, which is our encyclopedia of Senate \nprecedents, and looked up ``constitutional point of order'' and some of \nthe history there.\n  I was surprised to find that a constitutional point of order was \nraised during the consideration of the Alaska statehood bill.\n  I have had an opportunity on the floor, throughout this past year, to \nremind all my colleagues that this year is the 50th anniversary of \nAlaska's statehood and some of the debate that took place on the floor \nof the Senate and the process that we as a State took to gain \nstatehood.\n  I pulled up the Congressional Record from this debate on the \nconstitutional point of order. It is quite interesting, quite \nfascinating, from Alaska's perspective, because the point of order that \nwas being discussed was whether section 10 of the Alaska Statehood Act \nviolated the requirement that States come into the Union on equal \nfooting.\n  The argument that was made at the time was that half of Alaska's \nterritory would be withdrawn by the federal government, depriving the \nproposed State of Alaska at the time the power to have a uniform system \nof taxation. Alaska's experience seeking voting representation in \nCongress explains why I have taken such great interest in the debate \nover representation for the District of Columbia.\n  In Alaska, it was a huge fight--a huge fight--as to whether we should \nbecome a State. My grandparents on both sides were involved in the \ndebate at the time. It was a fight to gain control of our resources. It \nwas a fight to determine who had control of our fish. As Alaska \nobserves the 50th anniversary of its admission to statehood I reflect \nback on our fight for voting representation in Congress. This is why I \nbelieve it is so important for the people of Alaska to have voting \nrepresentation in the House of Representatives.\n  I appreciate the pleas of the people of the District of Columbia, the \nresidents\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\nof this very small area, for voting representation within the Congress \nbecause it was not too long ago those same cries were being heard back \nin Alaska. You have to give the District of Columbia government credit \nfor a pretty effective lobbying campaign. I do not know of any other \nplace that has used their license plates to tell the rest of the \ncountry what it is they are asking for: no taxation without \nrepresentation.\n  There are significant differences between Alaska's fight for \nstatehood and the cause of representation in the House for Washington, \nDC. Alaska, 50 years ago, was a territory. The District of Columbia is \na different entity, a federal enclave created by our Constitution. Our \nConstitution makes it clear that they are not a State. However, I \nsupported cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 160 yesterday because \nI believed it was important that we have this debate on the floor of \nthe Senate and that we hear the perspectives being presented, whether \nit is from the Senator from Connecticut or the Senators from Arizona, \nand to allow this issue, which is so important to some 600,000 people, \nto be debated. I represent a State of just a little over 600,000.\n\n  It was back in 1960, June 17, that the Congress approved and sent to \nthe States for ratification the 23rd amendment. It was the 23rd \namendment that extended to the people of the District of Columbia \nrepresentation in the electoral college. It was 285 days later that the \n23rd amendment was ratified by the States. That ratification settled \nthe question of whether the people of the District of Columbia should \nhave the right to vote for President, and it settled that question \nabsolutely conclusively, by way of amendment to our U.S. Constitution.\n  I believe the people of the District of Columbia have been without \nrepresentation in the Congress for too long. I have strongly supported \nthe view that the people of the District should have voting \nrepresentation in the House of Representatives, but what we have before \nus today, S. 160, does not conclusively resolve the question of whether \nthey will.\n  We know the question of whether Congress may, by legislation, grant \nthe District of Columbia a vote in the House of Representatives has \nbeen a matter of spirited debate not only here on this floor but with \nconstitutional scholars on all sides of the issue. It was our assistant \nmajority leader yesterday who observed that S. 160 has attracted--I \nthink the words were some strange bedfellows amongst the community of \nconstitutional scholars. We have very distinguished individuals such as \nKen Starr and Viet Dinh who suggest that, in fact, S. 160 is \nconstitutional. On the other side, we have an extremely well-respected \ngentleman, Jonathan Turley, who has testified that despite the best of \nmotivations, S. 160 is fundamentally flawed on a constitutional level \nand would only serve to delay true reform for District residents. His \nconclusion is that this legislation is facially unconstitutional.\n  We also have a review by our nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService, their assessment and their analysis, and they, too, cast doubt \non the constitutionality of S. 160. Their report, dated February 17, \n2009, states:\n\n       Although not beyond question, it would appear likely that \n     Congress does not have the authority to grant voting \n     representation in the House of Representatives to the \n     District of Columbia.\n\n  So the key point here is this: I believe the District of Columbia \ndeserves representation in the House of Representatives, but S. 160 \ndoes not conclusively resolve the question of whether they will get it.\n  I think we have heard on this floor that this is going to lead to \nlitigation. The issue, of course, is how do we interpret article I, \nsection 2, of the Constitution, which says:\n\n       The House of Representatives shall be composed of members \n     chosen . . . by the people of the several States.\n\n  I don't think there is any dispute amongst the constitutional \nscholars who are out there that the District of Columbia is not a State \nfor the purposes of article I, section 2. If the courts shall conclude \nthat article I, section 2, of the Constitution means what it says--that \nonly the people of the several States can send voting Representatives \nto the House--then basically we start all over. We start all over. We \nstart anew with a constitutional amendment on DC representation.\n  So I would suggest to the body that what we are engaging in today is \nalmost a cruel hoax because what we are doing is we are delaying the \nend of taxation without representation for several more years. What we \nare doing is getting this into the courts. Is that what the people of \nthe District are really seeking?\n  I think 49 years ago the Congress understood what we needed to do in \norder to provide clarity and to conclusively resolve the issue of the \nDistrict of Columbia with the 23rd amendment. We knew the way to handle \nit was to give the people of the District of Columbia a voice in the \nselection of the President and Vice President, and the route they chose \nto take was the route of a constitutional amendment. They knew then \nthat was the proper route to take, and I would suggest that today it is \nthe proper route to take to provide for this. This Senator believes \nthat is what we owe to the people of the District of Columbia, to get \nit right the first time. Let's resolve this. A constitutional amendment \npassed by the Congress, ratified by the States, settles the matter of \nDC representation conclusively, and S. 160 doesn't.\n  Now, we know the history on this. This was tried once before. A \nconstitutional amendment was adopted by two-thirds of both bodies and \nsent to the States for ratification. Unfortunately, only 16 States \nchose to ratify within that 7-year period. So we basically come back to \nstart over. I would suggest that is the method and manner we need to \napproach as we try to provide representation for the 600,000 people who \nare residents of the District of Columbia.\n  I am prepared to support a constitutional amendment and to work for \nits ratification, and I intend to introduce that constitutional \namendment today. It will not be part of S. 160. A constitutional \namendment is a different process, one that is done through joint \nresolution as opposed to a Senate measure or a House measure. I believe \namending our Constitution will provide justice for the people of the \nDistrict of Columbia, and I look forward to working toward that end.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 576 to Amendment No. 575\n\n    (Purpose: To restore Second Amendment rights in the District of \n                               Columbia)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment 575 offered by the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to offer a \nperfecting second-degree amendment to Senator Ensign's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 576 to amendment No. 575.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is simply a perfecting amendment to \nchange the date of the actual enactment of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for a few moments on the underlying \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will do that for a very short period of time.\n  We have heard a lot about the constitutionality of this, but I think \nthere is an important point that has not been raised, and I would take \nexception to the fact that this is not a partisan debate. This is about \nwhether we really follow this wonderful little document each of us in \nthis Chamber has sworn an allegiance to and what it says.\n\n  I wish to quote a legal scholar because I think it leads to a lot of \ncommon sense. Here is the quote:\n\n       It would be ridiculous to suggest that the delegates to the \n     Constitutional Convention or ratification conventions would \n     have worked out such specific and exacting rules for the \n     composition of Congress, only to give the majority of \n     Congress the right to create\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\n     a new form of voting members from federal enclaves like the \n     District. It would have constituted the realization of the \n     worst fears for many delegates, particularly the Anti-\n     Federalists, to have an open-ended ability of the majority to \n     manipulate the rolls of Congress and to use areas under the \n     exclusive control of the Federal Government as the source for \n     new voting Members.\n\n  I have no doubt that if this present bill is passed, it will be found \nunconstitutional. As my colleague from Alaska stated earlier, if what \nwe want to do is change the Constitution, the way to do that is through \na constitutional amendment and a joint resolution.\n  So there is no question that people who are taxed have the right to \nrepresentation, but there is another way to solve that. The best way to \nsolve it is to eliminate the tax on the citizens of the District of \nColumbia. I will be offering an amendment this afternoon that will do \njust that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is a distressing situation where, \nfor some reason, we have abandoned the knowledge we gained in 1977 that \nit takes a constitutional amendment to get representation in the \nCongress for the District of Columbia. There is so much in the \nConstitution that refers to this, but article I--the very first \narticle--section 2, says the House of Representatives--that is what we \nare talking about: giving a Member of the House a vote for the District \nof Columbia--shall be composed of Members ``chosen every second year by \nthe people of the several States.'' It goes on to say that the \nrequirements of a Representative are that they should be--they must be, \nwhen elected, ``an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be \nchosen.'' The Senate--discussed in section 3--of the United States \n``shall be composed of two Senators from each State.''\n  So I know there is politics here, and I hope when the Supreme Court \nreads this debate they look right through it because I don't think it \nis a sound position we are dealing with. I believe Senator McCain has \nrightly raised a point of order as to the constitutionality of this \nbill.\n  I wish to make some general remarks.\n  I think the legislation is an affront to the Constitution. Professor \nJonathan Turley, one of the liberal outstanding scholars of the law, \nwho has testified before our committee a number of times, testified \nbefore the House Judiciary Committee recently--this is the language he \nused, and I am sure he would consider himself a Democrat. He said he \nconsiders this bill to be ``one of the most premeditated \nunconstitutional acts by Congress in decades.''\n  Congress cannot, consistent with the Constitution, pass a bill that \ngives congressional voting rights to a non-state without violating the \nplain text of the Constitution. The Framers of our Constitution \nenvisioned a Federal city that would not be beholden to any State \ngovernment. The text of the Constitution does not provide anywhere that \na non-state may have a congressional voting Member. Also, the District \nof Columbia is not a forgotten city. In fact, it receives more Federal \ndollars, per capita, than any State in the United States.\n  History is clear that the Framers excluded the District of Columbia \nfrom having direct congressional representation. Our Founders could \nhave placed the seat of the Federal Government within a State--and that \nwas discussed--thus ensuring direct congressional representation from \nthat city, but they chose not to do so. As James Madison stated in \nFederalist No. 43, there was fear that the State that encompassed the \nNation's Capital would have too much influence over Congress. It has a \nlot now. The Framers feared that, symbolically, the honor given to one \nState would create ``an imputation of awe and influence'' as compared \nto other States. That is, that the State would have an advantage in \nsome fashion.\n  Thus, when the Framers of our Constitution considered carefully how \nto treat the Nation's Capital, they provided in the District clause--\narticle I, section 8, clause 17, of the Constitution--that Congress had \nthe power to ``exercise exclusive Legislation in all cases whatsoever, \nover such District.''\n  So it gave Congress the legislative power over the District, clearly. \nCongress was, of course, made up of Representatives from States. This \nmeant that residents of the District would not have direct \nrepresentation in Congress--they understood that, clearly, from the \nbeginning and, indeed, they have never had it--but instead, they would \nhave indirect representation and that such direct representation was \nreserved only for the residents of States.\n  Second, this bill violates the plain text of the Constitution, as I \nnoted. Article 1, section 2 says ``each State shall have at least one \nrepresentative.'' Further, one of the qualifications to be a \nCongressman is to ``be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be \nchosen.'' As George Smith, the former senior counsel at the Department \nof Justice's Office of Legal Counsel recently wrote and was published: \n``All told, no fewer than 11 constitutional provisions make it clear \nthat congressional representation is linked inextricably to \nstatehood.''\n  Congress has recognized this fact in years past. In 1977, Congress \npassed a constitutional amendment, which was never ratified by the \nStates, but we passed it. It was a constitutional amendment that would \nhave given the D.C. residents congressional representation. I suppose \nthat was then and this is now. Now we are just going to pass a law that \ndoesn't have to have a supermajority in Congress or be ratified by the \nStates. That is a lot easier to do. I remind my colleagues that while \npolitical winds may change, the plain text of the Constitution doesn't. \nThe Constitution says only States may have congressional \nrepresentation, and no bill, no mere congressional legislation, no law \nwe pass can change that fact. The Constitution is the supreme law of \nthe land. Our legislation can't alter the constitutional requirements. \nWe can alter the Constitution through the amendment process, as has \nbeen previously done, to fix this very problem.\n  Alexander Hamilton, many years ago, wrote:\n\n       The qualifications of the persons who may . . . be chosen, \n     are defined and fixed in the Constitution, and are \n     unalterable by the legislature.\n\n  Finally, the District is not, as I said, forgotten. Its residents \nhave indirect representation. All 435 Members of the Congress travel in \nthe traffic here, go in and out of the city, and 100 Senators likewise \ndo the same. They have done pretty well by way of getting money out of \nthe Federal Government.\n  One of the Framers' concerns, which Madison articulated, was a fear \nthat the ``host'' State would benefit too much from ``the gradual \naccumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the \nGovernment.'' According to the most recent data available, as of 2005, \nthe District of Columbia taxpayers received more in Federal funding per \ndollar of Federal taxes paid than any of the 50 States. According to \nthe Tax Foundation, for every $1 of Federal tax paid in 2005 by the \nDistrict of Columbia citizens, they received approximately $5.55 in \nFederal spending. This ranks the District the highest nationally by a \nwide margin. For example, New Mexico, which is perceived to be the most \nbenefitted State, received $2.03 in Federal spending per $1 of tax \npayments their citizens made. But even that amount is $3.52 less than \nwhat the citizens of D.C. receive. Perhaps, some would say Madison's \nfear has become a reality, with all the jobs that are here and paying \ngood wages--how many of us would love to carve out some of these \nagencies and have them be settled in Birmingham or Baltimore or New \nYork? Then that tax revenue would be spent in our States. But it is \nbeing spent here.\n  I am just saying I don't believe the District of Columbia is being \nabused. In fact, they are doing pretty well with taxpayers' money all \nin all. I know the argument that you don't collect property tax on \nGovernment property and everything, but they are doing pretty well \nunder any fair analysis.\n  The Framers envisioned a Federal district serving as the National \nGovernment's home. That district was not to be a State, and the \nDistrict of Columbia was never to be treated as a State. Granting a \nnon-state congressional representation and voting rights in the \nCongress of the United States violates the Framers' intent, pretty \nclearly, and the plain language of the Constitution. Congress, as \nProfessor Turley notes, ``cannot legislatively amend the Constitution \nby re-defining\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\na voting member of [the House of Representatives].''\n  We have all sworn to uphold the Constitution and to defend it. As \nwritten, this bill violates the Constitution and it will, I predict, be \nstruck down by the Court. I think it is going to come back from the \nCourt like a rubber ball off that wall. If it doesn't, we are going to \nlearn something about the Supreme Court of the United States--something \nwe don't want to know. I submit that we cannot in good faith vote for \nthis bill without conflicting with our oath to the Constitution. So \nthat is why I cannot support it.\n  I would just point out a recent case decided November 4, 2005, in the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The panel consisted \nof now-Chief Justice John Roberts; Judge Harry Edwards, appointed by \nPresident Carter; and Judith Rogers, appointed by President Clinton, \nfor whatever that is worth. I hate to even say that because we expect \nour judges to put away partisan activities when they put their robes \non. So that is just background.\n  Basically, the court dealt with an argument over taxes. As part of \ntheir holding--it is a per curiam opinion; no one judge was considered \nto be the author. They all agreed to this language. They said:\n\n       Congress, when it legislates for the District, stands in \n     the same relation to District residents as a state \n     legislature does to the residents of its own State.\n\n  So we stand in the same position to the people of D.C., as set up by \nour Founders, as the State legislatures do to the people of the States. \nThe court also noted:\n\n       Not only may statutes of Congress or otherwise national \n     application be applied to the District of Columbia--\n\n  That is the tax laws--\n\n       but Congress may also exercise all the police and \n     regulatory powers which a state legislature or municipal \n     government would have in legislating for state or local \n     purposes.\n\n  Then the court said:\n\n       This is true notwithstanding that the Constitution denies \n     District residents voting representation in Congress.\n\n  So this panel, in 2005, concluded--all three judges--that the \nConstitution denies District residents voting representation in \nCongress.\n  I am not personally of the view that people who voluntarily live \nwithin the borders of the District of Columbia have to have direct \ncongressional representation. I guess it is a matter that we can \ndiscuss and debate. Arguments on both sides can be made. I simply say \nthe matter is conclusively decided by the plain language of the \nConstitution.\n  As Mr. Smith says, 11 different places in the Constitution say that \nrepresentation in Congress must come from States. It does not come from \ndistricts. It does not come from territories. It does not come from \ntribal areas. It comes from States.\n  If we would like to change it, maybe we can, but we are bound by the \nlaws and our Constitution, and a mere statutory act of this Congress is \nnot able to reverse the Constitution. Therefore, I will object to the \npassage of this legislation. I think it is incorrect. I will support \nMr. McCain's constitutional point of order because I see no other \nrational conclusion.\n  As shown by a recent opinion from the District Court of the District \nof Columbia in 2005, the Constitution does not give congressional \nvoting rights to residents of the District of Columbia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in support of the DC Voting \nRights Act. I rise from a new seat, a new chair in the Senate. My desk \nis now moved to the center aisle. I rise from this desk for the very \nfirst time to speak about a new opportunity to expand democracy. That \nis what the DC Voting Rights Act is--it is about democracy, about \nfairness, and about empowerment.\n  The DC Voting Rights Act simply gives the District Representative \nfull voting rights in the U.S. House of Representatives. I also want to \npoint out to my colleagues that this is not only about the District of \nColumbia, but this is also about Utah. What this legislation does, in a \nsense of fairness and parity, is grant a seat to the District of \nColumbia and an additional seat to Utah. What we are doing is trying to \nadjust, without amending the Constitution, wrongs that need to be \nrighted. The DC Voting Rights Act gives the District Representative \nfull voting rights in the House of Representatives.\n  Right now, the District of Columbia is represented--and I might add \nvery ably--by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, a distinguished \npublic servant. She is called a Delegate to Congress. We call her \nCongresswoman. When she moves around her great area, she is also called \nthat. What is she allowed to do? One, she is able to have a voice. That \nis important. So the people of DC do have a voice. But in Congress, a \nvoice also usually means a vote. That is where it doesn't work the way \nwe think it should. She is able to vote in her committee, but she is \nnot able to vote on the House floor. We think that is wrong. We think \nshe should have a voice and we think she should have a vote.\n  The residents of the District of Columbia are the only residents in a \ndemocratic country in the capital city who do not have a vote in \ndetermining the fate and direction of the Nation.\n  What we have essentially done is disempower the over 600,000 \nresidents of the District of Columbia. Yet we do not disempower them \nwhen we call them to serve for war. The District of Columbia, through \nits National Guard, has served ably and willingly. Yet even though they \ngo to fight for the entire United States of America and they are sent \nto war by the Congress of the United States, they have no voice, no \nvote in the direction of their own country. This is not right.\n  DC residents go by the same rules and laws as the United States of \nAmerica. They pay taxes. They pay, by the way, Federal taxes because \nthey see themselves as part of the Federal Government. But the Federal \nGovernment does not see that they have full representation. I wish \nsometime we could have those DC residents who fought in wars in the \nbalconies. They fought through the National Guard, and they fought \nthrough the regular military. They have fought and they have died, most \nrecently in Iraq and Afghanistan. But when they come home, they are \ntreated like second-class citizens. I don't think that is right.\n  I also happen to believe if you pay taxes--there was a famous patriot \nwho said: If you pay taxes, you should have representation. If it was \ngood enough for Patrick Henry and Patrick Kennedy, it should be good \nfor us. If you pay taxes to the Federal Government, your representative \nshould have a vote in the Congress of the United States. That is what \nwe want to do today.\n  When we think about all the major issues that are debated in \nCongress--the economy, health care, education, the direction of our \nnational security--these issues affect the residents of the District of \nColumbia the same way they affect Maryland or Virginia or Texas or \nAlabama or North Carolina. Yet the DC residents do not have a vote on \nthese issues.\n  How would you feel, Madam President, if you did not have anyone \nrepresenting you on those issues or if your Congresspeople could have a \nvoice but not a vote? I think the District of Columbia deserves this, \nand they have been waiting a very long time. The District of Columbia \nhas been waiting for this for 200 years.\n  Last year when we tried, we fell three votes short. But we are in a \nnew day in Washington, and I hope this new day will be new democracy, \nthe expansion of democracy. We love to expand democracy around the \nworld. Let's expand democracy to the District of Columbia.\n  The District of Columbia has been made the target of congressional \npet projects. We often shove ideas at them. We undo what they often \nwant to pass for themselves. We think they should be able to have a \nvote to exercise the direction both for themselves and for the Nation.\n  Currently, DC residents are represented by a delegate. This would \ngive full voting power in the House of Representatives. It would give \nUtah one additional representative. This solution is fair, it is \nnonpartisan, and it will enfranchise 600,000 District of Columbia \nresidents and also enfranchise the State of Utah to have one additional \nrepresentative that they barely missed in a census that was flawed in \nmany ways.\n  I stand today as a friend and neighbor to the people of the District \nof Columbia. We in Maryland live next door\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nto the District. Many of the constituents I represent, the sons and \ndaughters live in Maryland, the moms and dads continue to live in the \nDistrict of Columbia. I know their fierce devotion to this country, the \nfact that they are proud to be residents of the Capital of the United \nStates of America. They love doing their duty by participating in their \ncommunity, by paying their taxes, and going to war, if necessary. But \nthey believe participation and taxation should have representation. I \nbelieve like they do; we should give it to them and give it to them \nthis week in this Senate. The time is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, when we are sworn in to the Senate, we \nraise our right hand, put our left hand on the Bible, and swear to \nuphold the Constitution and laws of the United States. That is why I am \nvery troubled and concerned that those of us who have taken that sacred \noath to uphold the Constitution would, in fact, purport to violate the \nConstitution by passage of S. 160, the DC voting rights bill.\n  This bill, at various times, has been called the DC voting rights \nbill; at other times it has been called the DC statehood bill. Of \ncourse, DC is not a State, but DC would have to be a State under the \nConstitution to get the voting Member of the Congress for which the \nproponents of this legislation are calling.\n  By the way, if DC is a State for the purpose of creating a district \nfor a Member of Congress, why would not DC be a State for the purpose \nof having two U.S. Senators? Of course, even the proponents of this \nlegislation know that would be a bridge too far, but this is the first \nincremental step to considering the District of Columbia as a State \nentitled, they say, to a Member of Congress, as well as two Members of \nthe Senate.\n  I believe this legislation is unconstitutional. There is a \nconstitutional way to do it, but the proponents of this result have \nfound that to be a tough row to hoe, to pass a constitutional \namendment. So now they have come back trying to do it the so-called \neasy way but in a way that violates the Constitution and, I would say, \ncannot be reconciled with the oath that each of us takes.\n  I know it is common to say the courts will fix it. We ourselves have \na duty to pass only legislation that we believe is truly \nconstitutional. For us to say we have the votes now, as some of my \ncolleagues have indicated, we have the votes to do it, but let's not \npay attention to the constitutionality of it I think is a very serious \nmistake.\n  We all sympathize with the desire of the residents of the District of \nColumbia to be represented in Congress. But as I said, there are \nconstitutional ways to do this, and this legislation is not a \nconstitutional way to accomplish that goal.\n  I don't know how the constitutional limitation or, indeed, the \nprohibition to passing this legislation and expecting it to be enforced \ncould be more plain. Of course, the Constitution in article I, section \n2, limits House seats to States alone. The District of Columbia is not \na State and, therefore, the District of Columbia may not have a House \ndistrict and be represented by a voting Member of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I am not asking anybody to take my word for it. Let's just look at \nthe text of the Constitution.\n  The text of the Constitution repeatedly and clearly limits \nrepresentation in the House of Representatives to the States. The \napportionment of Representatives is governed by section 2 of the 14th \namendment, which provides: ``Representatives shall be apportioned among \nthe several States.''\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, article I, section 2, of the \nConstitution establishes the House of Representatives and governs its \nmembership. Each of that section's first four clauses specifies \nStates--not cities, not the District of Columbia--as those entities \nthat are entitled to representation in the House.\n  The first clause provides that Representatives are chosen ``by the \nPeople of the several States.''\n  The second clause provides that a Representative must be ``an \ninhabitant of the State in which he [or she] shall be chosen.''\n  The third clause says that ``each State shall have at least one \nRepresentative.''\n  The fourth clause specifies that ``when vacancies happen in the \nRepresentation from any State,'' the Governor of that State shall call \nan election.\n  Article I, section 4, of the U.S. Constitution provides that rules \nfor the elections of House Members ``shall be prescribed in each State \nby the Legislature thereof. . . .''\n  Just as the text of the U.S. Constitution makes plain that only \nStates are to be represented in the House of Representatives, it is \nequally clear the District of Columbia is not a State for purposes of \nsuch representation.\n  Article I, section 8, of the Constitution specifies that the Federal \nGovernment ``District,'' the District of Columbia, was to be formed \n``by Cession of particular States.'' This provision distinguishes \nbetween States and the Federal District in which we are presently \nlocated formed by cession of the States.\n  If that is not enough--the plain text of the Constitution--then I \nthink all we need to do is look back at the 23rd amendment of the \nConstitution, where the proponents of this result actually tried to do \nit the right way. The 23rd amendment to the Constitution, which granted \nthe District of Columbia Presidential electors, gives the District of \nColumbia the number of electors it would be entitled to if it were a \nState. This constitutional text presupposes that the District is not a \nState, as that term is used in the Constitution, for purposes of \napportioning Representatives, Senators, and electors.\n  In short, the text of the Constitution could not be clearer, that \nMembers of Congress are to be elected only from States and that the \nDistrict of Columbia is not a State.\n  One may be asking why would we be having this debate 230-something \nyears since this country was founded. It has been understood and, \nindeed, has been the uninterrupted practice and precedent of our \nRepublic that people have regarded the District of Columbia not as a \nState and not entitled to a Member of the House. Otherwise, why would \nthis just be coming up now? From the founding until recently, the \nevidence shows it was understood that a constitutional amendment would \nbe required to give the District a voting seat in Congress. Of course, \nsince the founding, the District has never been granted a voting seat \nin Congress. Representation has been apportioned in accordance with the \nconstitutional provisions I have cited every 10 years since 1790. In \nother words, every 10 years we have a census, and every 10 years \nCongress apportions seats in accordance with these constitutional \nprovisions, every 10 years since 1790. Never in the history of this \ncountry has a Congress or a President acted on the belief or on the \ntheory that they had the power somehow to apportion a Representative to \nthe District of Columbia.\n  Indeed, the Framers of the 23rd amendment clearly thought that \ngranting the District Presidential electors, as I mentioned a moment \nago, required a constitutional amendment. Similarly, in 1977, Congress \npassed a constitutional amendment that would actually have given the \nDistrict residents what they seek by this act of legislation. At least \nat that time, the consensus of Congress was a constitutional amendment \nwas required.\n  If the Framers of the 23rd amendment or the authors of the DC voting \nrights amendment believed they could have achieved their ends by mere \nlegislation alone without submitting themselves to the admittedly \ndifficult process of constitutional amendment, don't you think they \nwould have done so? Clearly, they would have done so.\n  Furthermore, the Federal courts have long interpreted the word \n``State'' in section 1 of the 14th amendment to exclude the District of \nColumbia. Thus, due process, equal protection, and other constitutional \nchallenges to District laws, such as in the recent Heller case--that \nwas the DC gun rights case--are brought under the Bill of Rights rather \nthan the fourteenth amendment that would incorporate the Bill of Rights \nand apply them to the States.\n  If the District of Columbia is not a State for purposes of section 1 \nof the 14th amendment, it seems odd to argue it is a State for purposes \nof section 2 of\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nthe 14th amendment in the very next sentence of the U.S. Constitution.\n  The history of our first two centuries under our Constitution \ndemonstrates an uninterrupted consensus by all three branches of \nGovernment that the District could not be represented in Congress \nwithout a constitutional amendment. Why Congress would even consider \npassing a piece of legislation that is going to be challenged in the \ncourts and ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court--and I am \npredicting here today they will say this is an unconstitutional act by \nthe very same Federal officials who have taken an oath to uphold and \ndefend the laws and Constitution of the United States--why we would do \nthis is baffling to me.\n  So why could anyone think a bill such as this might actually be \nupheld? Well, there was a clever lawyer, as there frequently is behind \nnovel legal theories. It was not until 1991, shortly after the \nConstitution's bicentennial, that a clever law student first advanced \nthe argument that Congress could create a Representative for the \nDistrict of Columbia through simple legislation. Legislation purporting \nto do that was first introduced in 2004. This novel legal theory lacks \nmerit, as I have argued, and cannot overcome the weight of textual and \nhistorical evidence that would all but declare that this bill is \nunconstitutional.\n  Supporters of this theory cite the District clause of the \nConstitution that gives Congress power to ``exercise exclusive \nlegislation in all cases whatsoever'' over the District. Because the \nDistrict is not a State, it doesn't have a State legislature, and so \nCongress is given that authority under the Constitution. This plenary \npower, it is argued, gives Congress unfettered power to determine the \nDistrict's representation in Congress.\n  But this power cannot be used in any kind of logical way to vitiate \nthe carefully crafted apportionment of representation elsewhere in the \nfour corners of the Constitution. By the logic of the act's supporters, \nCongress would exercise unlimited plenary power to repeal freedom of \nspeech in the District or give the District 436 representatives in the \nHouse and 101 Senators.\n  The absurdity of this argument is highlighted by the fact this \nDistrict clause goes on to give Congress the same plenary power--``Like \nAuthority''--over Federal institutions such as, ``Forts, Magazines, \nArsenals, dock- Yards, and other needful Buildings,'' in the quaint \nlanguage of the Constitution. But surely this does not mean that on the \nbasis of the District clause Congress can grant a vote in Congress to a \nfederal dockyard or an arsenal. It doesn't make any sense.\n  Congress should not adopt an overly aggressive or overly expansive \nrole of its powers under one section of the Constitution that allows it \nto violate--somehow magically--the clear language and intent of other \nprovisions of the same Constitution. Like all of Congress's powers, the \nDistrict clause is limited by the context and the rest of the same \nConstitution.\n  As the Supreme Court of the United States first noted back in the \nearly 19th century in Marbury v. Madison, and has continually affirmed \nthroughout our history, if Congress could alter the Constitution's \nmeaning through mere legislation, then the Constitution would cease to \nbe ``superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.''\n  On another note, having argued from a historical perspective, and \nfrom the text of the Constitution the historical practice, the \npolitical impact of what the Senate is being asked to do--aside from \nthese constitutional concerns--we need to look at the impact of this \nlegislation on the size of congressional delegations in all other \nStates after the 2010 census and beyond.\n  As I noted earlier, every 10 years we recalculate how many seats will \nbe available to the U.S. House of Representatives from each State, \nsince there is a fixed number. Of course now it is 435. Because of \nthat, every 10 years some States are winners and some States are \nlosers. High population growth States, such as my State--Texas--are \nlikely to get as many as three new congressional seats after the next \ncensus. This bill would change the list of winners and losers after the \n2010 census and for every census thereafter.\n  Think about this, colleagues: Some States clearly are going to lose a \nseat or two in Congress after the 2010 census. Just as my State will \ngain up to three seats, there will be other States that will lose a \nseat because of population shifts in our country. There are other \nStates that are not clear winners or clear losers but are on the \nbubble. I ask my colleagues to consider what they are doing to the \ninterests of their State before they vote on this bill. It could be \nthat by voting for this legislation some Senators will be putting their \nStates on the bubble now and for decades to come.\n  Now, what does that mean? Well, let me ask this question: Do you want \nto explain to your constituents that your State must lose a seat after \nthe census so the District of Columbia can gain a seat by this \nlegislation? Are Senators going to vote for a bill that might mean \ntheir State would receive one less congressional district after the \nnext census, because they want the District to have one? Do you want to \nexplain to your constituents that you would have had another seat after \nthe census, but instead you are going to have the same number and the \nDistrict of Columbia is going to grow by an additional seat as a result \nof your vote on this legislation?\n  The increase in House membership from 435 to 437 disguises this \nissue, but only if you are not paying very close attention. Think about \nthis: If the membership of the House had been 437 after the 2000 \ncensus, which States would hold those two seats today? The answer would \nbe Utah and New York. So New York is a big loser in this bill because \nwe are expanding membership in the House without giving New York the \nseat its people deserve based on the current law.\n  We don't know which State will be the biggest loser after 2010. If \nthe current census projection holds, it is likely to be New Jersey or \nOregon. The fact is we don't know which State would be entitled to that \n437th seat if it weren't awarded to the District of Columbia by this \nlegislation. But we do know this: There will be winners and there will \nbe losers. And there will be a new loser every 10 years after this bill \npasses if it is not struck down, as I predict it will be, by the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  The ultimate impact of this bill on our representation in the House \nof Representatives is unclear, but I believe the bill's lack of \nconstitutional foundation is clear. For that reason, I believe Senator \nMcCain's constitutional point of order should be sustained.\n  I will close where I started: Each of us, as U.S. Senators, has taken \na sacred oath to uphold the laws and Constitution of the United States. \nSo how, under any interpretation, would we vote to pass a law that is \nso clearly unconstitutional? Why is it that Congress would totally \nabdicate its responsibility in considering legislation to determine \nwhether it is constitutional or not and to kick that responsibility \nover to the Federal courts?\n  I believe all of us--Members of the House, Members of the Senate, \nFederal judges, the President of the United States--have a \nresponsibility to uphold the laws and the Constitution of the United \nStates. And if this Senate passes this clearly unconstitutional \nlegislation, it will have violated its sacred oath to uphold the \nConstitution, in my humble view.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, \nthis morning raised what he called a constitutional point of order \nabout S. 160. I would like to just respond to a few of his arguments.\n  He is my friend, and I appreciate his leadership in this body. I \nappreciate the fact that he went through this great campaign and \nasserted such influence but also such dedication to this country. I \nhave appreciated his dedication to our country ever since I met him. \nBut I do have some comments to make about his constitutional point of \norder.\n  The Senator from Arizona said that this bill is obviously, plainly, \nand blatantly unconstitutional because the District is not a State.\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n  For him, the constitutional debate apparently begins and ends with a \nsingle word.\n  As I said on Tuesday, however, noting that the District is not a \nState is a factual observation; it is not itself a constitutional \nargument.\n  It is a premise, not a conclusion.\n  There are many other factors to consider in order properly to answer \nthe constitutional question.\n  The Senator from Arizona is entitled to answer that question however \nhe choose, but I believe it is necessary to at least consider the \nfactors relevant to the answer.\n  I, for one, have not avoided the constitutional issue.\n  I have confronted the issue directly.\n  I have testified about it before the Senate Homeland Security \nCommittee.\n  I have spoken about it on this floor.\n  I have written and published an extensive article about the issue.\n  I have sent that article to my colleagues, including to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  I do not demand, or even expect, that my colleagues necessarily agree \nwith me on this issue, but I would like to hear at least an attempt to \nrespond to those arguments.\n  America's founders, those who wrote the Constitution we are talking \nabout, passed legislation allowing Americans living on the land ceded \nfor the District to vote in congressional elections. They did that.\n  That land was no more a State in 1790 than the District is today.\n  Those Americans did not live in a State.\n  I do not understand why treating District residents today as if they \nlived in a congressional district is constitutionally different than \ntreating them in 1790 as if they lived in Virginia or Maryland.\n  No one argued in 1790 that doing so was unconstitutional.\n  It seems to me that the Constitution would have been, if anything, \neven more clear and plain to its own drafters in 1790 than it is to us \nSenators here today.\n  Congress has provided, by legislation, that Americans living abroad \ncan vote in congressional elections.\n  They do not live in a State.\n  They do not even live in America.\n  I would like to hear from the Senator from Arizona why Congress can \nprovide voting rights for Americans living in other countries but \ncannot provide voting rights for Americans living in this country.\n  If it were so obviously, plainly, and unequivocally obvious that the \nword ``States'' in the Constitution can never include the District, \nthen the Supreme Court would not have ruled that the authority of \nCongress to regulate interstate commerce applies to the District.\n  The Supreme Court would not have ruled that the sixth amendment right \nto a speedy and public trial in the State where a crime was committed \napplies to the District.\n  The Supreme Court would not have ruled that Congress can extend to \nthe District Federal Court jurisdiction over lawsuits between citizens \nof different States.\n\n  The Supreme Court would not have held that the apportionment of taxes \namong the States applies to the District.\n  The Supreme Court would not have upheld Congress's authority to \nimplement in the District the fourteenth amendment's commands regarding \nthe States.\n  The Supreme Court has indeed held all these things.\n  If Congress could not provide for the District the House \nrepresentation the Constitution gives to the States, the Supreme Court \nwould not have affirmed a decision saying that such a goal could indeed \nbe pursued in the political process.\n  I assume the Senator from Arizona is aware of these and many other \nsimilar decisions over the past two centuries.\n  He is certainly entitled to believe that all of these decisions were \nwrongly decided.\n  But, with respect, rather than simply repeating the word States, he \nshould at least attempt to explain why those decisions are all wrong \nor, in some way, are different than the issue before us now.\n  And, again with respect for my colleague whom I admire, these Court \ndecisions establish that the Senator from Arizona is simply incorrect \nwhen he says that courts have consistently ruled that the word States \nexcludes the District.\n  The Senator from Arizona also asked why territories would not be \nentitled to the same congressional representation as the District.\n  As the Senator himself acknowledged, however, the District is an \nentirely unique entity in America.\n  America's founders intended that the District permanently to be a \njurisdiction separate from State control.\n  It should remain that way.\n  Territories, in contrast, are jurisdictions which can, and in some \ncases are intended to, become States.\n  I am unclear why the Senator from Arizona included this argument in a \nconstitutional point of order because it is not a constitutional \nargument.\n  It is instead a political argument, and it has been raised and \naddressed before.\n  My friend from Arizona also questioned whether Utah is included in \nthis bill.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut explained, both before and after the \nremarks of the Senator from Arizona, the House of Representatives must \nhave an odd number of Members.\n  One will go to the District, and the other to the State which would \nhave next qualified for one under the 2000 census.\n  As such, this decision was, as the Senator from Arizona said it \nshould be, based on census data.\n  It is not, as he alleged, simply an arbitrary, irrational, backroom \npartisan political deal.\n  This debate about what the Constitution allows Congress to do is \nimportant and worthwhile.\n  I believe the constitutional foundation of this bill is more than \nsufficiently solid to justify voting for this bill and I hope my \ncolleagues will.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote down this constitutional point of \norder which I think is not justified under either the Constitution or \nunder our rules.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 6 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 474 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is fortuitous that I happened to be on the Senate \nfloor managing the DC Voting Rights Act. But I take this opportunity to \nthank my friend from Iowa for this introduction of this legislation.\n  It is consistent with not only the actions that I have been \nprivileged to be involved with him on but what our committee has stood \nfor. We will give it a thorough review and, hopefully, we will be able \nto bring it forward. Senator Akaka is a very active and senior member \nof our committee. I am sure his advocacy will help a lot in moving the \nlegislation forward. I thank my friend from Iowa for introducing this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Under the previous order, the \nfirst 10 minutes prior to the 2 p.m. vote are equally divided and \ncontrolled by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, is going to speak in support of the point \nof order Senator McCain has raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose S. 160, the District of Columbia \nHouse Voting Rights Act. I must--in other words, I have to--review and \nrenew my objections to legislation of this kind. I have to speak and \nspeak loudly--can you hear me--to its flaws, as I have done when \nsimilar erroneous attempts have been made to amend the Constitution \nwith legislation.\n  As I have said previously, my quarrel is not with the intent of the \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nbut with the vehicle with which the Congress is seeking to effect this \nchange.\n  What does the Constitution say? Article I, section 2, of the \nConstitution says--now listen:\n\n       The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members \n     chosen every second Year by the people of the several States \n     . . .\n\n  The Constitution does not include the residents of the District of \nColumbia in this context as a State.\n  We know--or we ought to know--from our history books that our \nFounding Fathers sought out a Federal city that would not have to rely \nupon the protections of any one State. Their vision, the vision of the \nFounding Fathers, a center of government apart from the States, is seen \nin the distinction made in article I, section 8, between the ``States'' \nand a ``District.'' Therefore, under the Constitution, the District is \nnot a State. Consequently, a constitutional amendment is required to \ngive the District's citizens voting representation in Congress. This is \nthe step that ought to be taken. It is the step I have consistently \nsupported. As far back as 1978, as the majority leader of the Senate, \nthis body, I--let me identify myself: Robert C. Byrd--spoke in support \nof and voted for H.J. Res. 554, a joint resolution that proposed \namending the Constitution to provide for representation of the District \nof Columbia in Congress. Where is that? Here.\n  Every Member of this Senate ascribes to the underlying tenet of our \nsystem of government; namely, that the Government of the United States \nof America serves only by the consent of its citizens, as expressed \nthrough their elected representatives. That is us, their elected \nrepresentatives. Every Senator seeks the goal of upholding and \nperfecting our representative form of government, but the difference \nlies in how we seek to effect those rights.\n  I contend that this is no way to go about doing it. While the goal in \nthis case is laudable, it is a dangerous course on which we embark. \nSimply passing a law that grants voting rights to an entity that is not \na State is plainly circumventing the Constitution. As John Adams noted: \n``Facts are stubborn things.'' Let me say that again. This is John \nAdams talking now, not Robert C. Byrd. ``Facts are stubborn things.'' \nThat is right, I may say to the Senator.\n\n       Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, \n     our inclination, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot \n     alter the state of facts and evidence.\n\n  So I say this imperfect method of legislation employed to amend the \nConstitution has already been met with swift opposition and solid \nopposition. The text of the legislation anticipates that very outcome \nby providing for the Court's expedited review. And legal challenges \nwill surely come quickly--don't doubt it--calling into question the \nvalidity of this legislation, and the fate of the District's long-\nsought voting rights will be further bogged down in a swamp--a swamp--\nof litigation.\n  Providing voting rights for the District through a constitutional \namendment would provide the clarity and the constitutionality needed \nand would also avoid the path of litigation. Anything short of a \nconstitutional amendment will be insufficient and will certainly set a \ndangerous precedent.\n  While it is indeed an arduous task to amend the Constitution, and \nrightly so, thank heavens, something so critical as representation in \nthe House for the people of the District of Columbia compels it. \nShortcuts have no place here. In this instance because of litigation, \nany shortcut, so-called, may turn out to be the long cut, the long way \nhome for the very deserving, long-suffering people of the Capital City \nof this country, Washington, DC.\n  I will support the point of order raised by Senator McCain against \nthe underlying bill, as it addresses this most crucial issue.\n  I thank the distinguished, very able Senator. I thank the Chair and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, during the remarks we have just been \nprivileged to hear, the Senator from West Virginia said: ``I--let me \nidentify myself: Robert C. Byrd.'' May I say, there was no need for \nthat identification. There is only one Robert C. Byrd. And may I add, \nit has been an honor to serve with you now for 20-plus years, to learn \nfrom you, to respect your love of the Senate, of the Constitution, and \nto hear you deliver the remarks that you have just delivered.\n  Mr. BYRD. It has been my honor, my dear friend.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Thank you, sir.\n  In the spirit of your history of great debate, I nonetheless, and \nwith total respect, rise to oppose the point of order brought forth by \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  We have here a contest between two provisions of our great \nConstitution. The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from West \nVirginia rely on the provisions of article I, section 2, clause 1 that \nsays the House Members be chosen by the people of the several States. \nThose of us who support the measure before us, S. 160, rely instead on \narticle I, section 8, clause 17, the so-called District clause.\n  It is true the Constitution does require that House Members be \nelected by the people of the several States. But it is also true \nCongress has repeatedly not applied that language literally. To fully \nprotect the interests of people living in the Capital City, the Framers \ngave Congress extremely broad authority over all matters related to the \nFederal District under the so-called District clause I have referred \nto.\n  Here is where the courts have spoken exactly to where we are now. The \ncourts have said this clause, the District clause, gives Congress \nextraordinary and plenary power over the District of Columbia and, more \nto the point, have upheld congressional treatment of the District as a \nState for very important purposes of diversity jurisdiction and \ninterstate commerce.\n  Article III, for instance, of the Constitution provides that courts \nmay hear cases ``between Citizens of different States.'' The Supreme \nCourt actually initially ruled under this language that residents of \nour Nation's Capital could not sue residents of other States in Federal \ncourts. But in 1940, Congress said that was wrong and asked that \nresidents of the District be treated as a State for that purpose, a law \nthat was upheld in the case of DC v. Tidewater Transfer Company of \n1949.\n  The Constitution also allows Congress to regulate commerce among the \nseveral States. That is the language of the Constitution, which \nliterally would exclude the District of Columbia and make it impossible \nfor its residents to enjoy all the protections adopted under the \nCommerce clause. But Congress's authority to treat the District as a \nState for Commerce clause purposes was upheld in the case of \nStoughtenburg v. Hennick.\n  So what we are asking for has constitutional precedent. More to the \npoint, ultimately, or as much to the point, is the underlying reality \nthat the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Arizona speak \nto eloquently, which I presume all of us share, which is, it is an \noutrageous injustice that 600,000 residents of America who happen to \nlive in our Capital City do not have any voting representation in \nCongress.\n  Final point. The legislation before us presumes that there will be a \nlegal challenge to its constitutionality, and that will be decided \nunder the expedited procedures provided for in this legislation, in \nwording almost exactly similar to that provided in the so-called \nMcCain-Feingold landmark campaign finance reform legislation. The \nSupreme Court will decide.\n  So if you feel the status quo is unjust, I still urge you to vote for \nthis legislation, even if you wonder about the constitutional basis of \nit because ultimately that is the judgment of one of the other two \nbranches of our Government that the Supreme Court will decide. \nTherefore, I respectfully ask my colleagues to vote no on the point of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am aware that the hour has expired. I \nask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I cannot add to the persuasive argument \npresented by the most respected Member of the Senate on constitutional \nmatters and other matters. I thank Senator Byrd for his opinion. I \nthank him\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nfor his many years of service. I know all of us, however we vote on \nthis issue, respect and admire his views. Thank you, sir.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the constitutional point of order \nraised by the Senator from Arizona, whether it is well taken.

Reciprocity for the carrying of certain \n       concealed firearms\n\n       ``Notwithstanding any provision of the law of any State or \n     the District of Columbia or political subdivision thereof--\n       ``(1) a person who is not prohibited by Federal law from \n     possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm, \n     and is carrying a valid license or permit which is issued \n     pursuant to the law of any State or the District of Columbia \n     and which permits the person to carry a concealed firearm, \n     may carry in any State or the District of Columbia a \n     concealed firearm in accordance with the terms of the license \n     or permit, subject to the laws of the State or the District \n     of Columbia in which the firearm is carried concerning \n     specific types of locations in which firearms may not be \n     carried; and\n       ``(2) a person who is not prohibited by Federal law from \n     possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm, \n     and is otherwise than as described in paragraph (1) entitled \n     to carry a concealed firearm in and pursuant to the law of \n     the State or the District of Columbia in which the person \n     resides, may carry in any State or the District of Columbia a \n     concealed firearm in accordance with the laws of the State or \n     the District of Columbia in which the person resides, subject \n     to the laws of the State or the District of Columbia in which \n     the firearm is carried concerning specific types of locations \n     in which firearms may not be carried.''.\n       (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     44 of title 18 is amended by inserting after the item \n     relating to section 926C the following:\n\n``926D.

Mr. President, my amendment is a very simple amendment. It \nallows individuals the right to carry a lawfully concealed firearm \nacross State lines while at the same time respecting the laws of the \nhost State. It is very similar to legislation I introduced earlier, a \nstand-alone bill, S. 371, which currently has 19 Senate cosponsors.\n  As I believe and the Supreme Court found last June, the second \namendment of the Constitution provides law-abiding citizens have the \nright to possess firearms in order to defend themselves and their \nfamilies. As such, I believe a State's border should not be a limit on \nthis right. Today, there are 48 States that have laws permitting some \nform of concealed carry. While some States with concealed carry laws \ngrant reciprocity to permit holders from other select States, what my \namendment would do is eliminate the need for these laws by allowing an \nindividual to carry a concealed firearm across State lines if they \neither have a valid permit or if under their State of residence they \nare legally entitled to do so.\n  After entering another State, the individual must respect the laws of \nthe host State as they apply to conceal-and-carry permits, including \nthe specific types of locations in which firearms may not be \ncarried. Reliable empirical research shows that States with concealed \ncarry laws enjoy significantly lower violent crime rates than those \nStates that do not. For example, for every year a State has a concealed \ncarry law, the murder rate declines by 3 percent, rape by 2 percent, \nand robberies by over 2 percent.\n\n  My amendment is relevant to this debate because it underscores the \nselective support that the District of Columbia has when it comes to \nindividual rights such as the second amendment, and together with \nSenator Ensign's amendment will increase these rights. Specifically, \nanytime the word ``State'' is mentioned throughout my amendment, DC is \nalso explicitly mentioned as well.\n  My amendment is a common-sense measure that will strengthen public \nsafety throughout the Nation. And I would hope if the Senate is willing \nto pass the unconstitutional legislation that is before us--the \nunderlying bill creating an additional Member of Congress within the \nDistrict of Columbia--then the Senate should also be able and willing \nto pass amendments which are constitutional and protect each citizen's \nsecond amendment rights.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 585\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the retrocession of the District of Columbia \n           to the State of Maryland, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in a few moments I am going to propose an \namendment. I thought to conserve time that I would simply describe the \namendment now, and then as soon as it is copied, I will distribute it \nand ask unanimous consent that the pending business be laid aside so \nthat I can offer that amendment.\n  This is the retrocession amendment. It is an amendment that has been \nfrequently offered in the House of Representatives over the years, and \nit is the alternative to the constitutional mechanism for providing the \nDistrict of Columbia with representation in the House and Senate.\n  Rather than going the constitutional amendment route, there is one \nthing we know we can constitutionally do legislatively. Congress has \nthe ability to retrocede to the State of Maryland all of the non-\nFederal areas within the District of Columbia that adjoin Maryland. The \neffect of that, obviously, is to give the residents of the District of \nColumbia today the same rights as other citizens of Maryland, if this \nprocedure were to be followed.\n  Under this amendment, it would require an affirmative action of the \nLegislature of the State of Maryland, so that if the Legislature of \nMaryland did not wish to proceed with this, then it would not occur. It \nalso would require the repeal of the 23rd amendment to the \nConstitution, as I will describe in just a moment. But the effect of it \nis, as I said, to allow the residents of the District to enjoy \nrepresentation in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. It \nwould do so without violating the Constitution's requirements that only \nStates be represented in Congress and it would do so without creating a \ncity state that would have disproportionate leverage in Congress and \nover the Federal budget.\n\n  The amendment provides quite simply that after certain conditions are \nsatisfied:\n\n       The territory ceded to Congress by the State of Maryland to \n     serve as the District constituting the permanent seat of the \n     Government of the United States is ceded and relinquished to \n     the State of Maryland.\n\n  Retrocession, as I said, includes a minor exception for the so-called \nnational areas--the White House, the Capitol building, the Supreme \nCourt building, and the other Federal buildings and monuments around \nthe National Mall. The length of the amendment is simply due to the \nfact that there is a full description in section 3 of the amendment of \nthe area that would remain under the exclusive jurisdiction and control \nof the Congress.\n  There is an important transition provision that would allow lawsuits \nbegun in the District of Columbia to be continued in Maryland courts. \nThe amendment also provides that until the next reapportionment, the DC \nDelegate will serve as a full Member of the House of Representatives \nfrom Maryland. As I said, there are two conditions that would have to \nbe satisfied before it takes effect. First, the State of Maryland would \nhave to enact accepting the retrocession of the District to Maryland; \nand second, amendment XXIII, which currently gives the District three \nelectoral votes in Presidential elections, would need to be repealed.\n  The reason for this is that in the absence of such a repeal, \namendment XXIII might be construed not to be mooted and might be \nconstrued to give the very few residents living around the National \nMall three electoral votes. The intent here is not to capture anyone \nwho actually has an abode in that area, but there are some people who \nmight be living there nonetheless.\n  We believe the amendment is the most reasonable means of providing \nrepresentation in Congress to the residents of the District. It is a \nsolution that is based on precedent. Obviously, as we all know, in 1846 \nthe part of the District south of the Potomac River was retroceded to \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia and became Arlington County and old \nAlexandria. We have done this before. We know how it works.\n  If we adopt the amendment, the residents of Maryland could have a \nvote in the House and in the Senate within a year or two. If we \ncontinue down our current unconstitutional path, the legislation will \nbe tied up in litigation for several years and, at least in the view of \nmany of us, then struck down and we will be back at the drawing board. \nUnlike proposals to grant statehood to the District of Columbia, \nretrocession provides representation to the District residents in the \nnational legislature but without creating a city state that would \nfurther skew representation in the Senate.\n  In that regard, I would note that the number of people represented in \nmost of the congressional districts of the United States exceeds the \nnumber of people who are residents of the District of Columbia. As \nState population continues to grow, there is every reason to believe \nthat ratio would continue to exist.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this sensible constitutional means of \nproviding representation in Congress to the residents of the District \nof Columbia.\n  At this point I ask unanimous consent that pending business be laid \naside for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 585.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I note for the benefit of colleagues that we \nnow have, I think, two pending amendments.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues, if they wish to speak to either of \nthese two amendments or to lay down further amendments--we have good \ncooperation here on both sides of the aisle to move forward with this \nlegislation, and if Members who have an interest can be here and \nexpress their views or offer their amendments, we can move through the \nbill more quickly.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum here, but in the event Members \non the Republican side wish to speak, certainly this would be a good \ntime for them to come down and speak to the bill and offer amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are several amendments pending. This \nis a bill which is trying to make history. I thank Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Hatch, and others for bringing this bill to the floor. We have \n600,000 residents who live right here in the District of Columbia who \ndo not have a vote. They do not have a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives nor in the Senate. They never have. They were created \nas a kind of Capitol District without a voting Congressman, \nCongresswoman, or Senator. Of course, the people in the District of \nColumbia pay Federal taxes. Their sons and daughters take an oath to \nprotect America and march off to war. At least seven have recently died \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. They are bound by virtually all the Federal \nlaws that people in Illinois or Oregon or Connecticut would be bound \nby, but they do not have a voice.\n  There is no representation of 600,000 people. I think that is a gross \nmiscarriage of justice. I salute those who bring this bill to the floor \ntoday to give the District of Columbia, specifically the 600,000 people \nwho live here, that voice in Congress. It is long overdue.\n  But there is an interesting relationship between Congress and the \nDistrict of Columbia. Even though they do not have a voice in the \nCongress, Congress has always had a voice in the District. Congress has \nassumed a role somewhere between Governor and mayor when it comes to \nthe District of Colombia. I have seen it when I served in the House and \nthe Senate. A lot of Members from all over the United States of America \nwho secretly long to be mayors get their chance. They come to\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nWashington, they come to Congress, and they sit down and they play \nmayor for the District of Columbia.\n  They make all kinds of decisions, decisions that do not relate to war \nand peace or Federal Government; decisions that in most places are \ngoing to be confined to mayors and city councils or Governors or \nlegislatures. People in Congress cannot suppress the urge to be mayors, \nso they make all kinds of rules for the District of Columbia. Some of \nthem are nothing short of outrageous.\n  They delve into issues which the people in this city ought to decide \nfor themselves--zoning issues, issues of public health, issues that, \nfrankly, we do not have any business working on. But we can't stop \nourselves. These Senators who want to be mayors get their chance. You \ncan be a Senator from another State, but you can play part-time mayor \nin the District of Columbia.\n  That is one of the good reasons for this underlying bill, so finally \nat least some person can stand up in the House of Representatives and \nsay: I am representing these people and these people do not care for \nwhat you are doing to them.\n  Along come a couple of amendments here. They are in this big \nconstitutional debate, history making, about the future of Washington, \nDC, and several of my colleagues cannot suppress the urge to be mayor. \nThey want to be mayor of the District of Columbia.\n  One of them has come in with a proposal relative to firearms in the \nDistrict of Columbia. This is offered by Senator Ensign of the State of \nNevada and about a half dozen or a dozen other Republican Senators. \nHere is what they are trying to do.\n  They want us to write the ordinances for firearms in the District of \nColumbia. Are we going to do it in a committee hearing? Bring in the \npolice? Bring in the experts? Sit down and do this thoughtfully? No. We \nare not going to have any committee hearings. We are going to allow the \nNational Rifle Association to write the gun ordinance for the District \nof Columbia.\n\n  Do you want to guess what is going to be in that ordinance? Not much, \nwhen it comes to dealing with firearms.\n  I guess you could be sarcastic and say why would you worry about \ncontrolling firearms in Washington, DC? I am not going to be sarcastic \nbecause I can recall a time not that long ago when a deranged \nindividual brought a gun into this Capitol building and fatally injured \ntwo Capitol Hill policemen before he was finally suppressed.\n  I can recall when a President of the United States at the Washington \nHilton hotel on Connecticut Avenue, a man by the name of Ronald Reagan, \nwas shot down in the District of Columbia.\n  I can recall time and again the efforts made, by men and women who \nare Capitol police officers, to protect us and our visitors, wondering \nat any moment whether someone was going to open fire on them.\n  I can recall not that long ago an inauguration with 2 million people \non the Mall and the overwhelming concern we all had for the safety of \neveryone involved and particularly for our new President or First Lady, \nthe First Family. I saw the length we went through to protect them \nbecause of the obvious--we live in a dangerous place. We live in a \ndangerous time. A person with a gun, if they are willing to lose their \nown lives, can take out the lives of almost anyone. That is a fact. So, \nis there reason for us to be careful when it comes to guns? In my \nhometown of Springfield there is. In the great city of Chicago that I \nrepresent, you bet there will be. Kids are getting gunned down every \nday--certainly in Washington, DC, our capital city.\n  Guns need to be taken seriously--I won't say more seriously. Every \nlife is precious. But when we are entertaining visitors from around the \nworld who come to our Washington, DC, U.S. Capitol, we want to offer \nthem protection and safety as they travel. Maybe it is a special \ncircumstance here. But this town needs to be as safe as possible, for \nthe people arriving here, for the visitors, for all of us.\n  So the National Rifle Association has decided they want to establish \nthe standard for firearms in the District of Columbia. Let me tell you \nwhat they would do, to give you an idea if they could write the \nordinance for guns in the District of Columbia, with the Ensign \namendment. There are a few things they would like to do. The amendment \nwould provide:\n\n       The District of Columbia government shall not have \n     authority to enact laws or regulations that discourage or \n     eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms.\n\n  If that is your starting point, listen to what follows. It blocks the \nDistrict of Columbia from passing any background check or registration \nregulations, even sensible regulations that are needed to help law \nenforcement know who is buying guns. So the first thing the NRA wants \nto do is say we cannot ask you for a background check to find out if \nyou should be able to own a firearm in the District of Columbia. What a \ngreat starting point.\n  It also prevents the District of Columbia passing laws that require \ngun proficiency training. It even prohibits them from educating parents \nabout child gun safety.\n  You read the stories--we all do--about children killed when they find \na firearm at home, play with it, shoot themselves or a playmate, a \nlittle brother or a little sister. This bill would prohibit the \nDistrict of Columbia from establishing gun safety training.\n  The amendment would also prohibit the DC City Council from taking \nsteps to unduly burden--that is the language of the bill--the \nacquisition or use of firearms by persons not already prohibited under \nFederal law. That means that DC could not pass a law, for example, \nrestricting access to guns by those convicted of misdemeanor sex \noffenses involving a child.\n  That is a fact--because the Federal law does not prohibit that, DC \ncould not. A person convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense with a child \ncould not be prohibited, under this NRA amendment, from owning a \nfirearm in the District of Columbia. Make you feel safer? Would it make \nanyone feel safer? Obviously, some people at the NRA would.\n  Let me tell you what else. It repeals the age limits for legal gun \npossession. Now, this is a good one. Let's basically say you cannot \ntell someone you are too young to own a gun or maybe too old and \nfeeble. It repeals DC's prohibition on gun possession by anyone who was \nvoluntarily committed to a mental institution in the last 5 years. How \nmany times have we heard the stories on college campuses, in my State, \nin the State of Virginia, of someone who had a serious mental illness, \nturned to violence and killed innocent people?\n  It happened in Illinois. It happened in Virginia. It happened in \nother places. So governments try to keep guns out of the hands of \npeople who are mentally unstable. The Ensign amendment would stop the \ngovernment of the District of Columbia from imposing that standard when \nit came to possession of a firearm.\n  It also repeals, while we are at it, not just those voluntarily \ncommitted to mental institutions, but it would repeal the DC \ngovernment's prohibition on gun possession for those who have been \njudged by a court to be chronic alcoholics; you cannot stop them. Under \nthis Ensign amendment, they can own a gun. It is their second amendment \nright.\n  Well, I will tell you what. That is not what the Supreme Court said. \nThe Supreme Court said reasonable regulation of firearms was still the \nstandard in America. But I am afraid the Ensign amendment goes way \nbeyond reasonable regulation.\n  Well, here is another one. What if you had a requirement that before \nsomeone could buy a gun in the District of Columbia, they had to be \nable to see, a vision test. Not unreasonable. You want to have a gun or \ndrive a car, you ought to be able to do it safely. This bill would \nprohibit the District of Columbia from imposing an onerous burden that \na person has to pass a vision test in order to own a firearm.\n  I find this incredible. It is also unimaginable to me that this law \nexpressly allows the residents of the District of Columbia to cross \nborders into our States, buy firearms and come back. There is no \nrestriction, no limitation.\n  Now, I admit it has not worked very well. There has been a lot of gun \nviolence in this town, even with that law. But why do we want to raise \nthis white flag and say we are not even going to\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\ntry to restrict or limit them? So when the supporters of the Ensign \namendment say DC does not need any gun laws because Federal gun laws \nare strong enough, pay attention, they are, in fact, trying to weaken \nFederal gun laws at the very same time they are passing this amendment.\n  We do not debate guns around here much anymore. We used to. \nBasically, we reached a point where there are not many people who will \nstick their political necks out to vote for sensible gun control--too \nbig a hassle. The NRA is going to target you back home, and you are \ngoing to have to spend a lot of money to try to explain to people, as I \nhave, if you want to own a gun, if you want to use it safely, \nresponsibly, for self-defense or sporting purposes, your right should \nbe protected.\n  But you also ought to accept the responsibility, the responsibility \nto make certain that people check on your background so you do not have \na criminal record, a history of mental illness, chronic alcoholism. You \nought to be able to limit the kind of guns people buy. I mean, there \nare some people in my State and all over who say you should not limit \npeople. They should be able to buy whatever they want.\n  I do not buy that. I have always said, if you need an AK-47 to go \ndeer hunting, you ought to stick to fishing. Obviously, you do not know \nhow to use a gun, you just want to spray bullets until something stops \nmoving. There are also limitations in most places as to where you can \ntake your gun and how you can use it. I do not think that is \nunreasonable.\n  Coming from a family, people who are hunters and sportsmen, they are \npretty conscientious. They lock up the guns in the gun cabinet. They \nknow when the rabbit season starts and when the squirrel season starts \nand they are out there. They do not want to take their gun into the \nmall. It would not make, in my opinion, sense to them. That gun has a \npurpose.\n  But there are other people who disagree, people who think this is an \nabsolute right. I am afraid that is what has inspired the Ensign \namendment. I do not know if Senator Ensign or the people, the dozen or \nso folks who have cosponsored this amendment, have all gone back to \ntheir home States and said: We hope you will do exactly this. My guess \nis they have not. My guess is Senator Ensign has not gone to the mayor \nof Las Vegas and said: Let's take all the gun laws out; that ought to \nhelp us bring in some tourists. I do not think he has done that. Maybe \nhe has, in all fairness. I will give him his chance to respond to that \non the floor.\n  But it strikes me as peculiar and fundamentally unjust that Senators \nwho will not impose these standards in their own hometowns want to \nimpose them in the District of Columbia. They do not have the courage \nto stand in their own hometowns and say: We ought to let people with a \nhistory of mental illness have guns. Why? Because reasonable people \nwould say to them: Are you out of your mind? They would not say someone \njudged by the court as a chronic alcoholic ought to be able to buy an \nassault weapon. Not unless you happen to live in the Nation's Capital, \nwhere Senators get to be mayor, where Senators try to write gun laws, \nwhere Senators pass ordinances here. It is a shame.\n  It has been going on for a long time. I am not picking on the \nsponsors of this amendment. It has been going on as long as I have been \nhere. But it does not make any sense. If there was ever a town, and if \nthere was ever a time where we should take the extra measure to be \nsafe, it is this town at this moment.\n  We have to make sure the men and women who serve in elected office, \nthe wonderful staff people whom we have, the millions of visitors who \ncome into this building come in with peace of mind, knowing they and \ntheir families are going to be safe, not to worry that some law passed \nin the Senate is going to create a shooting gallery right outside the \nCapitol grounds.\n  This amendment does not make good sense. It certainly does not make \ncommon sense. It is not required by the Supreme Court. It is an \namendment that basically is an attempt for the National Rifle \nAssociation to do a little temperature check, find out where they are \nin this new Congress, to push to the limits the gun issue and to see \nwho is going to follow it.\n  I know a lot of Members who said: Well, that is their decision, I \nrespect them for it. But I respectfully disagree. Let us keep DC safe. \nLet's make sure all the people who value this city and the great \ntradition and heritage of this city take an extra measure to make it a \nsafe place for visitors, for those who live here, for kids going to \nschool, for folks going to church on Sunday. I do not think they \ndeserve anything less.\n  If one of those Senators, any one of these Senators want to stand up \nand say: I have proposed this gun ordinance in my hometown and my home \nState, I think it should apply to Washington, they would have more \ncredibility. But without that, they just want to experiment, experiment \non a city that for over 200 years has not had a voice in this Congress, \nexperiment on a city that is a helpless victim, many times to these \npolitical experiments that people like to try, through Congress, on \nWashington, DC.\n  I urge my colleagues: Read this. Take the time to read this \namendment. Pause and reflect and ask yourself one question: Would I \nwant this in my hometown? Is this a standard? I know some will say yes, \nbut most will say no. This is extreme. This goes too far.\n  The District of Columbia is trying its best after the Supreme Court \nchallenged and voided one of its ordinances. It rewrote its gun law. It \nallows for the registration of pistols, revolvers, and long guns for \nself-defense at home. So people in the District can have a gun in their \nhome for self-defense.\n  It bans assault weapons and junk guns used for crime. It prevents \npersons with a history of violence within 5 years from registering a \ngun. It prevents a person convicted of domestic violence or who is the \nsubject of a protective order, within 5 years, from registering a gun.\n  It prevents a person with multiple alcohol-related offenses within 5 \nyears from registering a gun. It requires that an applicant for a gun \ncomplete a firearm safety training course. It limits an applicant to \nregistering one gun every 30 days. It bans magazines on guns over 10 \nrounds. It tightens gun dealer licensing requirements. It requires all \nnew semiautomatic pistols to be stamped so they can be traced in a \ncrime.\n  It protects children by requiring registrants to safely store their \nfirearms, and it abolishes concealed carry licenses, except in very \nnarrow circumstances. That is the law if you want to own a gun in the \nDistrict of Columbia. If you have a legal right to do so, you have to \nfollow some basic rules, commonsense rules, rules that will be thrown \nright out the window with the Ensign amendment.\n  That is not good for the District, it is not good for America. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 573\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and I think it helps to set up some of my comments as \nwell. We are talking about a bill on DC voting rights that has a lot to \ndo with our Constitution. I have an amendment to that that also has a \nlot to do with our Constitution; that is, the right of free speech and \nthe right of freedom of the press, what we will call the Broadcasters \nFreedom Act.\n  The interesting point about the talk of my previous colleague is, he \nwas talking about the urge to be mayor here in the Senate. It is \ninteresting, after we just passed this massive stimulus bill, where we \nwere telling not only mayors but every Governor in the country what \nthey had to do and how they need to spend their money, to control \neverything from education to health care.\n  We cannot resist the urge to be Governors and mayors and, in fact, we \ncannot resist the urge to substitute our opinions of what should happen \nto our whole constitutional form of Government. It is interesting to \nhear about the guns amendment and the opinions there. I respect the \nSenator's opinion about the gun laws, what they should be.\n  But the fact is, that what we do here is not about our opinion, it is \nabout our oath of office, of protecting and defending the Constitution. \nThe Constitution does not give me a right to decide who is going to \nbear arms. I mean it is a basic constitutional right.\n  It does not give us the right to use our own opinions and good \nintentions\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\non every piece of legislation. One of the reasons as a country we are \nso much in debt--and this is attributed to both parties--is we have \nmoved away from any constitutional mooring of limited Government to the \npoint now where it is whoever's opinion can prevail is what passes.\n  An appeal to the Constitution is almost irrelevant. There is no way \nyou can interpret the Constitution to say the Federal District of \nColumbia is going to have Congressmen and Senators. Now, I respect an \nopinion of anyone who says it should not be that way, that people who \npay taxes should have Congressmen and Senators. But the fact is, our \noath of office is to defend the Constitution, not to employ our own \nopinions, to do what we think is right, to get money for our States.\n  That is a pretty simple judgment to make in this case, if we can \ncount, if we can look at the language of the Constitution and see \nsomething so obvious. Now, sure, we do not like it, we do not like the \nway it has turned out. There are 600,000 people living here and a lot \nof people with very good intentions say they should have the same \nrights as States. But that is our opinion, it is not the Constitution.\n  What worries me about a lot of our rights that are given in the \nConstitution, particularly our Bill of Rights, not only the right to \nbear arms, which people's opinion is being substituted for the \nConstitution, but the same thing has happened with the right of free \nspeech, the freedom of the press in our country, which has been so \ninstrumental to maintaining freedom and the ability of the American \npeople to be vigilant over their Government, finding out what is going \non here.\n  Back in 1949, the Federal Government implemented what was called the \nfairness doctrine over concerns that with the relatively few number of \nradio stations across the country, a diversity of opinion would not be \nheard.\n  Substituting our own good opinion for that of the Constitution, there \nare some in Washington who decided we needed to referee what was said \non radio.\n  If one political opinion was expressed, the fairness doctrine \nrequired that they have an opposite opinion also expressed. The whole \nidea was to create a diversity of points of view. The fact is, as with \nmany things we do here, it had exactly the opposite effect of what was \nintended. It put a chilling effect on political speech because what \nradio station would want to deal with the liability of expressing an \nopinion if someone else was going to come in and say they had to have \nsomebody else express a different opinion? It violates the right of \nfree speech and, in the process, actually puts a chilling effect on the \ndevelopment of political points of view in radio.\n  In 1987, it had become obvious what this was doing. Thousands of \nradio stations were developing all over the country. The Reagan \nadministration overturned this so-called fairness doctrine, which was \nreally a radio censorship act. With that act gone, we have seen the \ndevelopment of radio talk shows all over the country. One can tune in \nanywhere and get all kinds of diversity of opinion.\n  Frankly, it has become very annoying to a lot of Congressmen and \nSenators. There is nothing worse than going home and trying to tell \npeople one thing, and they actually find out that is not the truth. \nIncreasingly, that has been happening with bills we are passing, when \nfolks back home find out through talk radio those guys didn't even read \nthat bill. The front cover of that bill says it is not amnesty, but the \nbill says it is. The President says there are no earmarks, but open it \nup and there are thousands of earmarks in the bill. The President says \nhe is expanding our energy supplies, but then look and see that they \nactually have a drilling moratorium that we didn't know about.\n  Talk radio has become very annoying to politicians who don't want \nAmericans to know the truth. So increasingly a number of people in \nCongress are looking back to that fairness doctrine and thinking we \nneed to bring it back. We need to censor radio talk shows. We need to \ncreate that liability, that risk. Every time someone freely expresses \nan opinion, that station needs to know that they are liable to make \nsure another opinion is expressed.\n  Who is going to decide what should be expressed? The Governors and \nthe Mayor in Washington? In fact, what we are finding out is so many \npeople on the other side can't resist the urge to be Founding Fathers. \nThey want to change the Constitution and change what it means and \nignore it. But freedom of speech is so important. The fact is, people \nin this Senate who swore an oath to the Constitution are actually \nadvocating bringing back radio censorship and certainly will eventually \napply it to the blogosphere and the Web. They will not stop with radio \ntalk shows. We need to act to make sure this oppression, this tyranny \nis not reimposed on the American people.\n  It is not just important to protect what radio talk show hosts can \nsay. What we are really trying to protect is what millions of Americans \nare free to listen to: different opinions, facts, information about \nwhere to find more complete information about what is going on. The \nprimary reason more and more Americans are standing up and are outraged \nabout what is going on here is because they are finally finding out the \ntruth about what we are doing, how much money we are spending, how much \nwe are borrowing, the porkbarrel earmarks we are sending all over the \ncountry, basically changing the mission of the Federal Government from \none that stands for the national interest and constitutional government \nto one that is essentially trying to run local governments and State \ngovernments and to rearrange the Constitution.\n  The Federal Communications Commission could actually reimplement this \nradio censorship idea without Congress. That is why my amendment I will \noffer tomorrow, the Broadcasters Freedom Act, will prohibit the Federal \nCommunications Commission from bringing back any part of the radio \ncensorship they called at one time the fairness doctrine.\n  Some here will say it is not germane to this debate on DC voting \nrights. But DC voting rights are about the Constitution and whether we \nwill follow it. If we don't respect the Constitution on one issue, why \nshould we respect it on another? The fact that people at the FCC and \nhere in Congress are talking about bringing it back means it is germane \nto this discussion. It is germane to everything we do here, the right \nto freedom of speech. The freedom of the press is so foundational to \nour form of government, our way of life, it is germane to everything we \ndo here.\n  This amendment is so important to what we do because if we can't get \nthe American people informed and engaged and activated and get them to \nstand and express their outrage, this Government, this Congress, is \ngoing to continue to violate the Constitution at every turn; to \nsubstitute their opinion, whether it be the first amendment or second \namendment, any time their opinion is different from the Constitution. \nTheir belief and the prevailing belief here in Congress is, if you can \npass something, then it is legal. It doesn't matter if it violates the \nConstitution. What will matter is if the American people know what we \nare doing. They are going to stand up. They will e-mail. They will \ncall. They will express their outrage to these people who are taking \nour constitutional rights every day. They are going to hear from the \npeople back home, and they will back down or they will be brought home \nat the next election.\n  That is why radio freedom, freedom of the press, talk radio, \nbloggers, cable TV, all these alternative media that are going around, \nthe New York Times and the other liberal press, and taking the truth \nand the facts to the American people is something we have to protect \nwith our lives in Congress. The broadcasters freedom amendment that \nwill be offered tomorrow is critically important to what we do.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, don't buy these lame arguments that it \nis not germane to this constitutional debate. Don't buy the argument \nthat it is not relevant because no one is bringing it up. We have seen \nwhat people can sneak into bills that we don't get a chance to read. We \nneed to make it a law that the FCC or this Congress cannot implement \nany aspect of the fairness doctrine. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  I urge colleagues to take the Constitution seriously, take this \namendment seriously. Vote for it and show\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\nthe American people that we will stand for their constitutional rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I rise to support the District of Columbia \nHouse Voting Rights Act. For too long politics has trumped basic \nfairness. This is not a bill for statehood but one that ensures the \nsimple and long overdue right of American citizens to have a voice in \ntheir Government. It is the duty of any democracy to have every citizen \nrepresented. America is a model for democracy around the world. Right \nhere at home in our own Capital City almost 600,000 Americans live \nwithout a full vote in their Government. Passage of this bill is a \nmatter of fundamental rights. Citizens of Washington, DC, pay taxes \nlike everyone else, but they have no voice in how their taxes are \nspent. The phrase ``no taxation without representation'' used by the \noriginal Thirteen Colonies is every bit as relevant today.\n  The residents of our Capital City pay one of the highest tax rates in \nthe Nation, but they do not have a single voting representative in \neither House of Congress. Unlike every other city in America, \nWashington, DC, is forced to remain dependent upon Congress for even \nthe most basic functions. Congress has control over DC's local budget. \nCongress can review and overturn laws that DC residents pass. Even more \nimportant to consider is the brave service and sacrifice Washington's \nmen and women in uniform make in serving our Nation in the Armed \nForces. These great patriots deserve full participation in Congress.\n  The foundation of our system of government is that all citizens are \nrepresented in the Federal Government. Today we must make good on the \npromise and grant full and fair representation to the people of \nWashington, DC.\n  This issue has been around a long time. Finally, in this bill, we \nhave a balanced and sensible approach, one seat for the District of \nColumbia and one additional seat for the State of Utah.\n  I urge passage of this bill to give full, equal voice to the \nresidents of this District and allow those 600,000 citizens to finally \nbecome full members of our Republic.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 575\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, with regard to gun control. I \ndo so for five reasons.\n  First, this amendment is completely unrelated to the DC House Voting \nRights Act before us today. If it bears any relationship to this bill, \nit is in an inadvertent, unintended way to make the point of how badly \nwe in Congress treat the District, as if we have the right not only to \ndeprive it of voting representation in the House of Representatives--\n600,000 residents without voting representation, no government with \nconsent of the governed--but we exercise, by this amendment, if it \npasses, the right to intervene in the District when its own legislative \nbody, the council, has legislated and impose our desires on them.\n  Let me come back to my first point. The amendment is unrelated to the \nDC House Voting Rights Act. We should not be adding controversial, non-\ngermane issues to what I believe is a historic civil rights bill that \nfinally nullifies what has gone on for most of American history, which \nis a voting rights injustice. Residents of the District have fought for \ndecades to win the voting rights the rest of us take for granted. It \nhas taken tremendous work over more than this year to get this bill to \nwhere it is today, to enable us to actually be on the Senate floor \ndebating a voting rights bill.\n  We had a good debate earlier on a constitutional point of order \nraised by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, that went to the heart \nof the bill. That is what we ought to be debating. That point of order \nwas rejected, but it was relevant to what we are all about in S. 160. \nCongress has on many occasions, of course, debated legislation related \nto gun ownership, which is the subject of the Ensign amendment, \nunrelated to the DC House Voting Rights Act. No doubt we will have the \nopportunity to debate the issue of gun ownership and gun rights in the \nfuture. Opponents have raised relevant concerns about the \nconstitutionality and appropriateness of the legislation we are \nconsidering. That is what we should be debating, not gun legislation.\n  I fear, of course, in doing so, what we are doing on the Ensign \namendment is we are going to cloud the prospects for this bill with \ncontroversial, unrelated amendments that take us from the focus here, \nwhich is that 600,000 Americans do not have voting representation in \nCongress.\n  Second, I believe Congress should not limit the District's ability to \nenact its own measures with regard to gun violence. Some Senators, \nMembers of this body, may believe as a policy matter that the \nDistrict's gun laws are not adequate, not correct, but the District's \ngun laws have no effect whatsoever on the varying gun ownership laws of \nthe States. The fact is that none of our constituents--not one of our \nconstituents--will be affected or is affected by the gun laws of the \nDistrict of Columbia. We do not represent anybody who is a resident and \nvoter in the District of Columbia.\n  The gun rights of residents of other States are guided and controlled \nand enabled pursuant to the laws and regulations enacted by the elected \nofficials and executive officials in those States. Likewise, the \nelected officials of the District of Columbia have enacted laws \nregarding gun ownership that I believe this body should respect, just \nas I would want this body to respect the laws of my State with regard \nto guns or anything else. As I will explain in a moment, in fact, the \nDistrict of Columbia has enacted new gun laws in response to the court \ncase of DC v. Heller. Congress should not be singling out particular \nStates and localities to repeal their laws on guns or anything else.\n  This is not a uniform nationwide standard that will be adopted if the \nEnsign amendment passes. This is a law with regard to guns for the \nDistrict of Columbia. It is as if a law of my State of Connecticut was \nchallenged in the Supreme Court, and it was invalidated, and actually \nmy legislature then responded to the constitutional invalidation by \nadopting a law which they believed was consistent with the Supreme \nCourt decision, but then we in Congress came along and said: No, \nConnecticut, that is not enough. We are going to tell you exactly what \nyour law should be--not for the entire United States of America but for \nthe State of Connecticut. I would be outraged. Any Member of this \nChamber would be outraged if we did to one of our States what this \namendment proposes to do to the District. It is just not fair, and it \nis not consistent with our basic principles of limited Federal \nGovernment and the rights of States and localities to legislate for \nthemselves.\n  That is my second point. Congress should not limit the District's \nability to enact laws of its own regarding guns or anything else.\n  The third point is this: This amendment is actually outdated. The \nEnsign amendment is the same as legislation that passed the House last \nSeptember to remove restrictions on gun ownership in the District. But \nthere is an important point that has been left out here.\n  Last month, January, the District's government enacted new gun laws \nthat are their response to the holding of the Supreme Court in the DC \nv. Heller decision. The Heller decision struck down several provisions \nof the District's previous municipal code regarding guns. The decision \nparticularly invalidated the District's handgun ban and trigger lock-\nstorage requirement. But consistent with the newly enacted District of \nColumbia law adopted by the council, those provisions are no longer in \nthe law. So the Ensign amendment, in fact, is outdated. In fact, if you \nlook carefully at this amendment, it repeals and modifies provisions \nthat used to be in the DC law but no longer are because the recent \nenactment of the DC City Council removed those provisions of the law.\n  So my third point is the Ensign amendment is outdated and does not \nrelate to the reality that has been created by the District's City \nCouncil itself.\n  Fourth, let me talk about the District's new gun measures and their \nrelationship to the Heller decision. The\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\nSupreme Court made clear in its decision in Heller that the second \namendment meant something. It is something this Senator has always \nfelt. There is a constitutional right to bear arms. But that right, I \nhave always felt, is no more unlimited than any other right in the \nConstitution, including the fundamental--I would almost say sacred--\nrights in the first amendment. Those are not unlimited either, as we \nknow. So the Supreme Court decision said that the total bans in the DC \nlaw on gun ownership, possession of guns in the home, were \nunconstitutional and violative of the second amendment. But the \ndecision also made clear that reasonable regulation of gun ownership \nwas permissible.\n  This amendment essentially invalidates a whole series of what I \nbelieve the Supreme Court would find to be reasonable regulations of \ngun ownership and again does not acknowledge what the DC City Council \nhas done.\n  The gun laws the District passed last month restore the right of gun \nownership for self-defense in homes here in the District and amend the \nDistrict's safe-storage requirements so that a firearm no longer needs \nto be kept bound by a trigger lock within the home. The District's new \ngun law permanently repealed DC's ban on semiautomatic firearms and \npermits residents to own semiautomatic pistols. If you look at the \nEnsign amendment, you would not believe that was true. In fact, in the \nInoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008, the city of the District of \nColumbia provided a self-defense exception to allow residents with \nregistered firearms to carry these weapons lawfully in their homes or \nplaces of business. Additionally, the Firearms Control Amendment Act of \n2008 exempted from the registration requirement ``[a]ny person who \ntemporarily possesses a firearm registered to another person while in \nthe home of the registrant'' if that person believes they are in \nimminent danger. So these are the very real rights of gun owners that \nare now enshrined, adopted in the DC law that has been passed.\n  My fifth point is this, and I referred to it a moment ago: The Ensign \namendment goes much further than the Supreme Court did in limiting the \nright of localities, States, and municipalities to regulate gun \nownership while recognizing the second amendment constitutional right \nto bear arms. In fact, Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion in the \nHeller case, and he specifically noted that a wide range of gun laws \nwould be lawful and not violative of the second amendment--everything \nfrom laws ``forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places'' \nto ``conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.''\n  The amendment offered by my colleague from Nevada would overturn \nprovisions that the Heller decision did not address and did not strike \ndown.\n  This amendment provides that the government of the District of \nColumbia ``shall not have authority to enact laws or regulations that \ndiscourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms.'' \nPotentially, this could prevent the District from passing legislation \nregarding background checks, which have been widely accepted by courts, \nor registration regulations that are needed to help law enforcement \nkeep tabs of who is buying and owning guns in the District.\n  The Ensign amendment repeals DC's ban on sniper rifles that can \npierce armor plating up to a mile away and its ban on military-style \nsemiautomatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n  The amendment repeals DC's requirements--modeled on a California law \nwhich has been strongly supported by law enforcement agencies--that \nsemiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011, be \nmicrostamp-ready. Microstamping is a law enforcement tool that helps \nsolve gun crimes by imprinting shell casings with a unique identifier \nso they can quickly be matched to the handguns that fire them.\n  The Ensign amendment also repeals the District's age limits for legal \ngun possession. Imagine how we would feel in my State of Connecticut or \nin the Presiding Officer's State of Illinois if Congress came along and \ntold us how to write laws for our States.\n  This amendment repeals the District of Columbia's prohibition on gun \npossession by anyone who was voluntarily committed to a mental \ninstitution in the last 5 years. It repeals the District's prohibition \non gun possession for those who have been adjudicated as chronic \nalcoholics and those who have failed a vision test. This would be--I do \nnot even want to say it. It is shocking.\n  The amendment also weakens Federal law. Federal law prohibits gun \ndealers from selling handguns directly to out-of-State consumer buyers \nbecause of the high risk this creates for interstate gun trafficking. \nBut this amendment would allow DC residents to cross State lines to buy \nhandguns in neighboring States, undermining those Federal \nantitrafficking laws.\n  It is no surprise that the chief of police of the District of \nColumbia, Cathy Lanier, has testified that the legislation on which the \nEnsign amendment is based would undermine safety and security in the \nNation's Capital.\n  So those are five reasons why I believe this amendment should not be \nadopted. But as the chairman of the committee that has reported out the \nunderlying bill and as somebody who personally has worked for a lot of \nyears to try to right this wrong on the residents of the District of \nColumbia, our Nation's Capital--the capital of the greatest democracy \nin the world--not having a voting representative in Congress, I just \nthink this amendment, leaving aside its merits or demerits, adds \nsomething to this historic piece of legislation that just does not \nbelong and may, along the way, complicate its path to passage.\n  So regardless of your position on gun control--and I state again, I \nhave always believed the second amendment has meaning, that it makes \nconstitutional the right to bear arms, but that it is not unlimited--\nthis amendment comes close to a judgment that the second amendment \nreally is unlimited. So that is why I, on its merits, think it goes too \nfar.\n  But whatever you think of the merits, if you really believe in \nhelping eliminate one of the last vestiges of voting rights blocks in \nour country--when you think about it, when the Constitution was \nadopted, people of color could not vote. Good God, people of color were \nonly counted as three-fifths of people who were White. Woman could not \nvote. A lot of men could not vote if they were not property owners. And \nover the years, on this journey of ours, from the ideals in our \nDeclaration of Independence, we have gone forward to eliminate one \nafter another block to the reality that the Government was premised on \nthat you would not have governing without the consent of the \ngoverned. Yet this bizarre anomaly remains in our Nation's Capital \nwhere people are deprived of the right to have a voting representative \nhere.\n\n  So I appeal to my colleagues, whatever your position on gun ownership \nand gun violence, whatever your position on the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Nevada, please don't stand in the doorway, as Bob \nDylan once sang, and block this underlying bill or cause it to become \nmore controversial than it should be.\n  I thank my colleagues, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask the Chair to notify me when I have consumed 8 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have two items I wish to discuss, one \nthat has already been raised on the floor by my friend, Senator DeMint, \nwith respect to his proposed amendment No. 573 to the underlying bill. \nAs I understand it, Senator DeMint will be offering an amendment \ndealing with the fairness rule. I was a cosponsor of this legislation \nin the last Congress and I am happy to support it in this Congress; \nthat is, the position that says we should not allow the FCC to \nreinforce what has been called the fairness rule that was dropped some \nyears ago. Who can be against fairness? Well, I am in favor of \nfairness, but I am opposed to censorship, under the mislabeling that we \nhave here, the fairness doctrine is nothing more than censorship. The \nFederal Government would say to a radio or television broadcaster we \nhave\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\ndetermined that the broadcasting that you have been doing is not fair \nand so you are going to be ordered by the Government to present a \ndifferent point of view on your show and we will determine whether it \nis fair or it is not. The fairness doctrine was imposed on the grounds \nthat radio was such a pervasive medium that anything that was said on \nradio regarding politics should be balanced by someone who holds a \ndifferent point of view. Right away, this raises the question of how \nmany points of view?\n  We have seen Presidential elections where we had President Clinton, \nwhere we had Pat Buchanan, where we had Ralph Nader, and some minor \ncandidates, and who determines which one is important enough to qualify \nfor a fairness opportunity on radio? According to the so called \nFairness Doctrine, the government determines. Who determines, \ntherefore, what is one position that deserves putting down so that \nother positions can be raised in the name of fairness? The Federal \nGovernment. What do we get into when the Federal Government has the \nauthority to make these kinds of decisions? Again, there is a word for \nit and it is called censorship.\n  One way to deal with an argument, to use the Latin phrase ``reductio \nad absurdum,'' which means ``reduce it to an absurdity.'' Take it to \nits ultimate end. If we are going to take the Fairness Doctrine to it's \nultimate end, then we are going to say to the late night comedians, \nwhen you make a joke about a Democrat, since you are on the airwaves, \nyou must make a joke of equivalent nastiness about a Republican. When \nyou put down the President, you must find an equivalent Republican \nfigure to put down in the name of fairness. The consequence of all of \nthat, of course, if it were enforced, would be that the late night \ncomedians get shut down all together.\n  We have already had an opportunity for fairness, if you will, with \nrespect to talk radio. When a group of people got together and financed \na liberal talk show host--one who aspires to enter this body at some \ntime--the public spoke. The station went out of business. Let the \npublic decide what they are going to listen to and let the public \ndecide how they are going to pick. There are so many outlets for \ndifferent points of view that we do not need to go back to the Fairness \nDoctrine and impose Government censorship on the way people think and \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 581\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 581 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an amendment numbered \n581.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX FOR RESIDENTS OF \n                   THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\n       Due to the unique status of the District of Columbia, \n     created by the Constitution of the United States, bona fide \n     residents of the District (other than Members of Congress) \n     shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be exempt \n     from the individual Federal income tax for taxable years \n     beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I know my colleague from New York wishes \nto speak and I will be very brief. I should not take more than 10 \nminutes.\n  We are in a debate about the District of Columbia and the fact that \nthey are taxed and not represented with a vote in the Congress. It is a \nlegitimate debate. I tend to look at the Constitution and, as a matter \nof fact, as I read the Constitution--and I am not a constitutional \nlawyer, but I will tell my colleagues that anybody who reads the \nConstitution can say this is an unconstitutional bill we have in front \nof us.\n  I also reject the idea that the District of Columbia does not have \nrepresentation. All one has to do is look at the facts: $66,000 per \nresident of the District of Columbia, that is how much money the \nFederal Government spends per capita in the District of Columbia. That \nis $5.5 for every dollar they pay in taxes. So the 535 votes in the \nCongress have well represented them greater than any other group of \ncitizens in the country. But there is a claim--a legitimate claim--that \nthey don't have their own representative and that they are taxed.\n  This is a simple amendment. What it says is while we work this out, \nthe way to be fair is to eliminate Federal income tax on citizens of \nthe District of Columbia. They don't have a vote. Their tags even say \ntaxation without representation is unfair; no taxation without \nrepresentation. This solves that. They will have to change all of the \nauto tags. I don't know what that will cost. But the fact is we will \ntake away Federal income taxes on money earned in the District of \nColumbia from every citizen of the District of Columbia.\n  Now, two things happen with that, especially since they have 535 \nrepresentatives already. Think about what will happen to the District \nof Columbia in terms of income. Think about what will happen to the \nDistrict of Columbia in terms of economic progress. Think about what \nwill happen in terms of the value of the ownership of any asset in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Think of the growth. Think of the modernization \nthat will happen as we make this the center of progress based on the \nidea that because there is no representation, there should be no \nFederal taxation. It is a very simple, straightforward amendment. It \nsolves the immediate problem. When we finally do a constitutional \namendment with a joint resolution, which we are ultimately going to \nhave to do, what we will have done is given the people of the District \nof Columbia the benefit of having a tax advantage because they don't \nhave, under their thinking, representation in the Congress.\n  I am not trying to have a cute vote. If I had my way, I would try to \neliminate almost every Federal income tax. As the Senator from New York \nknows, I try to do that quite often, and try to eliminate a lot of \nspending. The whole point being, there is a legitimate point to be made \nby the citizens of the District of Columbia in that they are treated \ndifferently than everybody else in this country. My argument is they \nactually have 535 representatives plus their Delegate, and it has shown \nto be very effective for them, because no place else in the country \ngets as much Federal money per capita as the District of Columbia. So \nif we want to treat the citizens of the District of Columbia fairly--by \nthe way, this excludes all Members of Congress, so if my colleagues are \nthinking about voting for it for a selfish reason, please don't. If you \nare thinking about voting for this amendment on the basis of fairness, \nplease consider it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 575\n\n  I wish to take a few more minutes to comment on the Ensign amendment, \nif I might, and then I will finish. The Ensign amendment isn't about \nconcealed carrying, it is about the right that is guaranteed under the \nsecond amendment to be applied to people in the District of Columbia.\n  James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 46:\n\n       Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans \n     possess over the people of almost every other nation . . . \n     forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more \n     insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form \n     can admit of.\n\n  If you look at the murder rate in the District of Columbia, what \nhappened when the gun ban in 1975 was first instituted, we didn't see \nit rise that much because we allowed people to keep their guns. When \nthe complete ban took place, we saw a fivefold rise that is still going \nup--except for the last 2 years--in the murder rate compared to the \nrest of the cities in this country. There is something to be said for \nthe thinking that a perpetrator of a felony thinks he or she may \npossibly be harmed significantly. That tends to drive down violent \ncrime--we know that--in the States that have concealed carry, and that, \nI believe, is 26 or 28 States. It may be even more than that now.\n  The fact is, this isn't about concealed carry; this is about \nguaranteeing the\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nrights of individual citizens in the District of Columbia to represent \nthemselves with a right that every other citizen in this country has. \nBecause Congress didn't act on that right, it took the Heller decision \nto give them that right. All this does is bring into line the District \nof Columbia with the rest of the States in the country. I will have \ntaken the amount of time that I should in favor of Senator Schumer. I \nthank him very much for the consideration of allowing me to go first. I \nthank the chairman of the committee as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to a dangerous \namendment that would go far beyond authorizing gun possession for self-\ndefense in the home and create serious threats to public safety, and \nthat is the Ensign amendment.\n  First, I support the Lieberman bill to bring representation to the \nDistrict of Columbia, which seems to be in total keeping with what \nAmerica is all about. I just say to my good friend from Oklahoma that \nrepresentation, of course, involves dealing with taxation, but it \ninvolves many other things. To simply say the people of the District of \nColumbia don't have to pay any taxes but would be deprived of other \nrights in these Chambers, to me, is not what this bill is all about. It \nis a fine bill and a long overdue bill. It is a compromise, obviously. \nBut it is one that moves us up the steps to gaining representation for \nthe hundreds of thousands of the hard-working, taxpaying citizens of \nthe District of Columbia.\n  Now, of course, we are getting into the sort of season of irrelevant \nor controversial amendments. The Ensign amendment is certainly the \nsecond of those. Let me say this: The Heller case basically said there \nis an individual right to bear arms. I have some degree of sympathy \nwith those who are in the pro-gun movement who say: Hey, so many \nAmericans look to expand the first amendment, the fourth amendment, and \nthe fifth and sixth amendments broadly, and then see the second \namendment through a narrow pinhole, saying that it is only involving \nmilitias.\n  If you believe in a broad and expansive Constitution, how is it that \njust one of them is perceived as narrow as possible? The Heller \ndecision says it is not just militias that have a right to bear arms, \nor members of them, but individuals. But every Justice in that case, \nincluding Justice Scalia, made the opposite point. Just as those in the \npro-gun movement have some justification in saying it is unfair to \nregard every amendment expansively except the second, those of us who \nbelieve more in gun control have the right to say that every amendment \nhas a limitation.\n  I am a strong believer in the first amendment, but I don't vote \nagainst libel laws or pornography laws. I certainly agree with, I \nbelieve Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said: You cannot falsely scream fire \nin a crowded theater. So those are limitations on the first amendment. \nI say to my friends in the pro-gun movement, if every other amendment \nhas limitations, such as the first, fourth, fifth, sixth--and many on \nthat side of the aisle are for more strict limitations on those \namendments than we might be--how is it that the second amendment should \nnot have any limitation?\n  This proposal by Senator Ensign, my friend from Nevada, just shows \nthe absurdity of that argument because there are things in this \namendment that people would say defy common sense. It defies common \nsense to say someone who was voluntarily committed to a mental \ninstitution should be allowed to get a gun. It defies common sense to \nsay someone who can't pass a sight test should have a right to a gun. \nIt defies common sense to say a 10-year-old has a right to carry a \nshotgun. Yet in the defense of an overly expansive view of the second \namendment, even conceding that it does apply to these individuals, my \ncolleague from Nevada wishes to say those things. Again, how many \npeople in America think if you fail a sight test, you should have a \nright to a gun? You might say some sight tests are faulty. Well, change \nthe test. How many people would say someone who has been in a mental \ninstitution--voluntarily committed--should have the right to have a \ngun?\n  This is about Washington, DC, but didn't we learn on the campus of \nVirginia Tech about the destructive link when mentally ill people are \nallowed to acquire guns? Wasn't the country in an uproar about that? \nYet here, just a few short years later, as parents of those slain \nstudents are still mourning, we are about to say in the District of \nColumbia, a neighboring jurisdiction, if you not just have a mental \nillness, but it has to be pretty significant if you have been in a \nmental institution, you should have a right to have a gun.\n  So all we are trying to do in opposing the Ensign amendment is invoke \ncommon sense. We are not getting into the discussion of whether the \nsecond amendment applies to individuals or just to those in militias. \nThe Supreme Court has ruled on that. We are saying to our friends, just \nas they get up on the floor and advocate limitations on every other \namendment, it is contradictory to say the second amendment should not \nhave the most reasonable of limitations. There can't be a more \nreasonable restriction than the requirement that someone be required to \nsee before they are allowed on the streets with a gun. It just doesn't \nmake sense.\n  One other point: My colleagues on the other side of the aisle tend to \nadvocate for States rights in the broad balance of things. The States \nshould have the ability to make these decisions. It is clear the \nDistrict of Columbia, with its high crime rate, is not Nevada, Wyoming, \nor Nebraska. It is clear that firearms cause far more damage in the \nDistrict of Columbia than they do in many other States. Why shouldn't \nthe citizens of the District of Columbia have the right to determine, \nwithin constitutional confines, how those firearms may be used and who \nmay have them? If you are for a State being able to decide so many \nother policies, and you don't like the encroaching Federal Government, \nwhy is it different for guns? I guess that is at the nub of the Ensign \namendment, Mr. President.\n  Somehow the sponsor of this amendment seems to believe that guns are \ndifferent from everything else. The supporters of this amendment seem \nto believe that guns are different from everything else--limitations on \nevery other amendment but not the second amendment. States rights is a \ngood thing, but not when it comes to the States' or localities' view to \nregulate guns. Why is it different?\n  If you want to cite the Heller case in defense of the individual \nright to bear arms, the Heller case also says--Justice Scalia--that \nrestrictions on firearms that are reasonable, like bans on mentally ill \npeople having access to guns, are constitutional and could be, and \nshould be, decided by the citizens of Washington, DC.\n  So this amendment, make no mistake about it, if passed, will lead to \nneedless maiming and deaths. It is a serious amendment; it is not \nfrivolous. It goes way beyond a political statement on an important \nbill. I hope my colleagues will rise to the occasion and reject it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent to offer \nthat has been cleared on both sides. It is as follows:\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:45 p.m. today, the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the Coburn amendment No. 581, with the time \nuntil then equally divided and controlled between Senators Coburn and \nLieberman or their designees, and that no amendment be in order to the \nCoburn amendment prior to the vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for a few minutes or until Senator Coburn arrives, \nwhichever event occurs earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 581\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to speak against Coburn amendment No. 581. I suppose that in \npart I should say that this amendment, sponsored as it is by an \nopponent of the underlying bill, accepts one of the major contentions \nwe are making about the inequity of the current situation, which is \nthat the 600,000 residents of the District of Columbia, uniquely among \nall Americans, do not have voting representation in Congress. \nNonetheless, they are taxed. I mean, this goes back to one of the early \nAmerican Revolutionary slogans or principles, which is ``taxation \nwithout representation is tyranny.'' Our proposal, S. 160, the House \nVoting Rights Act, responds to that inequity by providing for voting \nrepresentation in the House of Representatives for the District of \nColumbia. The Coburn amendment takes the opposite view and says that \nsince the District does not have representation, well, by God, they \nshould not be subject to taxation. So it would eliminate the Federal \ntax. This amendment would eliminate Federal taxes for DC residents. But \nthat is not what DC residents are asking or we are offering on their \nbehalf. I mean, the point of this is that residents of the District of \nColumbia do pay taxes. They pay higher per capita taxes to the Federal \nGovernment than any other entity but one. They are second highest, \napproximately $20 billion a year.\n  Second, they not only have been conscripted into our military \nservices, but since the Volunteer Army, they have volunteered. \nResidents of this District have not only served, but they have \nsacrificed their lives in the cause of American security and freedom.\n  So the point is that there is something very, I hope, inspiring about \nthis. The residents of the District of Columbia are not asking for any \nfree ride. They want to be contributors to America in every way, \nincluding Federal taxation, but they also expect to be represented in \nthe House of Representatives with a voting Representative. So on behalf \nof what I would describe as the patriotic citizens of the District of \nColumbia, I would say this amendment makes a point, but it is not a \nsound or fair one.\n  I polled the members of my staff who live in the District of Columbia \nto ask how they would advise me to vote. I am pleased to say that they \nput principle ahead of personal interests and have urged me to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  I also say that if the amendment passed, we would have yet another \nenormous gap, and this gap we now have between Federal expenditures and \nrevenues would grow even larger.\n  So perhaps Senator Coburn is making a point, but it is not one that I \nbelieve we ought to adopt in an amendment; therefore, I would urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleague from \nConnecticut a question or two about this. First of all, I think it is \ncorrect that all of us would like to see a way, a proper way--and we \ndisagree about what that way is--for the residents of the District of \nColumbia to have a full franchise in terms of congressional \nrepresentation. Failing that, I think Senator Coburn was simply saying \nthey should not have to pay taxes.\n  I was wondering myself about potentially a second-degree amendment \nthat might give that option to other States or congressional districts \non the theory that maybe this would be a two-fer for their \nconstituents: they could vote to get rid of their Congressman and the \nincome tax. I wonder if my colleague would have an idea about such an \namendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. To my friend from Arizona, I do have some ideas about \nsuch an amendment, but I guess it would be best to not verbalize them \non the floor.\n  Actually, we are at a time in our history, difficult as it is \neconomically, where I think people are turning to the Federal \nGovernment and asking for not such a free ride but asking for help. \nThere is a wonderful word; I do not know if it is in the dictionary; \nthe word is ``deviltry.'' It is another way to say mischievous or \nmischief.\n  I think our friend from Oklahoma may be up to a little deviltry with \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the Senator from Connecticut is probably right about \nthat. His point is to draw an important distinction, and that is that \nthere are two elements to this, one being the taxation and the other \nthe representation. The Senator from Connecticut rightly points to a \nvery important episode in our history where the Founding Fathers tied \nthose two together. There are other factors as well.\n  I urge support for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 581 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the District of Columbia \nsubcommittee, I rise today in support of S. 160, the District of \nColumbia Voting Rights Act of 2009. I vote to enfranchise thousands of \nDistrict residents and to affirm my commitment to the fundamental right \nof all Americans to participate in our great democracy.\n  Despite our Nation's founding principle of ``no taxation without \nrepresentation,'' District of Columbia residents lack full \nrepresentation in Congress. They have sent sons and daughters to war in \ndefense of our country, and they have paid Federal taxes in support of \nour Government. Despite this, the distinguished Delegate from the \nDistrict of Columbia lacks a vote on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Fair voting representation is fundamental to our democracy. I \nunderstand the challenges facing the District's residents, and I \nsympathize with its trouble to attain voting representation\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\nin Congress. I also understand that this will be an ongoing discussion. \nI am sensitive to the concerns raised by my colleagues on the \nconstitutionality of our actions.\n  Legal scholars have testified before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee that \nCongress does have the constitutional authority to extend a vote to a \nDistrict Representative in the House. I believe this legislation is \nconstitutional, but ultimately it is the role of the courts to decide.\n  Our representative democracy is based on the principle that citizens \nof this country should have a say in the laws that govern this country. \nIf citizens disagree with the laws, they have the power to vote for \ndifferent representatives. By extending this core principle to the \nDistrict of Columbia, I believe this bill would be a decisive step \nforward for the rights of DC residents.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 575\n\n  Now I wish to address the pending Ensign amendment.\n  Today, we are addressing voting rights. Now is not an appropriate \ntime to cloud the debate with amendments on gun control. Last year, \nwhen this gun issue was brought up on the Senate floor before being \nconsidered by the committee, I joined 10 of my colleagues in a letter \nto the majority leader asking that the bill follow Senate procedures \nand be referred to committee before consideration on the floor.\n  As the chairman of the subcommittee charged with the oversight of the \nDistrict of Columbia, I am familiar with the debate on DC's gun \npolicies. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court in the Heller decision \nstruck down the District of Columbia's gun ban. Since then, the DC City \nCouncil has taken necessary steps to comply with the Supreme Court's \ndecision, including the passage of legislation to address issues raised \nby the ruling. I do not believe any congressional action is needed to \nhelp DC comply with the Heller decision, but, more importantly, this is \nnot the appropriate time to consider and vote on this issue.\n  I am not against gun ownership. I am for self-determination. I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to give the District of Columbia and \nits citizens the opportunity to vote on and establish their own rules \nregarding gun control. It would be ironic if we were to with one hand \nfinally give the people of the District voting representation but on \nthe other hand take away their right to self-determination by forcing \nthem to adopt a gun control policy on which they were unable to vote. \nI, therefore, urge my colleagues to vote no on the Ensign amendment and \nall related amendments.\n  I am proud to lend my support for the underlying bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in support of voting rights for the residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia and to reject any amendment that would abridge \nthose rights or is not germane to the issue at hand.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent agreement to \npropound which has been cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nS. 160 on Thursday, February 26, the time until 10:30 a.m. be for \ndebate with respect to the Kyl amendment No. 585, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled between Senators Kyl and Lieberman or their \ndesignees, with no amendment in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote, and that at 10:30 a.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, I would like to announce to everyone where \nwe are in regard to this bill. We have been working through the \namendments. Senator Lieberman has done a terrific job. I understand \nthere will be a few more that may be offered. We expect to have votes \nthroughout Thursday on pending amendments, and those that are offered \non Thursday we are going to try to dispose of those tomorrow.\n  I filed cloture today, but I hope it isn't necessary to have this \ncloture vote. However, if necessary, we will look forward to seeing if \nwe can get a consent agreement to have the vote tomorrow; otherwise, we \nare going to wind up coming in Friday morning. I hope that is not \nnecessary. This is a piece of legislation that has been talked about \nfor a long time. We have had it on the Senate floor before. I think \neveryone has had the ability to offer whatever they believe is \nappropriate.\n  I really express my appreciation for the cooperation of all Members, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, but especially Senator Kyl, who did \nsome very good work with Senator Lieberman this afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2461-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

When historians look back at the last 8 years, they are \ngoing to evaluate one of the most secretive administrations in the \nhistory of the United States. Now, the citizens of this country have \nsaid we should have change, and we should. But we also know that the \npast can be prologue unless we set things right.\n  In the last administration, there was a justification for torture. It \npresided over the abuse at Abu Ghraib, destroyed tapes of harsh \ninterrogations, and conducted extraordinary renditions that sent people \nto countries that permit torture during interrogation.\n  They used the Justice Department, our premiere law enforcement \nagency, to subvert the intent of congressional statutes, even to \nsubvert nonpartisan prosecutions, and instead to use them in partisan \nways to try to affect the outcome of elections. They wrote secret law \nto give themselves legal cover for these misguided policies, policies \nthat could not withstand scrutiny if brought to light.\n  Nothing has done more to damage America's standing and moral \nauthority than the revelation that during the last 8 years we abandoned \nour historic commitment to human rights by repeatedly stretching the \nlaw and the bounds of Executive power to authorize torture and cruel \ntreatment.\n  As President Obama said to Congress and the American people last \nnight, ``if we're honest with ourselves, we'll\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nadmit that for too long we have not always met'' our responsibilities.\n  Now, the President said that about the economy, but the same holds \ntrue here. It is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment \nthat we can move forward. How can we restore our moral leadership and \nensure transparent government if we ignore what has happened?\n  There has been discussion, and in some cases disagreement, on how \nbest to do this. There are some who resist any effort to investigate \nthe misdeeds of the recent past. Indeed, some have tried to extract a \ndevil's bargain from Attorney General Holder, a commitment that he \nwould not prosecute for anything that happened on President Bush's \nwatch. That is a pledge no prosecutor should give, and, to his credit, \nEric Holder did not.\n  There are others who say that regardless of the cost in time, \nresources, and unity, we have to prosecute these administration \nofficials to lay down a marker. The courts are already considering \ncongressional subpoenas that have been issued and claims of privilege \nand legal immunities, and they will for some time.\n  Over my objections, Congress has already passed laws granting \nimmunity to those who facilitated warrantless wiretapping and conducted \ncruel interrogations. The Department of Justice issued legal opinions \njustifying these executive branch excesses which, while legally faulty, \nwould undermine attempts to prosecute. A failed attempt to prosecute \nfor this conduct might be the worst result of all if it is seen as \njustifying abhorrent actions. Given the steps Congress and the \nexecutive have already taken to shield this conduct from \naccountability, that is a possible outcome.\n\n  The alternative to these approaches is a middle ground, a middle \nground I spoke of at Georgetown University a little over 2 weeks ago. \nThat middle ground would involve the formation of a commission of \ninquiry dedicated to finding out what happened. Such a commission's \nobjective would be to find the truth. People would be invited to come \nforward and share their knowledge and experiences, not for the purpose \nof constructing criminal indictments, but to assemble the facts, to \nknow what happened and to make sure mistakes are not repeated.\n  I have seen what happened before in prosecutions. We don't find the \nfull truth. We prosecute those at the bottom of the chair of command, \nbut we don't find out what those above did.\n  While many are focused on whether crimes were committed, it is just \nas important to learn if significant mistakes were made, regardless of \nwhether they can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous \njury to be criminal conduct. We compound the serious mistakes already \nmade if we limit our inquiry to criminal investigations and trials. \nMoreover, it is easier for prosecutors to net those far down the ladder \nthan those at the top who set the tone and the policies. We do not yet \nknow the full extent of our government's actions in these areas, and we \nmust be sure that an independent review goes beyond the question of \nwhether crimes were committed, to the equally important assessment of \nwhether mistakes were made so we may endeavor not to repeat them. As I \nhave said, we must read the page before we turn it.\n  Vice President Dick Cheney continues to assert unilaterally that the \nBush administration's tactics, including torture, were appropriate and \neffective. But interested parties' characterizations and self-serving \nconclusions are not facts and are not the unadulterated truth. We \ncannot let those be the only voices heard, nor allow their declarations \nto serve as historical conclusions on such important questions. An \nindependent commission can undertake this broader and fundamental task.\n  I am talking about this process with others in Congress, with outside \ngroups and experts, and I have begun to discuss this with the White \nHouse as well. I am not interested in a commission of inquiry comprised \nof partisans, intent on advancing partisan conclusions. Rather, we need \nan independent inquiry that is beyond reproach and outside of partisan \npolitics to pursue and find the truth. Such a commission would focus \nprimarily on the subjects of national security and executive power in \nthe government's counterterrorism effort. We have had successful \noversight in some areas, but on these issues, including harsh \ninterrogation tactics, extraordinary rendition and executive override \nof the laws, the last administration successfully kept many of us in \nthe dark about what happened and why.\n  President Obama issued significant executive orders in his first days \nin office, looking to close Guantanamo and secret prisons, banning the \nuse of harsh interrogation techniques and forming task forces to review \nour detainee and interrogation policies. I support his decisions, and I \nam greatly encouraged by his determination to do the hard work to \ndetermine how we can reform policies in these areas to be lawful, \neffective and consistent with American values. My proposal for a \ncommission of inquiry would address the rest of the picture, which is \nto understand how these types of policies were formed and exercised in \nthe last administration, to ensure that mistakes are not repeated. I am \nopen to good ideas from all sides as to the best way to set up such a \ncommission and to define its scope and goals.\n  A recent Gallup poll showed that 62 percent of Americans favor an \ninvestigation of these very issues. Respected groups including Human \nRights First, the Constitution Project and thoughtful Senators, \nincluding Senator Whitehouse and Senator Feingold, have also embraced \nthis idea. The determination to look beyond the veil that has so \ncarefully concealed the decision making in these areas is growing. Next \nWednesday, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to explore these \nideas and to continue the conversation about what we can do moving \nforward.\n  Two years ago I described the scandals at the Bush-Cheney-Gonzales \nJustice Department as the worst since Watergate. They were. We are \nstill digging out from the debris they left behind while those in the \nlast administration continue to defend their policies, knowing full \nwell that we do not even know the full extent of what those polices \nwere or how they were made. We cannot be afraid to understand what we \nhave done if we are to remain a nation equally vigilant in defending \nboth our national security and our Constitution. I hope all Members of \nCongress will give serious consideration to these difficult questions.\n  I argue it will be the quintessential American thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, during my brief tenure so far in the \nSenate, the Judiciary Committee has confronted many difficult issues, \nbattles over judicial nominees, complex legislative matters, a historic \ninvestigation into misdeeds of the Bush administration's Department of \nJustice. In that process, the committee saw U.S. attorneys fired for \npolitical reasons, the Civil Rights Division run amok, declassified \nlegal theories asserting that the President can secretly ignore his own \nexecutive orders. We saw unprecedented politicization of a noble \ndepartment, and we saw those Office of Legal Counsel memos approving \ninterrogation techniques long understood, long known to be torture. \nFortunately, throughout that time, Chairman Leahy sought answers. His \nefforts were evenhanded but unyielding. We know so much of what we know \nnow because Patrick Leahy was satisfied with nothing less than the \nwhole truth.\n  Today his work continues, and I wish to speak in support of his \nefforts. The backdrop is, of course, a grim one. Over and over, as I \ntravel around my State of Rhode Island, I hear from people facing \nchallenges that seem almost insurmountable, challenges President Obama \nspoke about in his address to Congress last evening. Every day it gets \nharder and harder to find a job, to pay the bills, to make ends meet. \nEvery day it seems more difficult to see a way out. The Bush \nadministration left our country deeply in debt, bleeding jobs overseas, \nour financial institutions rotten and weakened and an economy in free-\nfall. This is the wreckage we see everywhere, in shuttered plants, as \nmy colleague from Pennsylvania sees at home so cruelly, in long lines, \nand in worried faces. But there is also the damage we cannot see so \nwell, the damage below the water line of our democracy, damage caused \nby a systematic effort to twist policy to suit\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\npolitical ends; to substitute ideology for science, fact, and law; and \nto misuse instruments of power.\n  If an administration rigged the intelligence process and, on faulty \nintelligence, sent our country to war, if an administration descended \nto interrogation techniques of the Inquisition, of Pol Pot and the \nKhmer Rouge, descended to techniques that we have prosecuted as crimes \nin military tribunals and in Federal courts, if institutions as noble \nas the Department of Justice and as vital as the Environmental \nProtection Agency were subverted by their own leaders, if the integrity \nof our markets and the fiscal security of our budget were open wide to \nthe frenzied greed of corporations and speculators and contractors, if \ntaxpayers were cheated and the forces of Government rode to the rescue \nof the cheaters and punished the whistleblowers, if our Government \nturned the guns of official secrecy against our own people to mislead, \nconfuse, and propagandize them, if the integrity of public officials, \nthe warnings of science, the honesty of Government procedures and the \ncareful historic balance of our separated powers all were seen as \nobstacles to be overcome and not attributes to be celebrated, if the \npurpose of Government became no longer to solve problems but simply to \nwork them for political advantage, and a bodyguard of lies and jargon \nand propaganda was emitted to fool and beguile the American people, \nsomething very serious would have gone wrong in our country.\n  Such damage must be repaired. I submit that as we begin the task of \nrebuilding this Nation, we have a duty to our country to determine how \ngreat that damage is. Democracy is not a static institution. It is a \nliving education, an ongoing education in freedom of a people.\n  As Harry Truman said, addressing a joint session of Congress back in \n1947:\n\n       One of the chief virtues of a democracy is that its defects \n     are always visible, and under democratic processes can be \n     pointed out and corrected.\n\n  We have to learn the lessons from this past carnival of folly, greed, \nlies, and wrongdoing so the damage can, under democratic processes, be \npointed out and corrected. If we bind ourselves to this history, we \ndeny ourselves its lessons, lessons that came at too painful a cost to \nignore.\n  Those lessons merit disclosure and discussion. Indeed, disclosure and \ndiscussion makes the difference between this history being a valuable \nlesson for the bright and upward forces of our democracy or a blueprint \nfor those darker forces to return and someday do it all over again. As \nwe work toward a brighter future ahead, to days when jobs return to our \ncities, capital to our businesses, and security to our lives, we cannot \nset aside our responsibility to take an accounting of where we are, \nwhat was done, and what must now be repaired. We also have to brace \nourselves for the realistic possibility that as some of this conduct is \nexposed, we and the world will find it shameful, revolting. We may have \nto face the prospect of looking with horror at our own country's deeds.\n  We are optimists, we Americans. We are proud of our country. \nContrition comes hard to us. But the path back from the dark side may \nlead us down some unfamiliar valleys of remorse and repugnance before \nwe can return to the light. We may have to face our fellow Americans \nsaying to us: No, please, tell us we did not do that, tell us Americans \ndid not do that. And we will have to explain somehow.\n  This is no small feat and not easy. This will not be comfortable or \nproud, but somehow it must be done.\n  Chairman Leahy has embarked on the process of considering a new \ncommission, one appropriate to the task of investigating the damage the \nBush administration did to America, to her finest traditions and \ninstitutions, to her reputation and integrity. The hearing he has \ncalled in coming days will more thoroughly examine this question to \nhelp us determine how best to move forward. I stand with him. Before we \ncan repair the harm of the last 8 years, we must learn the truth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2463-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING LARRY H. MILLER\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to speak of one of Utah's most \noutstanding citizens, Larry H. Miller, who passed away recently.\n  Larry Miller is a true American success story. He graduated from high \nschool. He wasn't able to cut it in college and ended up working in a \nparts department in an auto dealership. Not a very auspicious beginning \nfor someone who became a billionaire, but Larry Miller had two things \nthat many people do not have. No. 1, he had in effect a photographic \nmemory. I understand that if you went to Larry Miller while he was \nrunning this parts department and asked for an axle or for a head lamp \nor for any other auto part, he knew exactly where it was. Somehow he \nhad that in his head and he made a tremendous success out of that. He \nultimately began his career by buying an auto dealership and then built \na string of 40 auto dealerships.\n  The other thing he had was an incredible work ethic. Larry Miller \nworked hard every day and demanded that kind of performance from those \nwho worked with him.\n  He is best known in Utah for the fact that he was the minority owner \nof the Utah Jazz, the NBA's least successful team financially. The Jazz \nreached the point where they had to be sold because they couldn't \nsurvive anymore. They were losing money at every turn. The majority \npartner made a deal whereby the franchise would be sold to someone \noutside of the State. As minority partner, Larry Miller was required to \nsign the deal. He picked up the pen to sign the deal and then he \ncouldn't bring himself to sign it, and he turned to the majority \npartner and said, Sam, I can't do it. So he bought the majority partner \nout, kept the Jazz in Utah, and then he presided over the revival of \nthe Jazz. They won more games. They have been in the playoffs more than \nmost people. They have been to the national finals twice and the only \nreason they haven't won an NBA national championship is because the \nChicago Bulls had Michael Jordan at the time. Against any other team or \nany other star, the Jazz would have won the NBA championship. I \nremember the last failed game very well, and the shot Jordan put up \nthat won the game that was fantastic, but that was Jordan's legacy.\n  Larry Miller is known for all of these things, but that is not how I \nwish to remember him before the Senate here today, because this man, \nwho was a philanthropist and gave his money to community colleges to \nhelp people who were more like him in terms of their academic needs, \nbecame in his later years a history buff. He fell in love with the \nFounding Fathers. I remember talking to Larry Miller about John Adams, \nabout Thomas Jefferson, and recommending a book to him. He had just \nread McCullough's book on John Adams and I said, Have you read Joseph \nEllis's book, ``Founding Brothers''? He said, no. I said, I will send \nit to you. I got caught up in all of my difficulties and all of my \ndistractions and realized I had failed to keep my word. So finally, \nwith some embarrassment, I got hold of Larry and said, I apologize I \nhave not sent you a copy of ``Founding Brothers.'' He said, that is all \nright, Senator. I went out and bought one on my own. He followed \nthrough where I didn't.\n  He fell in love with this country, not as an entrepreneur, although \nhe did that way; not as someone who had been very successful and \nblessed by this country, although he did that way; but toward the end \nof his life he fell in love with this country as one who studied its \nhistory and understood its underpinnings. He was generous. He was \ninventive. He was tenacious. The people of Utah have been more than \nblessed by the fact that he chose Utah as his home. We miss him \nterribly and extend our deepest sympathies to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2463-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2463-S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the committee clerk, a witness may request \n     changes in testimony to correct errors of transcription, \n     grammatical errors, and obvious errors of fact. The Chairman \n     or a staff officer designated by him shall rule on such \n     request.\n       8. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his or her character or \n     adversely affect his or her reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record; and\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf.\n       9. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee, the Ranking Member, to call at least one \n     witness to testify or produce documents with respect to the \n     measure or matter under consideration at the hearing. Such \n     request must be made before the completion of the hearing or, \n     if subpoenas are required to call the minority witnesses, no \n     later than three days before the hearing.\n       10. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his or her counsel, or any spectator conducts him or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing the \n     Chairman or presiding Member of the Committee present during \n     such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, \n     his representative or any law enforcement official to eject \n     said person from the hearing room.\n\n\n            III. Closed Sessions and Confidential Materials\n\n       1. Procedure. All meetings and hearings shall be open to \n     the public unless closed. To close a meeting or hearing or \n     portion thereof, a motion shall be made and seconded to go \n     into closed discussion of whether the meeting or hearing will \n     concern Committee investigations or matters enumerated in \n     Senate Rule XXVI(5)(b). Immediately after such discussion, \n     the meeting or hearing or portion thereof may be closed by a \n     vote in open session of a majority of the Members of the \n     Committee present.\n       2. Witness Request. Any witness called for a hearing may \n     submit a written request to the Chairman no later than \n     twenty-four hours in advance for his or her examination to be \n     in closed or open session. The Chairman shall inform the \n     Committee of any such request.\n       3. Confidential Matter. No record made of a closed session, \n     or material declared confidential by a majority of the \n     Committee, or report of the proceedings of a closed session, \n     shall be made public, in whole or in part or by way of \n     summary, unless specifically authorized by the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member.\n\n\n                            IV. Broadcasting\n\n       1. Control. Any meeting or hearing open to the public may \n     be covered by television, radio, or still photography. Such \n     coverage must be conducted in an orderly and unobtrusive \n     manner, and the Chairman may for good cause terminate such \n     coverage in whole or in part, or take such other action to \n     control it as the circumstances may warrant.\n       2. Request. A witness may request of the Chairman, on \n     grounds of distraction, harassment, personal safety, or \n     physical discomfort, that during his or her testimony \n     cameras, media microphones, and lights shall not be directed \n     at him or her.\n\n\n                         V. Quorums and Voting\n\n       1. Reporting. A majority shall constitute a quorum for \n     reporting a resolution, recommendation or report to the \n     Senate.\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\n       2. Committee Business. A third shall constitute a quorum \n     for the conduct of Committee business, other than a final \n     vote on reporting, providing a minority Member is present.\n       3. Hearings. One Member shall constitute a quorum for the \n     receipt of evidence, the swearing of witnesses, and the \n     taking of testimony at hearings.\n       4. Polling:\n       (a) Subjects. The Committee may poll (1) internal Committee \n     matters including those concerning the Committee's staff, \n     records, and budget; (2) other Committee business which has \n     been designated for polling at a meeting.\n       (b) Procedure. The Chairman shall circulate polling sheets \n     to each Member specifying the matter being polled and the \n     time limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so \n     requests in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held \n     for meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a \n     record of polls. If the Chairman determines that the polled \n     matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule III(1), the \n     record of the poll shall be confidential. Any Member may \n     request a Committee meeting following a poll for a vote on \n     the polled decision.\n\n\n                           VI. Investigations\n\n       1. Authorization for Investigations. All investigations \n     shall be conducted on a bipartisan basis by Committee staff. \n     Investigations may be initiated by the Committee staff upon \n     the approval of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member. \n     Staff shall keep the Committee fully informed of the progress \n     of continuing investigations, except where the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Minority Member agree that there exists temporary \n     cause for more limited knowledge.\n       2. Subpoenas. Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or \n     the production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials shall be issued by the Chairman, or by any other \n     Member of the Committee designated by him. Prior to the \n     issuance of each subpoena, the Ranking Minority Member, and \n     any other Member so requesting, shall be notified regarding \n     the identity of the person to whom the subpoena will be \n     issued and the nature of the information sought, and its \n     relationship to the investigation.\n       3. Investigative Reports. All reports containing findings \n     or recommendations stemming from Committee investigations \n     shall be printed only with the approval of a majority of the \n     Members of the Committee.\n\n\n                    VII. Depositions and Commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness's failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule II(6).\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he or she may refer the matter to the Committee or \n     the Member may order and direct the witness to answer the \n     question, but the Committee shall not initiate the procedures \n     leading to civil or criminal enforcement unless the witness \n     refuses to testify after he or she has been ordered and \n     directed to answer by a Member of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall \n     return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes, \n     if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule \n     II(7). If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the \n     staff shall note on the transcript the date a copy was \n     provided and the failure to return it. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his or her presence, the \n     transcriber shall certify that the transcript is a true \n     record to the testimony, and the transcript shall then be \n     filed with the Committee clerk. Committee staff may stipulate \n     with the witness to changes in this procedure; deviations \n     from the procedure which do not substantially impair the \n     reliability of the record shall not relieve the witness from \n     his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the Committee regulating their use.\n\n\n                          VIII. Subcommittees\n\n       1. Establishment. The Committee will operate as a Committee \n     of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish \n     temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The \n     Chairman of the full Committee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member shall be ex officio Members of all subcommittees.\n       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction as described in \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is \n     authorized to conduct investigations, including use of \n     subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.\n       3. Rules. A subcommittee shall be governed by the Committee \n     rules, except that its quorum for all business shall be one-\n     third of the subcommittee Membership, and for hearings shall \n     be one Member.\n\n\n                              IX. Reports\n\n       Committee reports incorporating Committee findings and \n     recommendations shall be printed only with the prior approval \n     of a majority of the Committee, after an adequate period for \n     review and comment. The printing, as Committee documents, of \n     materials prepared by staff for informational purposes, or \n     the printing of materials not originating with the Committee \n     or staff, shall require prior consultation with the minority \n     staff; these publications shall have the following language \n     printed on the cover of the document: ``Note: This document \n     has been printed for informational purposes. It does not \n     represent either findings or recommendations formally adopted \n     by the Committee.''\n\n\n                         X. Amendment of Rules\n\n       The rules of the Committee may be amended or revised at any \n     time, provided that not less than a majority of the Committee \n     present so determine at a Committee meeting preceded by at \n     least 3 days notice of the amendments or revisions proposed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2465-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2465-S2466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT OF GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT, THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE, \n            AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of National \nPeace Corps Week and in honor of the thousands of Americans who serve \nthroughout the world as Peace Corps volunteers.\n  Since the Peace Corps' founding in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, \nover 195,000 U.S. citizens have chosen to serve their country as Peace \nCorps volunteers. Today, nearly 8,000 Peace Corps volunteers serve \nabroad in 76 different countries.\n  In my own home State of New Hampshire, 54 volunteers have heard the \ncall and are currently devoting their time, energy, and lives to \nfulfilling the vision of President Kennedy and serving their country \nabroad in the cause of peace. They are placed throughout the developing \nworld--from Morocco, where one New Hampshire volunteer is educating \ncommunity leaders on improving access to safe drinking water, to \nMacedonia, where another is teaching English to grade school children \nin a small rural village.\n  I would like to take a second and recognize each of these citizen \nambassadors and the nearly 1,500 Peace Corps volunteers from New \nHampshire that have served since 1961. In honor of their efforts, I \nwill ask consent that the attached list of current New Hampshire \nvolunteers be printed in the Congressional Record. New Hampshire is \nproud of your service, and we will continue to stand solidly behind \nyou.\n  The Peace Corps was founded on the ideal that each of us has the \nresponsibility to serve our country and leave our world in a better \nplace than we found it. This dual commitment to U.S. interests and the \nglobal good is a testament to the fact that in today's interconnected \nworld, American security and prosperity are inextricably linked to the \nsecurity and prosperity of people residing in the far corners of our \nglobe. Peace Corps volunteers understand better than anyone that we are \ntruly all in this together.\n  Peace Corps volunteers work on the front lines in our battle for \nhearts and minds throughout the world. They serve as teachers, business \nprofessionals, health educators, management specialists, information \ntechnology advisors, mentors and friends to citizens across the globe. \nThese unofficial ambassadors help develop trust and establish \nrelationships that are critical to American influence and global \nstability. Upon the completion of their service abroad, these \nvolunteers then return home to promote a better understanding here in \nAmerica of the culture, language and viewpoint of those they have \nserved.\n  These volunteers have all done their part to make the world a better \nplace and, in turn, have contributed a great deal to U.S. national \ninterests and global security. In our 21st century world, where the \nthreats and challenges that confront America and the global community \ncannot be overcome by the might of our military alone, Peace Corps \nvolunteers are laying the foundation for a more secure and prosperous \nworld.\n  In honor of National Peace Corps Week and in celebration of the Peace \nCorps' 48th Anniversary on March 1, 2009, I would like to recognize \nthose volunteers from New Hampshire, as well as all past and current \nPeace Corps volunteers, for their commitment to securing a better world \nfor us and our children.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the chair \nof the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, I will work \nwith our allies and friends throughout the world in the development of \nan American foreign policy that matches the passion and commitment to \nservice of our Peace Corps volunteers abroad.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the list of current \nNew Hampshire volunteers to which I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                SWORN-IN VOLUNTEERS IN THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Volunteer name                Country of service     Start of service date      Projected COS date\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlden, Elizabeth E...................

Mr. President, during the past year, I and other Senators \nhave urged the Government of Kenya to effectively address reports of \negregious misconduct by its police and military forces, including \ntorture and summary executions. The Mount Elgon killings, culminating \nin the slaughter of some 200 people by the police and army soldiers in \n2008, were particularly appalling, yet the government has yet to \nconduct a credible, transparent, thorough investigation.\n  We now have the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur, \nwhich confirms, again, the conclusions of multiple human rights \norganizations. I would hope that the Government of Kenya recognizes \nthat it is in its interest, and that it has a responsibility, to \npromptly implement the Special Rapporteur's recommendations.\n  Kenya is an ally and friend of the United States. In fact, we are \ntraining some of Kenya's security forces. It is imperative that these \nviolations be addressed urgently and decisively, and that the \nindividuals involved in these atrocities, including those who gave the \norders, are brought to justice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a press release on the Special \nRapporteur's report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                From the Press Center--U.N. Headquarters\n\n       Nairobi, February 25, 2009.--Today, the UN Special \n     Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Mr. Philip Alston, \n     concluded his 16-25 February 2009 fact-finding mission to \n     Kenya.\n       The UN independent expert stated that, ``Killings by police \n     in Kenya are systematic, widespread and carefully planned. \n     They are committed at will and with utter impunity.'' He also \n     found that death squads were set up upon the orders of senior \n     police officials to exterminate the Mungiki.\n       He called on the President of Kenya to acknowledge the \n     widespread problem of extrajudicial executions in Kenya and \n     to commit to systemic reform. ``Effective leadership on this \n     issue can only come from the very top, and sweeping reforms \n     to the policing sector should begin with the immediate \n     dismissal of the Police Commissioner,'' concluded the \n     independent expert. ``Further, given his role in encouraging \n     the impunity that exists in Kenya, the Attorney-General \n     should resign so that the integrity of the office can be \n     restored.''\n       In addition, the Special Rapporteur found compelling \n     evidence that in Mt Elgon, the police and military committed \n     organised torture and extrajudicial executions against \n     civilians during their 2008 operation to flush out the Sabaot \n     Land Defence Force militia. ``For two years, the SLDF militia \n     terrorized the population and the Government did far too \n     little. And when the Government did finally act, they \n     responded with their own form of terror and brutality, \n     killing over 200 people.'' He said that since the security \n     forces had not investigated the allegations in any convincing \n     manner ``the Government should immediately act to set up an \n     independent commission for Mount Elgon, modeled on the Waki \n     Commission''.\n       With respect to the accountability for the post-election \n     violence, the Special Rapporteur stated that the setting up \n     of the Special Tribunal for Kenya was ``absolutely \n     indispensible to ensure that Kenya does not again descend \n     into chaos during the 2012 elections.'' He called on civil \n     society and the international community to take a firm line \n     on its establishment. ``At the same time, this is an ideal \n     case for the ICC to urgently take up'', he added, stressing \n     that the two approaches were not mutually exclusive and a \n     two-track approach should be adopted.\n       The Special Rapporteur also recommended that an independent \n     civilian police oversight body be established, that records \n     of police killings be centralized, that an independent \n     Department of Public Prosecutions be created, across-the-\n     board vetting of the police be undertaken, the setting up of \n     an independent witness protection program, that the \n     Government issue substantive responses to KNCHR reports, and \n     compensation for the victims of those unlawfully killed.\n       In the course of his ten-day visit, the Special Rapporteur \n     visited Nairobi, Central, Rift Valley, Western and Nyanza \n     Provinces. He conducted in-depth private interviews with more \n     than one hundred victims and witnesses. Mr. Alston met with \n     senior Government officials, including the Prime Minister, \n     the Minister of Justice, the Assistant Minister of Defence, \n     the Chief of Police and the Chief of Staff of the Armed \n     Forces, as well as officials at the provincial and district \n     levels. He also met with the Kenya National Commission on \n     Human Rights, the independent national human rights \n     institution, as well as with civil society organizations.\n       The full text of the Special Rapporteur's statement is \n     available at www.extrajudicialexecutions.org.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2467-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2467-S2468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LEON FLEISHER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, this week, one of the indomitable artists \nof our age will take the stage of the Kennedy Center Concert Hall, as \nthe great pianist Leon Fleisher teams up with the London Philharmonic \nOrchestra. His range, commanding technique and total sense of the \nmusic's natural shape and scope will surely captivate the audience. \nThis is a fitting occasion to take note of a great artist, teacher and \nhumanitarian who, through his playing, has touched the souls of so \nmany.\n  In the early years of his career, Leon Fleisher astounded audiences \nwith a golden sound. His career then seemed tragically cut short when \nhe began suffering from a rare neurological condition that rendered his \nright hand unable to play. Instead of withdrawing from the musical \nworld, Leon Fleisher remained in close contact with music through \nconducting, teaching and playing scores specially written for pianists \nwho lost use of their right hands. He persisted in the effort to play \nthe full concert repertoire, and some novel medical treatments \neventually helped him regain full use of both hands.\n  It is a classic American journey, tracing a path out of despair to \ntriumph. In Leon Fleisher's sense of determination, dedication, vision \nand skill, there is much for all of us to both admire and emulate. My \nwife Marcelle and I were delighted to sit next to him at a reception \nthat honored his lifetime of achievement. We thoroughly enjoyed\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\ngetting to know this stately and cordial artist, a man of great \nintelligence, modesty and warmth.\n  Leon Fleisher has been playing across the country with full use of \nhis hands for several years now. We are fortunate to be able to hear \nagain how he plumbs the depths of every musical score, revealing \nsomething about ourselves through his music making. I know the Senate \njoins me in congratulating and recognizing Leon Fleisher's incredible \ncontributions to the vibrant cultural fabric of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2468-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2468-S2469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My husband and I are semi retired but the figure of $200 \n     way off the mark even for us. We do work part of the year but \n     are not doing so at this time. We live rural and have to \n     travel for groceries, building supplies. When we work all of \n     this involves a minimum of 40 miles each way, not including \n     the around town mileage. We have 20 acres, with a small \n     tractor to keep weeds under control which the county urges \n     all of us to do. We also have a large lawn to mow. Our fuel \n     bill for the month of May was $400. The tractor has a tank of \n     10 gallons, and that alone costs $40 per tank. We are trying \n     to save a bit by purchasing dyed fuel but, by the time you \n     travel to that, you have eaten up your savings. The point is \n     we have very little choice on our fuel issues. We do not go \n     to town on a whim and really never have as long as we have \n     been here (since 1973). The price of food is skyrocketing \n     also in the rural areas. We have a small grocery store in a \n     small town by us, but they have fuel issues, too. We would \n     like to see nuclear power sources and wind generators \n     multiply. Our daughter does websites and she has a customer \n     that has a wind power source for sale for each single home. \n     However, at this point, it is somewhat expensive, \n     approximately $5,500. Although in the past, nuclear power has \n     had a few hiccups so even we were not in favor of it. I \n     subscribe to Popular Science Magazine and it is my \n     understanding they are very close or have reached the ability \n     to neutralize the waste. However, I have not heard any news \n     about it from the media or official science reports.\n       Fixed income as well as families and singles cannot get pay \n     raises that equals the cost of living in reality. We dealt \n     with this our last years at work. Companies have their \n     stockholders that have to be kept and for the last eight \n     years of our jobs we steadily lost money from cost of living \n     that the government adjusted to be 3% or less when in the \n     blue collar world did not equate to that. Fuel along doubled \n     and what cost us $30 per week for work fuel jumped within 3 \n     months to $60 per week and kept traveling upward since. \n     Property taxes, auto and home insurance also have risen but \n     employers went with the government figures. I would get 25 \n     cent per hour raise. It brought home approximately $4 and \n     change per week. It did not cover any of our rising expenses. \n     Anything under $1.00 does not even show anything much on a \n     take home check. So there needs to be some way for an \n     employer with all their overheads to realize this and perhaps \n     hire CEOs, CFOs and other company officials that make a \n     decent wage without the super perks they have received for \n     the last 25 years. Corporate waste is rampant and should be \n     addressed somehow in the near future so the frontline \n     employees can afford today's fuel prices and not be stressed \n     daily by how to make ends meet. Sorry I got off the edge here \n     but it is all one big picture which is why the energy costs \n     are a frontline problem with this. We still have many elderly \n     people who do not have enough to live as is. With this energy \n     impact, I do not know how they can make it. So please keep up \n     your vigil. We need to open up the fields in Alaska and not \n     be selling it to other countries at this point. [When] my \n     husband and I work, which involves truck driving, we see what \n     is happening along the routes we travel. The distress in the \n     citizens and the oil wells being developed and the ones that \n     are not running.\n     Darlene, Spirit Lake.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to communicate in this \n     fashion my family's challenges with the high cost of energy \n     and our thoughts. I travel a great deal all over America and, \n     as part of my job, I work closely with many convenience store \n     operators around our great country. We own a Dodge Durango 4-\n     wheel drive SUV. It is great because it provides the safety \n     my family needs during the winter and the space we need for \n     all the stuff we need to transport when you have two young \n     children. As you no doubt remember with your own family, a \n     nine-month-old baby [needs] a lot of baggage when he \n     travels--car seats, strollers, etc. The daughter wants her \n     bike when visiting the grandparents, her books, and spare \n     clothes, etc. The bad thing is it only gets 13 miles to the \n     gallon on average and, like most families, we did not buy it \n     with cash but financed it which means we owe more on it than \n     we can sell it for. In fact, in this market, many car dealers \n     will not even take an SUV in on trade. So we have no choice \n     but to bear the burden of high gas prices for the foreseeable \n     future. We cannot just throw the car away and run out and buy \n     a new fuel-efficient SUV which is selling at a premium that, \n     frankly, even in today's market, does not even pencil out as \n     a good investment by my calculations. Of course, this is not \n     the only part of the story of how high energy costs have \n     impacted our family but the part those like Thomas Freidman \n     never take into consideration when promoting even higher \n     costs through taxation, cap and trade, and government \n     manipulation of the market.\n       What should Congress do?\n       Do not do as Congresswoman Maxine Waters suggested in \n     Committee and take over the oil companies. The markets are \n     working just fine, but what they reflect is all the inaction \n     and obstacles that have burdened the supply and demand \n     elasticity of the commodities markets be it oil or corn, etc.\n       Again, taxing is not a solution. We should be working to \n     lower taxes for everyone. Not redistributing it. Not to \n     manipulate markets. Fuel taxes should be what they need to be \n     to maintain our infrastructure. We should be encouraging \n     efficiencies in the market place with our tax code and \n     policies.\n       The fact is we need to make it easier to drill now. We need \n     to make it easier to refine more fuel now. We need to add \n     capacity to distribute that fuel to the marketplace now. We \n     need to expand our reserves so we have a cushion when natural \n     disasters occur. We need to do something about all the \n     boutique fuels that cause unnatural shortages every spring \n     and fall (winter blend, summer blend, smog blend, this blend, \n     that blend impact refinery efficiency). We need to do \n     something about credit card interchange fees. We need to do \n     everything we can to encourage efficiency.\n       And, of course, we need to encourage conservation, public \n     transportation where possible, more not less airports and \n     routes, and alternative even renewable sources of energy.\n       Well, that is my 415 cents. Thank you.\n     Robert, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I find it odd as the greatest country in the world we are \n     lagging in becoming energy self-sufficient. France, for \n     instance, runs and has, for many years, ran its country off \n     nuclear power. How is it that we cannot do this? If our \n     country was powered off of nuclear power, consider the \n     substantial reduction in oil consumption for the east coast. \n     They are paying to heat their houses with heating oil, more \n     expensive than our natural gas. Drilling for more oil will \n     help but we need a bigger and better solution. Corn is not \n     the answer, either. As the government pushes alternative \n     fuels (ethanol), the price of food rises. Also we do not get \n     the power out of ethanol that we get out of traditional fuel \n     so MPG on our cars drop. So we need more ethanol. It is a \n     very ridiculous cycle. Nuclear, wind, hydrogen, oil--all \n     these options need to be brought to the table now. Waiting \n     until after the election will not work. We all know as soon \n     as that election is over the focus will be on mid-term \n     elections and pandering to voters. Let us get it done now. \n     Does our government really care about our future, our \n     children? Let us act on this now before these same promises \n     are being made to our children's children.\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is time that we get off our cans and get aggressive in \n     drilling for oil on our own soil. I am tired of our country \n     being held hostage to foreign interests and values when it \n     comes to our own energy needs. High fuel costs have had a \n     significant negative effect on my business and my ability to \n     grow my business. Please do all you can to get us out of this \n     crisis.\n     Craig, Eagle.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is time to reign in the market speculation in oil and it \n     is products. There is no shortage of gasoline or oil. There \n     are no lines at gas stations! It is gouging, plain and \n     simple. Stop protecting the oil companies! Windfall profits \n     tax on all oil-related products of at least 50%. Apply the \n     windfall tax funds to alternative energy research that have \n     no connection to the oil industry. Make it a modern day \n     Apollo project. Repeal oil industry tax breaks. Apply a 100% \n     tax rate on any salary over 10 million per year.\n       The economy is collapsing while [the Administration does \n     nothing]. We own a small\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\n     business; we want support for the middle class. The rich need \n     no help; let them earn a living for a change.\n     Mike, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am glad to see someone taking a stand that actually has a \n     chance to be heard. I am glad that we are going to try and \n     get some relief to the gas prices, but I think we should also \n     be looking into the contributing factors that are causing \n     such a demand for fuel.\n       I live in Meridian and must commute to Boise every day for \n     my job. I confronted my employer (a local utility company) \n     regarding other options to having to commute to Boise every \n     day when the air quaility was getting so bad like 4-day work \n     week, telecommuting, etc. and was told it was not an option. \n     My son is 5 years old and has asthma. Every time the air \n     quality gets bad, so does his health. Recently, with the \n     gigantic increase in fuel prices and the demand of fuel, I \n     confronted my employer again about other options that could \n     not only help with the air quality, but help contribute to \n     decreasing the demand of fuel; again, I was again turned \n     down. To me it seems that not only should we be going after \n     congress to help relieve the outrageous cost of fuel, but we \n     also need someone to tell employers to do what they can to \n     start helping with the problem instead of contributing to it. \n     Thank you for what you are doing and I hope a resolution is \n     on the horizon.\n     Nichole, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I received your email asking us to share our stories about \n     high energy costs so here goes. We live 5 miles from the \n     nearest grocery store and town. This means that every time we \n     get in the car, the round trip is a minimum of 10 miles. If \n     my husband and I both go into town a couple of times a day, \n     and only go to the nearest town, we drive a minimum of 40 \n     miles a day and that is without running errands. going to \n     another town or anything like that. When all is said and \n     done, it is much more like 60 miles a day. We also live in \n     snow country and must have 4-wheel drives so get about 15 mpg \n     which means at $4 per gallon, we spend about $16 just to get \n     to town and back which is almost $500 per month. It is \n     insane.\n       What is more insane is the idea that we can explore and \n     produce our way out of this mess. The US consumes about 26% \n     of the world's oil but only has about 2% of the world's oil \n     reserves. We would have to increase our reserves and \n     production 12 fold to cover today's demand and that is never \n     going to happen. The price of oil shot up when it became \n     clear we were going to invade Iraq--financial markets hate \n     uncertainty and invading another country is a big \n     uncertainty. As the war has dragged on and as our President \n     has talked about taking action against Iran, oil prices have \n     soared higher. The best thing our nation could do to lower \n     the price of oil would be to get out of a country we had no \n     business invading in the first place and start spending \n     more, much much more, on the plentiful wind, solar and \n     geothermal we have been blessed with.\n       Americans want this, the people of Idaho want this, I only \n     hope Senator Crapo is listening. I ask him to do the only \n     sane thing and think outside the oil box.\n     Leslie.\n                                  ____\n\n       I live with a husband who makes his money his. When I had a \n     job, I had an income and contributed to the groceries. It has \n     already been hard for me because I had been on medical leave \n     for over a year from a job I had for over six years that paid \n     a little over $11 an hour. During this time on medical leave, \n     I could not draw any income because of some ``catch 22'' \n     about if my doctor released me to go back to work with \n     limitations, and my job did not allow me to come back to \n     work, I did not apply for short-term disability or assistance \n     is what I was told. After my leave was exhausted and my \n     employer said they did not have a job for my physical \n     limitations, I was let go, and had to pay more money for \n     COBRA. Last fall I had enrolled in BSU with student loans \n     that barely cover school fees, books, and travel expenses as \n     it is, from Mountain Home to Boise and the Air Base. I was \n     doing very well for the first semester, but money was very \n     tight then. I ended up using my savings, my tax refund, and \n     my retirement from the company that let me go, just to pay \n     the bills. I found out that I have a rheumatoid arthritis, \n     osteo arthritis, spondylitis, depression, I take lots of \n     medications and I have had back surgery, neck surgery and I \n     am in pain most of the time. I am still waiting for my \n     disability hearing because it takes so long to get it \n     scheduled and I am down to maxed out credit cards and $150 \n     dollars in the bank. My husband wants me to leave him because \n     my medical bills are too expensive. I have two classes this \n     second twelve weeks at the Air Base in Mountain Home that \n     will end on June 30th. I do not know if I will continue with \n     my BSU degree because I cannot afford to drive to Boise \n     anymore. And if I do not get an income I may end up on the \n     street. I cannot pay back my credit cards that I used to pay \n     for living expenses and medical bills and prescriptions. They \n     are maxed out. I am going to have to sell my things to get \n     by.\n       To the Congressmen and Senators of this great country: Why \n     are we so hesitant to get on the ball and do something about \n     this crisis that filters down to more than gas? We cannot \n     afford to live on what we have got and now we have to pay \n     more?\n       While I am frustrated with my present circumstances, I know \n     God will take care of me. What I am really worried about is \n     this country and our leaders taking us down the path of \n     destruction. Our country needs leaders who will demonstrate \n     true authority, not bickering about what party did what or \n     who is better for our country. We need to put parties aside, \n     put aside differences, fall on our knees and ask God Almighty \n     to forgive this county its many sins and his forgiveness and \n     guidance.\n       [Please do your best to] to solve this crisis. I think we \n     should drill for oil, build refineries, make alternatives \n     available to the poor working public, use cooking oil instead \n     of gasoline, use sugar cane like they do in South America, \n     use wind power in windy places like Mountain Home, use \n     geothermal resources, solar power, anything that is greener \n     and healthier. [But please do it now and do not leave the \n     rest of us for fend for ourselves in this terrible economy!] \n     We are tired of the blame game. Someone do something and stop \n     filibustering and stalling progress. [Such efforts stop our \n     country from solving the problems we face.]\n       I know I went off on this a little long, but again, I am \n     totally frustrated with inactivity and red tape. Thank you \n     for all you do, but please remember the people who you work \n     for whether they voted you in or not.\n     Crystal, Mountain Home.\n                                  ____\n\n       Something needs to be done. Prices keep going up \n     everywhere. Not only is it affecting how much I spend in gas, \n     but my grocery bill is outrageous now; Also, Idaho Power has \n     just raised their rates. I have three children, which \n     includes a baby in diapers. It is getting to the point where \n     we can barely afford anything. It is really scary for us. We \n     never have had much money, and one of the things I use to do \n     with the kids was to go on ``drives'' just to get out of the \n     house. We would go to Chevron and get drinks, then drive to \n     different areas in Boise that we had not seen before and \n     listen to music. Now, we cannot even do that. Prices will \n     keep going up because they can, and people like us are going \n     to really ``pay'' for it in the long run. It makes me sick. \n     It is not like we are not trying to make it in life. I am a \n     student at Boise State and I will be a Respiratory Therapist. \n     We are not people looking for handouts. We are a family not \n     only trying to get by, but we want to live, too We want to \n     enjoy life also. It upsets me when even the little things \n     that we were able to do are now a luxury. Something has got \n     to be done. The reality is that there is really people who \n     cannot afford the rise in prices (for gas and everything \n     else). There has got to be some sort of stopping point. The \n     saying,'' The rich will get richer and the poor will get \n     poorer'' sounds more like the truth to me every day. \n     Hopefully, you can represent the families and the people who \n     are being affected by this.\n     S.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2469-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2469-S2470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            CENTRAL MISSOURI EAGLES YOUTH HOCKEY ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I recognize the Central \nMissouri Eagles Youth Hockey Association for their outstanding public \nservice to the community. Also, the Eagles have been presented with the \n``Honoring the Game Award,'' presented annually by the Positive \nCoaching Alliance at Stanford University in 2006.\n  The ``Honoring the Game Award'' recognizes three youth sports \nprograms that ``strive to win, but also strive to help their players \ndevelop skills that will serve them throughout their lifetimes.'' The \nEagles were the only Midwestern sports program and the only youth \nhockey program in the Nation to be honored.\n  The Eagles received the ``Honoring the Game Award'' in recognition \nfor their service to the community. Each year Eagles teams commit to a \nlocal service project. These projects make a meaningful difference in \nmid-Missouri, and they teach the Eagles players valuable citizenship \nlessons about volunteering.\n  The Hockey's program's credo ``Building Good Athletes and Great \nCitizens'' rings true and is the foundation for this program's athletes \nwho not only show good sportsmanship but are active every year in \ncommunity service. The best way for our young people to ensure a \nstronger America is to be active in their communities.\n  The Central Missouri Eagles Youth Hockey Associations' achievements \nrepresent a great deal of dedication. I trust that they will continue \nthe high standards of principle and perseverance that brought them this \nhonor. I hope the Eagles continue to comprise success both on and off \nthe rink. Again, I extend my congratulations to this exceptional \nassociation and the young people within it. \n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2470-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING GREG HERNANDEZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge and honor the \nwork of Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy, CURE, and its \nfounder, Susan Axelrod. I have known Susan personally for many years \nand can attest to her tireless work on behalf of her daughter, Lauren, \nand of other children and families affected by epilepsy. Epilepsy often \nbegins in childhood and even in its mildest forms can modify brain \ndevelopment, with lifelong effects on cognition ranging from learning \ndisabilities to severe developmental disabilities. In 1998, a small \ngroup of families whose children were suffering from epilepsy joined in \nrecognizing the need for an increased commitment to research. Together, \nthey formed the nonprofit, volunteer-based CURE. Led by Susan, they \nhave become tireless advocates for epilepsy awareness and have grown \ninto one of the foremost organizations in funding cutting-edge epilepsy \nresearch. To date, CURE has raised over $9 million in its crusade \ntoward eliminating seizures, reducing the side effects of currently \navailable treatments, and ultimately toward finding a cure for \nepilepsy. I commend CURE for its unrelenting commitment to this worthy \ncause but underscore the fact that they cannot work alone. Epilepsy \naffects over 3 million patients nationwide, and the need for adequate \nfunding for research on a Federal level is imperative if a cure is to \nbe found. At a time when the Nation is confronted with serious health \nchallenges like epilepsy, we must not diminish our commitment to \nmedical research.\n  Please join me in honoring Susan Axelrod and CURE for their years of \nvision, leadership, and commitment.\n  I would ask to have the following Parade Magazine article \nhighlighting the work of Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy \nprinted in the Record. The material follows:\n\n                 [From Parade Magazine, Feb. 15, 2009]\n\n                         I Must Save My Child \n\n                        (By Melissa Fay Greene)\n\n       When Susan Axelrod tells the story of her daughter, she \n     begins like most parents of children with epilepsy: The baby \n     was adorable, healthy, perfect. Lauren arrived in June 1981, \n     a treasured first-born. Susan Landau had married David \n     Axelrod in 1979, and they lived in Chicago, where Susan \n     pursued an MBA at the University of Chicago and David worked \n     as a political reporter for the Chicago Tribune. (He later \n     would become chief strategist for Barack Obama's Presidential \n     campaign and now is a senior White House adviser.) They were \n     busy and happy. Susan attended classes while her mother \n     babysat. Then, when Lauren was 7 months old, their lives \n     changed overnight.\n       ``She had a cold,'' Susan tells me as we huddle in the \n     warmth of a coffee shop in Washington, D.C., on a day of \n     sleet and rain. Susan is 55, fine-boned, lovely, and fit. She \n     has light-blue eyes, a runner's tan, and a casual fall of \n     silver and ash-blond hair. When her voice trembles or tears \n     threaten, she lifts her chin and pushes on. ``The baby was so \n     congested, it was impossible for her to sleep. Our \n     pediatrician said to give her one-quarter of an adult dose of \n     a cold medication, and it knocked her out immediately. I \n     didn't hear from Lauren the rest of the night. In the \n     morning, I found her gray and limp in her crib. I thought she \n     was dead.\n       ``In shock, I picked her up, and she went into a seizure--\n     arms extended, eyes rolling back in her head. I realized \n     she'd most likely been having seizures all night long. I \n     phoned my mother and cried, `This is normal, right? Babies do \n     this?' She said, `No, they don't.' ''\n       The Axelrods raced Lauren to the hospital. They stayed for \n     a month, entering a parallel universe of sleeplessness and \n     despair under fluorescent lights. No medicine relieved the \n     baby. She interacted with her parents one moment, bright-eyed \n     and friendly, only to be grabbed away from them the next, \n     shaken by inner storms, starting and stiffening, hands \n     clenched and eyes rolling. Unable to stop Lauren's seizures, \n     doctors sent the family home.\n       The Axelrods didn't know anything about epilepsy. They \n     didn't know that seizures were the body's manifestation of \n     abnormal electrical activity in the brain or that the \n     excessive neuronal activity could cause brain damage. They \n     didn't know that two-thirds of those diagnosed with epilepsy \n     had seizures defined as ``idiopathic,'' of unexplained \n     origin, as would be the case with Lauren. They didn't know \n     that a person could, on rare occasions, die from a seizure. \n     They didn't know that, for about half of sufferers, no drugs \n     could halt the seizures or that, if they did, the side \n     effects were often brutal. This mysterious disorder attacked \n     50 million people worldwide yet attracted little public \n     attention or research funding. No one spoke to the Axelrods \n     of the remotest chance of a cure.\n       At home, life shakily returned to a new normal, interrupted \n     by Lauren's convulsions and hospitalizations. Exhausted, \n     Susan fought on toward her MBA; David became a political \n     consultant. Money was tight and medical bills stacked up, but \n     the Axelrods had hope. Wouldn't the doctors find the right \n     drugs or procedures? ``We thought maybe it was a passing \n     thing,'' David says. ``We didn't realize that this would \n     define her whole life, that she would have thousands of these \n     afterward, that they would eat away at her brain.''\n       ``I had a class one night, I was late, there was an \n     important test,'' Susan recalls. ``I'd been sitting by Lauren \n     at the hospital. When she fell asleep, I left to run to \n     class. I got as far as the double doors into the parking lot \n     when it hit me: `What are you doing?' '' She returned to her \n     baby's bedside. From then on, though she would continue to \n     build her family (the Axelrods also have two sons) and \n     support her husband's career, Susan's chief role in life \n     would be to keep Lauren alive and functioning.\n       The little girl was at risk of falling, of drowning in the \n     bathtub, of dying of a seizure. Despite dozens of drug \n     trials, special diets, and experimental therapies, Lauren \n     suffered as many as 25 seizures a day. In between each, she \n     would cry, ``Mommy, make it stop!''\n       While some of Lauren's cognitive skills were nearly on \n     target, she lagged in abstract thinking and interpersonal \n     skills. Her childhood was nearly friendless. The drugs Lauren \n     took made her by turns hyperactive, listless, irritable, \n     dazed, even physically aggressive. ``We hardly knew who she \n     was,'' Susan says. When she acted out in public, the family \n     felt the judgment of onlookers. ``Sometimes,'' Susan says, \n     ``I wished I could put a sign on her back that said: \n     `Epilepsy. Heavily Medicated.' ''\n       At 17, Lauren underwent what her mother describes as ``a \n     horrific surgical procedure.'' Holes were drilled in her \n     skull, electrodes implanted, and seizures provoked in an \n     attempt to isolate their location in the brain. It was a \n     failure. ``We brought home a 17-year-old girl who had been \n     shaved and scalped, drilled, put on steroids, and given two \n     black eyes,'' Susan says quietly. ``We put her through hell \n     without result. I wept for 24 hours.''\n       The failure of surgery proved another turning point for \n     Susan. ``Finally, I thought, `Well, I can cry forever, or I \n     can try to make a change.' ''\n       Susan began to meet other parents living through similar \n     hells. They agreed that no federal agency or private \n     foundation was acting with the sense of urgency they felt, \n     leaving 3 million American families to suffer in near-\n     silence. In 1998, Susan and a few other mothers founded a \n     nonprofit organization to increase public awareness of the \n     realities of epilepsy and to raise money for research. They \n     named it after the one thing no one offered them: CURE--\n     Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy.\n       ``Epilepsy is not benign and far too often is not \n     treatable,'' Susan says. ``We wanted the public to be aware \n     of the death and destruction. We wanted the brightest minds \n     to engage with the search for a cure.''\n       Then-First Lady Hillary Clinton signed on to help; so did \n     other politicians and celebrities. Later, veterans back from \n     Iraq with seizures caused by traumatic brain injuries \n     demanded answers, too. In its first decade, CURE raised $9 \n     million, funded about 75 research projects, and inspired a \n     change in the scientific dialogue about epilepsy.\n       ``CURE evolved from a small group of concerned parents into \n     a major force in our research and clinical communities,'' \n     says Dr.\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\n     Frances E. Jensen, a professor of neurology at Harvard \n     Medical School. ``It becomes more and more evident that it \n     won't be just the doctors, researchers, and scientists \n     pushing the field forward. There's an active role for parents \n     and patients. They tell us when the drugs aren't working.''\n       The future holds promise for unlocking the mysteries of \n     what some experts now call Epilepsy Spectrum Disorder. \n     ``Basic neuroscience, electrophysiological studies, gene \n     studies, and new brain-imaging technologies are generating a \n     huge body of knowledge,'' Dr. Jensen says.\n       Lauren Axelrod, now 27, is cute and petite, with short \n     black hair and her mother's pale eyes. She speaks slowly, \n     with evident impairment but a strong Chicago accent. ``Things \n     would be better for me if I wouldn't have seizures,'' she \n     says. ``They make me have problems with reading and math. \n     They make me hard with everything.''\n       By 2000, the savagery and relentlessness of Lauren's \n     seizures seemed unstoppable. ``I thought we were about to \n     lose her,'' Susan says. ``Her doctor said, `I don't know what \n     else we can do.' '' Then, through CURE, Susan learned of a \n     new anti-convulsant drug called Keppra and obtained a sample. \n     ``The first day we started Lauren on the medication,'' Susan \n     says, ``her seizures subsided. It's been almost nine years, \n     and she hasn't had a seizure since. This drug won't work for \n     everyone, but it has been a magic bullet for Lauren. She is \n     blooming.''\n       Susan and David see their daughter regaining some lost \n     ground: social intuition, emotional responses, humor. ``It's \n     like little areas of her brain are waking up,'' Susan says. \n     ``She never has a harsh word for anyone, though she did think \n     the Presidential campaign went on a little too long. The \n     Thanksgiving before last, she asked David, `When is this \n     running-for-President thing going to be finished?' ''\n       CURE is run by parents. Susan has worked for more than a \n     decade without pay, pushing back at the monster robbing \n     Lauren of a normal life. ``Nothing can match the anguish of \n     the mom of a chronically ill child,'' David says, ``but Susan \n     turned that anguish into action. She's devoted her life to \n     saving other kids and families from the pain Lauren and our \n     family have known. What she's done is amazing.''\n       ``Complete freedom from seizures--without side effects--is \n     what we want,'' Susan says. ``It's too late for us, so we \n     committed ourselves to the hope that we can protect future \n     generations from having their lives defined and devastated by \n     this disorder.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2471-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING GROVER GUNDRILLING INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this week marks the Consortium of \nEntrepreneurship Education's 3rd Annual National Entrepreneurship Week, \na time to celebrate the history of American entrepreneurship and to \nhighlight new and upcoming entrepreneurs and small business owners. As \nranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am all the more aware of the countless \ncontributions entrepreneurs have made to the success of this Nation. In \nthat vein, I rise today to recognize Grover Gundril-\nling Inc., a small business in my home State of Maine that brings a \nvery unique and critical skill to the Northeast.\n  A second generation family-owned small business, Grover Gundrilling, \nor GGI, specializes in precision deephole drilling. With nearly 60 \nskilled employees, GGI has developed the capability to drill smooth, \nfinished holes ranging from .045 of an inch to 2 inches in diameter, \nfrom 1 ounce to 6,000 pounds, at a depth of 1 inch to 10 feet in every \nmaterial from Teflon to mold steels to exotic high-temperature alloys. \nFounded in 1983 by Rupert and Suzanne Grover, Grover Gundrilling now \nhas three facilities in Oxford County, including a 40,000-square-foot \nmanufacturing facility in the town of Norway. And as former teachers, \nthe Grovers like to hire employees with no background as machinists, \nbut with strong math and science skills, to train them in their own \nparticular fashion.\n  Given its remarkable growth, considerable capacity, and small company \nsize, GGI prides itself on being ``small enough to listen and large \nenough to handle production.'' Grover Gundrilling has become a critical \nsupplier for industries as diverse as aerospace engineering and nuclear \npower, and its components are used in products as varied as medical \ndevices and semiconductors.\n  To care for its staff, Grover Gundrilling generously provides its \nemployees with full family medical coverage, flexible scheduling, and \nthe company encourages its workers to pursue higher learning by \noffering educational reimbursement. And the company offers a multitude \nof incentives to stellar employees, including family snowmo-\nbiling trips and tickets to a variety of area events.\n  GGI is also dedicated to supporting its community in a variety of \nways. The Grovers donate significant time and energy to the Oxford \nCounty Fair, a fun-filled annual tradition for the families of Oxford \nCounty and western Maine. They also created the Boxberry School, a \nnonprofit independent elementary school for K through sixth graders \nthat combines multiage classes, individual attention, and an integrated \nart curriculum with the Maine Learning Results standards. The Grovers \nalso volunteer in various capacities with the 4-H Club, Androscoggin \nHome Health, the Oxford Food Pantry, and Aspire Higher, and Suzanne \nGrover serves on the board of directors of the Growth Council.\n  Carving out a niche in the machine tool world, Grover Gundrilling has \nexcelled as a leader in precision deephole drilling. It is \nentrepreneurs like Suzanne and Rupert Grover who are going to \nrevitalize our economy, and I am proud to call them constituents.

A bill to amend chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, to \nmodify\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\nthe computation for part-time service under the Civil Service \nRetirement System; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nKohl in introducing legislation to assist many of our Nation's public \nservants who choose to work part-time for a portion of their Federal \ncareer. The legislation is timely given the increasing number of \nFederal employees eligible to retire and the need for agencies to \nretain an experienced workforce to carry out critical government \nfunctions.\n  Our legislation would change the computation of Civil Service \nRetirement System, CSRS, annuities involving part-time service by \ncorrecting an anomaly that is a disincentive for employees nearing the \nend of their careers who would like to phase into retirement by working \npart-time. Under current law, if an employee under the CSRS system with \nsubstantial full-time service before 1986 switches to a part-time \nschedule at the end of his or her career, the high-three average salary \nthat is applied to service before 1986 is the pro-rated salary or, if \nhigher, the full-time salary from the years before the employee began \nworking part-time. This often results in a disproportionate reduction \nin the employee's benefit.\n  The legislation would clarify that CSRS annuities based in whole or \nin part on part-time service should be pro-rated for the period of \nservice that was performed on a part-time basis. The correction will \nhelp agencies, as part of their succession planning efforts, in \nretaining the expertise of staff that elect to work on a part-time \nbasis at the end of their Federal careers. It is my hope agencies will \ninclude this tool in their human capital plans to help facilitate the \ntransfer of knowledge to the next generation of government leaders.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 470. A bill to combat organized crime involving the illegal \nacquisition of retail goods for the purpose of selling those illegally \nobtained goods through physical and online retail marketplaces; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation that I \nam introducing today, the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act of 2009. \nThis legislation takes important steps to confront the growing problem \nof organized criminal activity involving stolen and resold retail \ngoods. This organized retail crime costs retailers billions of dollars \nper year and creates significant health and safety risks for consumers. \nMy legislation will toughen criminal laws and put in place effective \nregulatory and information-sharing measures to help retailers, \nsecondary marketplaces, and law enforcement agencies work together to \nstop this crime. I am pleased that my colleague Senator Klobuchar is \njoining me in introducing this important legislation, and I look \nforward to working with her and all my colleagues to see it passed into \nlaw.\n  I recently became Chairman of the Senate Crime and Drugs Subcommittee \nand I hope to hold a hearing in the Subcommittee on the problem of \norganized retail crime and the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act. I \nalso want to acknowledge that Congressman Bobby Scott, the Chairman of \nthe House Crime Subcommittee, and Congressman Brad Ellsworth are each \nintroducing bills to crack down on organized retail crime. I look \nforward to working with them and all of my colleagues to enact \nlegislation that will address this growing problem in a comprehensive \nand effective manner.\n  Organized retail crime rings currently operate across the Nation and \ninternationally. Their criminal activity begins with the coordinated \ntheft of large amounts of items from retail stores with the intent to \nresell those items. The foot soldiers in these organized retail crime \nrings are professional shoplifters, called ``boosters,'' who steal from \nretail stores such items as over-the-counter drugs, baby formula, \nmedical diagnostic tests, health and beauty aids, clothing, razor \nblades, and electronic devices. These boosters often use sophisticated \nmeans for evading retailer anti-theft safeguards, and occasionally \ndishonest retail employees are complicit in the theft. Each booster \nroutinely steals thousands of dollars worth of items from multiple \nstores, and delivers the items to a ``fence,'' or a person who buys \nstolen products from boosters for a fee that is frequently paid in cash \nor drugs.\n  Today, organized retail crime rings often enlist numerous fences to \ndeliver stolen retail goods to processing and storage warehouses \noperated by the rings. At these warehouse locations, teams of workers \nsort the stolen items, disable anti-theft tracking devices, and remove \nlabels that identify the items with a particular retailer. In some \ninstances, they alter items' expiration dates, replace labels with \nthose of more expensive products, or dilute products and repackage the \nmodified contents in seemingly-authentic packaging. Often, the \nconditions in which these stolen goods are transported, handled and \nstored are substandard, leading to the deterioration or contamination \nof the goods.\n  Organized retail crime rings typically resell their stolen \nmerchandise in physical marketplaces, such as flea markets and swap-\nmeets, or on Internet auction sites. Internet sites are particularly \ntempting avenues for these sales, since the Internet reaches a \nworldwide market and allows sellers to operate anonymously and maximize \nreturn.\n  Organized retail crime has a variety of harmful effects. Retailers \nand the FBI estimate that this crime costs retailers approximately $30 \nbillion per year and deprives states of hundreds of millions of dollars \nin lost sales tax revenues. The proceeds of organized retail crime can \nbe used to finance other forms of criminal behavior, including gang \nactivity, drug trafficking and international terrorism. Further, \norganized retail crime often involves the resale of consumable goods \nlike baby formula or medical diagnostic tests like diabetic strips, \nwhich can cause significant harm to consumers when stored improperly or \nsold past their expiration date.\n\n  Although the problem of organized retail crime predates the economic \ncrisis facing our nation, the current recession has lent more urgency \nto the need to curb organized retail crime. In recent months theft and \nshoplifting from retailers has increased and retailers' revenues have \ndecreased, thus enlarging the bite that organized retail crime has \ntaken out of retailers' balance sheets. A December 2008 survey by the \nRetail Industry Leaders Association found that 80 percent of the \nretailers surveyed reported experiencing an increase in organized \nretail crime since the start of the current economic downturn. In a \n2008 survey of loss prevention executives performed by the National \nRetail Federation, 85 percent of the 114 retailers surveyed indicated \nthat their company had been a victim of organized retail crime in the \npast 12 months. Many law enforcement officials predict that organized \nretail crime will continue to increase during these troubled economic \ntimes.\n  After I introduced legislation on this subject last Congress, I \nlistened to the views of stakeholders from law enforcement, the retail \ncommunity, and the Internet marketplace community, and have made \nseveral revisions to my legislation in response to their suggestions. \nThe legislation I am introducing today, the Combating Organized Retail \nCrime Act of 2009, would do the following:\n  First, it would toughen the criminal code's treatment of organized \nretail crime. It would refine certain offenses, such as the crimes of \ninterstate transport and sale of stolen goods, to capture conduct that \nis being committed by individuals engaged in organized retail crime. It \nwould also require the U.S. Sentencing Commission to consider relevant \nsentencing guideline enhancements.\n  Second, the bill would establish a reporting system through which \nevidence of organized retail crime can be effectively shared between \nthe victimized retailers, the marketplaces where items are being \nresold, and the Justice Department. The bill would create a form that \nretailers could use to describe suspected illegal sales activity \ninvolving goods that were stolen from that retailer. The retailer would \nsign and submit this form to both the Justice Department and to the \noperator of a physical or online marketplace where\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\nthe stolen goods are suspected of being offered for resale. Upon \nreceiving the form, the marketplace operator would be required to \nconduct an account review of the suspected sellers and provide the \nresults of that account review to the Justice Department. This \nreporting system would ensure that the Justice Department receives \ninformation from both retailers and marketplaces in order to piece \ntogether organized retail crime investigations and prosecutions.\n  Third, the bill would require that when a marketplace operator is \npresented with clear and convincing evidence that a seller on that \nmarketplace is selling stolen goods, the operator must terminate that \nseller's activities unless the seller can produce exculpatory evidence. \nThe bill would also require that when a marketplace operator is \npresented with evidence of criminal activity involving a seller who \noffers consumable goods or medical diagnostic tests on that \nmarketplace, the operator must immediately suspend the ability of that \nseller to sell such goods because of the potentially imminent danger to \npublic safety.\n  Additionally, the bill would require high-volume sellers on Internet \nmarketplace sites to provide a physical address to the marketplace \noperator. This address would be shared with the Justice Department and \nwith retailers who attest and provide evidence that the high-volume \nseller is suspected of reselling goods stolen from that retailer. This \naddress-sharing regime will permit appropriate inquiries to determine \nwhether high-volume Internet sellers are legitimate operations, and is \nsimilar to address-sharing regimes that permit inquiries into possible \ncopyright violations by online sellers.\n  In sum, the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act of 2009 is targeted \nlegislation that aims to deter organized retail crime and facilitate \nthe identification and prosecution of those who participate in it. The \nbill heightens the penalties for organized retail crime, shuts down \ncriminals who are selling stolen goods, and places valuable information \nabout illegal activity into the hands of law enforcement. This \nlegislation has broad support in the retail industry in my home state \nof Illinois and nationwide. It is supported by the Illinois Retail \nMerchants Association, the National Retail Federation, the Retail \nIndustry Leaders Association, the Food Marketing Institute, the \nNational Association of Chain Drug Stores, and the Coalition to Stop \nOrganized Retail Crime, whose members include such retail chains as \nWalgreens, Home Depot, Target, Wal-Mart, Safeway, and Macy's.\n  Organized retail crime is a growing problem nationwide. There is a \npressing need to address it, particularly in light of the weakening \neconomy and the risks such crime creates for unknowing consumers. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation so we can effectively \ncombat this crime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Organized Retail \n     Crime Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Organized retail crime involves the coordinated \n     acquisition of large volumes of retail merchandise by theft, \n     embezzlement, fraud, false pretenses, or other illegal means \n     from commercial entities engaged in interstate commerce, for \n     the purpose of selling or distributing such illegally \n     obtained items in the stream of commerce. Organized retail \n     crime is a growing problem nationwide that costs American \n     companies and consumers billions of dollars annually and that \n     has a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce.\n       (2) The illegal acquisition and black-market sale of \n     merchandise by persons engaged in organized retail crime \n     result in an estimated annual loss of hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in sales and income tax revenues to State and local \n     governments.\n       (3) The illegal acquisition, unsafe tampering and storage, \n     and unregulated redistribution of consumer products such as \n     baby formula, over-the-counter drugs, medical diagnostic \n     tests, and other items by persons engaged in organized retail \n     crime pose a health and safety hazard to consumers \n     nationwide.\n       (4) Investigations into organized retail crime have \n     revealed that the illegal income resulting from such crime \n     often benefits persons and organizations engaged in other \n     forms of criminal activity, such as drug trafficking and gang \n     activity.\n       (5) Items obtained through organized retail crime are \n     resold in a variety of different marketplaces, including flea \n     markets, swap meets, open-air markets, and Internet auction \n     websites. Increasingly, persons engaged in organized retail \n     crime use Internet auction websites to resell illegally \n     obtained items. The Internet offers such sellers a worldwide \n     market and a degree of anonymity that physical marketplace \n     settings do not offer.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 to \nrequire the Statistics Commissioner to collect information from \ncoeducational secondary schools on such schools' athletic programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the High School Sports \nInformation Collection Act. I am pleased to be joined again this year \nby my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray. Since the 108th \nCongress, we have introduced this bill to require that high schools, \nlike their collegiate counterparts, disclose data on equity in sports, \nmaking it possible for student athletes and their parents to ensure \nfairness in their school's athletic programs.\n  Since my first day in Washington in 1979, I have been a stalwart \nsupporter of Title IX. And there should be no mistake what this 37-\nyear-old landmark civil rights law is all about--equal opportunity for \nboth girls and boys to excel in athletics. Obviously, athletic \nparticipation supports physical health, but sports also impart benefits \nbeyond the playing field. For girls who engage in sports, half are less \nlikely to suffer depression and breast cancer, 80 percent are less \nlikely to have a drug problem, and 92 percent are less likely to have \nan unwanted pregnancy. Athletic competition helps cultivate the kind of \npositive, competitive spirit that develops dedication, self-confidence, \na sense of team spirit, and ultimate success later in life. So it's not \nsurprising that, according to several studies, more than eight out of \nten successful businesswomen played organized sports while growing up!\n  Without question, Title IX has been the driving factor in allowing \nthousands of women and girls the opportunity to benefit from \nintercollegiate and high school sports. Indeed, prior to Title IX, only \n1 in 27 high school girls--fewer than 300,000--played sports. Today, \nthe number is more than 2.9 million, that's an increase of over 900 \npercent! Moreover, our country is celebrating the achievements of our \nwomen athletes now more than ever. Just a few weeks ago, tennis player \nSerena Williams became the all-time prize-money leader in women's \nsports by reaching both the doubles and singles finals in the \nAustralian Open--not to mention that she won both titles! I am \nparticularly pleased that Ms. Williams expressed appreciation for Title \nIX, proving how impactful this policy has been in giving her, and many \nother women, the opportunity to play sports.\n  So while we celebrate this remarkable progress, we cannot allow \nourselves a ``time-out'' or rest on past success. That is why I am \npleased to work with Senator Patty Murray--who has been a tireless \nadvocate for women's sports--to reintroduce the High School Sports Data \nCollection Act of 2007. Our bill directs the Commissioner of the \nNational Center for Education Statistics to collect information \nregarding participation in athletics broken down by gender; teams; race \nand ethnicity; and overall expenditures, including items like travel \nexpenses, equipment and uniforms. These data are already reported, in \nmost cases, to the state Departments of Education and should not pose \nany additional burden on the high schools. Further, to ensure public \naccess to this vital information, our legislation would require high \nschools to post the data on the Department of Education's website and \nmake this information available to students and the public upon \nrequest.\n  For nearly 40 years, Title IX has opened doors by giving women and \ngirls an equal opportunity to participate in student athletic programs. \nThis bill will continue that tradition by allowing us to assess current \nopportunities for sports participation for young women, and correct any \ndeficiencies. With this new information, we can ensure that young women \nall over the country have the chance not only to improve their athletic \nability, but also to develop the qualities of teamwork, discipline, and \nself-confidence that lead to success off the playing field.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Reid, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 473. A bill to establish the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad \nFoundation; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Senator \nPaul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act.\n  This year marks the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth. We \nwill spend this bicentennial year reflecting on Lincoln's legacy, a \nlegacy that extends far beyond the Civil War. President Lincoln strove \nto democratize higher education. He enacted the Morrill Act, \nestablishing public land grant universities and opening the doors to a \ncollege education to more Americans.\n  As we recognize Lincoln's legacy this year, we can again transform \nhigher education. Today with Senator Wicker I am introducing the \nSenator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act, which has the potential \nto equip a new generation of Americans with the skills to live in a \nglobalized world.\n  The bill is named after the late Senator Paul Simon, a man whose \npassion for the public good remains an inspiration to all who knew him. \nShortly before his death in late 2003, Senator Simon came back to \nWashington to talk to his former colleagues about the need to \nstrengthen American security. He wondered how the United States could \nlead the world to stability, peace, and harmony when so many Americans \nare ignorant of the world. He envisioned a United States populated by a \ngeneration of Americans with greater international understanding--an \nunderstanding arrived at not by just studying the world, but by living \nin it. He believed this study abroad initiative would be as \ntransformative as Lincoln's work to expand access to college.\n  Paul's tireless efforts led to Congress' establishment of the Abraham \nLincoln Study Abroad Commission. I was honored to serve on this \nbipartisan Lincoln Commission, and it was a privilege for me to \nintroduce legislation in the past two Congresses to\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\nbring Paul Simon's dream closer to reality. The bill is based on the \nCommission's recommendations for a study abroad program for \nundergraduate students that will help build global awareness and \ninternational understanding. In the last Congress, this bill was \nsupported by 50 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act has big goals. It \ndeclares our intention to send one million students abroad per year \nwithin the next decade. More of those students will study in the \ndeveloping world and the students we send will be more diverse in terms \nof race, socioeconomic background, and field of study. To accomplish \nthese goals, a small public-private entity, the Senator Paul Simon \nFoundation, will award grants to students and institutions of higher \neducation. The goal of the program is to make study abroad in high-\nquality programs in diverse locations around the world more common for \nall college students. Grants to colleges and universities will be used \nto encourage tearing down institutional barriers to study abroad. By \nleveraging change at the institution level, the Foundation will create \nopportunities for countless students--far more than possible through \ndirect student grants alone.\n  Expanding study abroad should be a national priority. The future of \nthe country depends on globally literate citizens who are at ease in \nthe world. In his troubled time, Lincoln said, ``The occasion is piled \nhigh with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case \nis new, so we must think anew, and act anew.'' Today, our Nation also \nfaces an occasion piled high with difficulty. By passing the Senator \nPaul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act, we will send the next \ngeneration of Americans out into the world with open minds and they \nwill come back able to think anew and act anew. I ask my colleagues to \njoin Senator Wicker and me in support of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 473\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study \n     Abroad Foundation Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to former President George W. Bush, \n     ``America's leadership and national security rest on our \n     commitment to educate and prepare our youth for active \n     engagement in the international community.''.\n       (2) According to former President William J. Clinton, \n     ``Today, the defense of United States interests, the \n     effective management of global issues, and even an \n     understanding of our Nation's diversity require ever-greater \n     contact with, and understanding of, people and cultures \n     beyond our borders.''.\n       (3) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission \n     on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program \n     pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations \n     and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199). \n     Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission has submitted \n     to Congress and the President a report of its recommendations \n     for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at \n     institutions of higher education in the United States to \n     study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing \n     nations.\n       (4) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[s]tudy abroad \n     is one of the major means of producing foreign language \n     speakers and enhancing foreign language learning'' and, for \n     that reason, ``is simply essential to the [N]ation's \n     security''.\n       (5) Studies consistently show that United States students \n     score below their counterparts in other advanced countries on \n     indicators of international knowledge. This lack of global \n     literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade \n     and business, global interdependence, and global terror.\n       (6) Americans believe that it is important for their \n     children to learn other languages, study abroad, attend a \n     college where they can interact with international students, \n     learn about other countries and cultures, and generally be \n     prepared for the global age.\n       (7) In today's world, it is more important than ever for \n     the United States to be a responsible, constructive leader \n     that other countries are willing to follow. Such leadership \n     cannot be sustained without an informed citizenry with \n     significant knowledge and awareness of the world.\n       (8) Study abroad has proven to be a very effective means of \n     imparting international and foreign-language competency to \n     students.\n       (9) In any given year, only approximately one percent of \n     all students enrolled in United States institutions of higher \n     education study abroad.\n       (10) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from \n     United States institutions of higher education with bachelors \n     degrees have studied abroad.\n       (11) Far more study abroad must take place in developing \n     countries. Ninety-five percent of the world's population \n     growth over the next 50 years will occur outside of Europe. \n     Yet in the academic year 2004-2005, 60 percent of United \n     States students studying abroad studied in Europe, and 45 \n     percent studied in four countries--the United Kingdom, Italy, \n     Spain, and France--according to the Institute of \n     International Education.\n       (12) The Final Report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission \n     Report) recommended that the United States increase support \n     for ``scholarship, exchange, and library programs''. The 9/11 \n     Public Discourse Project, successor to the 9/11 Commission, \n     noted in its November 14, 2005, status report that this \n     recommendation was ``unfulfilled,'' and stated that ``[t]he \n     U.S. should increase support for scholarship and exchange \n     programs, our most powerful tool to shape attitudes over the \n     course of a generation.''. In its December 5, 2005, Final \n     Report on the 9/11 Commission Recommendations, the 9/11 \n     Public Discourse Project gave the government a grade of ``D'' \n     for its implementation of this recommendation.\n       (13) Investing in a national study abroad program would \n     help turn a grade of ``D'' into an ``A'' by equipping United \n     States students to communicate United States values and way \n     of life through the unique dialogue that takes place among \n     citizens from around the world when individuals study abroad.\n       (14) An enhanced national study abroad program could help \n     further the goals of other United States Government \n     initiatives to promote educational, social, and political \n     reform and the status of women in developing and reforming \n     societies around the world, such as the Middle East \n     Partnership Initiative.\n       (15) To complement such worthwhile Federal programs and \n     initiatives as the Benjamin A.

A bill to amend the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \nto apply whistleblower protections available to certain executive \nbranch employees to legislative branch employees, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to introduce another bill as part \nof my Accountability in Government Week. Yesterday I introduced the \nFalse Claims Act Clarification Act to help restore the original intent \nof the most successful law the Government utilizes to protect \ntaxpayers' dollars from fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  One key component I added to the False Claims Act when it was amended \nin 1986 was allowing whistleblowers to file cases on behalf of the \nGovernment when they are aware of fraud or abuse of taxpayers' funds. \nWhistleblowers are the key to unlocking the secrets of wrongdoing \nbecause they have access to information about how the frauds were \nperpetrated and can help lead authorities in the right direction to \nuncover the fraud. However, for their brave efforts whistleblowers are \noften the victims of retaliation and are removed from their jobs by \nsupervisors who do not want the wrongdoing uncovered.\n  I have often said whistleblowers were as welcome as skunks at a \npicnic, despite the fact that all they do is bring forward the truth. \nThis is wrong. That is why I have supported strong whistleblower \nprotection laws during my time in the Congress.\n  The landmark whistleblower law is the Whistleblower Protection Act of \n1989--I believe is the year it was passed--providing rights and \nremedies to executive branch whistleblowers who are the victims of \nretaliation. I proudly cosponsored that bill. But like many laws that \nare 20 years old, it needs to be updated. So I have cosponsored \nlegislation introduced by Democratic Senator Akaka to do just that. \nHowever, that law also needs to be extended to employees of the \nlegislative and judicial branches of Government. So I come today to \nstart the discussion and to introduce legislation that will provide the \nsame whistleblower protection rights currently extended to executive \nbranch employees to the legislative branch.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator McCaskill in introducing the \nCongressional Whistleblower Protection Act of 2009. This important \nlegislation simply adds whistleblower protections to the legislative \nbranch by incorporating the Whistleblower Protection Act into the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995, a law that I authored to \nbring Congress in line with many labor and workplace practices that \naffected businesses around the country because I have long believed \nCongress should practice what it preaches. This legislation will do \njust that.\n  You might remember the Congressional Accountability Act was passed \nbecause, going back to the 1930s, Congress had exempted itself from a \nlot of employment laws because we individual Senators are employers, \nthe Congress is an employer, but we exempted ourselves from, I think, \n18, 19 different laws at that particular time.\n  So in 1995 I wanted to end the proposition of why we had two sets of \nlaws in this country--one for Capitol Hill and one for the rest of the \ncountry. Now, since 1995, we have one set of laws, but we do not have \nthe whistleblower protections that ought to be in it.\n  A theme that has dominated this new Congress, as well as dominated \nthe campaign of last fall, is accountability and responsibility in \nWashington. In most instances, the only reason we discovered waste or \nfraud is because employees were brave enough to stand up to the \nwrongdoers and to expose the offenses. Without these whistleblowers, \nthe American taxpayer would continue to foot a bill that might be a \nviolation of law, might be fraudulent use of taxpayers' money, might \njust be a waste of taxpayer money. Either way, taxpayers are hurt.\n  This bill is long overdue. I have previously introduced similar \nlegislation, but, unfortunately, those bills were never brought out of \ncommittee. I hope the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee, of which the chairman is on the Senate floor--I did not know \nthe Senator would be so available for me to preach to him. I hope the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will examine this \nlegislation and will closely and expeditiously report it to the full \nSenate so we can ensure employees of the legislative branch that they \nare protected from any reprisals relating to protected whistleblowing \nthe same way as executive branch employees.\n  Now, it has been a number of years since the Congressional \nAccountability Act was signed into law. So I would like to remind my \ncolleagues why we passed that law. It was a time very similar to today. \nThe American people were demanding more from their elected officials in \nWashington and wanted accountability and transparency in all branches \nof Government. I believed then, as I do now, that Congress needs to put \nits money where its mouth is and apply the various labor and employment \nlaws that were enforced on other branches of Government and businesses \nall across the country.\n  That is what the Congressional Accountability Act did. It applied a \nnumber of important laws to Congress, including the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, title VII, the Civil Rights Act, the Americans With \nDisabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family \nMedical Leave Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Employee \nPolygraph Protection Act, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification \nAct, the Rehabilitation Act, as well as some provisions of title V \nrelating to Federal service labor-management relations. It also created \nthe Office of Compliance of the legislative branch that oversees the \napplication of these important laws to this branch of Government and \nensures that employees' rights under these laws are protected.\n  While the Congressional Accountability Act was a good start, the \nOffice of Compliance has recommended additional laws be applied to the \nlegislative branch, including the purpose of my bill, the Whistleblower \nProtection Act.\n  We have already taken the steps to protect whistleblowers in the \nexecutive branch, so it does not make sense not to extend those same \nprotections to whistleblowers working right here in our own backyard on \nCapitol Hill. My bill will, very simply, give congressional employees \nthe same protections that workers of other branches of Government have. \nIt does this by simply adding the Whistleblower Protection Act to the \npreexisting list of statutes that are applied to the legislative branch \nby the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  This is a straightforward and simple solution to ensuring that \nemployees of the legislative branch are not without vital whistleblower \nprotections. So I ask, in closing, that my colleagues join me and \nSenator McCaskill in supporting this bill to ensure that those who help \nus in the fight to hold Government accountable are not punished for \nthose efforts.\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 481. A bill to authorize additional Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation field agents to investigate financial crimes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill with Senator \nWhitehouse to extend the reach of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \ninto financial crimes that may have helped precipitate last year's \neconomic meltdown.\n  We must investigate and scrutinize this financial crisis as we would \na terrorist attack in order to determine its causes and how to preempt \nanother economic collapse in the United States.\n  Following the September 11 attacks, the FBI redirected approximately \n1,000 agents to counterterrorism and counterintelligence activities. \nWithout a doubt, there is no argument that our country has benefitted \nfrom the dedicated efforts of the men and women of the FBI who are \nperforming this valuable work.\n  Over a 10-year period, from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2008, \nCongress has increased direct appropriations for the FBI from $2.993 \nbillion and 26,693 positions to $6.658 billion--122 percent increase--\nand 30,211 positions--13 percent increase. Most of these new resources \nwere provided in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as the \nFBI redirected its resources toward combating domestic and \ninternational terrorism by improving its intelligence gathering and \nprocessing capabilities. As a consequence, for fiscal year 2008, about \n60 percent of FBI funding and staffing is allocated to national \nsecurity programs, including counterterrorism and counterintelligence.\n  In view of the breadth and severity of the economic crisis brought on \nby events in U.S. financial markets, however, I am very concerned that \ncriminal wrongdoing may have played a significant role in crippling \nsome of America's largest companies. Criminal activity, such as fraud, \nmisrepresentation, self-dealing, and insider trading may have \ninstigated or exacerbated the financial industry upheaval of 2008-2009.\n  In order to augment FBI investigations of financial crimes, the FBI \nPriorities Act of 2009 authorizes $150 million for each of the fiscal \nyears 2010 through 2014 to fund approximately 1,000 Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation field agents in addition to the number of field agents \nserving on the date of enactment. It is my hope that this extra \nmanpower will enable the FBI to develop leads on unlawful actions, dig \ndeeply into those leads, and bring responsible parties to justice. The \nAmerican public deserves no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Alexander, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Reed, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 482. A bill to require Senate candidates to file designations, \nstatements, and reports in electronic form; read the first time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will once again introduce with \nthe senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, the Senate Campaign \nDisclosure Parity Act, a bill to require that Senate candidates file \ntheir campaign finance disclosure reports electronically and that those \nreports be promptly made available to the public. This step is long \noverdue; indeed I first introduced this bill in 2003. I hope that the \nSenate will act quickly on this legislation this year.\n  A series of reports by the Campaign Finance Institute has highlighted \nthe anomaly in the election laws that makes it nearly impossible for \nthe public to get access to Senate campaign finance reports while most \nother reports are available on the Internet within 24 hours of their \nfiling with the Federal Election Commission, FEC. The Campaign Finance \nInstitute asks a rhetorical question: ``What makes the Senate so \nspecial that it exempts itself from a key requirement of campaign \nfinance disclosure that applies to everyone else, including candidates \nfor the House of Representatives and Political Action Committees?''\n  The answer, of course, is nothing. The U.S. Senate is special in many \nways. I am proud to serve here. But there is no excuse for keeping our \ncampaign finance information inaccessible to the public when the \ninformation filed by House candidates or others is readily available.\n  My bill amends the section of the election laws dealing with \nelectronic filing to require reports filed with the Secretary of the \nSenate to be filed electronically and forwarded to the FEC within 24 \nhours. The FEC is required to make available on the Internet within 24 \nhours any filing it receives electronically. So if this bill is \nenacted, electronic versions of Senate reports should be available to \nthe public within 48 hours of their filing. That will be a vast \nimprovement over the current situation, which, according to the \nCampaign Finance Institute, requires journalists and interested members \nof the public to review computer images of paper-filed copies of \nreports, and involves a completely wasteful expenditure of hundreds of \nthousands of dollars to re-enter information into databases that almost \nevery campaign has available in electronic format.\n  The current filing system also means that the detailed coding that \nthe FEC does, which allows for more sophisticated searches and \nanalysis, is completed over a week later for Senate reports than for \nHouse reports. This means that the final disclosure reports covering \nthe first two weeks of October are often not susceptible to detailed \nscrutiny before the election. According to the Campaign Finance \nInstitute, in the 2006 election, ``[v]oters in six of the hottest \nSenate races were out of luck the week before the November 7 election \nif they did Web searches for information on general election \ncontributions since June 30. . . . In all ten of the most closely \nfollowed Senate races voters were unable to search through any \ncandidate reports for information on pre-general election (October 1-\n18) donations.'' And a September 18, 2006, column by Jeffery H. \nBirnbaum in the Washington Post noted that ``When the polls opened in \nNovember 2004, voters were in the dark about $53 million in individual \nSenate contributions of $200 or more dating all the way back to July. . \n. .''\n  Because the Senate failed to pass this bill last Congress, even \nthough we had 48 bipartisan cosponsors and no known opposition, and \neven though the Senate Rules Committee reported the bill by voice vote, \nthe same problem existed for Senate elections in the 2008 cycle. In \naddition, because of the expense, when the FEC puts information from \nthe paper filings in its electronic database, it only enters \ncontributions, not expenditures. So anyone interested in how a Senate \ncampaign is spending its money has to consult the paper forms.\n  As Roll Call said in its recent editorial in favor of the bill, \n``[i]t's time for this nonsense to come to an end.'' It is time for the \nSenate to at long last relinquish its backward attitude toward campaign \nfinance disclosure. I urge the enactment of this simple bill that will \nmake our reports subject to the same prompt, public scrutiny as those \nfiled by PACs, House and Presidential candidates, and even 527 \norganizations. I close with another question from the Campaign Finance \nInstitute: ``Isn't it time that the Senate join the 21st century and \nallow itself to vote on a simple legislative fix that could \nsignificantly improve our democracy?'' This Congress, let us finally \nanswer that question in the affirmative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the Roll Call \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Feb. 11, 2009]\n\n                               Outrageous\n\n       In this year when ``transparency'' is all the rage, it \n     would be appropriate for the Senate--at long last--to join \n     the House and every federal political committee in filing \n     campaign finance reports electronically.\n       Fundraising and spending reports for the end of 2008 were \n     due on Jan. 31. Reports for House Members and candidates and \n     the Republican and Democratic parties and their campaign \n     committees all were instantly available to the media, \n     watchdog groups and the public on the Federal Election \n     Commission's Web site.\n       But Senate reports take weeks from the filing deadline to \n     make it into the public realm. And when they are made \n     available, it's at the conclusion of a circuitous process\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\n     that costs taxpayers an estimated $250,000 a year that could \n     be far better spent elsewhere--almost anywhere else--or \n     simply used to narrow the federal deficit.\n       Moreover, because of the expense, the FEC does not \n     electronically post Senate campaign expenditures, only \n     contributions--a gap that Steve Weissman of the Campaign \n     Finance Institute correctly calls ``outrageous.''\n       Senators use FEC-approved software to compile their \n     reports, but then they snail-mail paper copies to the office \n     of the Secretary of the Senate, which then scans some 27,000 \n     pages and sends them electronically to the FEC.\n       They can be then combed through page by page on the FEC Web \n     site, but not digitally manipulated or matched. The FEC hires \n     a contractor to key the data into digital form. Only then, a \n     month or more after the filing deadline, can the data be \n     searched and connections made, if any, between money \n     collected and votes or positions Senators or their opponents \n     have taken.\n       But it still takes page-by-page searching to review \n     candidates' spending--to determine, for instance, if \n     candidates' relatives are on the campaign payroll.\n       All this ridiculous complexity is necessary because in 2000 \n     the Senate exempted itself from an electronic filing \n     requirement written into the FEC's appropriation. Legislation \n     to correct the situation has been regularly introduced by \n     Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), and it's regularly had dozens of \n     co-sponsors.\n       But it's never passed. Change was resisted at first by Sen. \n     Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), who wanted to maintain a fusty Senate \n     ``prerogative,'' and then by various Republican Senators who \n     wanted to attach amendments that amounted to ``poison \n     pills.''\n       Last year, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee \n     approved the bill for floor action, but it was blocked by \n     Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) who sought to add a provision \n     requiring disclosure of the donors to any organization filing \n     ethics complaints against a Senator. The bill never was voted \n     on.\n       It's time for this nonsense to come to an end. Feingold is \n     planning to re-introduce the measure soon. It ought to be \n     processed promptly by the Rules Committee, now chaired by \n     Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), and pushed to the floor for \n     passage as early in the year as possible so if it's subject \n     to more shenanigans, they can be exposed and resolved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 483. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of Mark Twain; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Mark Twain \nCommemorative Coin Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nLieberman, Boxer, Schumer, McCaskill, and Bond in cosponsoring this \nlegislation, which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \n100,000 five-dollar gold coins and 500,000 silver dollar coins in a \ndesign emblematic of the life and legacy of Mark Twain.\n  Samuel L. Clemens, better known by his pen name ``Mark Twain,'' was \nborn in 1835 in Florida, Missouri, and died in 1910 while residing in \nmy home State of Connecticut. As many of us know from having read his \nworks, Twain is an iconic author who has left an indelible mark on our \nNation's history. Two of his most renowned works, ``The Adventures of \nTom Sawyer'' and ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' have become a \ncentral part of the American literary canon and are still widely read \nin schools and universities across the country. Another enduring work, \nentitled ``The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today,'' satirized the excesses of \nthe age during which it was written, and solidified Twain's reputation \nas a fierce but subtle social critic. His writings evoke discussions of \nrace, politics, and economic inequality, all issues with which our \nnation continues to struggle as we become a ``more perfect union.''\n  This bill will allow the Treasury to mint and issue coins in \ncommemoration of Mark Twain's lasting contributions to America's \nliterary tradition and cultural heritage. A portion of proceeds from \nsurcharges of $35 and $10 applied to each gold and silver coin sold to \nthe public will be distributed by the Treasury to support four \ninstitutions critical to the mission of promoting Mark Twain's legacy: \nThe Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, CT; the Mark Twain Project \nat the Bancroft Library of the University of California, in Berkeley, \nCA; the Center for Mark Twain Studies at Elmira College, in New York; \nand the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum in Hannibal, MO.\n  The Mark Twain House and Museum in Hartford, CT, is a national \nhistoric landmark. Each year, over 60,000 visitors flock there, many of \nthem from outside my home State. This site offers a unique experience \nto all who visit, and serves as a center for educating young and old \nalike about Mark Twain's life and legacy. However, as recent news \narticles have reported, the Mark Twain House and Museum has--not unlike \nmany other nonprofit entities across the country in the midst of the \neconomic downturn--struggled to cover operating costs solely on private \ndonations, and the financial challenges it currently faces are \nsubstantial. Passing this legislation will help to support the \ncontinued operation and restoration of the Mark Twain House, and \npromote its goals by honoring Mark Twain with a commemorative coin \ndesirable to coin collectors as well as enthusiasts of American history \nand literature.\n  Congressman John Larson of Connecticut is introducing companion \nlegislation today in the House of Representatives. As a procedural \nmatter, the House Financial Services Committee requires no less than \n290 cosponsors for any commemorative coin bill to come under committee \nconsideration, and similar cosponsorship rules are in place for the \nSenate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Moreover, the \nHouse adheres to a tradition of interpreting commemorative coin bills \nas ``revenue-raisers'' subject to the origination clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. Passing the Mark Twain Commemorative Coin Act through \nboth Houses will require no small amount of effort, but today marks an \nimportant first step as we put this legislative proposal forward and \nbegin to generate broad public support for the effort. Once Congressman \nLarson's companion bill meets the necessary requirements and is adopted \nby the full House, I intend to press it forward here in the Senate.\n  The legislation I am introducing will require broad bipartisan \nsupport to meet the high threshold for commemorative coin legislation \nestablished by the rules of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs, so I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation \nand join me in supporting the life and legacy of Mark Twain, as well as \nthe important places in our Nation that promote further study and \neducation on his significant contributions to American history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mark Twain Commemorative \n     Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Samuel Clemens--better known to the world as Mark \n     Twain--was a unique American voice whose literary work has \n     had a lasting effect on our Nation's history and culture;\n       (2) Mark Twain remains one of the best known Americans in \n     the world, with over 6,500 editions of his books translated \n     into 75 languages;\n       (3) Mark Twain's literary and educational legacy remains \n     strong even today, with nearly every book he wrote still in \n     print, including ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' and \n     ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''--both of which have never \n     gone out of print since they were first published over a \n     century ago;\n       (4) in the past 2 decades alone, there have been more than \n     100 books published and over 250 doctoral dissertations \n     written on Mark Twain's life and work;\n       (5) even today, Americans seek to know more about the life \n     and work of Mark Twain, as people from around the world and \n     across all 50 States annually flock to National Historic \n     Landmarks like the Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, \n     Connecticut and the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum in \n     Hannibal, Missouri; and\n       (6) Mark Twain's work is remembered today for addressing \n     the complex social issues facing America at the turn of the \n     century, including the legacy of the Civil War, race \n     relations, and the economic inequalities of the ``Gilded \n     Age''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal \nthe Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help protect the retirement benefits earned by our Nation's \npublic service workers.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins, as well as Senators Durbin, Kerry, Brown, Cardin, Boxer, \nLincoln, Whitehouse, Nelson of Florida, and Menendez.\n  This bill will repeal two provisions of the Social Security Act--the \nGovernment pension offset and the windfall elimination provision--that \nunfairly reduce retirement benefits for teachers, police officers, and \nfirefighters.\n  These two provisions were originally designed--the Government pension \noffset in 1977 and the windfall elimiantion provision in 1983--to \nprevent public employees from being unduly enriched.\n  But, the practical effect is that those providing critical public \nservices are unjustly penalized.\n  Approximately 1\\1/2\\ million Federal, State, and municipal workers, \nas well as teachers and other school district employees, are held to a \ndifferent standard when it comes to retirement benefits.\n  In California, the problem affects about 200,000 workers.\n  The Government pension offset reduces a public employee's Social \nSecurity spousal or survivor benefits by an amount equal to two-thirds \nof the individual's public pension.\n  In most cases, the Government pension offset eliminates the spousal \nbenefit for which an individual qualifies. Three quarters of employees \naffected by the Government pension offset lose their entire spousal \nbenefit, even though their spouse paid Social Security taxes for many \nyears.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Government \npension offset provision alone reduces the retirement benefits earned \nby nearly 500,000 Americans each year by an average of $500 per month.\n  The windfall elimination provision reduces Social Security benefits \nby up to 50 percent for retirees who have paid into Social Security and \nalso receive a public pension, such as from a State teacher retirement \nfund.\n  Private-sector retirees receive monthly Social Security checks equal \nto 90 percent of their first $744 in average monthly career earnings, \nplus 32 percent of monthly earnings up to $4,483 and 15 percent of \nearnings above $4,483.\n  Under the windfall elimination provision, retired public employees, \nhowever, are only allowed to receive 40 percent of the first $744 in \ncareer monthly earnings, a penalty of over $350 per month.\n  Our legislation will allow government pensioners the chance to earn \nthe same 90 percent to which nongovernment pension recipients are \nentitled.\n  For those living on fixed incomes, in some cases this represents the \ndifference between a comfortable retirement and poverty.\n  Americans are hurting as our economy continues to contract.\n  More than $4 trillion in retirement savings were lost last year as \nmarkets destabilized and investments soured.\n  Retirees on fixed incomes have been especially impacted by this \nrecession. Every dollar matters to a retiree struggling to pay bills \nand meet mortgage obligations.\n  In California, more than 837,000 foreclosures were filed last year. \nThe roughly $500 lost by beneficiaries to the Government pension offset \neach month may mean the difference between foreclosure and keeping \none's home.\n  This is also critical for seniors residing in assisted living \nfacilities or retirement communities concerned about paying the \nincreasingly high cost of care.\n  Our Nation's unemployment rate stands at 7.6 percent. And, in my \nState, over 1.7 million people are out of work. For those close to \nretirement who have lost their jobs, reductions in Social Security \nbenefits compound an already challenging situation.\n  We must also eliminate the barriers which discourage many Americans \nfrom pursuing careers in public service.\n  This is more difficult now than ever, as states face mounting \ndeficits and painful budget cuts. Communities must be able to retain \ntheir most qualified teachers, police officers, and firefighters.\n  Unfortunately, the Government pension offset and windfall elimination \nprovision only contribute to this problem at a time when we should be \ndoing everything we possibly can to bring the best and brightest to \nthese careers.\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\n  It is estimated that schools will need to hire between 1.7 million \nand 2.7 million new teachers nationwide by the end of this year because \nof record enrollments in public schools.\n  The projected retirements of thousands of veteran teachers and \ncritical efforts to reduce class sizes also necessitate hiring \nadditional teachers.\n  California currently has roughly 310,000 teachers but will need to \ndouble this number over the next decade, to 600,000 teachers, in order \nto keep up with student enrollment levels.\n  It is counterintuitive that on the one-hand, policymakers seek to \nencourage people to change careers and enter the teaching profession, \nwhile on the other hand, those wishing to do so are told that their \nretirement benefits will be significantly reduced.\n  I certainly recognize that our Federal budget deficit and national \ndebt make repealing the Government pension offset and windfall \nelimination provision difficult.\n  And, I remain open to considering any alternatives that will allow \nhard working employees to keep the Social Security benefits to which \nthey are entitled.\n  But the bottom line is that we should respect, not penalize, our \npublic service employees.\n  In the 110th Congress, 38 Senators joined me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation. In the House of Representatives, 351 Members of Congress \nsupported Representative Howard Berman's companion bill. Our bill \nenjoys the support of more than three quarters of the entire House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The reason for this support is because public servants across the \ncountry are calling on Congress to act.\n  It is long overdue that we resolve this inequity, and it is time that \nthis body protects retirement benefits for public employees and \nformulates a more cohesive approach to promoting public sector \nemployment.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will join me in protecting the \nretirement benefits of our Nation's hard working public servants. We \nvalue their contributions and must ensure that all Americans receive \nthe retirement benefits they have earned and deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 484\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to \n     monthly insurance benefits payable under title II of the \n     Social Security Act for months after December 2009. \n     Notwithstanding section 215(f) of the Social Security Act, \n     the Commissioner of Social Security shall adjust primary \n     insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into \n     account the amendments made by section 3.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Social Security \nFairness Act, which repeals both the windfall elimination provision, \nWEP, and the Government pension offset, GPO. We believe that these two \nprovisions in the Social Security Act unfairly penalize individuals for \nholding jobs in public service when the time comes for them to retire.\n  These two provisions have enormous financial implications for many of \nour teachers, police officers, firefighters, postal workers and other \npublic employees. Given their important responsibilities, it is simply \nunfair to penalize them when it comes to their Social Security \nbenefits. These public servants--or their spouses--have all paid taxes \ninto the Social Security system. So have their employers. They have \nworked long enough to earn their Social Security benefits. Yet because \nof the GPO and WEP, they are unable to receive all of the Social \nSecurity benefits to which they otherwise would be entitled.\n  The impact of these two provisions is most acute in 15 States, \nincluding Maine, which have State retirement plans that lack a Social \nSecurity component. However, it is important to point out that the GPO \nand WEP affect public employees and retirees in every State, and in \nparticular our emergency responders, our postal workers and our other \nFederal employees. Nationwide, more than one-third of teachers and \neducation employees, and more than one-fifth of other public employees, \nare affected by the GPO and/or the WEP.\n  Almost 1 million retired public employees across the country have \nalready been harmed by these provisions. Many more stand to be harmed \nin the future. Moreover, at a time when we should be doing all that we \ncan to attract qualified people to public service, this reduction in \nretirement benefits makes it even more difficult for our Federal, State \nand local governments to recruit and retain the public servants who are \nso critical to the safety and well-being of our families.\n  What is most troubling is that this offset is most harsh for those \nwho can least afford the loss: lower income women. In fact, of those \naffected by the GPO, over 70 percent are women. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for more than \n200,000 individuals by more than $3,600 a year--an amount that can make \nthe difference between a comfortable retirement and poverty.\n  Many Maine teachers, in particular, have talked with me about the \nimpact of these provisions on their retirement security. They love \ntheir jobs and the children they teach, but they worry about the future \nand about their financial security.\n  In September of 2003, I chaired an oversight hearing to examine the \neffect that the GPO and the WEP have had on public employees and \nretirees. We heard compelling testimony from Julia Worcester of \nColumbia, ME, who was then 73. Mrs. Worcester told the committee about \nher work in both Social Security-covered employment and as a Maine \nteacher, and about the effect that the GPO and WEP have had on her \nincome in retirement.\n  Mrs. Worcester had worked for more than 20 years as a waitress and in \nfactory jobs before deciding, at the age of 49, to go back to school to \npursue her life-long dream of becoming a teacher. She began teaching at \nthe age of 52 and taught full-time for 15 years before retiring at the \nage of 68. Since she was only in the Maine State retirement system for \n15 years, Mrs. Worcester does not receive a full State pension. Yet she \nis still subject to the full penalties under the GPO and WEP. As a \nconsequence, even though she worked hard and paid into the Social \nSecurity system for more than 20 years, she receives less than $800 a \nmonth in total pension income.\n  After a lifetime of hard work, Mrs. Worcester, who turns 78 next \nmonth, is still substitute teaching just to make ends meet. She cannot \nafford to stop working. This simply is not right.\n  It is time for us to take action, and I urge all of my colleagues to \njoin us in cosponsoring the Social Security Fairness Act to eliminate \nthese two unfair provisions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Byrd):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, today I submit a resolution urging the \nGovernment of Moldova to ensure a fair and democratic election process \nfor the upcoming parliamentary elections on April 5, 2009.\n  Since independence in 1991, Moldova has made notable progress in \nestablishing a democratic political system and a free market economy. \nHowever, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, \nhas reported that recent rounds of parliamentary elections have fallen \nshort on a number of international election standards.\n  In 2005, the Senate passed a Resolution expressing our support for \ndemocratic reform in Moldova and urging the Government of Moldova to \nensure unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to all media \noutlets in the run-up to the 2005 parliamentary elections. While the \nOSCE found that the 2005 elections generally complied with \ninternational standards, it found that ``campaign conditions and access \nto media'' fell short of these standards. The OSCE reported similar \ncircumstances following the 2007 parliamentary elections, including a \nlack of ``equitable media access'' among the candidates.\n  This Resolution re-affirms the United States Senate's support for \npolitical reform and fair democratic processes with our partners in \nMoldova. It urges the Government of Moldova to recognize the importance \nof guaranteeing all election candidates equitable access to media \noutlets in Moldova for the April 2009 elections. This will be an \nimportant consideration for receiving a Compact from the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation and for Moldova's full integration as a member of \nthe Western community of democracies.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/25/senate-section/article/S2489-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 8--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN'S \n     DENTAL HEALTH MONTH AND HONORING THE MEMORY OF DEAMONTE DRIVER\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Mikulski, \nand Mr. Bingaman) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                             S.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed.\n       (2) As the Congress and the Supreme Court of the United \n     States have recognized, the Second Amendment to the United \n     States Constitution protects the rights of individuals, \n     including those who are not members of a militia or engaged \n     in military service or training, to keep and bear arms.\n       (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia \n     are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns \n     that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the \n     United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of \n     their persons, homes, businesses, and families.\n       (4) The District of Columbia has the highest per capita \n     murder rate in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to \n     local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding \n     persons who would otherwise be able to defend themselves and \n     their loved ones in their own homes and businesses.\n       (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the \n     Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady \n     Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide \n     comprehensive Federal regulations applicable in the District \n     of Columbia as elsewhere. In addition, existing District of \n     Columbia criminal laws punish possession and illegal use of \n     firearms by violent criminals and felons. Consequently, there \n     is no need for local laws which only affect and disarm law-\n     abiding citizens.\n       (6) Officials of the District of Columbia have indicated \n     their intention to continue to unduly restrict lawful firearm \n     possession and use by citizens of the District.\n       (7) Legislation is required to correct the District of \n     Columbia's law in order to restore the fundamental rights of \n     its citizens under the Second Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and thereby enhance public safety.\n\n     SEC. _03.
