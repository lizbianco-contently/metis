Mr. President, much of this momentous health care debate \nrevolves around numbers, as it should. We read them in reports, see \nthem in charts, and hear about them in speeches. The state of health \ncare in this country is in such a severe crisis that these numbers are \noften quite overwhelming. Today, I want to talk about 1 number--31. It \nhas a special significance, especially today, along the course of this \nlong, historic pursuit to make it possible for every American to have \nhealth insurance and good health.\n  First, let's discuss the future.\n  The number 31 is a powerful reminder of both the great opportunity \nbefore us and the great cost of inaction, a tangible illustration of \nwhat we stand to gain and what we stand to lose. When we pass this \nbill, 31 million Americans who today have no health insurance will have \nhealth insurance at long last. That means they no longer will have to \nput off the surgery they need and will be able to finally use \nprescriptions as prescribed--not half a pill every day, a whole pill \nevery day. It means 31 million Americans will have a decent shot at a \nhealthy life.\n  If we don't act, if we let misinformation confuse us or let \ndistractions divert us or refuse to answer the American people's call \nto action, many more will suffer. In Nevada, like every other State, \nhealth insurance costs continue to climb. If we don't act, in just 6 \nyears, the typical Nevada family will spend more than 31 percent of \ntheir income on health care premiums. Almost a third of every Nevadan's \npaycheck will go right to his or her insurance company. That number is \neven higher on average throughout the country but only if we do \nnothing.\n  Second, let's talk for just a little bit about today, the present.\n  Right now, every 31 minutes insurance companies terminate insurance \nfor 300 Americans. Sometimes it is because you lost your job, because \nyou lost your health care when you lost your job. Sometimes it is \nbecause you change your job but your health care company doesn't come \nalong with your job change. And sometimes, at the very time you need it \nthe most, the insurance company says: Sorry. We are not going to \ncontinue the insurance we have given you before. Because they want to \nmake more money, a greedy health insurance company looks at your \nmedical history and says: I am sorry, but we are going to take it away \nfrom you. You have no recourse. Maybe you have had high cholesterol \nyour whole life or maybe acne as a child or you had a C-section as an \nadult. Health insurance companies have used all these reasons to drop \nsomeone's coverage. Maybe you had minor surgery 10 years ago or your \nmother had breast cancer or your father had heart disease. That is all \nit takes. We all know that, much like our Republican colleagues, \ninsurance companies will use any excuse in the book to say no.\n  But that statistic, that every 31 minutes in America more than 300 \npeople lose their health insurance coverage, what does that really \nmean? Imagine if the Senate gallery--600 people can be seated in our \ngalleries--imagine if every single one of these seats was filled by a \ngood American citizen who wanted to look over the Senate and they all \nhad health care when they came in here. Imagine that each of them came \nthis morning to watch their government work, to observe the proceedings \nhere on the floor for an hour or so. Then each of them went on their \nway when that hour came to a close, but on their way out the door they \nwere told that no longer would they have health care. That is what is \nhappening right now in America, the wealthiest and greatest country in \nthe world. Every 31 minutes, 300 more people lose their health \ncoverage.\n  Third and finally, let's talk about the past. Let's put the \nhistorical moment upon us in the context of history.\n  It was 31 years ago this day that Senator Ted Kennedy gave one of the \nmost profound and stirring speeches both of his remarkable life and in \nthe history of the Senate and certainly in the history of our Nation's \nlong health care debate. In that talk, he made an observation that \nrings just as true today as it did more than three decades ago. He \nsaid:\n\n       One of the most shameful things about modern America is \n     that in our unbelievably rich land, the quality of the health \n     care available to many of our people is unbelievably poor and \n     the cost is unbelievably high.\n\n  Senator Kennedy observed how out of control costs were back in 1978 \nand warned how quickly they would rise if we did not act.\n  Well, we didn't act. In the past 31 years, health care costs have \nskyrocketed, and that is a gross understatement. The number of \nuninsured Americans has done the same. We have 50 million now uninsured \nand more bankruptcies than ever. Three out of five are because of \nmedical expenses. Other countries have no bankruptcies because of \nmedical expenses. Germany, France, Great Britain, Japan--they don't \nhave bankruptcies because of health expenses. The cost of prescription \ndrugs has doubled in just the past decade, and far fewer small \nbusinesses can afford to cover their workers. One more thing has \nhappened: The resistance of the health insurance industry and \ncongressional Republicans to change the American people's demand has \nonly become more tone deaf and more intense.\n\n  If we don't act at this time, those terrible trends will only \ncontinue. I can hear Senator Kennedy now. I wasn't here 31 years ago, \nbut I can hear him because I listened to him very closely for more than \n31 years. Costs will continue to go up without end. More Americans who \nhave health insurance today will lose it. More patients will die of \ndiseases we know how to treat. As the crisis spirals, insurance company \nexecutives will laugh all the way to the bank. One company made $1 \nbillion last year; the chief executive took home $100 million. How is \nthat?\n  Much of the health care debate revolves around numbers, but at its \nheart, it is really about people. On December 9, 1978, 31 years ago, \nSenator Ted Kennedy asked us to recognize that health care is ``a basic \nright for all, not just an expensive luxury for the few.'' A generation \nlater, good health is still a luxury in this country. We are working \nday and night to see if we can help the generation that is here now and \ngenerations to come. If we don't, they will have the same memories 31 \nyears from now as Senator Kennedy prophesied 31 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12744-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the American people have now seen what \nDemocrats in Congress plan to do with seniors' health care. They have \nlooked on in total disbelief as the majority voted again and again to \nslash Medicare by nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  Incredibly, these cuts represent just part of the pain caused by this \nbill. In addition to punishing seniors, it would punish businesses. At \na time when 1 out of 10 working Americans is looking for a job, this \nbill would hit employers\n\n[[Page S12745]]\n\nwith job-killing new taxes and mandates, and it wouldn't do anything to \nlower long-term health care costs. This is the very last thing business \nowners expected from this bill. It is the last thing America needs in \nthe midst of a recession. And it is just one of the reasons more and \nmore business groups are stepping forward and speaking out against this \njob-killing bill.\n  Yesterday, I mentioned a letter signed by 10 major trade groups \npleading with us not to approve this bill because of the effect it \nwould have on business. Later in the day, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, one of the leaders in the small business \ncommunity, released a letter explaining why they opposed the bill. They \nsaid any health care reform faces two tests for small businesses: Does \nit lower insurance costs, and will it increase the overall cost of \ndoing business. According to them, the Senate bill fails both of these \ntests and therefore fails small business. They have seen the CBO \nconclude that this bill would lead to higher premiums. They have seen \nthe billions of new taxes that would fall unfairly on small businesses. \nAnd they have seen the mandates and the fines that would kill jobs. \nThey have concluded that this bill would actually be worse for small \nbusiness than the current situation.\n  It is abundantly clear that the more Americans learn about this bill, \nthe more they oppose it. Now we know the same goes for business. \nBusinesses that can't insure workers face stiff fines resulting in lost \nwages and jobs, according to the independent Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  What is more, studies suggest that this so-called employer mandate \nwould have a disproportionate impact on low-income, entry-level \nworkers. At a time of 10 percent unemployment, we should be doing \neverything we can to create jobs. This bill would only lead to more \nlost jobs.\n  Medicare cuts are bad enough, but this bill doesn't just hurt \nseniors, it hurts the economy as well. That is why Americans \noverwhelmingly oppose it.\n  Speaking of how people feel about this bill, we see signs of \nopposition everywhere. Public opinion is overwhelming. In all the polls \nacross the country, the American people are saying: Don't pass this \nbill.\n  Last month's gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia were \na stinging rebuke to the Democratic approach of more spending, more \ndebt, higher taxes, and endless bureaucracy.\n  There is a new development. Just yesterday--just yesterday in my home \nState--there was a special election for the State senate. Why would \nthat be worthy of commentary on the Senate floor? Let me describe the \nsituation. It is a 3-to-1 Democratic district. Because of State issues, \nthe Democratic State administration was intensely interested in winning \nthat seat. They spent $1 million cumulatively--the candidate, the \nDemocratic State party, and an outside interest group--in support of \nthe Democrat--$1 million on one side of a State senate race in a rural \narea of my State.\n  On the other side was a Republican candidate, who was outspent 5 to \n1--outspent 5 to 1 in a 3-to-1 Democratic district. The Republican \ncandidate for the State senate won by 12 points. How did that happen? \nHe had one message--one message: oppose the Reid bill, oppose what \nPelosi is doing, oppose what the Democrats in Washington are doing.\n  In other words, the candidate who was outspent 5 to 1 in a district \nwhere he was outregistered 3 to 1 made the sole issue in the State \nsenate race what is happening here in Washington on this bill that is \non this floor.\n  That ought to tell you on the heels of the Virginia and New Jersey \nelections what is happening in this country. People have seen enough \nand heard enough, and they want it to stop.\n  The message is simple. This health care bill is a losing formula all \naround. That is the message Americans are sending loudly and clearly. \nThe signs are everywhere. We saw it yesterday in my home State. It is \ntime to stop this bill and start over.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12745-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, let me \nlay out today's program.\n  It has been nearly 3 weeks since the majority leader moved to proceed \nto the health care reform bill. This is the 10th day of debate on the \nbill. The Senate has considered 18 amendments or motions. We have \nconducted 14 rollcall votes.\n  Today the Senate will debate the amendment by the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan, on prescription drug reimportation. At the same \ntime, we will debate the motion by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, \non taxes.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 p.m. today will be for \ndebate only, with the time equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders or their designees. Following the remarks of the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee or his designee, the Republicans will \ncontrol the first 30 minutes and the majority will control the second \n30 minutes, with the remaining time equally divided and used in an \nalternating manner.\n  We are hopeful the Senate will be able to conduct votes on or in \nrelation to a second-degree amendment to the Dorgan amendment, the \nDorgan amendment itself, a side by side to the Crapo motion, and the \nCrapo motion itself. Thereafter, we expect to turn to another \nDemocratic first-degree amendment and another Republican first-degree \namendment. We are working on lining those up.\n  Over the course of the debate, there has been too much misinformation \nabout what health care reform is and what it will do. I wish to set the \nrecord straight.\n  The goal of health care reform is to lower costs and provide quality, \naffordable coverage to American families, businesses, and workers. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, our bill, the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is a success.\n  According to the CBO, this bill provides health insurance coverage to \n31 million more Americans. That is a big success. It lowers health \ninsurance premiums. Despite what some have said, what some have claimed \nabout premiums rising, that is not true. CBO says this legislation \nlowers health insurance premiums but for 7 percent, and that 7 percent \ngets much higher quality health care insurance than otherwise they \nwould get. CBO also says this legislation reduces the Federal deficit \nby $130 billion over the first 10 years--it reduces the Federal deficit \nby $130 billion over the first 10 years.\n  In addition, as the President promised, this bill does not raise \ntaxes on the middle class. In fact, this bill is a net tax cut. Over \nthe next 10 years, this bill will provide a total of $441 billion in \ntax credits to help American families buy quality, affordable health \ncare coverage they can count on. That is a tax cut, a total of $441 \nbillion in tax cuts. The chart behind me indicates\n\n[[Page S12746]]\n\nthat. Over the next 10 years, this bill will provide a total of, as I \nsaid, $441 billion in tax cuts.\n  The bill provides a net tax cut of $40 billion in the year 2017. You \ncan see that basically on the chart: $40 billion of tax cuts in 2017. \nThat is $440 for every taxpayer affected. These are individual tax \ncuts. Let me make that clear. American individuals will get tax cuts \nunder this legislation in these amounts.\n  That same year--2017--low- and middle-income taxpayers who earn \nbetween $20,000 and $30,000 a year will see an average Federal tax \ndecrease of nearly 37 percent. That is CBO. Do not take my word for it. \nThat is CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation--an independent \norganization. The average taxpayer making less than $75,000 a year will \nreceive a tax credit of more than $1,300, and that tax credit grows to \nmore than $1,500 in 2019. Those are tax cuts. It is very important we \nall remember this bill is a net tax cut of this amount for American \ntaxpayers. That is individual tax cuts.\n  I have heard arguments that the responsibility to have health \ninsurance amounts to a tax on the middle class. This is simply not \ntrue. In fact, this policy works to repeal the hidden tax of more than \n$1,000 in extra insurance premiums that American families with health \ninsurance pay each year in order to cover the cost of caring for those \nwithout health insurance. It is a tax for uncompensated care. That is \n$1,000 per American family, on average, that they have to pay under the \ncurrent system. This bill would virtually eliminate that.\n  Additionally, this bill provides Americans with the tools they need \nto meet that responsibility by ensuring that all Americans have access \nto quality, affordable health insurance.\n  The bill eliminates barriers that prevent Americans from getting \ninsurance coverage, such as discrimination based on preexisting \nconditions. This bill eliminates that. We--all of us--either directly \nor through a family member or through a friend, have heard these horror \nstories of insurance companies denying coverage because of a \npreexisting condition. This legislation stops this. And this \nlegislation makes quality insurance affordable to every American \nthrough tax cuts and help with copays and other out-of-pocket costs.\n  If for some reason an individual still cannot afford to buy the \nhealth insurance coverage available to them, they are exempt from \npaying the penalty. Clearly, this penalty is not a tax. So if you \ncannot afford it, you do not have to pay--no penalty.\n  I have also heard arguments that the excise tax on private insurance \ncompanies offering costly and excessive insurance plans will raise \ntaxes on individuals. This claim is equally untrue. The Congressional \nBudget Office reaches the conclusion that is not true. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office reaches the conclusion it will lower \npremiums. I think the amount is 7 to 12 percent, if I remember \ncorrectly--the amount stated in their letter to us in the Congress.\n  This policy, therefore, is not a tax on individuals. Rather, it is a \ntax on private insurance companies, and not passed on in the nature of \nhigher premiums, according to CBO--in fact, lower premiums according to \nCBO.\n  This legislation is designed to encourage private insurance companies \nto offer, and employers to choose, health insurance plans with lower \npremiums that are below the taxable threshold. The Congressional Budget \nOffice noted how effective this policy is in a report when it said:\n\n       . . . most people would avoid the cost of the excise tax by \n     enrolling in plans that had lower premiums.\n\n  As a result, CBO says premiums will decrease and wages will increase \nas employers offer more money in workers' pockets instead of inflated \nhealth benefits. In fact, the bulk of the revenue raised by this \nprovision--more than 83 percent--comes not from the tax itself but from \nincreased wages, increased wages on account of this provision. MIT \neconomist Jonathan Gruber estimates this provision will cause workers' \nwages to rise by $55 in 2019. That is $700 in additional income for \nevery household with health insurance.\n  The truth is, this bill is fully paid for--fully paid for; CBO says \nso--and it is paid for in a fiscally responsible way. It reduces the \nFederal deficit. It lowers the growth of health care costs. It provides \nquality, affordable health insurance to millions more Americans. And it \nis a net tax cut--net tax cut--for American families, businesses, and \nworkers, which in these tough economic times means more than ever.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I stand confused from the statement of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee because we have all the reports that \nthe bill he is talking about is not the bill we are going to be voting \non because we are totally changing what we are doing. What is out there \nnow is that we are going to expand Medicare to those down to 55 years \nof age, and we are going to expand Medicaid up to those of 150 percent \nof poverty. We are going to add billions of dollars of mandates, even \nat 90 percent copaid by the Federal Government, to the States over the \nnext 10 years. We have a Medicare Program that you have taken $465 \nbillion out of, and you are going to add 34 million new people to under \nthe new plan--the new plan we are talking about. You are talking about \nthe plan we used to have.\n  It is interesting, though, as you make those points, when you say it \nis net tax cut. Three-quarters of the net tax cut goes to people in \nthis country who pay no taxes in the first place. The chairman cannot \ndeny that. The fact is, according to the Joint Tax Committee--the \nchairman conveniently does not look at the other body that gives us \ninformation on taxes. According to the Joint Tax Committee, $288 \nbillion of the $394 billion will be refundable. That is a refundable \ntax credit to people who are paying no taxes now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator, it is a tax cut, \nwhether or not it is refundable. And even if it is refundable, it is \nextra dollars in people's pockets.\n  Mr. COBURN. The fact is, it is taxes to the average American family--\n40 million of them. According to the Joint Tax Committee, taxes will \nrise on those who are making under $200,000 a year. The Joint Tax \nCommittee said that.\n  The point is, what you are talking about does not have any \napplication because we do not have ``the bill,'' again, because we have \na new ``the bill'' on the floor, which is going to take a bankrupt \nprogram that our children today are responsible for--if you are born \ntoday, based on the unfunded liabilities of Medicare, you are \nresponsible for $350,000, if you are a new child born today, for what \nwe have not paid for in Medicare. And now we have the new plan that is \ngoing to come out. We have cut $465 billion out of Medicare, or moved \nit out of Medicare, to create a new program. And we are going to add 34 \nmillion new Americans to it, in a plan that has already mortgaged the \nfuture of our children.\n  The other thing the chairman said is that costs in health care will \ngo down and that premiums will go down. Well, there are 11 out of 12 \npeople who have studied ``the plan'' who say premiums will rise. What \nCBO says is, if you are in the individual market, your premiums are \ngoing to go up anywhere from 10 to 13 percent. In fact, they are not \nsure whether premiums will decline. They say on the other groups it is \nfrom a 1-percent increase to a 2-percent decrease over what they would \nhave already increased.\n  So our problem with health care is costs. That is the thing that \nstops access to health care in this country. And the plan--whether it \nis the new plan, which nobody has gotten to see the details of, or the \nplan we have seen the details of, the 2,074 pages we have seen the \ndetails of--raises the cost of health care in this country.\n  But none of that is important because the most important thing is, it \nputs government in control of your health care through the task force \non preventive health services, through the Medicare Advisory \nCommission, and through the cost comparative effectiveness panel. So \nwith a wink and a nod we are going to put government in control of your \nhealth care; we are going to put 70 new bureaucracies between you and \nyour doctor; we are going to put 20,000 new Federal employees between \nyou and your doctor; and we are not going to lower the costs. The \naverage American is not going to get a tax cut; they are going to see \nan\n\n[[Page S12747]]\n\nincrease out of this bill. The average middle-income American is going \nto see a tax increase out of this bill.\n\n  So, consequently, what we have heard sounds good on the surface. But \nthe most important thing to remember is you are no longer going to be \nin control of your health care because once the government puts its \nnose under the tent, just as it did on breast cancer screening--and we \nhave the gall to say we are going to recognize every time the agency \ndoes something that is harmful to a patient in their relationship with \ntheir doctor, that we are going to come to the Senate floor and correct \nit. The fact is, that isn't going to happen.\n  So, ultimately, your health care is going to cost more and your \npremiums are going to rise. Eleven out of the twelve studies say \npremiums are going to rise under the bill that is before us, and the \npeople who get the tax cuts are the people who aren't paying any taxes \nnow. To pay for those tax cuts, taxes are going to rise on 40 million \nAmerican families who earn under $200,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak, as well \nas engage in a colloquy with several of my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, under the order of the \nday, what is the amount of time allocated to each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans control the next 30 \nminutes. Then the majority controls the next 30 minutes after that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I appreciate the \nopportunity to discuss the issue of taxes and jobs today as we focus on \nthe critical legislation in front of us.\n  I have proposed an amendment, actually a motion, to commit this bill \nback to the Finance Committee to help us honor the President's pledge \non taxes. As we have discussed now for more than a week, \nnotwithstanding all of the claims that are being made about this \nlegislation, one of the irrefutable facts is that it grows the \ngovernment dramatically. If you take the first full 10 years of \nspending, not counting the first 4 years that are not included in the \nspending--in other words, they are delayed in order to make the numbers \nlook better--if you count the first full 10 years of implementation of \nthis bill, it will result in $2.5 trillion of new Federal spending. It \nwill grow the Federal Government by that much.\n  Repeatedly, President Obama has told the American people he will not \nallow them to be taxed--those whom he describes as the middle class--in \norder to pay for this huge new increase in Federal spending.\n  To use President Obama's own words:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase . . . not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes . . . you will not see any of your \n     taxes increase one single dime.\n\n  Yet what does this bill do? It includes $493 billion of new taxes in \njust the first 10 years. If you use that full 10-year timeframe--that \ntimeframe that starts after the 4 years of spending that have been \nsuppressed in order to change the numbers and the calculations on the \nbill--the total number in that 10-year window is $1.2 trillion of new \ntaxes.\n  The question is, Do these taxes fall only on the wealthy or do they \nfall squarely on those in the middle class? The answer is the large \nmajority of them fall on the middle class. In fact, the Joint Tax \nCommittee has indicated that by 2019, individuals earning between \n$50,000 and $200,000 would, on average, see a tax increase of $595,000. \nFamilies earning between $75,000 and $200,000 would, on average, see a \ntax increase of $670,000.\n  My colleague from Montana, the chairman of the Finance Committee, has \nargued that there is actually a net tax cut in the bill. How do we get \nto those numbers? Based on a Joint Committee on Taxation report, of the \n$394 billion that the government will spend on what are called tax \ncredits--that is the tax cut that my colleague is talking about--$288 \nbillion of those $394 billion in credits will go to people who pay no \ntaxes today.\n  If you think about it, how can it be a tax cut if the money is spent \nfrom the Federal Treasury and sent to--or to somebody on behalf of--a \nperson who is not paying taxes in the first place? You can call it a \nsubsidy. You can call it a credit if you would like. I know the words \nused in the bill are a ``refundable tax credit,'' but the reality is it \nis nothing other than pure Federal spending. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office classifies this kind of benefit as government spending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I will yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is fine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator says those are people who don't pay taxes. \nDon't most of those people pay a lot of taxes? Don't they pay payroll \ntaxes, most of them, who work?\n  Mr. CRAPO. There is a payroll tax. There is.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Are there not other taxes that people pay? It could be \nsales tax. There are all kinds of taxes that people pay. Particularly \nworking people, there are a lot of taxes they pay.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Reclaiming my time, although people do pay a lot of sales \ntaxes--not Federal sales taxes, by the way--and although people do pay \na lot of other types of taxes, they will pay penalties and fees--in \nfact, under this bill they will be paying a lot more taxes. The reality \nis I don't think that is what President Obama was talking about. When \nhe made his pledge, I think his words were: ``You will not see any of \nyour taxes go up.'' The bottom line is you can't say, well, if you \noffset this tax and you don't count the sales tax or if you add in the \nsales tax to counteract it--that is not what the President was talking \nabout.\n  Once again, as Joint Tax has said, by 2019 individuals making between \n$50,000 and $200,000 on average would see a tax increase of $590,000, \nand families making between $75,000 and $200,000 would see a net \nincrease on average of $670,000.\n  Let's go to the next chart.\n  I note my colleague from Tennessee is here. If he would like to step \nin at any time, please feel free. I just have two other charts to show, \nand then I will toss the floor to the Senator. I see he has, I think, a \nquestion brewing.\n  In the analysis that was done by the Joint Tax Committee, by 2019, \nthese people whose taxes I have just described who are squarely in the \nmiddle class, there will be at least 73 million American households--\nthat is not individuals, that is households--73 million American \nhouseholds earning below the $200,000 that will face a tax increase. \nSometimes the proponents of this bill say, well, that doesn't net out \nthe subsidies we are providing to some of them. If you net out the \nsubsidies--and I don't think that is necessarily an argument, but if \nyou do net out the subsidies--it is still at least 42 million American \nhouseholds that will see their taxes increase under this legislation.\n  How can that comply with the President's promise? All the motion I \nhave brought does is say to commit this bill to the Finance Committee \nand make the bill fit the President's pledge. The President pledged \nthat people in the middle class, which he defined as families making \nless than $250,000 or individuals making less than $200,000, would not \nsee their taxes go up.\n  With that, again, I see my colleague from Tennessee is ready to join \nin with me, and I would ask if he has any comments or questions to \nraise.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Idaho. The point you are \nmaking is, if you are going to add $\\1/2\\ trillion--this bill as \nproposed is paid for by about half through Medicare cuts and about half \nthrough tax increases, and it is paid for some by sending huge new \nbills to State governments. But I guess the point the Senator is making \nbasically is that we are going to add $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes over 10 \nyears or much more than that when the bill is fully implemented. Who is \ngoing to end up paying those taxes? It is not going to be insurance \ncompanies. It is not going to be medical device\n\n[[Page S12748]]\n\ncompanies. It is going to be the people who--it is going to be us. \nIsn't that true? Don't you expect that most of the companies upon which \nthe new taxes are imposed will pass those taxes along to the American \npeople?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes. As a matter of fact, in my own mind, I distinguish \nbetween taxes on the American people and fees that will be charged to \ncompanies and businesses in the private sector that are also being \npassed on to the American people. All of those will occur.\n\n  One interesting clarification or explanation with regard to this \nrefundable tax credit that is talked about so often: it isn't actually \nrefunded to the taxpayer, as I understand it, or to the individual who \ndoesn't pay taxes but is receiving the credit. It is paid directly to \nthe insurance company, as I understand it. So even though some people \ncould be claimed to be paying less taxes by this argument, because some \nof those who receive the subsidy will get a greater subsidy than they \nwill a tax increase, the fact is even they still get a tax increase and \neven they still pay their taxes at the higher level. It is just that \nsome of them will get a subsidy that will help to offset that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I may take a minute to talk about another \nform of taxes, which would be State taxes. Now, people might be \nthinking: Well, you are talking about a Federal health care bill. How \ndo you get State taxes in there? Well, let me try to explain that just \na little bit.\n  I remember as Governor of Tennessee some years ago, nothing used to \nmake me madder than Washington politicians who would come up with a big \nidea, take credit for it, hold a press conference and announce it; call \nit, for example, historic, and then send the bill to me, the Governor, \nto pay it. Then usually those same politicians would come back to \nTennessee and they would make a big speech about local control at the \nJefferson Day dinner or the Jackson Day dinner. In fact, sometimes \nRepublicans were just as bad as Democrats in doing it.\n  I also remember that in 1994 there was a political revolution in the \ncountry. This body switched dramatically to the Republican side, and \none of the main arguments was no more unfunded mandates. In other \nwords, don't be coming up with big ideas in Washington and sending the \nbill to the Governor or to the State legislature or to the mayor or to \nthe county commission and expect them to raise property taxes or cut \nservices or raise college tuitions to make it up.\n  So what I wish to say today is this: This legislation already \nincludes a huge new bill for the State governments. As it is now \nwritten, Medicaid for low-income Americans is expanded, and there is a \nbig bill to the States. Our Governor, who is a Democrat, by the way, \nhas been very effective in pointing this out; that Senator Reid's bill \nwill add $700 million over 5 years to our State. There is no way our \nState can pay this bill without a tax increase of significant size or \nseriously damaging higher education or seeing college tuition begin to \ngo through the roof, just as we saw it do in California the other day \nwhen it went up 32 percent. Why did it go up? Because the State has had \nto spend so much of its money on health care bills, many of which are \nrequired by the Federal regulations of Medicaid.\n  There is a rumor going around that there was a big deal cut last \nnight that would pave the way for passage of this bill that says that \ninstead of a new government-run program, we will simply expand two of \nthe government-run programs we already have--Medicare for seniors and \nMedicaid for low-income Americans.\n  I would ask these questions: First, with Medicare, how in the world \ncan we take $1 trillion out of Medicare when the program is fully \nimplemented and give 34 million or 35 million more Americans a chance \nto opt in it at a time when the trustees of Medicare have said it is \ngoing broke in 5 years. Insofar as Medicaid goes, if it is true that \nthe idea is to expand Medicaid to 150 percent of the poverty level--\nand, of course, we are not invited to any of the meetings; they were \nall written in the back room so we don't know the details--but if it is \ntrue we are going to expand Medicaid even more, our Governor has said \nin our State that doubles the cost of this legislation to our State.\n  So down the road, in a few years, what we are going to see in \nTennessee is a new State income tax, seriously damaging higher \neducation, and I think it is--\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. On your time, yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will quote from a letter basically to refute the \nallegations that this is a big obligation on the States. That is \ntotally not true. The question is, Is it not true that on page 7 of the \nletter from the CBO, dated November 18, to Senator Reid, CBO says:\n\n       The CBO estimates that State spending on Medicaid would \n     increase $25 billion over 10 years as a result of this \n     legislation.\n\n  That is $2.5 billion a year, on average, for all States.\n  Another figure I know is that the State increase will not be huge but \nabout a 1 percent increase over the State obligation. Why? Because, as \nthe Senator also noted, an expansion of the population in Medicaid--the \nFeds are paying virtually all of it. But on a net basis, it is a 1-\npercent only increase in State obligation over 10 years. Does the \nSenator know that to be true?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. My understanding of the proposal by the Finance \nCommittee bill and by the Reid bill is that the Federal Government \nexpands Medicaid and pays for 100 percent of it for a few years, but \nafter that, the State has a significant portion of the bill. Am I not \ncorrect in that?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We will have to divide this time. The division is \ncorrect. We are only talking--\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am not going to divide the time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator ask a rhetorical question or an actual \nquestion?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will retain the floor, and then the \nSenator can make his statement later.\n  The fact is, after 3, the Federal Government sends a big bill to the \nStates. The fact is, the Governor of Tennessee, who is a Democrat and \nwho has worked with other Governors and is actually leading the \nNational Governors Association's effort to see the impact of this kind \nof legislation, says it will cost our State $700 billion over 5 years \nand $1.4 billion if we expand Medicaid up to 150 percent of federal \npoverty level. The State pays part of that bill. That means a big State \ntax increase. It means big higher education increases.\n  As a former Governor, I guarantee that if this happens, a few years \nfrom now when the federal government shifts costs onto the states, \nthere will be a revolt in the States and people will be asking who did \nthis. I would seriously say that any Senator who votes to expand \nMedicaid and sends a significant part of the bill to the States ought \nto be sentenced to go home and be Governor and try to govern the State \nunder those conditions.\n  I think this kind of legislation, and especially the rumor I have \nheard regarding a dramatic increase in the expansion of Medicaid, will \nbe a damaging blow to the American public's higher education from which \nit will never recover, tuition will go to a level where only the rich \ncan afford to go to school, and the idea of public higher education \nwill be left aside, all because Washington politicians ran up the bill, \ntook the credit, made an announcement, and sent a huge bill to State \ngovernments that are struggling with their worst fiscal condition since \nthe Great Depression.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank my colleague. We will see State taxes as well as \nFederal taxes going up.\n  Senator Johanns has joined us as well. Before I ask him to join in \nwith questions and comments, I want to make one other clarification.\n  Again, we have the President's pledge up here on the chart. The \nmotion I have offered simply says: Make the bill comply with the \nPresident's pledge. If there are no new taxes, the bill doesn't have to \nbe changed if we pass this motion. If there are, it does.\n  Remember, I don't think that when the President made this pledge, he \nwas saying he will not increase taxes on a net basis. In other words, I \ndidn't hear the President say: I won't raise your taxes higher than I \nwould cut them in some other areas. He specifically didn't say he would \ncount subsidies being paid out to those who do not pay income taxes as \nan offset to any tax increases he wanted to raise somewhere else. The\n\n[[Page S12749]]\n\nPresident didn't get into all these nuances. He said he was not going \nto raise taxes on the middle class. The fact is, the middle class will \nsee huge tax increases under this bill.\n  Before I toss the floor to my colleague, I will say this: CBO \nestimates that only 7 percent of all Americans will receive any of \nthese subsidies. Yet, specifically, out of the 282 million Americans \nwith some type of health insurance, only 19 million of them will be \neligible for the tax credit for their health insurance. The rest of the \nmillions of Americans are going to be the ones paying those taxes. That \nis how it ends up. At minimum--and we are still going through the bill, \nand this number is growing--at least 42 million people who make less \nthan $200,000--and, frankly, far less--are going to be paying a lot \nmore taxes. That is the reason for the motion.\n  I yield to my colleague, Senator Johanns.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, Senator Alexander really has this right. \nI had the honor of being the Governor of Nebraska for 6 years. The \nwhole idea of balancing a budget is not theoretical to a Governor. You \nhave to do it.\n  Let me tell you, if I might, about our State. Many years ago--decades \nand decades ago--when our founders wrote our State constitution, they \nwere worried about the State getting itself embroiled in too much debt. \nSo they said the politicians will be allowed to borrow some money. The \nlimit they put in the State constitution was $50,000.\n  So you see, in Nebraska, when you are faced with an unfunded mandate, \nlike what is happening in this health care bill, I say you get three \nchoices: You can cut programs like K-12 education, higher education, \nand much-needed services. No. 2, you can raise taxes, sales and income \ntaxes. That is about what you are down to because that is really where \nthe revenue comes from for States. The third choice is you get to do \nboth. I guarantee you that none of those approaches is very popular.\n  Just within the last few weeks, our Governor, dealing with the \nrecession, like every Governor in the country, stepped in front of the \nunicameral, as I did as Governor, and he said: My friends, we have to \ncut the spending. It was just as clear as can be. He said: We have to \ncut the spending. People are hurting. They are laid off. If they are \nhurting, they are not spending as much; therefore, our revenues are \ndown. We have to cut spending.\n  They worked over a couple-week period of time, and they came up with \na plan--I think it was unanimously approved--to cut the spending.\n  Well, here we are in Washington, and when you pull the gimmicks out \nof this bill and score it realistically over 10 years, this is a \nmultimillion-dollar hit to every State, including the State of \nNebraska. So what are we handing off to the State? Guess what. We are \nsaying: You get a chance to raise taxes--not because of any vote you \ntook on the floor of the unicameral in Nebraska but because of what \nhappened with Washington unfunded Federal mandates. That is what this \nbill is all about when you look at the expansion of Medicaid. I read \nthe reports about the possibility this might go to 150 percent. Keep \ndoing the math, keep loading the unfunded mandates on our State \nGovernors.\n  Do you know why we are doing this? We are doing it to try to convince \nthe American people that this is a cheaper bill than it is. When they \nfigure out that the Governor of their State has this problem to deal \nwith and they come to figure out they are going to pay higher taxes or \nget fewer services and less education, it will become very real to \nthem. I have said many times on this floor that with this bill, reality \nwill set in. Here is another piece of reality.\n  Then you look at the overall bill. About $\\1/2\\ trillion--in addition \nto this Medicaid mess we are going to push onto the States, there will \nbe about $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes.\n  Senator Crapo put up the promise the President has made. Well, gee, \nwhen he is done with that board, we can ceremoniously tear it up \nbecause, you know what, that promise isn't anywhere near being kept. \nWhen he said those things, quite honestly, there was no way he could \ndeliver with this health care bill. Uninsured Americans get taxed. \nInsured Americans get taxed. Families with high-value plans get taxed. \nHigh-health-cost families get taxed. Flexible spending gets reduced. \nSmall businesses get taxed. We can go on and on and on, to the tune of \n$\\1/2\\ trillion. That is not even counting the unfunded mandate hammer \nwe are sending to every Governor in this Nation.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I will add some statistics that I was \nreading while my colleagues were commenting. If you take out that CBO \nreport, which is what actually analyzes this on a nonpartisan basis, \nthe impact of these Medicaid expenditures, not including the proposed \nincrease we heard about overnight, it clearly says:\n\n       CBO estimates that State spending on Medicaid would \n     increase by about $25 billion over the 2010-2019 period as a \n     result of the provisions affecting coverage in table 3. That \n     estimate reflects States' flexibility to make programmatic \n     and other budgetary changes to Medicaid and CHIP.\n\n  That is the statistic my colleague from Tennessee was looking for.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. It is true that in the \nlegislation the estimate is that the Federal Government would pay 100 \npercent of the increased expansion of Medicaid for 3 years and that it \nwill cover about 90 percent of the cost after that, which sounds like a \nlot. But we throw so much money around up here, we have completely lost \nany appreciation of what that amount of money costs at the State level. \nIn our State, our Governor has said that the 133-percent increase is \nabout $700 million over 5 years, and that is a big, new tax or a big \nincrease in college tuition.\n  If I may, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \narticle from the Wall Street Journal of December 4 from the dean and \nCEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 4, 2009]\n\n  Health Reform Could Harm Medicaid Patients: A Vast Expansion of the \n      Program Will Impose Unsustainable Costs on Treatment Centers\n\n                           (By Edward Miller)\n\n       Baltimore, MD.--Both the House and Senate health-care \n     reform bills call for a large increase in Medicaid--about 18 \n     million more people will begin enrolling in Medicaid under \n     the House bill starting in 2013, Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services (CMS) Actuary Richard Foster estimates.\n       We at Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) endorse efforts to \n     improve the quality and reduce the cost of health care. But \n     we also understand all too well the impact a dramatic \n     expansion of Medicaid will have on us and our state--and \n     likely the country as a whole.\n       A flood of new patients will be seeking health services, \n     many of whom have never seen a doctor on more than a sporadic \n     basis. Some will also have multiple and costly chronic \n     conditions. And almost all of them will come from poor or \n     disadvantaged backgrounds.\n       We know this because we've been caring for Medicaid \n     patients in a managed-care setting for 14 years, as well as \n     providing world-class care to people from all over the \n     country and the world. Our experience provides a glimpse of \n     the acute cost bubble that the health-care system will suffer \n     with the reforms now being proposed.\n       Like Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, Geisinger Medical \n     Center in Pennsylvania, and the Mayo Clinic, where, as \n     President Barack Obama notes, ``people fly from all over the \n     world to Rochester, Minnesota in order to get outstanding \n     care,'' people also fly from all over the world to obtain \n     care from JHM. But unlike those other institutions, we also \n     serve large numbers of people who can't afford cab fare to \n     the nearest hospital: poor, disadvantaged individuals, \n     150,000 of whom are in our Medicaid managed-care program, \n     Priority Partners.\n       Priority Partners operates under a capitated system--that \n     is, it receives a set payment per individual per month from \n     the state. Over time, we've developed the ability to manage \n     the care of these individuals in a way that is both cost \n     effective and that provides them with quality care. We've \n     done it by tapping into our extensive delivery system, which \n     includes four hospitals, a nursing home, the largest \n     community-based primary care group in Maryland, and much \n     more.\n       We've hit above-national benchmarks on all clinical quality \n     measures for our dialysis patients, reduced monthly costs for \n     patients with substance abuse and highly complex medical \n     needs, and 70% of our patients tell us they're satisfied with \n     our care. But the learning curve has been costly and steep, \n     and provides a cautionary tale for what will happen under the \n     health-care reforms currently in Congress.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The dean, who writes a very sympathetic column which I \nwill not read but a sentence or two of, is describing the current \nhealth care bill. He says:\n\n\n[[Page S12750]]\n\n\n       Even if only half those individuals seek Medicaid coverage, \n     such a large expansion would likely have an excruciating \n     impact on the State's budget. And Maryland is not alone. \n     According to a Kaiser Foundation survey conducted earlier \n     this year, three-quarters of the States have expressed \n     concern that expanding Medicaid could add to their fiscal \n     woes. Already, as Kaiser notes, 33 States cut or froze \n     payment rates to those who deliver health care to Medicaid \n     patients. . . .\n\n  The proposal--and the Reid bill is maybe exacerbated by this deal we \nhave been hearing about--is to shift millions more low-income Americans \ninto a program called Medicaid, when only 50 percent of doctors will \nsee new patients in that program, and then send a huge bill to the \nStates, which will damage higher education.\n  I remember, after I was Governor, I heard on the radio that the State \nof Tennessee had done a wonderful thing. It would double the number of \nchildren covered by Medicaid at the same amount of cost. It went \nthrough my mind that it would never happen. That program became the \nTennCare Program, which has nearly bankrupted our State.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their comments.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I will make a couple of other comments, and I will allow \nmy colleagues to wrap up with their final comments. I want to raise an \nadditional issue.\n  On this chart, we show what is going to happen with the IRS. Right \nnow, the CBO estimate indicates that because the IRS is in charge of \nthe implementation of so many of the mandates and other requirements in \nthis bill and because of the new taxes that will be forced onto the \nAmerican people, there will need to be an expansion of the IRS. The CBO \nsays that could mean as high as an additional $10 billion at the IRS.\n  If there are no new taxes in this bill or no new mandates in the \nbill, if there is no increased role of the Federal Government in the \nmanagement of the health care economy in this bill, why do we need to \nhave the size of the IRS, which is a $12 billion institution today--why \ndoes it need to grow to almost double, up to $22 billion?\n  The point is, the motion I have made is very simple and \nstraightforward. We can argue back and forth about what the President \nsaid or whether this bill has tax cuts or tax increases in it or \nwhether, in the net result, it does one thing or another.\n  The bottom line is, with regard to about 157 million Americans who \nget their health insurance through their employer, by 2019, they are \nnot going to be eligible for these tax credits people are talking \nabout. They are going to be paying increased taxes.\n  All this motion does is protect those 42 million people we were \ntalking about who are going to see their taxes go up; 42 million \nhouseholds will see their taxes go up.\n  If the other side is right and what we are talking about does not \nexist in the bill, then this motion should be harmless because all the \nmotion says is commit the bill to the Finance Committee and tell the \nFinance Committee to take out the taxes that impact the middle class.\n  I ask if either of my colleagues from Nebraska or Tennessee would \nlike to make any concluding remarks.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, let me offer a thought or two. Senator \nCrapo has hit the nail on the head. If this is not happening, if, in \nfact, the argument of the other side is accurate and this is not \nhappening and this is some made-up sort of argument, then the Senator \nfrom Idaho is absolutely right, this motion will have no effect. So why \nwould you not support the motion? Why wouldn't you want the health care \nbill to reflect the promise of the President of the United States? Why \nwould you not stand and say: Look, it is a hard time out there. \nUnemployment is 10 percent. People are hurting. Unemployment and \nunderemployment are 17.5 percent. This has been as tough a recession as \nwe have seen in a long time, and it has hurt real people. Why wouldn't \nyou want to stand for them and say: Man, we understand. We have heard \nyou at our townhall meetings. We have heard you back home. We have \nheard you, and we are going to make sure we are not going to add to \nyour burden.\n  I appreciate Senator Alexander putting in that article. I thought \nthat was a tremendous article. Medicaid is chewing up State budgets. I \nmanaged one of those budgets. Keep in mind, this is an entitlement \nprogram--no deductibles, no copays, no premiums. If you qualify, you \nget it. So there is no way you can manage this budget. It is \nexponentially growing. Forty percent of the docs do not take Medicaid \npatients. Why? Because they go broke on the reimbursement rate. \nHospitals tell me all across the State of Nebraska: We cannot keep our \ndoors open on the Medicaid reimbursement rate.\n  So what are we doing? We are adding millions of people to that \nproblem. They will have an access problem. State budgets will have a \nproblem. They will be in crisis. Our hospitals are going to face the \nsame crisis. It is the wrong policy. It is the wrong course of action. \nLet's start listening to the American people.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, day in and day out Republicans have \ncome to the floor and said: Instead of a comprehensive, 2,000-page \napproach to try to fix this massive health care system all at once in a \nway that raises taxes and premiums and makes Medicare cuts, why don't \nwe, instead, identify the goal of reducing the cost of health care to \nindividuals and to the government and take commonsense steps toward \nthat goal.\n  We have suggested small business health care plans which have been \noffered, scored by the CBO to save money and expand coverage. We have \noffered proposals to limit the number of junk lawsuits against doctors. \nThere may be an argument about how much that saves, but there is no \nargument that would not drive down the costs. We have suggested \nallowing purchasing of health insurance across State lines to increase \ncompetition, and creating health insurance exchanges. There are efforts \nin wellness and prevention that we have made specific proposals \nconcerning. In terms of corralling waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare \nand then spending the savings on Medicare, instead of a new program, \nthat is the Republican agenda.\n  Pick a goal: reducing health care costs and move step by step toward \nthat goal in a way that reearns the trust of the American people, \ninstead of a comprehensive, 2,000-page bill filled with taxes, \nmandates, surprises, and a Washington takeover of health care.\n  There is a real choice. We regret the fact that we seem to be \ncontinuing to move on this track without the track we are offering. We \nwant to defeat what is proposed, not in the debate. Change the debate \ntoward reducing costs step by step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma and others on \nthe other side of the aisle make the charge this bill increases \ngovernment. That is not so. It does not increase government. This bill \ndoes not increase government. They made that allegation. It is a pure \nallegation. Anybody can allege anything, but let me get the facts. It \nis one thing to make an allegation; it is something else to get the \nfacts.\n  The best fact I have come up with is a quote from the Congressional \nBudget Office letter to Senator Reid on that point. The Congressional \nBudget Office says--and I quote from page 16 of the letter. I do not \nhave the date of the letter. There are several letters to several of us \nin the Senate. I will quote the letter. It says:\n\n       CBO expects that, during the decade following the 10-year \n     budget window, the increases and decreases in the federal \n     budgetary commitment to health care stemming from this \n     legislation would roughly balance out, so that there would be \n     no significant change in that commitment.\n\n  ``Roughly balance out.'' ``No significant change in that \ncommitment.'' That does not sound like an explosive growth in \ngovernment to me. In fact, it sounds the opposite, listening to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Also, add to that this bill, in the first 10 years, decreases the \ndeficit by $130 billion. But CBO says: No, no, no significant change. \nThings will roughly balance out, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S12751]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This controls the government's role in health care. It \ndoes not increase it.\n  I do not have any time, I say to the Senator from Idaho. We are an \nhour later--if we have another time agreement, we will take it out of \nthe Senator's time. I will be willing to yield if the Senator from \nIdaho has a question.\n  Mr. CRAPO. No, I will ask a question later, then.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Fine. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle try to paint health care reform as bad for the economy. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. Health care reform will be good for \nthe economy. Health care reform is a net tax cut for working \nAmericans--a net tax cut. Health care reform is essential for long-term \ngrowth.\n  Some say it is a tax increase. It is not. The Congressional Budget \nOffice--I have a chart right in front of me--a net tax cut. If you take \nall the provisions of this bill that affect individuals, the Joint \nCommittee on Tax concludes that the average tax break for affected \nfilers with income under $75,000 is a cut every year. I will take one \nyear, 2019: a $1,500 cut for those people in that category. Net tax \nbreak for affected overall is a $441 decrease. It is a long chart. I \nwill not take the time to read it all.\n  In summarizing the chart, affected taxpayers, as a percent of all \ntaxpayers--it is over a majority--will see a net tax cut.\n  Some say for some it will be a tax increase. Let me indicate why that \nis somewhat true. They are getting more wages. Of course, their taxes \ngo up if they get more wages. Why are they getting more wages? Because \nthese tend to be people affected by so-called Cadillac plans. The Joint \nCommittee on Tax and the Congressional Budget Office say in that \ncategory, premiums go down and wages go up. Obviously, taxes are going \nto go up when wages go up. It is not fair to say that taxes are going \nup for those folks in that category unless you also say it is largely \nbecause their income is going up. I think that should be pointed out as \nwell.\n\n  Our bill will provide a substantial tax cut. It will cut taxes by $40 \nbillion in 2017 alone and cut taxes by $40 billion in 2019 alone and by \nsubstantial net tax cuts year after year. The average affected taxpayer \nwith an income under $75,000 a year would get a tax cut of more than \n$1,500 in 2019. The bill would affect more than 92 million taxpayers a \nyear by 2019. That is reductions. Our bill would affect most taxpayers \nby 2017, and the bill would give average taxpayers affected hundreds of \ndollars of tax relief.\n  Not only would health care reform cut taxes for working Americans, it \nwould also address the single largest challenge to our long-term fiscal \nfuture.\n  Reforming health care is the single most important thing we can do to \naddress long-term budget deficits. The Congressional Budget Office says \nwe will succeed in doing that. CBO says our bill would reduce the \nFederal budget deficit by $130 billion in the first 10 years. CBO says \nour bill would reduce the budget deficit by roughly $650 billion in the \nsecond 10 years. That is roughly $780 billion in net deficit reduction. \nThat is $800 billion in net deficit reduction over 20 years. I think \nthat is progress. That is pretty good.\n  Some of my colleagues say: Gee, Medicaid is pretty expensive, so be \ncareful, Congress, with what you do with respect to imposing \nobligations on States. I remind my colleagues there currently is a \nformula each State must subscribe to with respect to Medicaid. The \nFederal Government pays a certain portion and States pay the other. On \naverage--I could be off--the Federal Government pays 50 to 60 percent \nand the States pay the rest.\n  Under this legislation, we are talking about the so-called \ntransitional group, those where the poverty level is raised, in that \ncategory--I have forgotten the exact figure. But it is not the old \nformula, it is the new formula. Under the new formula, the Federal \nGovernment is paying virtually all of it--not quite all but virtually \nall of it. So the States will get a little bit of an increase in \nobligations. It is small. It is infinitesimal.\n  The underlying point is, we have to reform health care. Why do \nMedicaid costs go up? Because health care costs are going up around the \ncountry--health care costs for seniors, low-income people, health care \ncosts for everybody.\n  There are so many parts of this bill which address that problem, \nwhich address health care costs, to get health care costs down. I would \nthink all State Governors would want this bill to pass. Why? Because we \nare going to begin to go down the road of lowering health care costs. \nThen those Medicaid budgets will be more under control.\n  We have to lower health care costs, and this legislation does that. \nHealth care reform would very much help the economy, not just in the \nnear term but with substantial net tax cuts but also help the economy \nlong term with substantial deficit reduction--but also all the \nprovisions we are putting in to lower health care costs overall.\n  It is, clearly, the right thing to do. I, therefore, believe this \nlegislation should definitely pass. To remind my colleagues who say: \nGee, for folks making more than $250,000 a year, they will pay more \ntaxes, let me make clear: Those folks are not seeing tax rate \nincreases. Those folks are going to pay more taxes because they are \ngoing to get pay raises. That is why they are going to pay more taxes \nbecause, in effect, their incomes are going to go up. They are going to \nget pay increases.\n  I have more to say, but I see my colleague from Vermont on the floor. \nHow much time is remaining on in this block?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 19\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 15 minutes to my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. Before \nI get into the subject I wish to talk about, which is prescription drug \nreimportation and the absolute necessity of lowering the cost of \nprescription drugs in this country, I wish to say a word in general.\n  I find it interesting that my Republican friends are spending a whole \nlot of time down here on the floor attacking the health care \nlegislation. I suppose it is at least a positive thing that they are \nbeginning to talk about health care. They ran the government from 2000 \nto 2006. They had the President, they had the House and the Senate. At \nthat time, health care premiums soared. Millions of Americans lost \ntheir health insurance. Where were they? Where were they in the \nbeginning to come up with ideas to control health care costs and \nprovide health care to more Americans? They weren't there.\n\n  Now, having said that, let me also say I have problems with the bill \nthat is currently on the Senate floor. Clearly, it does a lot of things \nthat are good, but there are weaknesses in this bill in terms of cost \ncontainment that we have to address.\n  When some of my friends talk about expanding Medicaid and the \nproblems associated with that, they make a good point. We need to \nsignificantly expand our primary health care capabilities, which means \nmore community health centers, which means more primary health care \nphysicians. If we are not able to do that while we add 15 million more \npeople to Medicaid, frankly, I am not sure how we are going to deal \nwith the medical needs of those people.\n  So I think one of the imperatives that has to happen as we proceed on \nthis bill is we have to support the language in the House, which \nsubstantially increases funding for community health centers and for \nthe National Health Service Corps, so that we give a primary health \ncare infrastructure--clinics and doctors--to begin to serve the \nmillions more Americans who are going to be coming into the health care \nsystem.\n  That is one issue. The other issue I wanted to focus on today--and I \nam here because Senator Dorgan, who is the sponsor of this legislation, \nis unable to be on the floor of the Senate at this time--deals with \nprescription drug reimportation. This is an issue I have worked on for \nmany years. When I was Vermont's Representative in the U.S. House, I \nbelieve I was the first Member of Congress to take American citizens \nover the Canadian border--in this case to Montreal--in order to \npurchase affordable prescription drugs.\n  I will never forget--never forget--the bus trip we took over from St. \nAlbans, VT, to Montreal, Canada. On that bus there were a number of \nlower income\n\n[[Page S12752]]\n\nwomen who were struggling with breast cancer. Many of them were using \nthe widely used breast cancer drug called Tamoxifen. We got off the bus \nin Montreal, and we walked into the drugstore--and that had all been \nprearranged--and in there they purchased Tamoxifen. At that point in \ntime--and I am thinking it was about 10 years ago, a while back--they \npaid, in American dollars, one-tenth of the price for Tamoxifen in \nMontreal, Canada, that they were paying in the United States of \nAmerica--one-tenth of the price for lower income women who were \nstruggling for their lives.\n  So when you talk about morality, I want some of my friends to explain \nwhy it is that the American people are forced to pay by far the highest \nprices in the world for prescription drugs? Talk to physicians in \nVermont. There is a doctor I know in northern Vermont, and when she \nwrites a prescription, one-third of her patients cannot afford to fill \nthe prescription. So what is the sense of an examination, a diagnosis, \nand writing a script when your patient can't even fill that script?\n  The high cost of prescription drugs in this country is one of the \nmajor health care crises we face. It is an issue we have to deal with, \nand we simply have to ask ourselves why it is that the same exact \nmedicine in this country costs substantially more than it does in \nCanada, in Australia, or all over Europe.\n  There has been a lot of concern in this country about the lack of \nbipartisanship. Well, I have to say that on this issue there is \nbipartisanship. That was true when I was in the House, and that is true \nin the Senate.\n  Let me just read to you the cosponsors of this legislation--\nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents. The bill is introduced by Senator \nDorgan, and the cosponsors are Senator Begich, Senator Boxer, Senator \nCasey, Senator Conrad, Senator Feingold, Senator Inouye, Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Leahy, Senator Lincoln, Senator McCaskill, Senator \nSanders, Senator Snowe, Senator Stabenow, Senator Thune, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Brown, Senator Collins, Senator Durbin, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Johnson, Senator Kerry, Senator Kohl, Senator Levin, \nSenator McCain, Senator Nelson, Senator Shaheen, Senator Specter, \nSenator Tester.\n  So there is widespread bipartisan support for legislation which says: \nLet's end the absurdity of the American people having to pay \nsubstantially more for the same exact medicine that is sold in other \ncountries around the world.\n  Let's take a look at some of these charts. To begin with, we all \nunderstand when you deal with the drug companies and the pharmaceutical \nindustry you are dealing with some of the most powerful lobbyists and \nforces right here in Washington, DC. These people spend huge amounts of \nmoney on campaign contributions, huge amounts of money in lobbying. \nJust recently, in order to make sure they got in under the wire, in \ncase there was some real reform passed in Washington, they \nsubstantially raised their prices for particular drugs just in the year \n2009, and here is the chart reflecting that: Enbrel, a 12-percent \nincrease; Singulair, 12 percent; Plavix, 8 percent, Nexium, 7 percent; \nLipitor, 5 percent; Boniva, 18 percent.\n  One of the reasons health care costs are soaring in America--and one \nof the reasons many seniors are having such a difficult time with \nhealth care costs--is precisely the rapid rise of prescription drugs.\n  What I want to talk about now, through this chart, is something that \nis inexplicable to the average American. This is Lipitor, which is a \nwidely used drug, and here is the cost of Lipitor. The same amount in \nCanada costs $33; in France, $53; Germany, $48; the Netherlands, $63; \nin Spain, $32; the United Kingdom, $40; and in the USA, $125, or four \ntimes as much as it costs in Canada.\n  Now, you explain that to me. The same exact medicine made in the same \nexact factory, the same exact bottle. That is why, by the way, in the \nState of Vermont, and all across the northern tier, every day people \nare going over the Canadian border or using the Internet to buy those \ndrugs. So what we are saying in this legislation is let's end this \nabsurdity.\n  We are living in a global economy. I have a lot of problems with the \nglobal economy in many ways, but if, when we go Christmas shopping, the \nonly products we can find are made in China--because we don't do too \nmuch manufacturing in America--and if when we eat lunch we get lettuce \nand tomatoes from all over the world, what people are asking is, why is \nit we can't bring into this country FDA-safety-approved medicine? We \ncan bring lettuce in from the backwoods of Mexico, and that is OK. But \nsomehow, when we have a handful of major pharmaceutical companies, \npresumably it is just too difficult to be able to bring them safely \ninto the United States. Nobody believes that for one moment.\n  Let's take a look at another chart. Plavix, same story: Canada, $85; \nFrance, $77; Germany, $85; the Netherlands, $77; Spain, $58; the U.K. \n$59; and in the USA, $133. Somebody explain this to me. I really would \nappreciate it.\n  Nexium: Canada, $65; Germany, $37; Spain, $36; the UK, $41; and the \nUnited States of America, $424. That is six times more than in the \nUnited Kingdom. People wonder why Americans are running over the \nCanadian border or they are on the Internet trying to get this \nmedicine.\n  Why is it that the drug companies charge $424 here and $41 in the UK? \nWell, the reason they are charging more here is because they can charge \nmore. If you walk into your drugstore tomorrow, you can find the prices \nthat you will pay are double, triple because we are the only country in \nthe world that does not have, in one way or another, some kind of \nregulation on prices. All these other countries have national health \ncare programs. That is another reason their drug prices are lower. We \ndon't, of course.\n  But at the very least, what reimportation is all about is, we are \nsaying, in a global economy, when all kinds of products are brought in \nfrom all over the world and we let the consumer buy them every day, why \nnot let the pharmacist, let the prescription drug distributor be able \nto take advantage of the global economy?\n  I am not, I must confess, a great supporter of unfettered free trade. \nI think that has, in many ways, been a disaster for American workers. \nBut to the degree that it is here, to the degree businesspeople can run \nto China and pay workers there 50 cents an hour or so, that is the \nglobal economy. Well, here is the global economy: Canada, $65; the UK, \n$41; and the USA, $424. Why can't prescription drug distributors \npurchase their products in the UK, bring them back into America, so we \ncan substantially lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs \nfor all Americans?\n\n  Some of my friends in the pharmaceutical industry say: It is \nimpossible to bring medicine in from abroad. It can't be done safely. \nWell, the Washington Post says:\n\n       40 percent of active ingredients in U.S. prescription drugs \n     currently come from India and China.\n\n  I guess that is OK for the pharmaceutical industry, when it adds to \ntheir profits, but we can't do that to lower the cost to the consumer.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, February 21, 2008, says:\n\n       More than half the world's Heparin, the main ingredient in \n     the widely used anti-clotting medicine, gets its start in \n     China's poorly regulated supply chain.\n\n  Well, I guess that is OK too.\n  So here is where we are. One of the many health care crises we face \nin this country is the high cost of prescription drugs. I think there \nis a lot that we have to do. Whether the Congress is capable of \nstanding up to the drug companies and all their money and all of their \nlobbyists remains to be seen. But this is, quite frankly, a no-brainer.\n  For all my colleagues here who believe in unfettered free trade, \nplease do not be total hypocrites. If you believe in unfettered free \ntrade--which I happen not to--if you believe it is OK for American \ncompanies to shut down and run to China, if you think it is OK for \npeople to buy any product anywhere in the world, tell me why we can do \nthat for everything except for prescription drugs? There is no rational \nexplanation.\n  This is legislation which has been around for years. The drug \ncompanies have fought it successfully for years. We now have widespread \ntripartisan\n\n[[Page S12753]]\n\nsupport in the Senate and a lot of support, I know, in the House. Let's \nfinally stand up for the average American. Let's substantially lower \nthe cost of prescription drugs. Let's pass prescription drug \nreimportation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is there a previous agreement on time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The next hour is equally divided, \nwith 10-minute limits.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2793\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the amendment which, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, would provide an \nestimated $100 billion or more in consumer savings over 10 years. That \nis unique to this bill. It is unique to this legislation. It actually \nsaves the taxpayers money.\n  I think it is important for us to go back and see how we got here--\nagain, with the administration and the President reversing his previous \nposition in favor of drug reimportation, the President's Chief of \nStaff, Mr. Rahm Emanuel, reversing his position on drug reimportation.\n  Again, a lot of it has to do with the deals that have been made. I \nrefer, to start with, to the August 6, 2009, New York Times article.\n\n       Pressed by industry lobbyists, White House officials on \n     Wednesday assured drug makers that the administration stood \n     by a behind-the-scenes deal to block any Congressional effort \n     to extract cost savings from them beyond an agreed-upon $80 \n     billion.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       ``We were assured: We need somebody to come in first. If \n     you come in first, you will have a rock-solid deal,' Billy \n     Tauzin, the former Republican House member from Louisiana who \n     now leads the pharmaceutical trade group, said Wednesday. \n     ``Who is ever going to go into a deal with the White House \n     again if they don't keep their word? You are just going to \n     duke it out instead.''\n       The pressure from Mr. Tauzin to affirm the deal offers a \n     window on the secretive and potentially risky game the Obama \n     administration has played as it tries to line up support from \n     industry groups typically hostile to government health care \n     initiatives, even as their lobbyists pushed to influence the \n     health measure for their benefit.\n\n  Here is the important part of the article--and I ask unanimous \nconsent the entire article from the New York Times be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the News York Times, Aug. 6, 2009]\n\n                 White House Affirms Deal on Drug Cost\n\n                       (By David D. Kirkpatrick)\n\n       Washington.--Pressed by industry lobbyists, White House \n     officials on Wednesday assured drug makers that the \n     administration stood by a behind-the-scenes deal to block any \n     Congressional effort to extract cost savings from them beyond \n     an agreed-upon $80 billion.\n       Drug industry lobbyists reacted with alarm this week to a \n     House health care overhaul measure that would allow the \n     government to negotiate drug prices and demand additional \n     rebates from drug manufacturers.\n       In response, the industry successfully demanded that the \n     White House explicitly acknowledge for the first time that it \n     had committed to protect drug makers from bearing further \n     costs in the overhaul. The Obama administration had never \n     spelled out the details of the agreement.\n       ``We were assured: `We need somebody to come in first. If \n     you come in first, you will have a rock-solid deal,' '' Billy \n     Tauzin, the former Republican House member from Louisiana who \n     now leads the pharmaceutical trade group, said Wednesday. \n     ``Who is ever going to go into a deal with the White House \n     again if they don't keep their word? You are just going to \n     duke it out instead.''\n       A deputy White House chief of staff, Jim Messina, confirmed \n     Mr. Tauzin's account of the deal in an e-mail message on \n     Wednesday night.\n       ``The president encouraged this approach,'' Mr. Messina \n     wrote. ``He wanted to bring all the parties to the table to \n     discuss health insurance reform.''\n       The new attention to the agreement could prove embarrassing \n     to the White House, which has sought to keep lobbyists at a \n     distance, including by refusing to hire them to work in the \n     administration.\n       The White House commitment to the deal with the drug \n     industry may also irk some of the administration's \n     Congressional allies who have an eye on drug companies' \n     profits as they search for ways to pay for the $1 trillion \n     cost of the health legislation.\n       But failing to publicly confirm Mr. Tauzin's descriptions \n     of the deal risked alienating a powerful industry ally \n     currently helping to bankroll millions in television \n     commercials in favor of Mr. Obama's reforms.\n       The pressure from Mr. Tauzin to affirm the deal offers a \n     window on the secretive and potentially risky game the Obama \n     administration has played as it tries to line up support from \n     industry groups typically hostile to government health care \n     initiatives, even as their lobbyists pushed to influence the \n     health measure for their benefit.\n       In an interview on Wednesday, Representative Raul M. \n     Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who is co-chairman of the \n     House progressive caucus, called Mr. Tauzin's comments \n     ``disturbing.''\n        ``We have all been focused on the debate in Congress, but \n     perhaps the deal has already been cut,'' Mr. Grijalva said. \n     ``That would put us in the untenable position of trying to \n     scuttle it.''\n       He added: ``It is a pivotal issue not just about health \n     care. Are industry groups going to be the ones at the table \n     who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over \n     the crust?''\n       The Obama administration has hailed its agreements with \n     health care groups as evidence of broad support for the \n     overhaul among industry ``stakeholders,'' including doctors, \n     hospitals and insurers as well as drug companies.\n       But as the debate has heated up over the last two weeks, \n     Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats have signaled that they \n     value some of its industry enemies-turned-friends more than \n     others. Drug makers have been elevated to a seat of honor at \n     the negotiating table, while insurers have been pushed away.\n       ``To their credit, the pharmaceutical companies have \n     already agreed to put up $80 billion'' in pledged cost \n     reductions, Mr. Obama reminded his listeners at a recent \n     town-hall-style meeting in Bristol, Va. But the health \n     insurance companies ``need to be held accountable,'' he said.\n       ``We have a system that works well for the insurance \n     industry, but it doesn't always work for its customers,'' he \n     added, repeating a new refrain.\n       Administration officials and Democratic lawmakers say the \n     growing divergence in tone toward the two groups reflects a \n     combination of policy priorities and political calculus.\n       With polls showing that public doubts about the overhaul \n     are mounting, Democrats are pointedly reminding voters what \n     they may not like about their existing health coverage to \n     help convince skeptics that they have something to gain.\n       ``You don't need a poll to tell you that people are paying \n     more and more out of pocket and, if they have some serious \n     illness, more than they can afford,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. \n     Obama's senior adviser.\n       The insurers, however, have also stopped short of the drug \n     makers in their willingness to cut a firm deal. The health \n     insurers shook hands with Mr. Obama at the White House in \n     March over their own package of concessions, including ending \n     the exclusion of coverage for pre-existing ailments.\n       But unlike the drug companies, the insurers have not \n     pledged specific cost cuts. And insurers have also \n     steadfastly vowed to block Mr. Obama's proposed government-\n     sponsored insurance plan--the biggest sticking point in the \n     Congressional negotiations.\n       The drug industry trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research \n     and Manufacturers of America, also opposes a public insurance \n     plan. But its lobbyists acknowledge privately that they have \n     no intention of fighting it, in part because their agreement \n     with the White House provides them other safeguards.\n       Mr. Tauzin said the administration had approached him to \n     negotiate. ``They wanted a big player to come in and set the \n     bar for everybody else,'' he said. He said the White House \n     had directed him to negotiate with Senator Max Baucus, the \n     business-friendly Montana Democrat who leads the Senate \n     Finance Committee.\n       Mr. Tauzin said the White House had tracked the \n     negotiations throughout, assenting to decisions to move away \n     from ideas like the government negotiation of prices or the \n     importation of cheaper drugs from Canada. The $80 billion in \n     savings would be over a 10-year period. ``80 billion is the \n     max, no more or less,'' he said. ``Adding other stuff changes \n     the deal.''\n       After reaching an agreement with Mr. Baucus, Mr. Tauzin \n     said, he met twice at the White House with Rahm Emanuel, the \n     White House chief of staff; Mr. Messina, his deputy; and \n     Nancy-Ann DeParle, the aide overseeing the health care \n     overhaul, to confirm the administration's support for the \n     terms.\n       ``They blessed the deal,'' Mr. Tauzin said. Speaker Nancy \n     Pelosi said the House was not bound by any industry deals \n     with the Senate or the White House.\n       But, Mr. Tauzin said, ``as far we are concerned, that is a \n     done deal.'' He said, ``It's up to the White House and \n     Senator Baucus to follow through.''\n       As for the administration's recent break with the insurance \n     industry, Mr. Tauzin said, ``The insurers never made any \n     deal.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The important quote is:\n\n       Mr. Tauzin said the administration had approached him to \n     negotiate. ``They wanted a big player to come in and set the \n     bar for everybody else,'' he said. He said the White\n\n[[Page S12754]]\n\n     House had directed him to negotiate with Senator Max Baucus, \n     the business-friendly Montana Democrat who leads the Senate \n     Finance Committee.\n       Mr. Tauzin said the White House had tracked the \n     negotiations throughout, assenting to decisions to move away \n     from ideas like the government negotiation of prices or the \n     importation of cheaper drugs from Canada.\n\n  My goodness.\n\n       ``They blessed the deal,'' Mr. Tauzin said.\n\n  That is how we got here, with the administration coming over with a \nletter last night basically saying they would oppose or certainly \nimpede the ability of Americans to import drugs from Canada. What have \nwe seen happen in the interim? Here again is a New York Times article \nentitled ``Drug Makers Raise Prices in Face of Health Care Reform.''\n  Here is a graphic demonstration of it. This little line right here, I \nwould say to my colleagues, is inflation in this country. If you look \nat it for the year 2009, inflation is actually minus 1.3 percent.\n  Now look at the wholesale drug prices. The annual change is 8.7 \npercent. While inflation has gone down 1.3 percent, actual costs of \ndrugs have gone up 8.7 percent.\n  The article from the New York Times says:\n\n       Even as drug makers promise to support Washington's health \n     care overhaul by shaving $8 billion a year off the nation's \n     drug costs after the legislation takes effect, the industry \n     has been raising its prices at the fastest rate in years. In \n     the last year, the industry has raised the wholesale prices \n     of brand-name prescription drugs by about 9 percent, \n     according to industry analysts. That will add more than $10 \n     billion to the nation's drug bill. . . .\n\n  Let's get the math right. The drug companies have offered to save the \nAmerican consumer $8 billion a year, and guess what. They have \nincreased their prices, where it will add more than $10 billion to the \ndrug bill of America's citizens, including our seniors.\n  The math is, they agreed to an $8 billion reduction. They actually \nalready this year have seen an increase of more than $10 billion. So \nthey are on track to make a $2 billion profit off their deal. No wonder \nthey made a deal.\n\n       That will add more than $10 billion to the nation's drug \n     bill, which is on track to exceed $300 billion this year. By \n     at least one analysis, it is the highest annual rate of \n     inflation for drug prices since 1992. . . .\n\n  This is the consumer price index right here, which has fallen by 1.3 \npercent.\n\n       Drug makers say they have valid business reasons for the \n     price increases. Critics say the industry is trying to \n     establish a higher price base before Congress passes \n     legislation that tries to curb drug spending incoming years.\n\n  That is what this is all about. They increase the prices so it \nreaches a certain level, and that is what they will negotiate on. They \nalready are in line to experience $2 billion more in profits than the \n$8 billion they say they intend to cut. What a Ponzi scheme this is.\n\n       ``When we have major legislation anticipated, we see a run-\n     up in price increases,'' says Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a \n     professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of \n     Minnesota. He has analyzed drug pricing for AARP, the \n     advocacy group for seniors that supports the House health \n     care legislation that the drug industry opposes.\n       A Harvard health economist, Joseph P. Newhouse, said he \n     found a similar pattern of unusual price increases after \n     Congress added drug benefits to Medicare a few years ago, \n     giving tens of millions of older Americans federally \n     subsidized drug insurance. Just as the program was taking \n     effect in 2006, the drug industry raised prices by the widest \n     margin in a half-dozen years.\n\n  We have seen this scam before. What is the administration going to \ndo? The administration sends a letter, I believe last night--not to the \nsponsor of this legislation, Senator Dorgan, but to another Member \nbasically saying they would have to examine the health and safety.\n  Since when is a prescription drug imported from Canada a threat to \nAmericans' health, since they obviously have the same standards that we \ndo? The letter is to Senator Carper. It is signed by Margaret Hamburg, \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs. It is--I am not making this up. I am \nnot making this up. ``The Dorgan importation amendment seeks to address \nthese risks.'' It talks about our amendment.\n\n       We commend the sponsors for their efforts to include \n     numerous protective measures in the bill that address the \n     inherent risks of importing foreign products and other safety \n     concerns relating to the distribution system for drugs within \n     the U.S. However, as currently written, the resulting \n     structure would be logistically challenging to implement and \n     resource intensive.\n\n  Let's get this straight. According to the CBO, if we pass this, we \nwould save consumers $10 billion--excuse me--$100 billion. According to \nCBO, we would provide an estimated $100 billion in consumer savings \nover 10 years. That is what the CBO says.\n  But what this obviously heavily overburdened Margaret Hamburg, the \nCommissioner of Food and Drug, says is:\n\n       However, as currently written, the resulting structure \n     would be logistically challenging to implement and resource \n     intensive.\n\n  Oh my God. I am going to have to include, for the Record, the number \nof employees over at the Food and Drug Administration. I am sure they \nare full up with their responsibilities at present.\n\n       In addition, there are significant safety concerns related \n     to allowing the importation of non-bioequivalent products, \n     and safety issues relating to confusion in distribution and \n     labeling of foreign products--\n\n  When we see something come in from foreign countries, it is so \nconfusing when you look at the labeling of it. It is remarkably \nchallenging for the American consumer----\n\n     relating to the distribution and labeling of foreign products \n     and the domestic product that remain to be fully addressed in \n     the amendment.\n\n  ``But''--she goes on to say, to Senator Carper, who is a fine and \ngreat Member of this body but not the sponsor of the amendment----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for an additional 30 seconds to finish.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. ``We appreciate your fine leadership on this important \nissue and would look forward to working with you as we continue to \nexplore policy options to develop an avenue for the importation of safe \nand effective prescription drugs from other countries.''\n  Translated: The fix is in. We will be back on the floor on this. I \nstrongly urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am back on the floor on this, \nas I have been over the course of the last decade, because we have been \nlike a yo-yo in my State of Florida on the importation of drugs, since \nwe have quite a few senior citizens in our State. They have been \naccustomed to either going to Canada and bringing back prescriptions at \nhalf the price or phoning Canada to pharmacies and having those drugs \nshipped in the Postal Service or e-mailing to Canadian pharmacies. What \nhappened over the course of the last 8 or 9 years is that the previous \nadministration cracked down on the reimportation of these drugs. Of \ncourse, that was at a great expense to our senior citizens who can buy \nthese drugs at roughly \\1/2\\ of what they pay by going into the \npharmacies in the United States.\n  Then an interesting thing happened along about 2006. This Senator \nstarted getting multiples of calls--I think up to something like 100 \ncomplaints in that 1 year from senior citizens who had purchased the \ndrugs, either by e-mail, telephone, or by going personally there and \nhaving them shipped. And lo and behold, under the previous \nadministration, they gave the order to the Postal Service to confiscate \nthese drugs. This happened, for example, to a couple from Mt. Dora, FL, \nMr. and Mrs. Lee Eads. They had their drugs confiscated. We went after \nthe Postal Service. We went after the Customs Bureau. We found, in \nfact, that a lot of these complaints we had received, those drugs had \nbeen confiscated when, in fact, the policy was supposed to be if it was \npharmaceuticals for personal use--and they defined that as less than a \n90-day supply--the government, the U.S. Government, was going to let \nthese senior citizens take advantage of getting that cost break of a \n50-percent reduction.\n  It took us till late 2006--getting into this with Mr. and Mrs. Eads \nas the poster couple who had been getting their prescription drugs and \nthen, all of\n\n[[Page S12755]]\n\na sudden, they were confiscated--to get the Postal Service and Customs \nto reverse. This has supposedly been the policy, but we can't get it \netched into law because people keep bringing up this Trojan horse that \nit is not safe. The very manufacturers we are buying our prescriptions \nfrom here in American pharmacies are the same manufacturers in \nidentical locations with identical labeling of the drugs that are going \nto Canadian pharmacies. Why can't we give our senior citizens a break?\n  Of course, what this Senator would like to do is to give them a \nbigger break. This Senator has an amendment, which is continuously \nbeing stated that I may not get to offer, that would cause the \npharmaceutical industry to give discounts on the drugs sold under \nMedicare that are being sold to 6 million people who are eligible \nbecause of their low income for Medicaid but get their drugs through \nMedicare. Those 6 million people, Medicaid, poor people who are \neligible to get government assistance, used to have a discount, a \nsubstantial discount. Therefore, the U.S. Government was paying less \nfor the drugs it bought for those people. But 6 years ago, when the \nprescription drug benefit was passed, those 6 million people were \nsuddenly made ineligible to get the drug discount because they were now \ngetting their drugs under Medicare. That is absolutely ridiculous, that \nthe U.S. Government is going to pay full price for the drugs now that \nthey used to pay only a fraction.\n  How much is that worth? According to CBO and the amendment I offered \nin the Finance Committee that was defeated 10 to 13, that is worth $106 \nbillion over 10 years that would be savings to the American taxpayer \nthat we would be paying for those dual eligibles, Medicaid recipients \nwho get their drugs in Medicare, $106 billion of savings that the U.S. \nGovernment would not have to pay for those drugs, if we followed the \nsame policy we did back there before this prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare.\n  That kind of makes common sense, doesn't it, that we would want to \nsave the American taxpayer $106 billion? But we were defeated by a vote \nof 13 opposed to the amendment and 10 in favor in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I know it is a tall order to bring this amendment out here on the \nfloor and have to meet a 60-vote threshold, because 41 Senators can \ndeny the American taxpayer from getting $106 billion of savings. One of \nthe good things about our bill that has come to the floor is, we are \ngoing to reduce the deficit by $130 billion. That is over a 10-year \nperiod. That is a good thing. But if we would accept my amendment, we \ncould reduce the deficit by $236 billion or we could use part of it--\nsay, half--to fill the rest of the doughnut hole that the AARP would \nlike and so would this Senator. The AARP strongly supports my \namendment. They have made it clear to the leadership of this Senate \nthat they want to see that doughnut hole closed. But there is nothing \ncoming out here on the floor that is going to do that.\n  The amendment Senator Dorgan has offered, which in and of itself is \ngood policy, reimporting drugs at half the cost from Canada, is a step \nin the right direction, but that doesn't close the doughnut hole.\n  So here we are at a decision point. Who are we going to serve? Let me \nsay at the outset I understand the political dynamics. I want to give \ncredit where credit is due. The pharmaceutical industry is, in fact, \nsupporting the leadership in trying to pass this bill. That is a good \nthing. We appreciate that very much. We need their support because we \nhave all these other interest groups that are flaking off. At the end \nof the day, we have to get 60 votes in order to pass health care \nreform. That includes health insurance reform. We have the insurance \nindustry totally, flat out trying to kill this legislation. I am \ngrateful to the pharmaceutical industry for trying to help us. \nTherefore, my plea is, there has to be a balance. There has to be a \ncompromise in the works. There has to be a way of the pharmaceutical \nindustry stepping to the plate to help us totally fill the doughnut \nhole, that gaping $3,000 hole seniors have to pay for all of the drugs \nthey need when they reach that level. There has to be a sweet spot, a \ncompromise.\n  I certainly support the Dorgan amendment. I hope the Senate will \nfavorably consider my amendment later on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris.) The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 19 minutes on the Republican side and \nSenators are limited to 10 minutes each.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have been talking about the Crapo motion and the \nnew taxes that are in this bill. There are so many new taxes that it is \ngoing to increase the cost of health care to every individual who has \nhealth insurance. It will also tax the people who don't have health \ninsurance. It will tax the people who have too much health insurance. \nThe taxes in this bill are almost mind-boggling.\n  Yesterday we talked about the cuts in Medicare. But we are also \ntalking now about the $\\1/2\\ trillion in tax increases, $500 billion of \ntax increases. What Senator Crapo's motion will do is to say that we \nwant to go back to the promise made by the President that no one who \nmakes under $200,000 or a couple who makes under $250,000 would have \nany tax increases. It recommits the bill and takes out everything that \nwould tax individuals at that level because the promise was made to the \nAmerican people.\n  Senator Crapo's motion would certainly benefit those who have high-\nbenefit plans which are going to have a 40-percent excise tax in this \nbill. If your plan is considered high benefit and you make under \n$200,000 a year or you are a couple making under $250,000 a year, you \nshould not have to pay, because your benefits are better than the \ngovernment has said they should be.\n  We would help the union member, for instance, because the unions do \nhave high-benefit plans. We would help those union members who are \nmaking under $200,000 a year, if they are single, to make sure that \nthey are not going to pay a tax for having too much coverage. Then \nthere are the individuals who have no coverage or too little coverage \nwho are going to have to pay an individual tax in this bill of $750. \nSurely if someone can't afford to have health insurance, we should not \nbe taxing them. The Crapo motion will assure that when this goes back \nto the committee, someone would not be subject to the individual \nmandated tax, if they make under $200,000 a year, which they surely \nprobably do, or if they have a high-benefit plan and they make under \nthat amount. It is trying to say that promise that the President made \nwould be kept.\n  I also wish to talk about another issue in this bill. One would think \nthat the bill takes effect in 2014, so the taxes would take effect in \n2014 as well, that everything will come together and start in 2014. \nThat is what one would think, but they would be wrong. That is not the \ncase. In fact, the biggest part of the taxes in this bill will take \neffect next month, less than 1 month from now. The taxes that are going \nto increase the cost of health care premiums, prescription drugs, \nequipment that you would use for medical care--the taxes start next \nmonth. The bill imposes taxes for 4 years before any person would be \nable to sign up for any of the plans that are going to be available, \npresumably, under this bill.\n  Let's walk through this: $22 billion in taxes on prescription drug \nmanufacturers would start next month; $19 billion in taxes on medical \ndevice manufacturers, next month; $60 billion in taxes on insurance \ncompanies across the board, next month. What is going to happen? Of \ncourse, the cost of all of those items will go up. Americans will start \nnext month paying more in insurance premiums. Americans will pay more \nfor their prescription drugs and more for their medical devices because \nthose taxes start next month for supposed programs that are going to \nstart in 2014. Well, maybe you would think the benefits would start \ncoming in 2011, 2012, 2013. Not at all. Nothing starts in benefits or \nprograms until 2014.\n\n  But there are more taxes that come before 2014. In 2013, taxes on \nhigh-benefit plans take effect: $149 billion. This will affect union \nmembers, surely people making under $200,000. They will be affected \nstarting in 2013, but any benefits from this bill would take effect a \nwhole year later.\n\n[[Page S12756]]\n\n  The limit on itemized deductions for medical expenses is also \nchanged. Under this bill, you would have to spend 10 percent of your \nincome on medical expenses before you could take a deduction. This is \nfor people who have a terrible accident or a debilitating high-cost \ndisease, such as a cancer treatment, maybe a clinical trial. So present \nlaw is 7.5 percent of your income, and you can start deducting these \nexpenses. But with the new bill, starting in 2013, you have to go to \nthe 10-percent threshold before you can have those deductions. So that \nwould be another $15 billion in taxes to individuals.\n  Finally, in 2014, after 4 years of taxes and increases in premiums \nand medical devices and prescription drugs, then you would start seeing \nthe rest of the bill take effect. In 2014, you still have more taxes. \nMr. President, $28 billion in employer taxes will start in 2014. These \nare for employers who cannot afford to meet the threshold of what they \nwill have to cover for their employees. Or individuals who cannot \nafford health care will have $8 billion in taxes. That starts in 2014.\n  I am working with Senator Thune. There will be a Hutchison-Thune \nmotion to commit this bill that will say the taxes start when the \nimplementation of the bill starts. I think that is a matter of \nfairness. We want to commit the bill and say: Everything should start \nat once. How can we tax people for 4 years, raise their prices on \ninsurance premiums, raise their prices on drugs, raise their prices on \nmedical devices when they get none of the opportunities that would be \nin this bill until 2014?\n  I am going to be working with Senator Thune, Senator Grassley, and \nSenator Hatch to try to make the corrections in this bill that will \npresent transparency and fairness to the public about what these taxes \nare and when they start, then, when the implementation of the program \nstarts.\n  It is so important we have the ability to say to the American people, \nif this bill passes: You are not going to be taxed, your prices are not \ngoing to go up, your premiums are not going to go up--any more than \nthey already have, caused by the increased taxes in this bill--at least \nuntil the bill is implemented. We are going to try to do that in the \nbill for the American people very soon. I am very much looking forward \nto talking about this issue.\n  I talked to someone last night who heard us starting to talk about \nthe taxes in this bill, and they were astounded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. They were astounded.\n  We are going to try to give relief to the American people and have a \nbill that will truly not have the taxes and mandates that are there now \nthat start 4 years before the bill is implemented.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and the \nchairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak concerning an amendment on which \nI am proud to join the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Byron Dorgan, and \nother colleagues in an effort to lower the cost of prescription drugs. \nBut I do want to make one comment on Medicare before I do that.\n  We know our plan, overall, is about saving lives, saving money, and \nsaving Medicare. That is what this is about overall. That is what we \nare doing in our health care reform proposal for American families. But \nI do want to mention and stress again this is about saving Medicare. It \nis about strengthening Medicare and our commitment.\n  I do have to say, we have been hearing from colleagues, and the \ndistinguished Republican leader has said over and over again that, in \nfact, cutting Medicare is not what Americans want. Then last night he \nsaid here on the floor that expanding Medicare was a plan for financial \nruin. So they do not want to cut, they do not want to expand. I am not \nsure where our colleagues on the other side are in terms of Medicare. \nBut I know where we are. I know we are the party that created Medicare, \nwith President Johnson at the time. We are the party that has continued \nto promote and to expand and to strengthen Medicare. We are the party \nthat intends to make sure we save Medicare for the future, expanding \nprescription drug coverage, to be able to close the doughnut hole, to \nbe able to expand the ability of seniors to have preventive care, and \nto extend the life of the Medicare trust fund, which is critically \nimportant.\n  And to that, I want to speak now to the other two provisions we have \nas our priorities: saving lives and saving money. The Dorgan-and-others \namendment, which I am proud to join Senator Dorgan on, does exactly \nthat. It will save lives and save money. As a Senator from Michigan, I \nknow that very well. We can look across the Detroit River into Windsor \nand know that the people of Michigan, by going across the bridge, would \nbe able to drop their costs 30, 40, 50 percent.\n  There is something wrong with the system where Americans are paying \nso much more than those in other countries for the same drug. The \nsafety provisions are the same. The difference is there have been \nprotections put up at the American border to stop Americans from \ngetting the benefit of having our hospitals, our pharmacies, our \nschools of medicine, and others who use prescription drugs to be able \nto bring that back, to do business across the border.\n  Everybody is always talking about open borders, open trade. Well, \nthis is a trade issue about bringing back FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs across the border to the American side, so Americans have access \nto lower priced medicines.\n  It has been about 10 years now since I did my first bus trip to \nCanada with seniors. I have been doing that for a long time. I have \nbeen focused on this issue both in my days in the House of \nRepresentatives, where I took the lead on this issue, as well as now \nworking with colleagues in the Senate. It is time to get this right in \nthe context of health care reform because this is about saving lives \nand saving money.\n\n  I want to share one story. I have heard so many over the years from \npeople in Michigan. But here is one recent story of someone who has \nwritten to me.\n  Joe is a 40-year-old father with heart disease. His family says \ndespite his heart condition, he is doing well. He loves to work. His \nmedicines cost over $4,800 a month. Can you imagine that? But his \ninsurance has a family cap of $10,000 a year. In other words, after \nbasically 2 months, he hits the cap, and he has to pay for everything \nout of pocket.\n  By going over the bridge to Canada--and we have three bridges: up in \nthe Upper Peninsula, we have a bridge; in Port Huron we have a bridge; \nand in Detroit we have a bridge, the largest cross-border bridge in \nterms of volume of goods and services on the northern border--but by \nsimply going across the bridge, Joe would be able to save $2,000 a \nmonth.\n  We should be able to do better for Joe and his family. He could save \n$2,000--almost half of his cost--by simply buying the same drug, FDA \napproved, from one side of the bridge instead of the other.\n  We also know that the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor is about 40 \npercent less, also the ulcer medication Prevacid is about 50 percent \nless, according to a search on Pharmacy Checker. I have to say that \nagain. This is a trade issue and whether we are going to continue to \nhave trade barriers. Because, for instance, Lipitor is made in Ireland \nand Pfizer is able to bring that back to America, they can bring it \nback. But if someone wants to go to Windsor, Canada, right across the \nbridge, and purchase a lower priced version of the very same drug, \nLipitor, and bring it back as an individual or a business or a pharmacy \nor a hospital, it is illegal. It is illegal. That makes absolutely no \nsense.\n  This amendment is about opening the border, allowing our pharmacies, \nallowing our wholesalers, allowing hospitals--I have gotten calls from \nmedical schools at universities wanting to do business, to lower their \ncost, with wholesalers in other countries where it is FDA approved, \nsafe to do that. That is what this bill is about.\n  Right now, we are in a situation where if we do not pass the \nPharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act, which we have \nintroduced on a\n\n[[Page S12757]]\n\nbipartisan basis, we are going to continue to have a situation where \npeople such as Joe, a 40-year-old father with heart disease, is going \nto be paying $4,800 a month out of his own pocket, when we could cut \nthat down. It still would be tremendous, but we could cut that by \n$2,000 for him, by passing this legislation.\n  The drug importation bill is supported conceptually. We have been \nworking over time with many different groups such as AARP, the Alliance \nfor Retired Americans, Families USA, and Cato Institute--very different \ngroups philosophically, but they all agree we need more competition, we \nneed to open the border to safe--and I emphasize and underline \n``safe''--FDA-approved prescription drugs so we are focused not on what \nis best for the pharmaceutical industry, the brand-name companies, but \nwhat is best for American citizens who are struggling, who see their \nprices go up 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent every year. \nFamilies cannot sustain that.\n  How many of us have stood on this floor and talked about the fact \nthat people are choosing between food and medicine? That is not just \nrhetoric. It is not rhetoric. It is real. It is real for people right \nnow today. It is getting cold. It is getting very cold. People are \ndeciding: Am I going to keep the heat on or am I going to be able to \nget my medicine? Am I going to be able to get my food? Am I able to get \nmy medicine? Am I able to pay the rent, the mortgage, or get the \nmedicine I need for my life or for my child's life or for my husband's \nor wife's ability to continue to live a healthy, successful life?\n  That is what this is about. We have an easy, straightforward way to \nincrease competition, to bring down prices, with safe, strong safety \nstandards. This is something that makes sense. It will help seniors. It \nwill help people with disabilities who are in the doughnut hole before \nwe get that all closed under Medicare. It will help every family and \nevery individual right now who needs medicine and is paying more and \nmore, higher and higher prices every single year.\n  I hope we will have a very strong bipartisan vote. This is a very \nimportant addition to what we are doing here. This truly will save \nlives and save money; and that is what we are all about: creating \ncompetition to bring prices down so the American people have access to \nthe medicine and to the health care they need and deserve.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about keeping \nPresident Obama's promise to the American people when it comes to tax \nincreases in this health care bill.\n  You will recall on September 12, 2008, he said:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge: Under my plan, no family making \n     less than $250,000 will see their taxes increase . . . not \n     your income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital \n     gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\n\n  The problem we see, though, is this bill, as proposed, increases \ntaxes for 25 percent of taxpayers earning less than $200,000 a year. \nThat is 42 million individuals and families who will be taxed in a way \nthat violates President Obama's pledge.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Internal Revenue \nService will need many more agents and workers in order to enforce the \nReid bill. It will essentially need to double in size the Internal \nRevenue Service just to be able to raise those taxes called for in this \nbig job-killing bill.\n  The possibility of higher taxes is one reason job creators are \ncurrently standing on the sidelines. The President had a job summit. \nYesterday he spoke at Brookings Institute and talked about initiatives \nhe was going to undertake in order to help create jobs in this country. \nBut the fact is, government doesn't create jobs except to the extent we \ngrow the size of government. What we need to do in this country is to \nget out of the way, reduce the burden, and limit the uncertainty for \nthe private sector--small business that is the primary job-creating \nengine in this country.\n  But the fact is, job creators are nervous--I would strike that; they \nare not nervous, they are scared--about one job-killing proposal after \nanother coming out of Washington. Not just the spending, not just the \ndebt, but they see things such as this big health care bill and the \nincrease in taxes that go along with it. Then they see the President \ngoing to Copenhagen and perhaps trying to obligate our country to some \nadditional financial burdens that are going to make it harder for these \njob-creators, not easier.\n  The debt, for example, is one looming disaster. The total public debt \nnow stands at $12 trillion. Before the end of the month, the majority \nleader is going to come to the Senate floor, presumably on a Defense \nappropriations bill or some other vehicle, and ask us to lift the debt \nlimit because Congress has maxed out the American people's credit card, \nand we can't keep running the government unless we increase the debt \nlimit.\n  Well, a number of us are not going to vote for that increase in debt \nlimit until we receive firm assurances that the administration and the \nmajority are going to get real about this increasing debt and unfunded \nFederal liabilities in Medicare, in Medicaid, and other entitlement \nprograms.\n  We are accumulating debt even faster during this fiscal year. For \nexample, in just 2 months--2 months of this year--the Congressional \nBudget Office says an additional $292 billion in deficits were \naccumulated. Our deficits will average nearly $1 trillion for every \nyear during the next decade, according to the Obama administration \nitself. Of course, I mentioned the other unfunded liabilities out \nthere--things such as Medicare.\n  I understand the majority has somehow cut a tentative deal to try to \ngrow Medicare. Well, if you grow Medicare and grow Medicaid, what does \nthat do to the already $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities? This $38 \ntrillion is three times our national debt. It means, in essence, a debt \nburden of $32,000 for every U.S. family. Yet my colleagues don't seem \ndesirous of fixing this problem. They seem determined to make it worse.\n  Yesterday the Washington Post reported on our Nation's deteriorating \nfiscal situation. They said:\n\n       The problem is that, if investors think the United States \n     isn't fiscally responsible--\n\n  I wonder why they would conclude that? But they go on to say--\n\n     they could start demanding much higher interest rates when \n     they bid on Treasury securities.\n\n  That is, when they start buying our debt, as a result of all of this \nspending and the money we have to borrow from China and other countries \nthat buy our debt, those countries could begin to demand higher \ninterest rates.\n  The Washington Post goes on to say:\n\n       The feedback loop could get ugly. The Nation could have to \n     borrow hundreds of billions of dollars just to pay interest \n     on what it owes. This has been touted as a classic path to \n     irreversible national decline.\n\n  The Post cited Leonard Burman, an economist at Syracuse University, \nwho said:\n\n       Right now, this year, we have $1.6 trillion in debt coming \n     due--\n\n  And that is before we pass this ill-conceived health care bill.\n  He said:\n\n       That's roughly twice individual income tax revenue. Our \n     only plausible strategy for paying that back is to borrow \n     more money.\n\n  The Post also cited David M. Walker, a former Comptroller of the \nUnited States, who recently testified:\n\n       Our total Federal financial hole is about $10 trillion more \n     than the current estimated net worth of all Americans and the \n     gap has been growing.\n\n  Then, adding insult to injury, yesterday Moody's Investors Service \nsaid its debt ratings on U.S. Treasury securities ``may test the \nTriple-A boundaries'' because the government's fiscal status is \nworsening.\n  Well, the fact is, this Reid health care bill makes this much worse. \nMy colleagues say the CBO--the Congressional Budget Office--has scored \nthe bill as deficit-neutral. Well, any bill can be called deficit-\nneutral if you are willing to raise taxes enough and cut programs such \nas Medicare, both of which this bill does.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said in their score of the Reid bill:\n\n       The long-term budgetary impact could be quite different if \n     key provisions of the bill were ultimately changed or not \n     fully implemented.\n\n  Well, what could they mean by that? What they mean is some of the \nassumptions about the cuts and other things that range over a 10-year \nbudget window, if they don't come true, then all bets are off.\n\n[[Page S12758]]\n\n  We know the Reid bill relies on budget gimmicks to hide the true cost \nof this Washington takeover. One gimmick is, for example, not including \nthe Medicare provider fix, the so-called doc fix, which costs $210 \nbillion over 10 years. In other words, this bill leaves that out \nentirely. I know--I am confident because Congress has only failed to \nact to reverse those cuts on one occasion--that if we let this cut in \nprovider payments to physicians be fully implemented--a 23-percent cut \ncome January--then many Medicare beneficiaries, including the vastly \nexpanded rolls that would be included under this deal we have read \nabout in the paper, patients will not be able to find a doctor to see \nthem because doctors will not be able to continue seeing patients with \na 23-percent cut in the payments they are entitled to under Medicare.\n\n  The other issue is the time shift. This is really sort of the classic \nshell game. The Reid bill starts the tax increases and the Medicare \ncuts in 2010, but as we know, the expanded coverage doesn't start until \n2014. Someone said that is like buying a house, closing on the sale of \na house, and being told: Well, you can't move in for 4 years. You have \nto start paying the bill today, but you don't get the benefits for 4 \nyears.\n  The Congressional Budget Office score focuses on the budgetary impact \nto the government, not on the total cost to the American people. The \nCBO said the Reid bill increases the Federal budgetary commitments to \nhealth care. In other words, rather than trying to bend the cost curve \nas we have heard should be the goal, this makes it worse. We end up \nbending the cost curve in the wrong direction. The Reid bill will \nincrease premiums for American families purchasing insurance in the \nindividual market. The Congressional Budget Office hasn't yet been \ngiven time to estimate the total cost on the economy as a whole.\n  David Broder, one of the deans of the Washington Press Corps, did a \nnice roundup of nonpartisan experts last week. He cited Robert Bixby of \nthe Concord Coalition, Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a \nResponsible Federal Budget, and he concluded this:\n\n       Every expert I have talked to says that these bills as they \n     stand are budget-busters.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. So I hope my colleagues will pass the Crapo motion to \ncommit this bill to the Finance Committee so the President can keep his \ncommitment not to raise taxes on the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the \nDorgan-Snowe importation amendment No. 2793, which provides some much-\nneeded relief to Americans who are being crushed by ever-higher \nprescription drug costs. I wish to first note I am eagerly awaiting the \ndetails of some of the proposals that were put out there last night. I \nappreciate the work of my colleagues, but I do want to hear the \nresponse from the Congressional Budget Office. As I have said on this \nfloor many times, I am concerned about expanding Medicare unless we do \nsomething about the geographic disparities that are already present in \nour system. When we look at some of the numbers, the average patient \ngot $6,600 in Minnesota in 2006, and Texas is something like $9,300. \nWhat we want to try to do with this bill, and what I like about this \nbill, is all of the cost reform measures that are going to push us \ntoward rewarding States that are participating in systems that provide \nmore efficient care. If we don't do something about these geographic \ndisparities, we are going to further exacerbate this by expanding \nMedicare.\n  So I have some concerns about this, and I look forward to hearing \nfrom my colleagues as well as, of course, the solvency of the Medicare \nProgram, which is scheduled to go in the red by 2017 under existing \ncircumstances.\n  Back to the Dorgan-Snowe amendment. This amendment not only would \nallow American pharmacies and drug wholesalers to import FDA-approved \nmedications from Canada and several other countries and pass the \nsavings on to consumers, it would also import some much-needed \ncompetition into the American pharmaceutical market. It is estimated \nthat the amendment, which enjoys both Democratic and Republican \nsponsors, would result in Federal savings of $19.4 billion over 10 \nyears, just at a time when we are looking for these kinds of savings.\n  Millions of Americans depend on prescription drugs to help them \nmanage chronic disease or other illnesses, but drug prices continue to \nskyrocket with annual increases well above the general inflation rate. \nFrom 1997 to 2007, retail drug prices increased an average of 6.9 \npercent per year, more than 2\\1/2\\ times the general rate of inflation, \nwhich was 2.6 percent per year over the same period.\n  Look at that difference: 6.9 percent per year compared to 2.6 percent \nper year. As a result of these rising prices, many patients are forced \nto split pills, skip doses, or not fill their prescriptions at all. Yet \nright across the northern border of Minnesota and Canada, many of these \nsame brand-name prescription drugs are available at a much lower cost.\n  For example, according to one recent comparison, a 90-day supply of \nLipitor costs $256 in the United States. In Canada, it is available for \n$188. In other words, Canadians pay 26 percent less than Americans for \nthe very same drug.\n  Here is another example: A 90-day supply of Nitroderm patches cost \n$303 in the United States but $125 in Canada. The Canadian price is 59 \npercent cheaper. We can go right down the line of major brand-name \ndrugs and see these dramatic price disparities. In fact, every year, \nCanada's pharmaceutical pricing board compares Canadian prices for \npatented drug products with prices in a number of other countries. \nConsistently, prices in the United States are higher by double-digit \npercentages. In 2008 U.S. prices were, on the average, 63 percent \nhigher than Canadian prices.\n  Now, current Federal law says no one except the manufacturer can \nimport a drug into the United States. Wholesale and retail pharmacies \naren't allowed to. State and local governments aren't allowed to. \nIndividual Americans aren't allowed to, even for personal use. But, of \ncourse, they do, and they have been doing it for a number of years.\n  My State, as I noted, happens to be on the border of Canada. Every \nday Canadians cross over to Minnesota to work and make purchases and \nfish and do all kinds of things. Likewise, Minnesotans cross over to \nCanada every day to work and make purchases and fish. It is no big \ndeal. We are not afraid of Canadians. Minnesotans know that Canadians \npay less--much less--for many of their prescription drugs.\n  Beginning in the 1990s, the Minnesota Senior Federation started \norganizing bus trips for seniors to go up and cross the border into \nCanada so they could get affordable prices for the drugs they depend \non.\n  The Senior Federation also introduced a prescription drug importation \nprogram and used its buying power to negotiate directly with Canadian \nmail order pharmacies to provide lower cost prescription drugs to \nMinnesota seniors. But drug prices in the United States just continue \nto go higher and higher and higher so the pressure to find some relief \nkept growing.\n  Finally, some State governments decided to take their own initiative \nto help their residents purchase lower cost drugs from Canada. \nMinnesota was one of the very first. There was broad bipartisan support \nfor this with a Republican Governor and Democrats and Republicans in \nthe legislature.\n  In February 2004, the State of Minnesota established RX-Connect, the \nfirst State-run Web site to provide citizens with information on how to \nsafely purchase drugs from Canada. The Web site lists prices for \nhundreds of brand-name and generic medications as well as voicemail and \ne-mail contact information.\n  The American pharmaceutical industry likes to use scare tactics to \nkeep people from buying their medications in Canada. Look at what is \nhappening. You don't see a lot of problems there with their drugs.\n  The Dorgan-Snowe amendment takes on renewed importance and urgency \nbecause the American pharmaceutical industry has been imposing \nsuspicious drug price increases this year. Last month, the New York \nTimes reported that drugmakers have been busy raising prices for the \nmost common prescribed medicines in anticipation of\n\n[[Page S12759]]\n\npossible health care reform. The newspaper quoted industry analysts as \nsaying that in the 12 months ending September 30, drugmakers have \nraised the wholesale prices of brand-name prescription drugs by about 9 \npercent. Overall, that means an additional $10 billion in health care \nspending. That is the largest increase since 1992, and it happened even \nas the consumer price index declined during the same 12-month period. \nSome analysts suggest that these prices are being inflated artificially \nin expectation of new reform that could otherwise reduce prescription \ndrug prices. A similar trend was observed just before Medicare Part D \ntook effect.\n  Just last week, an economist at the University of Minnesota said:\n\n       Curiously, prescription drug prices appear to rise more \n     rapidly in periods just prior to major policy changes. Brand-\n     name and specialty drug prices accelerated before the \n     Medicare Part D program was enacted and implemented.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here.\n  This amendment would allow U.S. licensed pharmacies and drug \nwholesalers to import FDA-approved medications from Canada, Europe, \nAustralia, New Zealand, and Japan and then pass on the savings to \nconsumers.\n  Real health care reform requires real changes from business as usual. \nThis amendment would start to bring some real changes--opening up new \nchoices to American consumers and injecting new competition into the \npharmaceutical marketplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Dorgan \nreimportation amendment of which I am a cosponsor. I am very glad to \nsupport this important amendment. It is a bipartisan effort.\n  Unfortunately, most of this debate and effort about the underlying \nbill is anything but bipartisan. This is a welcome contrast to that, a \nbipartisan effort around a very important reform proposal--\nreimportation of prescription drugs.\n  We face an interesting situation. The United States is, by far, the \nbiggest market for prescription drugs in the world. Yet with all that \nbuying power and all that activity, we pay, by far, the highest prices \nin the world.\n  It is for a simple reason: We don't have a true worldwide free market \nin prescription drugs. We need to do that, in part, through \nreimportation.\n  Americans need lower prices. They need the sorts of prices being \noffered elsewhere. We need to break down this system by which the big \ndrug companies can and do offer the same drugs at very different prices \nin different countries, and, of course, they offer them at the highest \nprices in the world in the United States. Americans should not have to \nchoose between their lifesaving medicines and other basic needs, such \nas food and utility bills.\n  By voting for the Dorgan amendment and enacting comprehensive \nreimportation, we can directly address access to health care and truly \nlower health care costs, which I believe should be our top goal in this \nentire debate. That is what this amendment does. It gives Americans \nimmediate relief from outrageously high prescription drug prices.\n  Our amendment allows individuals the freedom to buy their \nprescription drugs at affordable prices, while providing oversight to \nensure that only FDA-approved and safe drugs are permitted.\n  Our amendment closes loopholes that big pharma has been using to \nfight reimportation, such as shutting down drugs to wholesalers who \nparticipate in reimportation.\n  Our amendment would close the poison-pill loophole requiring HHS \ncertification, which has left it up to administrations to deny \nreimportation by making that comprehensive reimportation discretionary. \nIt would shut down that poison-pill loophole.\n  We would make it mandatory that Americans have affordable choices for \nprescription drugs.\n  Many of us, Democrats and Republicans, and certainly including and \nstarting with Senators Dorgan and Snowe, have long fought for this \ncomprehensive solution. We have made important steps forward. The \nSenate has adopted amendments to allow personal reimportation. Just \nlast year, we voted overwhelmingly, 73 to 23, that we need to enact \nthis sort of comprehensive reimportation reform, and we have taken \nconcrete steps, such as the personal reimportation provisions, some of \nwhich I have authored and passed through the Senate. But we need to go \nfurther, and we need this comprehensive approach.\n  Obviously, the big stumbling block in the way is the powerful \npharmaceutical lobby, big pharma, which has spent millions in lobbying \nto stop this comprehensive approach. Just this past summer, Senator \nMcCain read an e-mail on the Senate floor from a big pharma lobbyist \noutlining their strategy to derail those efforts in the Senate. More \nrecently, there are reports that they may have struck a deal with the \nWhite House to derail these sorts of efforts and offered to spend tens \nof millions in support of so-called health care reform, perhaps with a \ndeal to derail these efforts.\n  That is why I am so glad Democrats and Republicans are coming \ntogether around this amendment to say that enough is enough. We need to \nfight all of these backroom deals. We need to fight this pervasive \ninfluence by pharma and finally stand with average Americans and pass \nreal, comprehensive reimportation reform that will bring down prices, \nbring down health care costs, which should be the top priority of all \nof us.\n  We all say we want to lower health care costs. That has been a big \nissue in this overall debate. Well, this amendment will absolutely do \nthat. The Congressional Budget Office says that and independent \nanalyses say that. Let's take an important step and do what we all say \nshould be a top priority--actually lowering, in real terms, health care \ncosts.\n  Again, I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to \ncome together in a bipartisan way. I wish more of this debate and this \neffort was designed from the beginning to be truly bipartisan. But this \namendment and this effort is. This amendment and this effort have been \ndiscussed for years. Let's finally get it done with a bipartisan vote \nto pass comprehensive reimportation.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we extend the \nperiod for debate only until 2 p.m., with the time equally divided, \nwith Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, \nwith no amendments in order during that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas and others talked \nabout premiums. I wish to discuss the effect on premiums of health care \nreform.\n  Affordability is at the crux of this debate. In fact, reducing costs \nand making health care premiums more affordable and predictable, while \nimproving quality, is the impetus for this bill. This bill cuts cost \nand improves quality.\n  Two analyses have been released that show Americans will pay less and \nhave more choices under this bill. The first is by the CBO. It found \nthat the legislation will lower premiums for millions of Americans. \nAccording to the CBO--and there are a lot of claims around here to the \ncontrary, but they are just claims, and it is not documented--according \nto the CBO, in the individual market health insurance premiums under \nthe Senate plan would fall by 14 to 20 percent compared with the same \nplan under current law. If you compare apples with apples, premiums \nunder the Senate plan will fall in the individual market by 14 to 20 \npercent. These savings come from lower administrative costs, from \nincreased competition, and better pooling of risk to include healthier \npeople. Again, in the individual market, premiums will fall 14 to 20 \npercent.\n  Let me be clear. CBO does say that those buying health care in the \nindividual market will pay 14 to 20 percent\n\n[[Page S12760]]\n\nless under this bill than they would for the same plan under current \nlaw. If you currently have coverage you like, you can keep it. You will \npay 14 to 20 percent less for that coverage than you would pay under \ncurrent law. If, on the other hand, people in the individual market are \nunhappy with their coverage, what can they do? They can choose to \npurchase the more comprehensive coverage available in the exchange. You \ncan keep what you have, but if you don't like it, you can choose to buy \nsomething else in the exchange.\n  Unlike most of the coverage available in the individual market today, \nthe coverage in the exchange will ensure access to preventive benefits. \nThis is a very important point. Unlike most of the insurance available \ntoday in the individual market, that is, people buying just for \nthemselves, the quality of insurance they will get, because of very \ndramatic insurance market reforms, will be much greater than what they \nhave today. The quality will be much better.\n  What are some of those quality improvements? First of all, the bill \nwill ensure that insurance companies cannot deny coverage based on \npreexisting conditions. Moreover, people will have access to preventive \nbenefits. The plan--the bill we are debating--will guarantee that every \npolicy has an out-of-pocket limit. That is not true today. Most plans \ndon't have limits on that. This legislation says you have a limit on \nout-of-pocket coverage. Insurance companies have to provide the \ninsurance. They cannot provide a policy that says: We can only pay so \nmuch.\n  The legislation will eliminate discrimination by insurance companies \nagainst those who have been sick in the past or have a preexisting \ncondition. They cannot deny coverage based on health status. They \ncannot do that anymore. They do that today.\n  This health legislation will preclude insurance companies from \nrescinding your policy if you get sick.\n  How many times have we heard that happen under current law, insurance \ncompanies rescinding a policy when you get sick because they find a \nlittle something that has nothing to do with your illness that you \nperhaps did not report, a preexisting condition someplace else.\n  For small businesses, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \npremiums in the small group market could be 2 percent lower than under \ncurrent law. For workers in small firms that are eligible for the small \nbusiness tax credits, premiums would be 8 to 11 percent lower than \nunder current law. Those savings alone make this legislation worthwhile \nfor small business.\n  Another enormous benefit for small businesses under this bill is \npredictable premiums. Under current law, if you are a small employer \nand one of your employees gets sick, your premiums could double, triple \nnext year. I have experienced that many times. I am sure most Senators \nhave. They talk to small businessmen at home and a businessman says: My \ngosh, my insurance premiums have doubled, tripled, quadrupled over the \npast year. Why? Because one of my employees has a preexisting \ncondition, and I am placed in this terrible dilemma. This is a key \nemployee. I cannot fire that person to get lower premiums. I cannot pay \nthe increase in premiums. What do I do?\n  There is one contractor at home in Montana I talked to about this. He \nfelt so bad, he could not let somebody go, one of his best employees. \nHe kept that employee. He kept shopping around, shopping around, and \nfound a carrier that did increase his premiums because this employee \nhad a preexisting condition but not as much as his regular carrier. It \nwas a 20-percent increase rather than a 30-percent increase. That \nhappens today, and it is wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.\n  So if you are a small businessperson, under this bill, you are going \nto find your premiums are going to be much more stable, and there is \ngoing to be a greater pool of people so your premiums, the \nCongressional Budget Office said, will be less--not by a lot but a \nlittle less. You don't have to worry about the insurance company coming \nto you next year and saying: We are going to charge you much more.\n  Under this legislation, insurance companies can no longer \ndiscriminate against small employers that have an employee who gets \nsick. I mention all the time I hear from small businesses that say they \nwant to buy health insurance for their employees, but it is too \nexpensive and the cost is too unpredictable. They cannot do it. They \nwant to. They cannot afford it. This legislation helps solve that \nproblem. This bill creates a requirement that allows small businesses \nto provide health coverage to their workers. There is a little \nreduction in premiums, according to CBO, and also much more \npredictability and higher quality of insurance all at the same time.\n  In the large group market--that is companies with more than 50 \nemployees--what does CBO say about their premiums? I have heard all \nthese allegations about people who work for larger companies are going \nto find their premiums will increase. That is the assertion. That is \nflatly not true, at least not true according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that premiums \ncould be up to 3 percent lower than under current law. Again, that is \nnot a big reduction, but it is a reduction, nonetheless. CBO says \nemployees who work for larger companies will find their premiums will \ngo down by a little bit. The assertion is, premiums will go up. CBO \nsays they will go down, to be honest, not by a huge amount but down a \nlittle bit. That is better, lower premiums. That 3 percent could make \nthe difference whether an employer decides to keep employees. A 3-\npercent reduction in premiums will keep that employee, or a bunch of \nemployees, working for him.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, five out of six \nAmericans get their coverage through employers of this size. Five out \nof six Americans work for larger companies. This means 83 percent of \nAmericans will see no change or perhaps a slight decrease in their \npremiums. That is the Congressional Budget Office. That is what they \nsay. It is in black-and-white print. It is right there. The remaining \nindividuals--that is 17 percent--purchase their coverage on their own \nin the individual market.\n  Of those, many will choose to retain the coverage they have and will \nsee a reduction of 14 to 20 percent in their premiums. Those who choose \nto purchase more comprehensive coverage in the individual market, the \nvast majority--nearly 60 percent--will see a reduction in premiums. \nGuess what. That is a big reduction in premiums. They will see a \ndecrease of 56 to 59 percent due to the tax credits provided in this \nbill.\n  Let me restate that point. For the majority of those who choose to \nbuy insurance in the exchange, in the individual market, a majority \nwill see a reduction in premiums, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, a whopping reduction of between 56 and 59 percent due to the \ntax credits provided in this bill. That is pretty important. The \nremaining few individuals may see an increase of up to 13 percent. But \nthose who experience an increase in premiums, let's remember, will do \nso because they have much better insurance. The increased quality of \nthe insurance they are going to get, in my judgment, is going to \noutweigh the increase in premiums they have to pay because they are \ngoing to get a lot more for the buck, a lot better insurance than they \notherwise would get today.\n  If you buy a new car rather than a used car, most people think maybe \nthey will pay more for a new car as opposed to a used car because it is \nnewer and better. That is what is happening today. You might pay more, \nbut you are getting a lot better insurance.\n  The Congressional Budget Office analysis, therefore, is good news for \nhealth care reform. The analysis does not take into account some of the \nSenate bill's other policies, such as a catastrophic option available \nto young adults, otherwise known as ``young invincibles.'' They think: \nI am not going to get sick, so I will get a catastrophic plan and pay \nvery low premiums. That is available in this legislation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office analysis does not incorporate the \npotential effect of the proposal on the level or growth rate of \nspending for health care. In other words, CBO's analysis does not fully \ncapture the effects of the excise tax on high-cost plans, which will \nalso help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have more to say, too much more to ask for an \nadditional minute. I will continue at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Senator Crapo's \nmotion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance in order that \nthis bill does not increase taxes for individuals with incomes of less \nthan $200,000 or families with incomes of less than $250,000.\n\n[[Page S12761]]\n\n  Let's start by looking at three basic promises President Obama \ncampaigned on to get elected--promises that almost no one on the other \nside of the aisle talks about anymore. Here are those promises. These \nare his quotes.\n  He says:\n\n       But let me [be] perfectly clear . . . if your family earns \n     less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes \n     increased a single dime. I repeat: not a single dime.\n\n  Promise No. 2:\n\n       . . . nothing in this plan will require you or your \n     employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. Let \n     me repeat this: nothing in our plan requires you to change \n     what you have.\n\n  His third promise:\n\n       Under the plan, if you like your current health insurance, \n     nothing changes, except your costs will go down by as much as \n     $2,500 per year.\n\n  I think these are three promises that should be the test when we are \njudging this health care bill. I certainly agree with President Obama \non all three of these points. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation has recently confirmed that this bill, in no uncertain terms, \nis a middle-class tax nightmare. Even after you account for taxpayers \nwho receive the tax credit, 24 percent of tax filers--so that is a \nquarter of all tax filers--who make under $200,000 will, on average, \nsee their taxes go up. Only 8 percent of all taxpayers receive the \npremium tax credit, which, by the way, is a new entitlement program, \nnot a tax cut, as Democrats claim.\n  This news should not be a surprise to anyone. We have known for a \nlong time that the largest tax in the bill, the so-called Cadillac \ninsurance plan tax, falls heavily on the middle class. Eighty-four \npercent--let me repeat this--84 percent of the people who pay the tax \nhave incomes of less than $200,000 per year.\n  What is wrong with this bill? This bill contains nine--that is right, \nnine--new taxes that will affect every American. I wish to walk you \nthrough those brandnew taxes.\n  First, we have the 40-percent insurance plan tax. This is the biggest \ntax, and it is designed to make insurance companies and employers drop \ntheir premium insurance plans and leave people to buy cheaper plans. As \na result, this tax violates promise No. 2 and promise No. 3 that the \nPresident made that I showed in my first chart. It also violates the \nfirst promise because 84 percent of the people paying this tax are in \nthe middle class, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation.\n  The insurance tax, tax No. 2, is another tax that will raise the cost \nof everyone's insurance plans. According to the analysis from the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which I will quote, these \ntaxes ``would increase costs for the affected firms, which would be \npassed on to purchasers''--in other words, the employees--``and would \nultimately raise insurance premiums by a corresponding amount.''\n  In addition to violating the first promise not to raise taxes on \nmiddle-class Americans, it also raises insurance premiums and violates \nthe third promise. This is not a good start for the American people.\n  Tax No. 3, the employer tax. For businesses that are struggling to \nstay afloat and to not lay off employees, especially during these tough \neconomic times, this tax will make it much harder and may result in \nfurther layoffs in our weakened economy.\n  I thought our goal was to create jobs and to strengthen our economy.\n  The drug tax--this is tax No. 4. This tax will increase \npharmaceutical prices. In fact, my colleagues should not be surprised \nthat drug companies are already increasing their prices ahead of this \nbill because they know they are going to be taxed.\n  Tax No. 5, the lab tax. If you need clinical laboratory tests, then \nhere is another way the government is going to pick your pocket.\n  Tax No. 6, the medical device tax. If you need surgery, there is a \nnew tax on medical devices, such as pacemakers and other lifesaving \ndevices.\n  Tax No. 7, failure to buy insurance tax. If you do not buy insurance, \nas this bill mandates, then you must pay a penalty tax. Do not be \nfooled by the new bill as it changes the name from ``tax'' to \n``penalty.'' It is still money out of your pocket. By the way, 75 \npercent of that tax is on people who make less than $200,000 a year--\nonce again violating President Obama's first promise.\n  I also wish to note that unlike the protection we included in the \ncommittee's bill to waive interest on criminal and civil penalties on \npeople who do not pay this tax, the current bill on the floor only \nstops criminal penalties and certain enforcement mechanisms. This bill \nstill allows the IRS to go after people who do not buy insurance.\n  What is the maximum penalty allowed? For a civil penalty in this \nbill, $25,000 for not paying this tax. That is what Americans can be \npenalized if they just fundamentally do not agree with this tax. Some \npeople, such as myself, do not believe it is constitutional that the \nFederal Government can require us to buy health insurance. If you \nbelieve strongly in the Constitution and you do not believe this is a \nconstitutional provision, the IRS can come after you and require up to \na $25,000 fine.\n  The next tax to talk about is the cosmetic surgery tax. Ironically, \nDemocrats want to tax the most market-oriented aspect of medicine that \nhas resulted in lower prices, safer procedures, and more consumer \nsatisfaction by taxing cosmetic surgery procedures.\n  Tax No. 9, increased employee Medicare tax. Lastly, for the first \ntime, some Americans will pay higher Medicare taxes and that money will \nfinance an entirely new entitlement program.\n  According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, as I \nmentioned before, 84 percent of the people who pay the so-called \nCadillac insurance plan tax are in the middle class.\n  Let's consider the whole taxpaying population of the United States. \nAccording, once again, to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, \n8 percent of the population, or slightly more than 13 million, will get \nbenefits that the Democrats tout under this bill. That is about 8 \npercent of our population.\n  The other side is wrong to say that this bill delivers a broad tax \ncut to all Americans. It does this for only 8 percent, and only after \nshifting $\\1/2\\ billion worth of new taxes around to the rest of \nAmericans. And what about the rest of Americans? They are either clear \nlosers under this bill or come out roughly even by getting a tax credit \nto balance their tax hike. Even after you account for taxpayers who \nreceive the tax credit, about one-quarter of all tax filers under \n$200,000 will, on average, see their taxes go up, not down.\n  About 157 million Americans who get health insurance from their \nemployers will not be eligible for the tax credit. This does not take \ninto account the higher premiums, medical devices, drugs, lab tests \nthat the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says will be shifted \nto consumers. They did not break those tax impacts down by income \nlevel, so we can't tell you exactly where they fall. But since most \nAmericans make less than $200,000 a year, common sense tells you that \nmost of those taxes will be borne by Americans making under $200,000 a \nyear.\n  Most of the nine brand new taxes in this legislation violate the \nPresident's promise that middle-class families will not have to pay \nmore taxes. The purpose of the Crapo amendment is to inject honesty \ninto the health care debate and to hold Congress to the promises that \nwere made to the American people.\n  Before we vote on this, I want to remind my colleagues of a very \nsimilar vote we had last year. I had an amendment to the Budget Act \nthat was passed 98 to 0 by this body. My amendment last year said: It \nshall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, resolution, \namendment between Houses, motion----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \nbill, resolution, amendment between Houses, motion or conference report \nthat includes a Federal tax increase which would have widespread \napplicability on middle-income taxpayers. That passed 98 to zero. That \nprovision was adopted. Unfortunately, it was stripped later when the \nbudget resolution went to conference.\n\n[[Page S12762]]\n\n  Let me say in conclusion, despite the actions my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle made toward following that policy of not \nraising taxes on middle-income families, we continue to see legislative \nproposals--and the bill before us is exactly one of those legislative \nproposals--that do just that. So I support Senator Crapo's motion to \ncommit this bill in order to remove these onerous tax burdens on the \nAmerican people.\n  My argument is simple: Let's do what we said we would do and protect \nmiddle-income families from these taxes.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise this morning--or this afternoon, I \nguess it is--to speak about health care, but in a very particular \ncontext--an area of our health care debate which we, unfortunately, \nhaven't spent enough time on.\n  The purpose of my remarks today will focus on an amendment that I \nwill be filing today that is entitled ``Support for Pregnant and \nParenting Teens and Women.'' It is a challenge within our health care \nsystem which I think has gone largely unaddressed, or at least for a \nsegment or a category of pregnant women in our society. We know many \nteens and women who face an unplanned pregnancy do so with little or no \nsupport. This amendment--the Pregnant and Parenting Teens and Women \namendment--offers teens and young women the support they need to finish \ntheir education and provide for their children. This is especially \nimportant to those teenagers or women who are victims of domestic \nviolence or other kinds of violence, and also women on college \ncampuses.\n  Just a quick overview of the amendment, and then I will walk through \nsome of the main reasons why I think it is important we make this a \npriority.\n  First of all, the amendment will provide assistance and support for \npregnant and parenting college students. Secondly, the amendment will \nprovide assistance and support for pregnant and parenting teens. Third, \nit will improve services for pregnant women who are, as I mentioned \nbefore, victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, and stalking. \nFourth and finally, it will increase public awareness of the resources \navailable to pregnant and parenting teens and women.\n  I will go through some of the background in the time I have, but the \nway I look at this--and I think the way a lot of families look at this \nchallenge in America--is that often after a woman becomes pregnant, she \nhas a decision to make. Under our law, she can carry the child to term \nor not. We want to make sure if she decides to carry that child to term \nshe has all of the help she needs. And not just a little help--not just \na program or two here and there--but the full range of help that we can \nprovide, in addition to what so many people and so many organizations \ndo so well.\n  There are many individuals and organizations in the nonprofit sector, \nand there are great programs out there right now that help women with \ntheir pregnancies, but I look upon this challenge as one that is faced \nby pregnant women of all incomes, of all backgrounds, and of all \ncircumstances. Even a woman who has the resources and the means often \nfeels that she has to walk that path alone. Sometimes her family \nabandons her or doesn't provide her the help she needs. But it is \nespecially urgent and especially difficult when a woman is both \npregnant and without means or is pregnant and poor, pregnant and \nvulnerable to all of the challenges she will face.\n  If a woman makes the decision to bring a child to term and to raise \nthe child, she often does that all alone. What I believe we have to do \nhere--not just as Democrats and Republicans, because that doesn't \nmatter, candidly, on this--we have to do as Americans, if we mean what \nwe all say, that we want to help people who are vulnerable, and we want \nto help people with their health care, and many of us say that over and \nover--people in both parties say that--then we have to help women \nduring what can be a very difficult time in their lives.\n  I realize for some people this is not an issue. Pregnancy is a time \nof joy and a time when they have no challenges and they bring a child \ninto the world with a lot of support and all the help they need. But \nthere are plenty of women out there who have to walk this road all \nalone--all alone. And so if we mean what we say about helping, as \nAmericans--forget parties here--we should do everything possible to \nwalk that road with her, if she wants the help and if she can benefit \nfrom the services we are talking about.\n  Why should a woman on a college campus who makes a decision to have a \nbaby be left alone? Why shouldn't we be giving her help? We don't do it \nnow. I know some do it, and I will hear from others that this group \ndoes this and this group does that, but unfortunately it is not nearly \nenough, especially for someone who happens to be a teenager, a woman \nwho is pregnant, or a young woman who is pregnant as a teenager or \nbefore the age of 18. Are we doing enough to help that woman who \nhappens to be pregnant get through the challenge of a pregnancy?\n  Finally, and most horrifically, if a woman is both pregnant and the \nvictim of domestic violence, sexual violence, or stalking, what are we \ndoing to help her? Unfortunately, the answer to that is very little--\nvery little. I think this is a criticism I am making of both political \nparties. We could have a debate about who is doing more, and that might \nbe instructive, but neither party is doing enough for at least those \nthree categories of pregnant women--teens, women on college campuses, \nand women who are victims of violence.\n  I believe we are going to have an awful lot of support for this \namendment. I think it is an essential part of this health care debate, \nand I believe it is an opportunity to bring people together to agree on \nsomething around here when we have a lot of disagreement. But also I \nthink it is vitally important to our society in general. It is not just \na good thing to do, it is not just the right thing to do or the \ncompassionate thing to do, it is, I believe, a very important part of \nhow we deliver health care and how we help people through what is often \na crisis.\n  Think of the kind of life that mother will have during her pregnancy \nand after her pregnancy. Think of the life that child will have, while \nthe child is in the womb and then after the child is born. If the \npregnancy goes well, the child will learn more. If the pregnancy goes \nwell, the child will grow and develop appropriately so that he or she \ncan be healthy. If a pregnancy goes well, the child will contribute a \nlot more to society. The real challenge, the urgent question for us is: \nWhat are we doing to help pregnant women, especially in these \nparticular categories?\n  I have been so fortunate, and I am grateful to have worked with \nSenator Klobuchar on this amendment. We will be talking about it more, \nbut I wanted to provide a summary of it now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, over the weeks and months we have been \nhere, we have talked a lot about the economy and the challenges we face \nin the economy. We have spent time trying to figure out the best \napproach when it comes to job creation. We went through a debate \nearlier this year regarding a stimulus package that, when you add on \ninterest, was eye popping--$1 trillion. We were promised by the \nPresident that if you pass this gargantuan stimulus package, the \nunemployment rate won't go over 8 percent. Well, we stand here today \nwith unemployment at 10 percent.\n  We look at that and we recognize that the 10-percent number doesn't \ntell the true story of the suffering that is going on out there. When \nyou read much farther in the analysis, you begin to realize it is not \n10 percent. When you add in those who have flat given up, those who are \nunderemployed, and those who may be piecing one or two or three jobs \ntogether to try to pay the bills, we are closer to the 17.5 percent \nrange. And in spite of that, over the last days, we have been talking \nabout a piece of legislation that, because of mandates and tax \nincreases and burdens placed upon the middle class and our job \ncreators--our small businesses--we can see very clearly we are going to \nend up with adding to the misery of the American people.\n  Let me, if I might, start out by focusing on a specific piece of this \nto get started; that is, the employer mandate.\n\n[[Page S12763]]\n\n  The bill here and the bill in the House have a common element--\ncertainly different mandates, certainly different amounts of the \nmandate, but the common element is that under both pieces of \nlegislation there is a ``Washington way or the highway'' sort of \napproach. It basically says to employers: Thou shalt do it our way or \nthere is the highway. It basically says to our job creators out there \nthat our medium-size, even some of our small job creators are going to \nbe pulled into this. It says: Look, you either do it the Washington way \nor we are going to penalize you. We are going to use the Internal \nRevenue Code, the full force and effect of this mammoth government \nbureaucracy called the Internal Revenue Service, to get you, to get \nthat money out of your business because you have not complied with the \nWashington way of this legislation. We are going to put a tax on job \ncreators, a penalty on job creators who are already facing the dilemma \nof how do they keep their employment steady at a time when unemployment \nis 10 percent and real unemployment is actually in the vicinity of 17.5 \npercent. The result is obvious. You don't have to study this very long \nto figure out that if this bill is passed, you are hammering the very \npeople who are supposed to be creating the jobs.\n  According to our Congressional Research Service:\n\n       Economic theory suggests the penalty [and by that they mean \n     the employer mandate] should ultimately be passed through to \n     lower wages . . . if firms cannot pass on the costs in lower \n     wages, the higher cost of workers may lead firms to reduce \n     output and the number of workers.\n\n  Let me kind of pierce through that fancy language, if I might. It \nkind of sounds like Washington-speak to me. What the Congressional \nResearch Service is saying is this: If you are a worker out there in \nthe United States, you are literally going to be faced with lower \nwages. If that doesn't work, then it may be your job that is at stake.\n  Like every Senator in this body, I get across my State. I try to \nlisten to people. I have townhall meetings. We try to keep an open-door \npolicy so if somebody wants to talk to me, they can. The human misery \nof losing a job is just unbelievable. It does something to a person. It \nmakes them look at themselves very differently. It makes them wonder, \nis there hope out there?\n  This administration ran on this notion of hope and promise. According \nto our Congressional Research Service, when you pierce through that \nWashington-speak language, what it really says is that this bill by \nthis administration is going to create more human misery because it \nwill impact jobs. Nonpartisan analysis says employer mandates will \neither decrease wages or lead to layoffs.\n  This is my first year in the Senate. What a legacy for your first \nyear, that you get to go home at some point and you say: You know, I \nvoted for a bill that, according to the Congressional Research Service, \nwill either cause more layoffs in my State or reduce wages.\n  Employers will look at their balance sheet--they have to. They don't \nhave the ridiculous opportunity we have here of just spending crazily \nand running up the Federal deficit. They have to make it work or they \ngo out of business. For them, it has to be a cost-benefit analysis. How \nmany have looked at this bill and said: I think I have figured \nsomething out here. I don't like the mandate, they tell me. But then \nthey say: But we have studied this, and if there has to be that result, \nit is cheaper for us to try to figure out a way to drop our health \ncoverage and pay the penalty. The average employer that provides a \nhealth care plan pays about $4,000 per employee for health coverage. If \nthe mandate were something like $750--do the math--a cost-benefit \nanalysis is going to lead to one conclusion: Drop the health plan. We \nknow employers are already considering it. My office recently met with \na human resources manager from one of Nebraska's largest cities. She \nnoted how much cheaper it would be if they could just do that. Many \nemployees will lose their coverage. If that happens, then all of a \nsudden the doctor-patient relationship is impacted.\n  Remember all those promises: Your taxes are not going to go up; you \nget to keep the doctor you like; if you like your plan, you are not \ngoing to lose it. We have ripped those promises up with this \nlegislation. You would think at some point somebody in the \nadministration would stand up and say: Hold everything here, we are \nmaking shambles out of what we thought we could do.\n  True health care reform should lower costs for businesses so they \nhave more capital to work with, so they can hire workers, not dismiss \nthem. I suggest this bill just completely misses the mark.\n  I also suggest that this is a step in the wrong direction in terms of \nhealth care. Making matters worse, the people this bill supposedly \nhelps will be disproportionately impacted. A professor studying \nemployer mandates recently said this:\n\n       Workers who would lose their jobs are disproportionately \n     likely to be high school dropouts, minorities and females. \n     Among the uninsured, those with the least education face the \n     highest risk of losing their jobs under employer mandates.\n\n  Is it a surprise that business groups are opposing this legislation? \nThe U.S. Chamber, Wholesale Distributors, General Contractors, \nIndependent Electrical Contractors--all sent a letter recently, and \nthey said this:\n\n       Perhaps no sector has been more passionate, more active \n     than the small business community in working to advance \n     reforms that lower health coverage costs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. May I have an additional minute, by unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. The Senate health care bill `` . . . will lead to higher \ncosts and increased burdens on small businesses. The bill will cause \ngreater damage to our economy and health care system.''\n  We all agree on some basic premises. One is that about 60 to 70 \npercent of our jobs in this country are dependent upon small \nbusinesses. Isn't this a time for us to take a step back and ask what \nare we doing to our economy here, what are we doing to these job \ncreators, and work together to get a truly bipartisan bill that builds \nour economy and protects our jobs?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is alleged here on the floor that the underlying bill \nraises taxes. The legislation does not increase taxes--essentially. \nThere was a slight modification to that, but I will explain that later. \nIn fact, the bill represents a tax cut. The bill does two things: It \nprovides tax credits to low- and middle-income individuals and families \nto help purchase health insurance and it results in increased wages for \nthose receiving employer-sponsored insurance.\n  Let me first speak about how the bill provides a tax cut. The chart \nbehind me basically shows that for a family of four with an income of \n$66,000, the light blue indicates that the cost of that health \ninsurance is going to be about $14,100. That is basically what health \ninsurance costs today for a family of four. That is what people pay \ntoday. After this legislation, look at the bar there on the right. \nAgain, a family of four, income $66,000. Those persons will receive an \n$8,000 tax cut, in terms of credits that family will get, with a net \nresult of a health insurance policy that costs $6,100. Health insurance \nis going to cost less for a family of four with an income of $66,000. \nThat is fairly representative, a family of four with $66,000.\n  Just to repeat, on the left, the health insurance policy for a family \nof four with that income level is about $14,000. After the tax credit \nkicks in, once this legislation kicks in, the same family, same four \npeople, will find they are paying only $6,100 net for their health \ninsurance. Why? Because they get a tax cut of $8,000.\n  I might add--look at the next chart, ``Who Gets A Tax Cut? An \nindividual with an income of $32,000.'' Earlier, it was a family of \nfour with $66,000. This is an individual with an income of $32,400. \nCurrently, today, before health care reform is passed, that individual \nwill pay roughly $5,000 in health insurance. But after this bill is \npassed, that same individual with an income of $32,400 will find that \nhealth insurance will not cost $5,000 but much less--$3,000. Why? \nBecause that person gets a tax cut in terms of a credit of $2,200. I \nthink that is a very important point to make.\n\n[[Page S12764]]\n\n  While we are at it, we might as well get the next chart.\n  There are some who are saying this legislation will result in \nincreased taxes for higher income people; that is, people whose income \nis, say, around $200,000. There is something to that argument, but that \nis not the whole story. Let's look at the whole story.\n  This legislation as portrayed by this chart shows:\n\n       High-cost insurance excise tax leads to increased wages.\n\n  Why increased wages? Because the Congressional Budget Office or maybe \nit is the Joint Committee on Taxation--the Joint Committee on Taxation \nconcludes that because of that provision of the bill; that is, the \nexcise tax on companies that provide more expensive policies, in effect \nthose policies will be modified or changed, and in effect the premiums \nfor those policies, the so-called Cadillac plans, will actually go \ndown, according to the Congressional Budget Office, between 7 and 12 \npercent. But that is premiums. The discussion right now is on taxes. \nThose folks will be paying a little more taxes. That is true under this \nlegislation. But, again, what is the whole story? Why are they going to \nbe paying more taxes? They are going to be paying more taxes because \nthey will get more income. Their wages and salaries will increase \ntremendously.\n  Look at the bar on the left. In the year 2013, the percent of the \ntotal tax revenue due to increased wages will be about 90 percent, but \nthat person will also pay a 10-percent increase in taxes. The wage \nincrease, salary increase is far greater than the tax increase. That is \ntrue for every year--2013, 2014, 2015, all the way up to 2019. It is \nproportionately basically the same--roughly around an 80-percent \nincrease in wages and roughly maybe about less than a 20-percent \nincrease in taxes. So on a net basis, those persons are going to be \ndoing pretty well.\n  Consider the example of Joe who works for ACME Company. He is married \nand has two children. Together, he and his spouse earn $100,000 a year \nin taxable wages.\n  In 2012, ACME Company provides family health coverage to Joe at a \ncost of $25,000. Because of the high cost insurance excise tax, ACME \nCompany finds different coverage that costs only $21,000 in 2013. Thus, \nACME Company can afford to pay Joe an extra $4,000 each year.\n  Now, even though Joe has to pay income and payroll taxes, he will \nstill have an extra $2,076 in his pocket. That is $4,000 -$1,000 in \nFederal tax -$612 FICA tax -$312 in State tax.\n  I don't believe Joe would refuse a pay increase just because he has \nto pay taxes on that raise.\n  Or consider Sally, a single mother of two working for XYZ Company. \nShe makes $50,000 in 2013 and receives family health insurance coverage \ncosting $27,000.\n  When XYZ Company restructures their plan to $22,000 as a result of \nthe high-cost insurance tax, Sally will get an extra $5,000 in wages. \nThat is $3,095 in take-home pay after taxes. That is $5,000 -$750 in \nFederal income tax -$765 FICA tax -$390 State tax.\n  I have no doubt that Sally will be able to put that extra money to \ngood use.\n  Also, I would like to remind everyone about this legislation on \npremiums. Earlier, I discussed what the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid about premiums under our bill. Let me repeat, this is what the \nCongressional Budget Office says: In summary, the Congressional Budget \nOffice concludes that 93 percent of Americans receive decreases in \npremiums. About 93 percent of Americans net will see a decrease in \npremiums.\n  That is not from these charts; that is from the CBO letter. Of that \n93 percent, 10 percent will see decreases of 56 percent to 59 percent \nbecause of new tax credits. We are talking about on the individual \nmarket. About 60 percent of those who are getting insurance in the \nindividual market on the exchange will get tax credits which will \nresult in roughly a 60-percent reduction in premiums. It is between 56 \nand 59, which is pretty close to 60 percent. The remaining 7 percent \nwill pay slightly higher--100 less 93. Seven percent will pay slightly \nhigher, but they also get much better insurance for that same dollar. \nWhen you have a choice between buying a used car or a new car, you \nprobably expect to pay a little bit more when you buy the new car. \nHopefully, it is a little better, higher quality, drives faster, safer, \nall those things. You expect to pay a little more for a new car, but \nyou get more. The same thing here. You are going to pay a little more. \nBut only 7 percent will see their premiums go up according to the CBO. \nThose 7 percent are people who do not get tax credits because their \nincomes are a little higher, but they will get much better insurance, \nhigher quality insurance. CBO says that, much higher quality insurance.\n  So, in effect, they will probably get at least the same, maybe no \nincrease at all, maybe a reduction in premium, if we calculate in the \nhigher quality insurance they will have.\n  In addition to CBO, MIT's Jon Gruber has also done a study on \npremiums. And what does he conclude? He concludes, using Congressional \nBudget Office data, the Senate bill could mean people purchasing \nindividual insurance would save every year $200 for single coverage and \n$500 for family coverage in 2009 dollars. Most people think he is one \nof the best outside experts. He has big computer models. He takes the \nCBO data and, in some respects, he has helped CBO by giving some \ninformation to CBO that it otherwise does not have.\n  Mr. Gruber also points out that people with low incomes would receive \npremium tax credits that will reduce the price they pay for health \ninsurance by as much as $2,500 to $7,500.\n  We have also seen several studies funded by the insurance industry. I \ndon't want to be disparaging but to some degree you have to consider \nthe source. I have been citing CBO. I think most people think they are \na highly professional outfit, no axe to grind. Sometimes they upset \nthose against health insurance reform. Sometimes they upset those for \nhealth insurance reform. They are a very professional group of people. \nBut I have also seen studies paid for by the private sector, by the \ninsurance industry. Those studies find that premiums will increase \nunder the bill before us for all Americans. These studies are flawed \nand, frankly, some of them, the authors of these studies admitted they \nare flawed. They were just looking at selective parts of the \nlegislation, not all parts, and they were pushed by the industry to \nissue a report quickly. They have admitted that. Each of them failed to \ntake into account all aspects of the proposal. They selectively chose \nthe provisions that will increase premiums, and they ignored those \nprovisions that will lower premiums.\n  Why do they do that? Basically, the insurance industry wants to kill \nthis bill. I can understand it. If I were the insurance industry, I \nwouldn't want my apple cart upset either. They do just fine under the \nstatus quo, thank you very much. They don't want to see any changes. \nSome insurance companies want to continue their current practices of \ndenying coverage if you have a preexisting condition. That is how they \nmade their money in the past. They made most of their money by denying \ncoverage, by underwriting insurance rather than making money on \nconventional insurance. Anyway these companies want to continue their \ncurrent practice of denying you coverage if you have a preexisting \ncondition. Some want to continue charging unaffordable premiums if you \nhave been sick in the past, and some want to be able to rescind your \ncoverage once you get sick. That is their MO, and they have done pretty \nwell under the status quo.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and Professor Gruber are both \ncredible and unbiased sources that are not bought and sold by the \ninsurance industry. The Congressional Budget Office and MIT's Gruber \nhave confirmed what many of us have known: that the bill before us will \nlower premiums and provide a great many options for more comprehensive \ncoverage. That is very important. With the exchange set up and with \nother provisions that will be in this bill, there are many more options \nfor individuals to buy insurance with. It creates a lot of competition. \nWith health insurance market reform, insurance companies will be \ncompeting more on price than they are on quality of coverage.\n  This legislation provides much needed assistance as well to lower \nmiddle-income Americans struggling to pay their health insurance \npremiums.\n  The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, a few moments ago said people\n\n[[Page S12765]]\n\nwould pay more because of industry fees in this bill. Let's address \nthat point. The reductions in premiums determined by the CBO that I \ndescribed earlier took into account any impact of the industry fees. \nThe Congressional Budget Office took that into account. I note for the \nrecord, there is no lab fee. I know that was an honest mistake on his \npart, but I want to indicate there is no lab fees in this bill. He was \ntalking about lab fees.\n  The bottom line is that for the overwhelming majority of Americans, \nthis bill means lower premiums. I don't have it with me, but also a \nsection in one of the CBO letters basically says these fees will have a \nvery negligible impact on consumers. Frankly, I was a bit surprised. I \nwas concerned that some of these studies might, as determined by the \nCBO or other outside analysts, conclude that there would be a \nsignificant impact on consumers and on premiums, basically, what these \ncompanies would otherwise charge. But the CBO says no; the fees on \nhospitals, the pharmaceutical industry, even the insurance industry \nwill have a very negligible effect on increased costs for consumers. It \nis negligible according to the CBO. I thought, frankly, that would not \nbe the case.\n  Here is the letter. It is on page 15. I don't have the date of this \nletter, but it is from the Congressional Budget Office. It is under the \nsection ``New Fees Would Increase Premiums Slightly.'' The operable \nsentence is:\n\n       Because that fee would not impose an additional cost for \n     drugs sold on the private market, CBO and [Joint Tax] \n     estimate that it would not result in measurably higher \n     premiums for private coverage.\n\n  To be fair, I don't know if they also address the effect of hospital \nfees or other provider fees. But I think it is noteworthy in that \ncontext for us to remember, it wasn't too long ago when the health \ninsurance industry got together at the White House with the President \nand promised the President they could reduce their costs by $2 trillion \nover 10 years. If they believed they could reduce their reimbursement \nby $2 trillion over 10 years, you would think they would kind of know \nwhat they are talking about. After all, they have to report to \nstockholders. They have certain obligations.\n  They said they could reduce their reimbursement by $2 trillion. This \nbill cuts down their reimbursement increases not by $2 trillion but by \none-quarter of that. That is roughly 4,500 billion over that same 10-\nyear period. They have agreed to that. I can understand why they would \nagree to that because that is about one-quarter of what they promised \nearlier.\n  If they have agreed to it, they are probably going to do OK under \nthis legislation. It is not going to result in reduced quality of care \nto people because they have agreed to it essentially. As I pointed out, \nCBO says, at least with respect to the pharmaceutical industry, very \nlittle of that will be passed on to consumers. Why is that? The basic \nreason is, there is waste in our current health care system. These \ncompanies know where the waste is. They can find it. They know it is \nout there.\n  But, second, with increased coverage, many more Americans will have \nhealth insurance. Currently, 84 percent have health insurance. Under \nthis legislation, 94, 95 percent of Americans will have health \ninsurance. If many more Americans have health insurance, there are more \npatients for the hospitals, more patients for home health care, more \nmedical equipment sold, more drugs provided by the pharmaceutical \nindustry. That is the second main reason they know that with provisions \nin this bill, the reduction in reimbursement to them is numbers they \ncan live with.\n  I know the next two speakers, Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan, \nboth intend to speak for more than 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nthey be allowed to speak longer under the time under the control of the \nrespective sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \narranging that for me. I hope this afternoon to speak on the issue of \nimportation of drugs because I support the Dorgan amendment. Right now \nI wish to address the issue of the Crapo motion to commit.\n  This generally deals with all of the tax provisions in this 2,074-\npage bill. If Senator Crapo prevails--and he should--the unrelated \nHouse bill, along with the Reid amendment, would be sent to the Senate \nFinance Committee. The Finance Committee, under the motion, would be \nempowered to return the bill to the full Senate with an amendment that \neliminates the heavy taxes that are in this bill. Senator Crapo has \ndiscussed the impact of the Reid amendment on middle-class families. I \nwill lay out all the taxes that are in this bill.\n  In farm country, many of us who work the land often observe big \nfreight trains rumbling across the terrain. Sometimes they scare \ncattle, hogs, and other animals. Those freight trains are impressive in \ntheir power, in their speed, and now the length of the trains. It is \nvery common to see a 100-car train, 150-car trains. The partisan force \nwith which the majority is powering this bill through the Congress is \nequally as impressive as that of a freight train. The speed that is \nbeing displayed for such complex legislation is something to behold. \nMost importantly, the sheer number and breadth of the new taxes in this \nbill reminds me of a very long train.\n  Almost $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes, fees, and penalties, and I think \nthey all have the same economic impact, whether it is a tax, a fee, or \na penalty--a negative impact on the economy. These taxes, fees, and \npenalties are so imposing, I am calling this 2,074-page bill the tax \nincrease express.\n  The locomotive driving this train is health care reform, driven by \nthe Democratic leadership. So we have the locomotive that drives this \ntax increase. I don't think the American public knows the bill would \nimpose that much, $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of new taxes, new fees, and new \npenalties on the American people.\n  The American public, who supported President Obama with a majority of \nvotes 13 months ago, heard the President loudly and clearly, and that \nis why they gave him such an overwhelming majority.\n  They understood our President pledged he would not raise taxes on \npeople making less than $250,000 a year. Unfortunately, the Democrats' \nleadership bill would violate that clear pledge.\n  What are the tax increases and the fees and penalties in Senator \nReid's amendment? Let me take a moment to highlight them because every \nlocomotive needs power to run. The first power source, the first car of \nthe tax increase express, is the so-called fees on health insurance \ncompanies, medical device manufacturers, and drug manufacturers.\n  That might not sound like something the grassroots of America would \nworry about--taxes on insurance companies, medical device \nmanufacturers, drug manufacturers--because maybe they think businesses \npay taxes. But businesses and corporations do not pay taxes, only \npeople pay taxes. So when people find out they are going to be paying \nthese, it puts a whole new light on what is a fee and what is a tax.\n  There have been numerous studies that have shown that these fees on, \nfor example, health insurers will increase health insurance premiums. \nSome say premiums would increase by $488 for a family, other studies \nsay $500. Most Members on the other side of the aisle take issue with \nthese studies. They argue these studies were performed at the request \nof insurance companies or conducted by independent experts with ties to \nthat same industry.\n  Let me ask my Democratic friends this: Do you question the work of \nthe Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation? \nWell, you should not because they are like a god around here. When the \nCBO says something is going to cost something, that stands, unless \nthere are 60 votes to override it in the Senate. So most everything the \nCBO says stands. They have respect because of the intellectual honesty \nof their research and the nonpartisanship they have. So these \nagencies--the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation--have testified that these fees will actually be passed on to \nhealth care consumers. Check the record. No one can dispute it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation \nhave also testified that the fees will increase\n\n[[Page S12766]]\n\nhealth insurance premiums. Check the record. No one can dispute it.\n  My friends in the Democratic leadership may say, once their health \nreforms are in place, premiums will go down, net of the fees. They will \nhail a recent CBO report highlighting the winners but somehow ignoring \nthe losers. They will say these fees will not affect premiums for the \nvast majority of Americans. But here is the flaw in that assertion. The \nCongressional Budget Office analyzed premium costs, what they are \nprojected to be in 2016 under this legislation.\n  What about premium costs right now in the years before these programs \ntake effect--2010 and 2013? Why is this question important? The answer \nis, these fees go into effect in the year 2010, not when most of the \nexpenditures go into effect in 2014.\n  The majority of the Democratic reforms which are intended to lower \ncosts do not go into effect until 2014--4 years from now. I ought to \nsay that 10 times because that is very important to how this bill came \nout to be revenue neutral.\n  So we ought to look at what happens in the years 2010, 2011, 2012, \nand 2013. Premiums will go up. Why? Because, for one, the Democrats are \nadding costs to the health insurance you buy by imposing these fees on \nhealth insurers, and they are giving you no government assistance to \nhelp with these added costs.\n  I would ask my friends in the media, dig a little bit deeper on this \npoint, and you ought to be reporting on it. Why? Because the American \npublic does not understand that in the short term premiums will go up. \nInstead, the public is simply hearing some media reports on a portion \nof the premiums, in 2016 and beyond. Of course, that is a very long \ntime from now. The American public does not want to wait for their \npremiums to go down, if they go down at all. It appears my friends in \nthe Democratic leadership want the tax increase express to barrel \nthrough Congress before the public realizes what health care reform \nactually means; that is, higher premiums as early as 2010.\n  Let me turn to the second car of the tax increase express. This car \nis the proposal to restrict the eligibility criteria for claiming the \nitemized deductions for medical expenses. This proposal says you can no \nlonger deduct expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross \nincome. Instead, you can only deduct expenses that exceed 10 percent of \nyour adjusted gross income.\n  In plain English, this proposal limits tax deductions you can take \nfor medical expenses. In other words, you will lose a portion of your \ntax deductions. Even the New York Times calls proposals that would take \naway a portion of your tax deduction a tax increase.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article from the New York \nTimes, dated February 26, 2009, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 2009]\n\n        To Pay for Health Care, Obama Looks to Taxes on Affluent\n\n                   (By Jackie Calmes and Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington.--President Obama will propose further tax \n     increases on the affluent to help pay for his promise to make \n     health care more accessible and affordable, calling for \n     stricter limits on the benefits of itemized deductions taken \n     by the wealthiest households, administration officials said \n     Wednesday.\n       The tax proposal, coming after recent years in which wealth \n     has become more concentrated at the top of the income scale, \n     introduces a politically volatile edge to the Congressional \n     debate over Mr. Obama's domestic priorities.\n       The president will also propose, in the 10-year budget he \n     is to release Thursday, to use revenues from the centerpiece \n     of his environmental policy--a plan under which companies \n     must buy permits to exceed pollution emission caps--to pay \n     for an extension of a two-year tax credit that benefits low-\n     wage and middle-income people.\n       The combined effect of the two revenue-raising proposals, \n     on top of Mr. Obama's existing plan to roll back the Bush-era \n     income tax reductions on households with income exceeding \n     $250,000 a year, would be a pronounced move to redistribute \n     wealth by reimposing a larger share of the tax burden on \n     corporations and the most affluent taxpayers.\n       Administration officials said Mr. Obama would propose to \n     reduce the value of itemized tax deductions for everyone in \n     the top income tax bracket, 35 percent, and many of those in \n     the 33 percent bracket--roughly speaking, starting at \n     $250,000 in annual income for a married couple.\n       Under existing law, the tax benefit of itemizing deductions \n     rises with a taxpayer's marginal tax bracket (the bracket \n     that applies to the last dollar of income). For example, \n     $10,000 in itemized deductions reduces tax liability by \n     $3,500 for someone in the 35 percent bracket.\n       Mr. Obama would allow a saving of only $2,800--as if the \n     person were in the 28 percent bracket.\n       The White House says it is unfair for high-income people to \n     get a bigger tax break than middle-income people for claiming \n     the same deductions or making the same charitable \n     contributions.\n       The officials said the resulting increase in revenues, \n     estimated at $318 billion over 10 years, would account for \n     about half of a $634 billion ``reserve fund'' that Mr. Obama \n     will set aside in his budget to address changes in the health \n     care system. The other half would come from proposed cost \n     savings in Medicare, Medicaid and other health programs.\n       In a document summarizing its proposals, the White House \n     said it would finance coverage for the uninsured in part by \n     ``rebalancing the tax code so that the wealthiest pay more.''\n       Mr. Obama's blueprint, which will project spending and \n     revenues for the next decade, will flesh out the president's \n     thinking on his energy plans both to cap the emissions of \n     gases, particularly carbon dioxide, that are blamed for \n     climate change and to spur development of nonpolluting energy \n     alternatives.\n       The budget will show the government beginning by 2012 to \n     collect billions of dollars in revenues from selling permits \n     to businesses that emit the polluting gases, assuming the \n     president's energy initiative becomes law as soon as this \n     year, officials said.\n       Because utilities and other businesses would presumably \n     pass on their costs to customers, Mr. Obama will propose to \n     use most of the government's revenues from the permits to \n     finance an extension of the new ``Making Work Pay'' tax \n     credit beyond the two years covered in the $787 billion \n     economic recovery plan that was just enacted.\n       That tax relief, the administration will argue, will offset \n     households' higher costs for utilities and other products and \n     services from businesses' passing on their permit expenses.\n       That tax credit annually will provide $400 to low-wage and \n     middle-income workers or $800 to couples; Mr. Obama would \n     like to increase those figures to $500 and $1,000. The credit \n     phases out for those with incomes above $75,000 a year and \n     for couples with incomes of more than $150,000; no benefit \n     would go to individuals with more than $100,000 income and \n     couples with $200,000.\n       The tax credit will begin showing up in the form of lower \n     withholding for eligible workers beginning April 1.\n       The remainder of the projected revenues from the permits \n     will finance Mr. Obama's campaign promise for $15 billion a \n     year over 10 years to subsidize research and development of \n     alternative energy sources, officials said. The stimulus \n     package included a multibillion-dollar down payment to \n     develop a national electricity grid to harness and distribute \n     energy from such sources, including wind farms.\n       Behind the numbers in Mr. Obama's first budget is one of \n     the most far-reaching domestic agendas in years, and at a \n     time when the president and Congress are already grappling \n     with an economic crisis worse than any in decades. The \n     environmental permits would not take effect until 2012, at \n     which point the administration expects the economy to have \n     recovered. Similarly, some of the tax increases would not \n     take effect until 2011.\n       Democratic Congressional leaders promised to push the \n     agenda, which parallels their own. ``By the end of this year, \n     I want to do something significant dealing with health \n     care,'' the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, \n     told reporters.\n       The tax proposals, however, could galvanize Republican \n     opposition and give conservatives a concrete target for \n     taking on Mr. Obama, who despite his political strength could \n     find some members of his own party reluctant to embrace tax \n     increases.\n       Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the \n     Senate Finance Committee, who has been drafting a health \n     plan, predicted in an interview that the Senate could pass \n     legislation by its August recess.\n       Mr. Baucus acknowledged that ``there has to be revenue'' to \n     offset the costs of expanded coverage initially, but he did \n     not endorse the proposal for limiting wealthy taxpayers' \n     deductions.\n       ``There will be lots of options to pay it, not necessarily \n     that one,'' Mr. Baucus said.\n       He would not say what revenue options he would support. But \n     he said tax increases of some kind would not prevent some \n     Senate Republicans from aligning with Democrats to pass a \n     health plan.\n       In the House, the Republican leader, Representative John A. \n     Boehner of Ohio, telegraphed his side's opposition to any tax \n     increases.\n       ``Everyone agrees that all Americans deserve access to \n     affordable health care,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement, \n     ``but is increasing taxes during an economic recession, \n     especially on small businesses, the right way to accomplish \n     that goal?''\n       Mr. Boehner likewise criticized Mr. Obama's cap-and-trade \n     emissions permits proposal, saying, ``Cap-and-trade is code \n     for increasing taxes and killing American jobs,\n\n[[Page S12767]]\n\n     and that's the last thing we need to do during these troubled \n     economic times.''\n       To finance health care reform, administration officials \n     suggested to senior aides in Congress on Wednesday that \n     revenues could be raised by ending the policy of excluding \n     the value of employer-provided health insurance from income \n     taxes.\n       But the officials emphasized that the administration was \n     not advocating that option, which not only is anathema to \n     some in organized labor and business but also conflicts with \n     Mr. Obama's position in last fall's presidential campaign.\n       The administration is proposing a number of other \n     politically contentious ways of offsetting the costs of the \n     health care initiative. Mr. Obama wants to require drug \n     companies to give bigger discounts, or rebates, to Medicaid, \n     the health program for low-income people.\n       Drug makers now must provide Medicaid with a discount equal \n     to at least 15.1 percent of the average manufacturer price \n     for a brand-name product. Mr. Obama wants to require \n     discounts of at least 22.1 percent. Pharmaceutical companies \n     have strenuously resisted such proposals in recent years.\n       Mr. Obama will also propose cutting Medicare payments to \n     health insurance companies that provide comprehensive care to \n     more than 10 million of the 44 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries. He says he can save $175 billion over 10 years \n     with a new competitive bidding system, under which payments \n     to private Medicare Advantage plans would be based on an \n     average of the bids they submit to Medicare.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In the top line, the article says: ``President Obama \nwill propose further tax increases on the affluent to help pay for . . \n. health care reform.''\n  I am highlighting this article because the President is also \nproposing to take away a portion of a person's tax deduction. The \nPresident wants to limit the itemized deductions people making more \nthan $250,000 a year can take. The only difference between the two \nproposals is the medical expense deduction limitation affects people \nwho make less than $250,000 a year--the same class of people the \nPresident promised in the election he was not going to increase taxes \non.\n  So, again, do not take my word for it. Data from the Joint Committee \non Taxation tells us that in the year 2013, the largest concentration \nof taxpayers claiming the medical expense deduction will earn between \n$50,000 and $75,000--people who never thought they were going to have \ntheir taxes increased based upon what the President said during the \ncampaign.\n  The analysis shows, a good number of taxpayers earning between \n$75,000 and $200,000 also claim the medical expense deduction.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle will argue that their \ngovernment-subsidized tax credit for health insurance will wipe clean \nany new taxes for those people below 400 percent of poverty. They will \nalso argue that people purchasing insurance through the new exchange \nwill be protected from catastrophic expenses as a result of annual out-\nof-pocket limits. For this reason, my friends on the other side argue \nthose middle-class taxpayers will not need to rely on medical expense \ndeductions.\n  I hate to break it to my colleagues, but the Congressional Budget \nOffice--again, that god of Capitol Hill--estimates that in 2014 only 4 \npercent of Americans will be purchasing exchange insurance and only 3 \npercent of Americans will be receiving a tax credit. By 2019, when the \nReid bill is in full effect, only 7 percent of Americans with exchange \ninsurance will be receiving the tax credit. That leaves a heck of a lot \nof people below 400 percent of poverty with higher taxes.\n  What about those individuals and families above 400 percent of \npoverty? These people earn income below the President's magic $250,000 \nlevel, and somehow they do not qualify for this tax credit. What they \ndo qualify for, though, is a tax increase. After all, there is reason \nwhy this proposal raises $15 billion over 10 years, and that is a heck \nof a lot of money.\n  Let me now turn to the third car of the tax increase express. This \ncar is the high-cost plan tax. The Congressional Budget Office has \nconsistently cited the two most powerful ways to bend the cost curve \ndownward, meaning the cost curve of health care inflation: No. 1 is to \ncap the tax preference for employer-provided health coverage or the so-\ncalled exclusion; and, secondly, Medicare delivery system reforms.\n  A recent letter sent to the White House by respected economists also \ncontends that placing a limit on high-cost employer plans would slow \nhealth care spending and reduce costs.\n  Well, some of my colleagues have come out squarely in support of a \ncap on the exclusion. That was an intellectually honest position. My \nfriends, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, took the intellectually honest position. The \nDemocratic leadership, however, has squarely opposed a cap on the \nexclusion. They argue that a cap on the exclusion would hurt middle-\nclass workers.\n  But in a sleight of hand, this bill--this 2,074-page bill--and its \nauthors, the Democratic leadership, came up with a proposal that would \ntax insurance companies for offering high-cost plans. It is a more \ncomplicated way of taxing the same workers. It is a sleight of hand \nbecause the Democratic leadership knows the tax will be passed through \nto the worker.\n  My friends simply did not want to say they were taxing the workers \ndirectly. So they have decided to tax those same workers very \nindirectly. In the end, the worker would be paying the tax, and these \nworkers would be middle-income workers.\n  Again, do not take my word for it. The Joint Committee on Taxation \ntestified before our very Senate Finance Committee that the high-cost \nplan tax would be passed on to whom--the workers.\n  Joint Committee on Taxation data also indicates that in 2019, 84 \npercent of the revenue generated from the high-cost plan tax comes \nfrom--guess who--individuals and families earning less than $200,000 a \nyear, contrary to the President's promise in the last campaign that \nthese folks would not pay any additional tax.\n  So whether you agree or disagree with the policy of limiting the tax \nbenefit for employer-provided coverage, middle-class workers would see \na tax increase.\n  Let's go to the fourth car of the tax increase express. This car is \ngoing to carry two new tax increases. The first tax increase is on \nworkers who contribute to a flexible spending account, better known as \nan FSA.\n  Under the current tax laws, a worker may contribute to an FSA on a \npretax basis and use those FSA contributions to pay for copays and \ndeductibles tax free. Currently, there is no limit on how much a worker \nmay contribute to an FSA. This 2,074-page bill, put together by Senator \nReid, would limit the contribution amounts to $2,500. Statistics show, \nthe average FSA contribution is $1,800 a year. So this $2,500 limit \ndoes not sound that bad, right? Well, I say wrong. A great number of \nworkers who have serious illnesses contribute significantly more than \n$1,800 and, let me say, more than $2,500.\n  On average--on average--these workers whom I am talking about with \nserious health problems earn about $55,000 a year. If I were to connect \nthe dots, I would see a tax increase on workers with serious illnesses \nwho earn $55,000 a year. Well, here is how. These workers would now \nhave to pay taxes on their FSA contributions in excess of $2,500. The \nDemocratic leadership is taxing health benefits for the first time \never--at least this benefit for the first time ever.\n\n  The second tax increase in this fourth car is the elimination of the \ntaxfree reimbursement for over-the-counter medicine. Under the current \ntax rules, payments for over-the-counter medicine may be reimbursed \ntaxfree if a worker is covered under a flexible savings account or \nunder a health savings account. This 2,074-page bill takes away that \ntax benefit.\n  The fifth car of the tax increase express is the new Medicare payroll \ntaxes. Since the New Deal, the United States has put into place several \nsocial insurance programs. They are part of the social fabric of \nAmerica. Included in those programs are Social Security, unemployment \ninsurance, and Medicare. They are all founded on the social insurance \nconcepts. As Senator Moynihan, when he represented New York, used to \nremind us, to ensure their constitutionality, these programs were \ndesigned to be financed with payroll taxes instead of insurance \npremiums. But to maintain the closest appearance possible to social \ninsurance, the payroll tax looks a lot like a premium for insurance.\n  This analogy is very intentional. It is not accidental. It is bedrock \nto the sustainability and universality of social\n\n[[Page S12768]]\n\ninsurance programs that we all support: Social Security on the one \nhand, Medicare on the other.\n  The Reid amendment breaks that precedent, muddies the premium \nanalogy, and could start us on a tax-hike-only journey to dealing with \nour unsustainable entitlement programs.\n  Let me explain that. The way the payroll tax works now is that every \nworker pays in based on his or her salary, wages, or small business \nincome. That is a single, simple, and consistent tax base. Also, one \ntax rate applies to that payroll tax base. Now, for the first time--for \nthe very first time--an additional second tax rate will apply to the \npayroll tax base. Also, for the first time in the almost 45-year \nhistory of this great social insurance program, we have before us a \nproposal that creates a marriage penalty in the payroll tax. Now think \nof the negative comments you get from a marriage penalty from \ngrassroots America. So here we have a proposal that creates such a \nmarriage penalty in the payroll tax. In other words, some married \ncouples will be paying higher payroll taxes due solely to the fact that \nthey are married. A tax on marriage? This is a direct result of this \naddition to the second tax rate.\n  Here is another matter that boggles the mind. The second tax rate \nkicks in if your wages exceed $200,000 if you are single and $250,000 \nif you are married. These dollar thresholds are not indexed. They are \nnot indexed, so what happens then when you have inflation?\n  Another tax where the tax base is not indexed is the AMT. That ought \nto bring back all the horror stories about not indexing something \ntimely when you first pass it. I think every Member of Congress knows \nthat is an annual problem for us. In the late 1990s, commentators \ncalled the AMT the tax system's ``ticking timebomb.'' Fortunately, my \nfriend, the chairman, and I started to diffuse this bomb in the 2001 \ntax legislation. It appears that my friends on the other side of the \naisle have created another tax system ticking timebomb problem.\n  Finally, we have a caboose of this tax increase express. The caboose \nis the individual mandate penalty tax. It is a tax. It can be called a \npenalty, but it is a tax. All you have to do is have the IRS collecting \nit, as it does, and you know it is a tax. President Obama does not want \nto acknowledge that the penalty for failing to maintain a government-\napproved health insurance program is a tax, but it is right here in \nblack and white. The Reid bill amends the Tax Code by adding a new \nexcise tax. It is payable by those Americans who do not purchase \ngovernment-approved health insurance.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place section 1501 of the Reid amendment \nin the Record, which adds this new excise tax to our tax laws.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Subtitle F--Shared Responsibility for Health Care\n\n                   PART I--INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n     SEC. 1501. REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM ESSENTIAL \n                   COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In general.--The individual responsibility requirement \n     provided for in this section (in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``requirement'') is commercial and economic in nature, \n     and substantially affects interstate commerce, as a result of \n     the effects described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Effects on the national economy and interstate \n     commerce.--The effects described in this paragraph are the \n     following:\n       (A) The requirement regulates activity that is commercial \n     and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions \n     about how and when health care is paid for, and when health \n     insurance is purchased.\n       (B) Health insurance and health care services are a \n     significant part of the national economy. National health \n     spending is projected to increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or \n     17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in \n     2019. Private health insurance spending is projected to be \n     $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, \n     drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. \n     Since most health insurance is sold by national or regional \n     health insurance companies, health insurance is sold in \n     interstate commerce and claims payments flow through \n     interstate commerce.\n       (C) The requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     this Act, will add millions of new consumers to the health \n     insurance market, increasing the supply of, and demand for, \n     health care services. According to the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the requirement will increase the number and share of \n     Americans who are insured.\n       (D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by \n     building upon and strengthening the private employer-based \n     health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans \n     nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar requirement has \n     strengthened private employer-based coverage: despite the \n     economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-\n     based coverage has actually increased.\n       (E) Half of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by \n     medical expenses. By significantly increasing health \n     insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other \n     provisions of this Act, will improve financial security for \n     families.\n       (F) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government \n     has a significant role in regulating health insurance which \n     is in interstate commerce.\n       (G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there \n     were no requirement, many individuals would wait to purchase \n     health insurance until they needed care. By significantly \n     increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, \n     together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize \n     this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk \n     pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health \n     insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating \n     effective health insurance markets in which improved health \n     insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not \n     exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.\n       (H) Administrative costs for private health insurance, \n     which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of \n     premiums in the current individual and small group markets. \n     By significantly increasing health insurance coverage and the \n     size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of \n     scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and \n     lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential \n     to creating effective health insurance markets that do not \n     require underwriting and eliminate its associated \n     administrative costs.\n       (3) Supreme court ruling.--In United States v. South-\n     Eastern Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the \n     Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance is \n     interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation.\n       (b) In General.--Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     chapter:\n\n        ``CHAPTER 48--MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE\n\n``Sec. 5000A.

The kicker here is that CBO has told Congress that \nroughly one-half of those Americans who will pay this tax are \nindividuals between 100 and 300 percent of poverty. These folks earn \nless than $250,000 a year. I see the light at the end of the tunnel \nthat this tax increase express is going through. Unfortunately, that \nlight at the end of the tunnel is the tax increase express.\n  We can derail the tax increase express if we want to.\n  That is why today I am supporting Senator Crapo's motion to commit \nthe Reid amendment to the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Crapo's \nmotion would require the Finance Committee report a bill back to the \nSenate that does not include tax increases, fees, and penalties \nincluded in the Reid bill.\n  Why should my Democratic friends vote in favor of the motion? Because \nthey shouldn't want to bear the fallout of legislation that was rushed \nthrough Congress as the economic stimulus package was back in February. \nThey shouldn't want to tell their constituents they voted in favor of a \nbill that increased their premiums. They shouldn't want to vote for a \nbill that raises taxes on many, only to provide benefit for a few. They \nshouldn't want to break President Obama's pledge not to tax people \nmaking less than $250,000 a year.\n  What my friends should want is real health care reform, the kind of \nreform that has broad bipartisan support. I have consistently said that \nif Congress wants to restructure one-sixth of the economy, it ought to \nbe done on a bipartisan basis, and that is not one or two Republicans \nvoting with Democrats. That is not happening around here on a \nbipartisan basis. We are debating this 2,074-page bill, a partisan \nproduct, a bill that was cobbled together by the Democratic leadership, \na bill that has not received approval of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I ask my Democratic friends to stop this process foul right now. Vote \nin favor of Senator Crapo's motion so we can do health care reform in \nthe right way: on a bipartisan basis, in a transparent and open way, so \nthat the American public can understand what we are doing; so the \nAmerican public can be a part of the process; so that we can find a way \nto reform our health care system without burdening our constituents \nwith these higher taxes, fees, and penalties.\n  Let's reduce the out-of-control spending in the Reid amendment and \nfind savings within the health care system. Let's derail the tax \nincrease express before it steamrolls over hard-working Americans and \ndiscourages employment, particularly employment in small business, \nwhere 70 percent of the new jobs are created. The taxes, fees, and \npenalties don't need to be the fuel of this locomotive fire.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to support Senator Crapo's motion to \ncommit the Reid bill to the Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the amendment we are now considering is \nan amendment I have offered that deals with drug importation; that is, \nthe importation of prescription drugs from other countries. One might \nask the question: Well, why would we want to import drugs from other \ncountries? FDA-approved drugs are made all over the world and they are \nshipped all over the world; again, FDA-approved drugs, approved by our \nFood and Drug Administration, produced in plants that are inspected by \nour Food and Drug Administration. The difference is--the only \ndifference is--when they are shipped around the world, the American \nconsumer is charged the highest prices in the world by far.\n  Here is an example of the drug Lipitor. There are plenty of examples \nand I will go through a number of them today, but this is an example of \nLipitor. For an equivalent amount of Lipitor, 20 milligram tablets, the \nU.S. consumer pays $125, the British pay $40, the Spanish pay $32, the \nCanadians pay $33, the Germans pay $48. We are charged the highest \nprices in the world for Lipitor. Lipitor, by the way, is the most \npopular cholesterol-lowering drug. I have a couple of empty bottles in \nthe desk drawer here that demonstrates this drug was produced in \nIreland. It was sent all around the world. The same pill put in the \nsame bottle made by the same company, approved by our Food and Drug \nAdministration, this was sent to Canada, this was sent to the United \nStates. The difference? Well, the American consumer was allowed to pay \nthree times as much as the Canadian consumer. I shouldn't say \n``allowed,'' I should say forced. But it is not just United States \nversus Canada. As we can see, it is United States versus every other \ncountry.\n  The question is, Should that be the case? Should the American \nconsumer be charged the highest prices in the world? My answer to that \nis no. Why is it the case that we are charged the highest prices in the \nworld? Because we are the only country in which there is a special \nlittle law that prevents our citizens from accessing that FDA-approved \ndrug from wherever it is sold at the most advantageous price. We have a \nprovision in law that says the American people don't have the freedom \nto import a prescription drug, an FDA-approved drug that they find for \nhalf the price or 20 percent of the price in some other country. I say, \ngive the American people the freedom. I hear so much discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate about freedom. This is the ultimate freedom: the \nfreedom of the American people to access those prescription drugs that \nare sold virtually everywhere else, brand-name prescription drugs at \nthe fraction of the price.\n  I have examples of other prescription drugs as well to show you. It \nis not just Lipitor, although Lipitor is the most popular cholesterol-\nlowering drug.\n  This is Plavix. Plavix is an anticoagulant. You will see that we pay \nhigher than all of these countries by\n\n[[Page S12771]]\n\nfar; more than double what the British pay, more than double what the \nSpanish pay.\n  This is Nexium. If you are someone who has ulcers and you are taking \nNexium, for an equivalent amount of the same drug, Nexium, you are \ncharged $424 if you are an American citizen, $40 for the British, $36 \nfor the Spanish, $37 for the Germans, $67 for the French. The American \nconsumer, trying to control their condition of ulcers, pays $424--10 \ntimes the amount of money that others are paying for the identical \ndrug--10 times.\n  This kind of what I believe is gouging--that is, a pricing strategy \nthat gouges the American consumer--can largely be resolved by the \namendment I have offered. It removes that little sweetheart impediment \nin law and says to the American people: You may import prescription \ndrugs that are FDA-approved from registered enterprises in other \ncountries. We specifically delineate which countries those are--there \nare a handful of them--that have a nearly identical drug approval \nprocess that we have in our country. Identical. We also put in this \namendment unbelievable safety provisions dealing with pedigree and \nbatch lots and tracers that don't exist now in our domestic drug \nsupply, let alone importation.\n  So if we were allowing the American people to do this, the \nCongressional Budget Office says my amendment will save $19 billion--\n$19 billion--for the Federal Government over the next 10 years, but \nabout somewhere around $80 billion for American consumers above that. \nThat is a pretty big savings.\n\n  Here is another chart that shows what has happened in addition to the \nfact that we are charged the highest drug prices in the world. What has \nhappened in recent months, in 2009, is that brand-name prescription \ndrugs have increased in price over 9 percent, at a time when there is \nvirtually no inflation. For Enbrel, for arthritis, you get to pay 12 \npercent more; for Singulair, 12 percent more; and for Boniva, for \nosteoporosis, by the way, you are paying 18 percent more just this \nyear. That is what is happening. There is nothing in any of the health \ncare plans considered by the Senate or the House that addresses the \nescalating price of prescription drugs.\n  There are a whole lot of folks in this country who are not senior \ncitizens and are taking drugs to manage their disease. They may take \ncholesterol-lowering medicine or medicine to lower their blood \npressure. They manage their health issues, and they don't have to go to \na hospital because they are doing the right things. They are doing it \nwith pharmaceuticals. The problem is, pharmaceutical prices are going \nup, up, up, way up above what other people in the world are paying for \nthe identical drugs. I am saying it is just not fair. The issue is not \nthat the pharmaceutical industry is a bad one or that they are infested \nwith bad companies. I just think they have bad pricing policies. They \nare able to, and therefore they do, charge the American people, by far, \nthe highest prices in the world.\n  I wish to talk about a couple of important issues with respect to \nthis issue of giving the American people the freedom to access or \npurchase that FDA-approved drug in selected countries in which the drug \nsafety regulatory system is identical to ours, which is in our bill. \nAnd our bill includes, as I said, the establishment of pedigrees for \nbatch lots and tracers that don't exist today for our drug supply.\n  Some say and allege that you cannot do this safely, that it causes \nall kinds of problems with counterfeiting and so on. The fact is, the \nEuropeans have been doing it safely for 20 years. For over two decades, \nin Europe, under what is called parallel trading, if you are a German \nand want to buy a prescription drug in Spain, you can do it through the \nparallel trading system. If you are in Italy and you want to buy a \nprescription drug from France, there is no problem, you can do it. They \nhave done that safely for a long time. To suggest that we don't have \nthe skill and capability to do what the Europeans have been doing \nroutinely for 20 years is, in my judgment, shortchanging our country \nand certainly our consumers. I think we will, however, have people \nallege again that this is risky, it is just risky.\n  I would like to make a point about risk because I want to demonstrate \nsomething that I think most people don't know. Forty percent of the \nactive ingredients of our existing prescription drugs come from China \nand India. Again, 40 percent of those active ingredients come from \nChina and India and in most instances from areas that have never been \ninspected. My amendment doesn't allow drugs to be imported into this \ncountry from China or India. I am talking about the ingredients the \npharmaceutical industry acquires with which to make their drugs. We \ndon't allow drugs to be imported from China or India as a matter of \nthis amendment; only FDA-approved drugs from FDA-inspected plants in \nCanada, the European countries, Japan, New Zealand, or Australia. That \nis all. Why? Because they have similar drug safety standards. That is \nthe basis on which we determine how importation could work safely.\n  I wish to describe a recent scandal that illustrates the double \nstandard some want to apply to this question. The scandal was about a \ndrug called Heparin, a blood thinner that is commonly used by dialysis \npatients, which was linked to more than 62 deaths last year. Heparin \nwas ultimately pulled from the market. According to Baxter, which \nmarkets Heparin in the United States, the allergic reactions to Heparin \nthat caused the deaths appear to be caused by a contaminant added in \nplace of the active ingredient in Heparin somewhere during the \nmanufacturing process, most likely in China.\n  The Wall Street Journal did a very important story on the Heparin \ncontamination. They reported that more than half of the world's Heparin \ngets its start in China's poorly regulated supply chain. This is what \nthe Wall Street Journal, after its investigation, concluded:\n\n       More than half of the world's Heparin, the main ingredient \n     in this widely used anti-clotting medicine, gets its start in \n     China's totally unregulated supply chain.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal published a series of pictures that I want to \nshow--photographs of the intestine encasing factory which processes pig \nintestines used to make Heparin. I want to show some photographs that \ncame from the Wall Street Journal. This is a photograph of a facility, \nand that is the outside. Here is a photograph of someone in the \nfacility who is stirring a rusty vat full of Heparin ingredients with a \ntree branch. So this is the processing of Heparin from pig intestines \nin a facility in China, in which a worker is stirring this rusty vat \nwith a tree branch. Are the ingredients that are used to make medicine \nwith respect to blood clotting an issue?\n  When the industry and others say we can't have drug importation \nsafely from Canada or Ireland, the point is that they are getting a lot \nof their ingredients from China and India. All you have to do is simply \nlook at this and ask yourself whether the domestic drug supply with \nrespect to that ingredient and those inputs has sufficient safety.\n  While the record keeping at these Chinese facilities makes it almost \nimpossible to trace the contaminant from this particular factory, these \npictures by the Wall Street Journal show the unsanitary conditions in \nwhich pig intestines are processed for that particular medicine. Again, \nby contrast, the amendment we offer would allow the importation of FDA-\napproved medicines only, with a chain of custody to ensure the drugs \nare handled properly. It gives the FDA the authority to inspect all \nfacilities in the chain of custody.\n  The amendment mandates the use of anticounterfeiting technology to \ntrack and trace imported and domestic drugs to ensure product \nintegrity. That doesn't exist today, but that is required in the \namendment. The amendment also requires pharmacies and drug wholesalers \nto register with the FDA and to be subject to strict requirements to \nensure the safety of imported medications, including frequent random \ninspections.\n  The amendment I am offering would ensure safety and, in fact, provide \na much greater margin of safety than now exists with all of our drug \nsupply. We need to have these improvements, in my judgment, because our \nown prescription drug distribution system is not as good as we think it \nis.\n  Here is an excellent example of something that took place in the \nUnited States. This is a picture of Mr. Tim\n\n[[Page S12772]]\n\nFagan, a young 16-year-old boy from Long Island, NY. He received a \nliver transplant. He was prescribed a drug called Epogen to boost his \nred blood cells and fight the anemia after the operation. He received \ndaily inspections, but his red blood cell count wasn't improving and \nthe doctors could not figure out why, what was happening. After 2 \nmonths, his mom went to the local CVS pharmacy, where she was told: By \nthe way, the Epogen your son has been taking may have been counterfeit.\n  Here is an example of counterfeiting in the existing domestic drug \nsupply--counterfeiting in which this container held the counterfeit \nmedicine and this one held the real medicine. There were subtle \ndifferences but not many. It turned out that the vial Tim was injecting \nwas one-twentieth the strength of what he was supposed to be taking and \nwhat was disclosed on the label.\n  How did that happen? The weaker drug sells for $22 a bottle, and the \nhigh-strength version goes for $445 a bottle. Investigators found that \n110,000 of the bogus bottles of that medicine reached the market in \nthis country, and it is estimated that the criminals involved with that \ncounterfeiting in that particular case made $46 million.\n  The manufacturer of that drug, a company called Amgen, had \ndistributed some of the product through a complicated network of \nsecondary distributors. Although nobody knew it at the time, some of \nthe Epogen that was eventually resold had most likely run through a \ncooler in the back of this strip club, a seedy Miami strip club called \nPlaypen South.\n  Here is a chart that shows the distribution system this particular \ncounterfeit drug went through. Again, this is not an import; this is a \ndomestic drug. You can see this unbelievable and complicated \ndistribution system. At the end of that, it traveled through strip \nclubs, through homes, and through trunks of cars without proper \ncooling.\n\n  This story was told in great detail by some outstanding investigation \nby Katherine Eban in a book called ``Dangerous Doses.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to extend the period of debate \nuntil 3 p.m., with the time to be equally divided, with Senators \npermitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with no \namendments in order during this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for as much time as I \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, again talking about the issue I just \ndescribed:\n\n       They traveled through strip clubs. They traveled through \n     homes. They traveled through trunks of cars, without proper \n     cooling.\n\n  I am talking about a domestic counterfeit drug supply.\n  The amendment we are offering would fix this supply chain problem. It \nwill require a pedigree for all drugs, not just those imported. It \nshould have been done long ago. Some of us have been trying for a long \ntime. It will allow us to track every single drug from where it is made \nto the pharmacy in which it is sold.\n  My amendment will require a set of anti-counterfeiting measures that \nare not in place now. If you think of it, I have a twenty-dollar bill \nhere, and most people who have looked at them understand there is \nsophisticated and substantial anti-counterfeiting technology in new \ntwenty-dollar bills. That doesn't exist today, by the way. That \nsophistication, that relentless search for the ability to detect \ncounterfeiting does not exist today, regrettably, in our drug supply. \nThe pedigree that we require, the tracing capability, the batch lots \nwill make that a requirement on our entire drug supply.\n  This amendment will make our entire drug supply safer. It will allow \nAmericans to benefit from lower prices--the prices at which these \nidentical drugs are sold in other countries. In many cases they are \nhalf the price and in some cases much lower--10 percent of the price at \nwhich they are sold in this country.\n  I wish to talk for a moment about the issue of drug price inflation \nbecause the drug price--what is happening to us in this country is drug \nprice inflation, the relentless increases year after year, which is the \nred line here on the chart. It is 9.3 percent this year. This yellow \nline is the rate of inflation. If we don't do anything to deal with the \nprice of prescription drugs, we will have missed the opportunity to do \nsomething to help the American people.\n  Let me describe a few stories about the need for the amendment.\n  In my home State, in Aneta, ND, Maryanne wrote to me:\n\n       My husband has Parkinson's Disease, so he takes a drug \n     called Mirapex. We have Medicare Part D, but in September, he \n     ends up in the so-called donut hole. In 2008, when this \n     happened, we paid $106 for his medication. It increased to \n     $187 in October and November, $198 in December. Now, in \n     September 2009, the price was $286--a $180 increase in one \n     year.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator, I know, is aware and has talked about this. \nHow does the Senator account for the fact that there is a nearly 9-\npercent increase in the cost of pharmaceutical drugs, while the \nconsumer price index this year has gone down 1.3 percent?\n  I understand this is the highest increase in the history, or in most \nrecent years, in the cost of prescription drugs. What is the \nexplanation between the divergence of those two lines?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The explanation, I suppose, is probably better addressed \nto the pharmaceutical industry of how and why do they increase these \nprices this way. My guess is they do it because they can.\n  The fact is, the cost-of-living index--the inflation rate is the \nyellow line. The price of prescription drugs is the red line.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would that have anything to do with the anticipation of \nincoming reductions or reductions in the increase of costs of \npharmaceuticals?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Arizona, my expectation is the \npharmaceutical industry has said this is the time to increase these \nprices. The most important element is there is no restraint. No one has \nany capability of restraining them. The only way you would provide \nrestraint on this is if you said to the American consumer: You know \nwhat. You don't have to buy it from these people at these prices \nbecause it is sold in virtually every other country at half the price. \nIf we say to the American people, we will give them the freedom to \naccess that drug elsewhere, I think quickly the pharmaceutical industry \nwould not be able to impose those price increases because then you \nwould have competition. Freedom equals competition, in my judgment, on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator another question. We understand you \ncan buy lettuce from overseas. You can buy many other products from \noverseas. You can buy dairy products. You can buy almost any item \nexcept perhaps prescription drugs. Yet the Canadians, in particular, as \nwell as the countries that are included in the Senator's amendment, all \nadhere to the same standards or higher standards than the United States \nof America does.\n  Now I understand one of the Senators--not the Senator from North \nDakota--has received a letter saying this is still a problem.\n  I don't get it. Maybe the Senator from North Dakota can explain it a \nlittle better.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Arizona, there is not a safety \nissue here. To the extent there is any safety issue, it is that we \nintend to increase the safety of both domestic supply of prescription \ndrugs and the imported prescription drugs because the fact is, there is \nnothing at this point dealing with batch lots and pedigrees and tracing \ncapability. That does not exist at this point. We will insist on it in \nthis amendment.\n  For anybody to suggest that somehow we are going to end up with \nprescription drug products that are less safe, that is just not the \nfact. As I indicated before the Senator came to the floor, Europe has \nbeen doing this for 20 years in something called parallel trading. For \n20 years, they have done it. If you are in Germany and want to buy a \nprescription drug that is approved, you can. If you are in Italy and \nwant to buy\n\n[[Page S12773]]\n\nit from France, you can. They do it successfully.\n  I do not believe anybody should tell us we are not capable of doing \nwhat the Europeans have done for 20 years, and that is giving people \nthe freedom to access prescription drugs where they are sold at a \nbetter price.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator another question. Isn't it true a \nletter was written to one of our colleagues from the Administrator of \nthe FDA, the organization that would basically make sure any product \nthat goes to American consumers along these lines, that go through that \nbureaucracy, said it would require a significant amount of assets and \nresources?\n  I have since been told there are 11,000 employees of that \nbureaucracy. I wonder what he thinks about that argument; and, again, \nwas the Senator from North Dakota informed about this position, which, \nby the way, is the same position as the previous administration?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from Arizona is correct. \nThere was a letter from the Food and Drug Administration. The fact is, \nwe have seen this over the years. They say: We don't have the resources \nor it will pose more risk.\n  The fact is, this amendment provides the resources for them because \nthose who are going to register to ship FDA-approved drugs into this \ncountry at a better price are going to have to pay a fee. The people \nwho are selling will pay a fee, and those pharmacies and others in our \ncountry that will be receiving them will also pay a fee.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So it would require no additional funding from the \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No additional funding from the taxpayers at all. Those \nwho decide they are going to offer these lower price prescription drugs \nwould be paying a fee for the purpose of being able to do that. This is \nnot a taxpayer-funded issue at all. It will provide the additional \nresources and pay for those resources without asking the taxpayers to \ncome up with the money.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Do these countries that are included in the Senator's \namendment--do we have absolute assurance, can we look at the American \npeople and say: Those countries and the agreements we would have with \nthem, you can have products that are safe, you can safely buy, and it \nwould not pose any hazard to anyone's health?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The countries that are involved in this amendment--and \nthey are limited--are countries that have nearly identical drug safety \nstandards to our country. These are countries that are accessing the \nsame drugs.\n  I just mentioned--let me do it again--two bottles of medicine. They \nare empty, obviously. Both of these bottles contain Lipitor. Most of my \ncolleagues know what Lipitor is. This was made by an American company \nin Ireland and then shipped all over the world. This little bottle was \nshipped to the United States. This little bottle was shipped to Canada. \nSame bottle. One was blue, one has red in the label. Same bottle, same \ncompany, inspected by the FDA. What is the difference? The price.\n  The American consumer is told: Guess what you get to do. You get to \npay almost triple. Why? And it is not just the American consumer, if I \ncan hold up a chart that shows two drugs--one is Nexium. This is \nadvertised substantially. Nexium is an example. I also have one on \nLipitor. Here is the price for Nexium.\n  Do you think the pharmaceutical industry is selling Nexium at $37 for \nthe equivalent quantity in Germany and losing money? I don't think they \nare losing money at that. Instead of $37, they charge the American \nconsumer $424.\n  My point is my beef with the industry is their pricing policy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Wouldn't the pharmaceutical companies say it costs $424 \nbecause we have to absorb the cost of all the research that went into \ndeveloping Nexium?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say that is also always raised. They say: If you \ndon't allow us to charge the American consumers the highest prices in \nthe world, we don't get to do the research and development that \nproduces the next new miracle drug.\n  Most of the recent studies have shown that the pharmaceutical \nindustry spends more money on promotion, marketing, and advertising \nthan they do on research. I want them to do research. But there is one \nother piece. The Congress gave, without my support, a proposal that \nsaid those American companies that have money overseas should bring it \nback and we will let them pay a lower tax rate. Guess which industry \nwas one of the largest industries with repatriated profits from abroad? \nThe pharmaceutical industry. If they are making big profits abroad and \ncharging lower prices to those consumers abroad, why can't the American \npeople have access to those prices?\n  It is not because they are going to lose money because they made a \nlot of money abroad. That is why they repatriated at a lower rate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Do the seniors from his State and other citizens from his \nState travel to Canada and buy these prescription drugs because they \nknow and are confident that they are getting, at a much lower price, \nthe same product? Unfortunately, citizens in my State have to go south, \nand it is unfortunate when they have to do that because we do have a \nmuch larger problem there, I am sorry to say.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the citizens from North Dakota often \nhave to go to Canada to buy a prescription drug. I have told the story \nabout the old codger who was sitting on a hay bale in a farmyard when I \nhad a town meeting. He was nibbling on a piece of straw. He said to me: \nMy wife--he was about 80 years old--my wife has been fighting breast \ncancer for 3 years. He said: The only way we could pay for our \nprescription drugs was to drive to Canada once every 3 months because \nwhen you buy tamoxifen in Canada, you pay like one-tenth the price or \none-fifth of the price you pay in the United States. He said: We did \nthat every 3 months so my wife could keep fighting breast cancer.\n\n  Of course they do that. What is happening is consumers are allowed to \nbring back as an informal strategy about 90 days' worth of supply of \nprescription drugs for personal use only. Most American consumers \ncannot do that. They do not live anywhere close to a border.\n  The question is, Can the rest of the American people have access to \nthe same prescription drugs sold at a fraction of the price?\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator, isn't it true the Congressional \nBudget Office has determined that this measure of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, this modest measure of only countries that are of the \nhighest level of quality of inspection, of all the standards that we \nhave, would save the American consumer $100 billion; is that true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Congressional Budget office says it \nwill save the Federal Government about $19 billion, and then about \nanother $80 billion will be saved by the consumers. That is about $100 \nbillion, nearly $100 billion in savings in total, $19 billion of which \nwill be saved by the Federal Government for its purchases, and the rest \nby the American consumers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, I wish to ask the Senator, what is the basis of \nthe argument against the Senator's amendment? What possible reason, \nfrankly, except for the influence of a special interest in this, our \nNation's Capitol?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am not a very good advocate for the other side. If one \nwere to ask what is the best argument opposed to my amendment, I would \nsay there are not any arguments that are the best. There is a range of \npoor arguments or arguments that do not hold much water.\n  I started by saying I do not have a beef against the pharmaceutical \nindustry. I want them to do well. I want them to be successful. I want \nthem to keep finding and searching for miracle drugs. By the way, much \nof the work they do comes from the National Institutes of Health and \nthe massive investments we make in health. I want them all to be \nsuccessful.\n  My beef with them is a pricing strategy that says to the American \npeople: Here is what you pay, and you can do nothing about it because \nwe decided that is what you pay, and we are going to offer everything \naround the world at lower prices. That is my beef. This is a pricing \nissue. They are wrong about it.\n  The way to correct it is to give the American people a little bit of \nfreedom. We will save money for the government and save money for the \nAmerican people.\n\n[[Page S12774]]\n\n  I want to raise one additional point while the Senator is here. If \nthe Senator from Arizona is like me, when I am brushing my teeth in the \nmorning, I have a television blaring and I hear all these ads: Go ask \nthe doctor if the purple pill is right for you. I haven't the foggiest \nidea what a purple pill will do for me. The ads are so compelling you \nalmost feel: I have to get out of here. I have to stop brushing my \nteeth, go get a phone, and call my doctor to see if my life might be \nimproved by taking a purple pill.\n  I read a whole series of advertisements:\n\n       Does your restless mind keep you from sleeping? Do you lie \n     awake exhausted? Maybe it's time to ask if Lunesta is right \n     for you. Ask your doctor how to get 7 nights of Lunesta free \n     . . .\n\n  I read a bunch of these. I will not now. Bladder problems, Flomax, \nAmbien--you name it and they advertise it all day and every morning. I \nsay knock off a little of that. Give us some better prices. God bless \nyou for doing all you do, I would say to the industry, but give us fair \nprices. Give fair prices to the American consumer and knock off a \nlittle of the advertising. The advertising is only for a product that \nonly a doctor can prescribe. You cannot get this product unless a \ndoctor thinks you need it. Stop asking me if the purple pill is right \nfor me, asking me to ask a doctor if the purple pill is right for \nSenator McCain. Knock it off.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make an \nadditional comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota who has been \npursuing this issue for a number of years. I believe we are on the \nverge of success.\n  I appreciate his eloquence, I appreciate his passion, but most of \nall, on behalf of the citizens of my State who can't get up to Canada, \nwho now are experiencing unprecedented economic difficulties, and who \nneed these lifesaving prescription drugs--many of them senior \ncitizens--I just wish to say thank you for your advocacy.\n  I think you have made an eloquent case, and I hope my colleagues have \npaid attention and will vote in the affirmative for the Senator's \namendment today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say that Senator McCain has been a \npart of this effort for a long time. It is interesting, with all the \naction on floor of the Senate in recent weeks, this is one of the few \nexamples of a significant policy that is bipartisan. We have \nRepublicans and Democrats--over 30 cosponsors--who have worked with us \nto make certain we can do this, do it safely, and give the American \npeople the opportunity they deserve. This is very bipartisan. I \nappreciate that a lot.\n  I wish to say, the National Federation of Independent Businesses \nsupports this; the AARP supports this. We have a long list of \norganizations that are strong supporters of this amendment, and so I \nhope, today, perhaps at last--at long last, after 8 or 10 years--we \nmight finally achieve a breakthrough and get this through the Senate.\n  I have said previously that the pharmaceutical industry is a \nformidable opponent. I understand that. We have had difficulty getting \nthis in a piece of legislation to get it signed and give the American \npeople freedom and give them fair pricing. When we do this--Senator \nMcCain, myself, and others--it is suggested that somehow we have no \nregard for this industry. That is not the case at all. It just is not. \nWe have no regard for a pricing policy, however, that we believe is \nunfair to the American people. It has been that way for too long--a \nlong time too long. Perhaps today--with the vote on this amendment, \nwhich I expect later this afternoon--will be the first step in getting \nthat changed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe if I am to speak for more than 10 \nminutes I need to ask unanimous consent. If that is correct, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the Crapo motion--an \namendment that, hopefully, we will be voting on a little later today--\nand I urge my colleagues to support the motion of the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  This is about jobs and it is about taxes. I think one thing Americans \ndon't expect out of this legislation is that they are going to have a \npay a lot of taxes and that jobs are going to be killed rather than \ncreated. The President is talking about creating more jobs. Everyone in \nAmerica is focused on putting people back to work, ending this \nrecession, and bringing unemployment down so we can get jobs and go \nback to work. One of the problems with this bill is it kills jobs. It \nkills job creation. One of the ways it does that is through the many \nnew taxes and mandates it imposes.\n  Naturally, we want to be sure that whatever we do, we don't harm our \neconomy or job creation, but this $2.5 trillion legislation is filled \nwith new taxes and mandates that will ultimately be borne by small \nbusinesses and the American workers. I will talk about just three.\n  First, a new employer mandate that says that employers have to \nprovide insurance to their employees or face a penalty. This would hurt \nlow-income workers especially, according to a Harvard economist, and I \nwill be talking about that.\n  Second, there is a new Medicare payroll tax. Incidentally, the \nrevenue raised doesn't go back to Medicare. It would be nice if we \ncould help with the Medicare solvency, but this too threatens the \ncreation of jobs, particularly in small businesses, because it is a \ndirect tax on hiring more people.\n  Finally, new taxes on the health care industry could undermine its \nongoing job creation gains. By the way, it is the only industry to have \ngained jobs since the start of the recession and this legislation will \nactually cause job losses.\n  I will describe all three of these. First, the employer mandate. The \nbill imposes a requirement--a costly new mandate--on employers that \nwill have the perverse impact of actually hurting employees, especially \nlow-cost employees. How so? Any employer with more than 50 employees \nwho does not offer health care coverage would be required to pay an \nassessment for each employee who receives a tax credit for purchasing \ncoverage through a newly created exchange. Those are folks in the lower \nincome brackets who qualify for tax credits. So this becomes a direct \ntax on hiring people.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,\n\n       . . . the particular employee provision in the Finance \n     Committee bill would pose significant problems by imposing a \n     tax on employers for hiring people from low- and moderate-\n     income families who would qualify for subsidies in the new \n     health insurance exchanges, it would discourage firms from \n     hiring such individuals, and would favor the hiring--for the \n     same jobs--of people who don't qualify for the subsidies \n     (primarily people from families at higher income levels.)\n\n  To conclude:\n\n       It would [also] provide an incentive for employers to \n     convert full-time workers (i.e., workers employed at least 30 \n     hours per week) to part-time workers.\n\n  So here you have it--a mandate in the bill that would directly impact \nthe hiring of low-income workers--precisely the opposite of what we \nwant to be doing these days.\n  Harvard economist Kate Baicker examined the effect of an employer \nmandate similar to the one in the Reid bill. She estimated the cost of \nhiring a low-wage worker would rise by 33 percent--or $2 per hour on a \nworker earning $6 per hour. Think about that. She concluded that \n224,000 workers would lose their jobs as a result of a mandate with \nthese costs.\n  In addition to all the other problems we have with growing \nunemployment, here is another one-quarter million people who would lose \ntheir jobs because of this bill. It makes no sense.\n  There was a recent letter sent to the two Senate leaders from the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses which states:\n\n       Mandates destroy job creation opportunities for employees. \n     The job loss, whether through lost hiring or greater reliance \n     on part-time employees, harms low-wage or entry-level workers \n     the most.\n\n  That is exactly what the other study said. By the way, the NFIB is a \nnonprofit, non-partisan organization, defining itself as the voice of \nsmall business. We are all familiar with the good work it does. I think \nit would know\n\n[[Page S12775]]\n\nwhat is best for American business and workers.\n  The second way this bill imposes taxes and hurts workers is it \nactually creates a payroll tax; in other words, a tax on hiring people \nor keeping them on your payroll. It raises the Medicare payroll tax by \n0.5 percent on small businesses with taxable receipts of $200,000 a \nyear or $250,000 or more, if the small business employer filer is \nmarried.\n  Because many small businesses pay taxes at the individual level, \nimposing higher individual income taxes hurts these engines of job \ncreation. The Joint Committee on Taxation recently estimated that one-\nthird of the income that would be taxed under a similar House proposal \ncomes from small businesses. Let us remember, as President Obama \nreminded us earlier this week, small businesses generated 65 percent of \nthe job growth between 1993 and 2008 and represent about half the \nprivate sector employment of the United States.\n  So this huge potential engine for job creation is going to get \nwhacked by the imposition of a new tax, which is a direct tax on the \nhiring or retaining of employees. The Joint Committee estimates that \nthis increase in the Medicare tax would raise $54 billion over the next \n10 years. That is $54 billion of resources that could have better been \nused in the private economy, in these small businesses, to expand job \ncreation.\n  Each new tax dollar paid by these small businesses is one less dollar \nthat could go toward the hiring of new employees or, for that matter, \npreventing layoffs or even giving raises to their existing employees.\n  A group of organizations recently told us in a letter--by the way, \nthese are all organizations that represent small businesses in their \ncommunities--they oppose this bill because of what it would do to these \nsmall businesses. I wish to read the names of the groups that represent \nthese folks: the Associated Builders and Contractors, the Associated \nGeneral Contractors, the International Food Service Distributors \nAssociation, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National \nAssociation of Wholesaler-Distributors, the National Retail Federation, \nthe Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, and the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce.\n  Here is a telling quotation from their letter:\n\n       In order to finance part of its $2.5 trillion price tag, \n     H.R. 3590 imposes new taxes, fees, and penalties totaling \n     nearly half a trillion dollars. This financial burden falls \n     disproportionately on the backs of small business. Small \n     firms are in desperate need of this precious capital for job \n     creation, investment, and business.\n\n  That is exactly what President Obama said yesterday. We have to get \nmore capital into the hands of these small businesses so they can \neither continue their businesses with their employees or, potentially \nat least, soon begin hiring more. Yet as this letter points out, this \nbill imposes taxes with a burden that falls disproportionately on the \nvery firms we are trying to help.\n  In a November 19 statement, the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses said of the bill's impact on small businesses:\n\n       We oppose [the Reid bill] due to the amount of new taxes, \n     the creation of new mandates, and the establishment of new \n     entitlement programs. There is no doubt all these burdens \n     will be paid for on the backs of small business. It is clear \n     to us that, at the end of the day, the costs to small \n     business more than outweigh the benefits they may have \n     realized.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       The impact from these new taxes, a rich benefit package \n     that is more costly than what they can afford today, a new \n     government entitlement program, and a hard employer mandate \n     equals disaster for small business.\n\n  They know what they are talking about. These are the folks whom we \nare depending upon to create jobs and we are punching them right in the \nstomach, right where it hurts, with respect to their ability to create \nthese new jobs with the new taxes and mandates imposed in this bill.\n  Let me share a brief letter from one of my constituents. He is a \nsmall business owner in Tempe, AZ. His name is Justin Page. He would \nlike to be able to grow his business, but the burdensome new taxes in \nthis bill would force him to lay off workers and cut hours from his \npayroll. Here is what he says:\n\n       Dear Senator Kyl, As a long time Tempe and Arizona \n     resident, who has been operating a small business for the \n     past 19 years, I urge you to not vote for the healthcare bill \n     as it is currently proposed and as recently passed by the \n     House of Representatives. My business has taken a severe \n     financial hit in the past 18 months with several employee \n     layoffs, reduced hours for current employees, heavier \n     workloads, et cetera. My answer to increased health care \n     costs and additional small business taxes is to lay more \n     people off . . . not good for [my employees], and not good \n     for me! But survival is my primary goal right now! Reform is \n     necessary, but please do it in a bipartisan manner and within \n     a timetable that allows for constructive debate. This is too \n     important.\n\n  So small businesses have some very real concerns about this \nlegislation and good reason to worry that they will be victims of its \ndestructive policies. Obviously, it is not the kind of legislation \nsmall business owners or the American worker wants and, of course, not \nparticularly in times of double-digit unemployment. We need to listen \nto the people out there who are actually creating jobs, who have to \nmeet a payroll, balance a budget, and know what is necessary to run a \nsuccessful small business. They are not happy with this legislation.\n  The third and final point is the new taxes on the health care \nindustry, which of course get passed through to the people who \nultimately have to buy insurance. Let me just discuss one--the medical \ndevice tax. This medical device tax is a tax on things that are used to \ntreat us, to give us health care every day. The $110 billion in new \ntaxes on industries such as this--the pharmaceutical, the insurance, \nand medical device industries--is a direct passthrough in terms of what \nwe will end up having to pay in insurance premiums.\n  For example, this medical device tax will be assessed against \nthousands of products, such as contact lenses, stethoscopes, hospital \nbeds, artificial heart valves, and advanced diagnostic equipment. Why \nwould you impose a tax on these things that help us? I could maybe see \na tax against liquor or a tax against tobacco but a tax on things such \nas this--these advanced technologies that help us? Why do we want to \nmake them more expensive? These have been invented so we can have an \nextension of our lives; so our families can have better health care.\n  We all know when you tax something, you get less of it. In fact, a \nUBS Investment Research paper recently confirmed:\n\n       If the plan passes as proposed and our estimates are \n     correct, the initial years would be a financial challenge for \n     medical device manufacturers, as the full industry fee \n     becomes due before newly covered patients impact volumes.\n\n  What they are saying here is, first, before they can even begin to \npass these costs on, it could kill this particular industry.\n  These taxes will hit smaller firms particularly hard since some of \nthe smaller companies don't start out with a lot of profits. They rely \nalmost entirely for domestic sales on their revenues.\n  I note my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Senators \nKlobuchar, Bayh, Franken, and in addition Senator Lugar from this side \nof the aisle, recently sent a letter in which they said:\n\n       Independent estimates indicate that this tax could \n     translate into an annual income tax surcharge of between 10 \n     and 30 percent on medical device manufacturers.\n\n  Think about that, a 10- to 30-percent tax on folks who are inventing \nthese kinds of things to help us.\n  These Senators go on in their letter:\n\n       This provision would harm economic development and health \n     care innovation nationwide.\n\n  This was a letter to the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  I know there some who argue that lost jobs in the private health care \nsector will be made up with new jobs in the government with health care \nbureaucrats here in Washington. Wonderful, I say.\n  That is not a good thing. We need jobs in the private sector. That \nshould be our primary goal and that certainly is what President Obama \nwas talking about yesterday when he talked about creating more jobs in \nthe private sector.\n  In conclusion, I have described three ways in which this legislation \nthrough its mandates and its new taxes will\n\n[[Page S12776]]\n\ncripple our ability to come back out of this recession. It will make it \nvery difficult for us to retain, let alone hire, new employees.\n  All of us here in the Senate I know want to do what we can to bring \ndown the current very high unemployment. It is obvious that this health \ncare bill makes things worse, not better. At every turn its new taxes \nand mandates put us on the wrong course. I think it is very hard to \njustify support for this legislation that threatens job creation, \nespecially job creation for low-income workers.\n  I urge my colleagues, when we vote on the Crapo motion here pretty \nsoon, to consider its impact. It will enable at least people in the \nlower income levels to avoid the kind of taxes that are imposed here, \none of which, for example, is the tax that IRS will enforce if you do \nnot buy the insurance policy that the government, under this bill, will \nmandate that you buy. If you cannot afford the insurance the Government \nhas, you have to buy it anyway. If you do not, we will impose a new tax \non you, enforced by the IRS. The Crapo motion would say no, not so \nfast, IRS, we are going to protect folks from that new tax. That is why \nit is important to support the Crapo motion.\n  I urge my colleagues, even though I know we have had a lot of votes \nhere where very few Democrats have supported Republican amendments, \nthis is one which I hope all of us could support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senator Dorgan. Frankly, this amendment should be \na no-brainer--it saves taxpayers and consumers money by bringing down \nprices for prescription drugs. I don't think American consumers should \nhave to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, \nparticularly when those prices keep going up.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has stated that brand-name drugs \ncost, on average, 35 to 55 percent less in other industrialized nations \nthan they do in the United States. And the AARP released a study \nrecently that found that the price of drugs most commonly used by \nseniors has risen faster than the general inflation rate every year \nsince 2004. In 2007, the price spiked by 8.7 percent--three times the \ngeneral inflation rate of 2.9 percent.\n  It is no wonder that Americans turn to Canada to buy more affordable, \nand entirely safe, prescription drugs. Americans are now importing more \nthan $1 billion in prescription drugs from Canada alone. Consumers \nwould not go to such lengths to buy their medicines this way if they \nwere not saving money.\n  Now, the drug industry has said that drug importation can't be done \nsafely. I give PhRMA credit. They have gone to great lengths to scare \nthe public. The reality is drug importation has occurred within \nEuropean Union countries--called parallel trade--for the last 25 years. \nThe pharmaceutical industry should know drug importation is safe. The \nindustry has imported drugs and sold them in the U.S. for decades. One-\nquarter of the drugs consumed by Americans today are made in foreign \nmanufacturing plants.\n  The Dorgan amendment includes a number of protections to ensure that \nimported drugs are safe--and certainly safer than the completely \nunregulated system we have today.\n  I don't need to remind my colleagues about the deficit hole we are \nin. Federal spending is one of the top concerns I hear about from my \nconstituents--they want to know what we are doing to get our deficit \nunder control. That is why I introduced legislation, the Control \nSpending Now Act, to propose concrete ways to bring down runaway \ngovernment spending. And one of the proposals I included was Senator \nDorgan's drug importation legislation, because it is such a commonsense \nand effective way to save the government tens of billions of dollars. I \nam pleased that the health care reform bill we are debating already \nincludes three other proposals in my control spending bill, championed \nby Senator Bingaman and others, that would slash Federal spending on \nprescription drugs by billions of dollars.\n  With passage of the Dorgan amendment we can make it four.\n  We do a lot of things in Congress that leave our constituents \nscratching their heads. Now we have a chance to show them we are \nlistening to them, that we understand their concerns, and that we want \nto bring down Federal spending while ensuring the prescription drugs \nthey need are more affordable. Again, that sounds like a no-brainer to \nme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we extend the \nperiod for debate until 4 p.m. with the time equally divided, with \nSenators permitted to speak up to 10 minutes each, with no amendments \nin order during this period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, Americans across this country are facing the \nreality of an economy that is in trouble. The unemployment rate is now \n10 percent. According to the Department of Labor's broadest measure, \nsome 17.5 percent of Americans are without a job entirely or are \nunderemployed.\n  We have shed 3\\1/2\\ million jobs since January of this year and the \naverage work week is now down to 33 hours for the American worker. \nAmericans are struggling to find good jobs and, because of that, they \nare having trouble making their mortgage payments. Fourteen percent of \nall mortgage loans, meaning 7.4 million households, were delinquent or \nin foreclosure in the last quarter. That is the highest number since \nthe mortgage bankers industry began this survey in 1972.\n  Many economic indicators point toward a slow, unsteady and jobless \nrecovery, and the American people know it. In a recent survey, 82 \npercent of Americans said our Nation's economic conditions are poor. In \nrecent weeks, President Obama has convened a summit at the White House \nto discuss jobs and economic issues. He has given speeches to discuss \nproposals for job creation and economic recovery. There has even been \ndiscussion about spending additional billions of dollars on another \neconomic stimulus bill.\n  Unfortunately, the President has not advocated for the single \nquickest and simplest way to promote economic growth. If the President \nwants to save jobs and grow the economy, all he needs to do is tell the \nmajority leader and the Senate Democrats to scrap this $2.5 trillion \nReid health care reform bill and work it over, step by step, to get it \nright and to save costs.\n  Senator Reid's prescription for our economic troubles is a $2.5 \ntrillion bill full of tax increases, higher health care costs, and $500 \nbillion in Medicare cuts. The Reid bill contains $500 billion in new \ntaxes. Primarily that is how it is being paid for--steal money from \nMedicare and tax people additionally. There are new taxes on \nindividuals, new taxes on small businesses, and new taxes on health \ncare providers.\n  These new taxes will raise health care costs. They will be passed on \nto the individuals in the form of higher premiums. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Reid bill will drive premiums up by 10 \npercent to 13 percent.\n  I know the other side likes to relate to those pieces of the bill \nthat talk about--one section that brings it down by 7 percent and \nanother one that brings it down by 7 percent, but they fail to notice \nthat the bill actually raises it to 27 percent to begin with. When you \nsubtract that out, it still winds up with a 10-percent to 13-percent \nincrease.\n  Who gets taxed under the Reid bill? If you don't have a government-\napproved health insurance, you get taxed. Incidentally, we are going to \ntell you--Washington is going to tell you what the minimum requirement \nis. That will be higher than most people have for insurance at the \npresent time. The government will tell you what you need and they will \nfine you if you do not agree.\n  The total amount of new taxes on uninsured Americans is $8 billion. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, half of the new taxes on \nthe uninsured will be paid by families earning less than $68,000 a \nyear.\n  If you do not have insurance, you will get taxed. If you have \ninsurance, you can get hit twice by new taxes in\n\n[[Page S12777]]\n\nthe Reid bill. First, new taxes on health care providers will be passed \non to consumers in the form of higher premiums. Second, if the \ngovernment bureaucrats decide your employer-sponsored insurance is too \ngenerous, you will get taxed for that too.\n  The Reid bill contains $150 billion in new taxes on employer-\nsponsored health benefits. These new taxes on benefits fall \ndisproportionately on middle-income Americans. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, 73 percent of those hit with new taxes on \nbenefits earn less than $200,000--73 percent. That is a whole bunch of \npeople down there in that category.\n  The Reid bill also contains new taxes on businesses that cannot \nafford to provide health insurance. Most employers do provide health \ninsurance to their employees, but there are some who simply cannot \nafford to and stay in business. Senator Reid's health care plan will \nmean they will have to pay $28 billion in new taxes. These are the same \nbusinesses that are barely making it. These are the same businesses \nthat are having to lay off workers to keep the company afloat, the same \nbusinesses that are cutting shifts to prevent further layoffs, and they \nare cutting wages to keep their employees on the payroll.\n  With our Nation's unemployment in double digits and millions more \nAmericans worried about keeping their jobs and paying their bills, it \nis unthinkable to me that any Member of this body would support new \ntaxes on businesses that are already struggling. These are the small \nbusinesses that absorb the extra employees that get laid off from the \nbig businesses--and hopefully it is the small businesses that become \nthe future big businesses.\n  In addition to the job-killing taxes, the Reid bill raises Medicare \npayroll taxes by $50 billion. These will fall disproportionately on \nsmall businesses. Approximately one-third of America's small businesses \nwill be hit with this tax increase. These are the same small businesses \nthat employ 30 million Americans.\n  I have to say, when you talk about taxing the rich, we are also \ntalking about taxing the owners of small business corporations, because \nthe money flows right through to them, even though they have to put \nmost of it back into the business in order to keep the business going.\n  Not only will small businesses see their taxes go up under the Reid \nbill, they will see their health insurance premiums go up as a result \nof new taxes on health care providers. Beginning in 2010--that is 3\\1/\n2\\ years before many of the health reforms go into effect--new fees \nwill be imposed on health insurance companies. That is right now, 3\\1/\n2\\ years before the reforms go into effect. The Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Joint Committee on Taxation have characterized these as \nexcise taxes. They have also testified that these fees will be passed \nthrough to consumers in the form of higher premiums.\n  If you need prescription drugs, you get taxed. Beginning in 2010, new \nfees will be imposed on prescription drug manufacturers. Similar to the \nhealth insurer fee, CBO and Joint Tax say it will be more expensive to \nbuy prescription drugs.\n  If you need a medical device, you get taxed. Medical device \nmanufacturers will be subject to a 2\\1/2\\-percent excise tax on sales. \nAgain, the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax have testified \nthat this tax will increase the cost of medical devices. Just like \nprescription drug costs and health insurance, this new tax on devices \nwill drive premiums up. If you have high out-of-pocket drug expenses, \nyou will get taxed. A family will no longer be able to deduct medical \nexpenses that exceed 7\\1/2\\ percent of their gross income as they can \nnow. Instead, they can only deduct expenses that exceed 10 percent. In \nplain English, this proposal limits the tax deductions a family can \ntake for medical expenses. For example, a family of four earning \n$57,000 in 2013 would lose a tax deduction of $1,425. A family of four \nearning $92,000 in 2013 would lose a tax deduction of $2,300.\n\n  Instead of working toward a bipartisan solution to our economic \nproblems, Senator Reid has brought a bill before us that spends $2.5 \ntrillion over 10 years, raises taxes on middle-class families and small \nbusinesses. I support health care form, and I will continue to work to \nenact real reforms that lower the cost of health care. I cannot, \nhowever, support higher taxes that further jeopardize our economic \nrecovery by punishing small businesses and raising health care costs \nfor working families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. How much time do I have allotted? I thought there was \nan agreement that I had a certain amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority side has 46 minutes 59 seconds, \nwith the 10-minute time limit therein.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield myself 10 minutes to speak on the Dorgan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is a \nstrong, good, talented legislator. He has a good amendment, one I have \nlooked at. It has been around for a long time. I have to rise in \nopposition to it.\n  I am ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and the Food and Drug Administration. \nThe FDA is in the purview of our subcommittee, so I work on the issues \nof the FDA. If I may brag, the University of Kansas is one of the best \npharmaceutical schools in the world and is often rated No. 1 as a \npharmacy school. For anybody interested in that field of study or work, \nit is a good place to go. They are very concerned about what is in the \nDorgan amendment.\n  The United States currently has one of the safest drug supply systems \nin the world that allows the Federal Food and Drug Administration to \nmonitor and regulate the manufacture and distribution of approved \nmedicines. The legal authority to import drugs already exists in this \ncountry. However, no HHS Secretary, Democrat or Republican, has been \nable to certify that the importation of prescription drugs from foreign \nnations is safe or will lead to cost savings. None have been able to.\n  The Dorgan amendment will allow for the importation of drugs from \noutside our current regulatory system, established and enforced by the \nFDA without certification from the Secretary of HHS or the Food and \nDrug Administration. Allowing drug importation from foreign nations \ncould threaten public health and result in unsafe, unapproved, and \ncounterfeit drugs being placed on pharmacy shelves in the United \nStates.\n  I want to develop that thought. The FDA has been tasked with the \nresponsibility of safeguarding this country's prescription drug supply \nand has executed that responsibility quite well. But as this country \nand the Food and Drug Administration struggle to prevent the growing \nthreat posed by imported, foreign-produced goods, as evidenced by \nrecent failures to detect polluted products such as infant formula, pet \nfood, and toothpaste, permitting the importation of drugs from foreign \nnations without the complete assurance from the FDA that it will not \njeopardize public safety is irresponsible and threatens this Nation's \nsafety and proven drug supply.\n  Toward that end, I ask unanimous consent that a letter that Senator \nCarper received from the Health and Human Services agency, the FDA \nDirector, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This letter states in particular:\n\n       We commend the sponsors for their efforts to include \n     numerous protective measures in the bill that address the \n     inherent risks of importing foreign products and other safety \n     products relating to the distribution system of drugs within \n     the U.S. However, as currently written, the resulting \n     structure would be logistically challenging to implement and \n     resource intensive. In addition, there are significant safety \n     concerns related to allowing the importation of non-\n     bioequivalent products, and safety issues related to \n     confusion in distribution and labeling of foreign products \n     and the domestic product that remain to be fully addressed in \n     the amendment.\n\n  In other words, they don't think we can do this--importation, \nreimportation of drugs--without significant safety problems.\n  There has been an explosion of illegal drug counterfeiting occurring \naround the world. Emergence of a multibillion-dollar international \nblack market has\n\n[[Page S12778]]\n\nproven to this Senate, current and past HHS Secretaries, and the FDA \nthat weakening our prescription drug regulatory framework would only \nincrease the risk of life-threatening counterfeit, contaminated, or \ndiluted prescription drugs entering our prescription drug supply that \nmillions of Americans rely on and trust. Prescription drug \ncounterfeiting has become a highly profitable criminal enterprise that \nhas been taken up by international organized crime syndicates, rogue \nnations such as North Korea, Syria and Iran, and developing nations \nsuch as China and Pakistan that seek to exploit ineffective or weak \ncounterfeit enforcement frameworks around the globe.\n  Criminals have realized that the production of counterfeit drugs is \ntwice as profitable as the trafficking of illegal narcotics and comes \nwith significantly less criminal penalties compared to those handed out \nfor illegal drugs.\n  Due to these limited and minimal criminal penalties, global \ncounterfeiting has grown into an epidemic that reaches every country \naround the world. The World Health Organization estimates that tens of \nthousands of people are dying due to counterfeit HIV, diabetes, and \ntropical disease medicines. Unfortunately, in most counterfeit cases, \nit is not what is included in these fake drugs, it is what has been \nexcluded that proves to be most harmful and deadly to patients. By \ntaking counterfeit, diluted, or completely ineffective drugs, many \npatients fail to receive the important lifesaving medicines they need. \nIt is just as dangerous for a person with high cholesterol to use a \ncounterfeit drug that lacks the prescribed medicine as it is for a \nperson to ingest a contaminated or even a poisonous pill. Due to this \nglobal counterfeit epidemic, two Secretaries of HHS, under both the \nClinton and Bush administrations, have been unable to certify that the \nimportation of prescription drugs will not pose a substantial risk to \nthe health and safety of citizens within the United States.\n  Current Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, from Kansas, has committed to \npreventing a drug importation system in the United States until it can \nbe proven that the safety standards of the imported drugs are ``at or \nabove American standards.'' The FDA doesn't believe they can get that \ndone at this time.\n  Many have argued that parallel trade in Europe has proven drug \nimportation across nations' borders has resulted in prescription cost \nsavings and has not increased risks to consumers or general public \nhealth. However, these cost and safety assertions do not correctly \nreflect the European experience with drug importation through what is \ncalled parallel trading.\n  A study by the London School of Economics on drug importation costs \nconcluded that savings from parallel imports benefit middlemen and \nthird-party vendors who buy and resell the imported drugs and do not \nget passed on to the patients in the form of lower prices. They say \nthis:\n\n       Although the overall number of parallel imports has \n     continued to increase, healthcare stakeholders are \n     realizing few of the expected savings . . . profits from \n     parallel imports accrue mostly to the benefit of the \n     third-party companies that buy and resell these medicines.\n\n  Furthermore, a report by the University of London School of Pharmacy \non the safety of the parallel prescription drug trade stated this:\n\n       The United Kingdom is the most vulnerable in Europe to \n     counterfeiting owing to the high level of ``parallel \n     importing.''\n\n  Due to parallel trade, the Medicines and Health Care Regulatory \nAgency in the UK has issued 10 different recalls of counterfeit drugs \nin the past 5 years. Drugs recalled include prescriptions to treat \nschizophrenia, blood pressure, and prostate cancer. The most disturbing \nfact of this counterfeit infiltration was that these drugs entered the \nUnited Kingdom through legitimate supply chains through parallel \ndistribution trade, according to the MHRA, the regulator agency in the \nUK.\n  In other studies, the European Commission found that the prescription \ndrug supply chain in Europe, which includes the former Eastern bloc \ncounties such as Latvia, Slovakia, and Bulgaria, is increasingly \ntargeted by international criminal counterfeiters.\n  The European Commission's Vice President, Gunter Verheugen, stated \nEuropean parallel trade ``[B]rings a considerable risk for the safety \nof the patients'' and that the increase in counterfeit medicines ``is a \nvery serious threat to public health and can cost lives.''\n  We don't want that happening to the United States, particularly with \nwhat we have seen in recent products coming in from China, not \nregulated under our system: things such as toothpaste, pet food, and \nthen the problems we have here. Do we want that to happen in the drug \nsystem? No, we don't. We can't certify that we can keep these products \nsafe.\n  As you can see, safety concerns and the lack of savings that may \nresult from exposing this country to the potential risk created by the \nimportation of drugs from outside our current safety system are real \nthreats.\n  It is kind of interesting. In October 2004, then-Governor Rod \nBlagojevich of Illinois launched the I-SaveRx Program to allow \nresidents in Illinois, and later Missouri, Vermont, Wisconsin, and \nKansas, to purchase low-cost drugs from Canada. However, by 2006, the \nIllinois State auditor found that the program cost nearly $1 million \nand was used by only about 3,700 people in Illinois and 267 residents \nof my State of Kansas.\n  Health and Human Services has concerns regarding the safety of \nimportation. The Food and Drug Administration has concerns regarding \nthe safety of importation. Given the opportunity to purchase Canadian \nprescription drugs, only 267 Kansans took that chance. We should not \nthrow out the safety of our drug supply chain without safety assurances \nfrom this country's regulatory bodies.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug \n           Administration,\n                               Silver Spring, MD December 8, 2009.\n     Hon. Tom Carper,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carper: Thank you for your letter requesting \n     our views on the amendment filed by Senator Dorgan to allow \n     for the importation of prescription drugs. The Administration \n     supports a program to allow Americans to buy safe and \n     effective drugs from other countries and included $5 million \n     in our FY 2010 budget request for the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA or the Agency) to begin working with \n     various stakeholders to develop policy options related to \n     drug importation.\n       Importing non-FDA approved prescription drugs presents four \n     potential risks to patients that must be addressed: (1) the \n     drug may not be safe and effective because it was not subject \n     to a rigorous regulatory review prior to approval; (2) the \n     drug may not be a consistently made, high quality product \n     because it was not manufactured in a facility that complies \n     with appropriate good manufacturing practices; (3) the drug \n     may not be substitutable with the FDA-approved product \n     because of differences in composition or manufacturing; and \n     (4) the drug may not be what it purports to be, because it \n     has been contaminated or is a counterfeit due to inadequate \n     safeguards in the supply chain.\n       In establishing an infrastructure for the importation of \n     prescription drugs, there are two critical challenges in \n     addressing these risks. First, FDA does not have clear \n     authority over foreign supply chains. One reason the U.S. \n     drug supply is one of the safest in the world is because it \n     is a closed system under which all the participants are \n     subject to FDA oversight and to strong penalties for failure \n     to comply with U.S. law. Second, FDA review of both the drugs \n     and the facilities would be very costly. FDA would have to \n     review data to determine whether or not the non-FDA approved \n     drug is safe, effective, and substitutable with the FDA-\n     approved version. In addition, the FDA would need to review \n     drug facilities to determine whether or not they manufacture \n     high quality products consistently.\n       The Dorgan importation amendment seeks to address these \n     risks. It would establish an infrastructure governing the \n     importation of qualifying drugs that are different from U.S. \n     label drugs, by registered importers and by individuals for \n     their personal use. The amendment also sets out registration \n     conditions for importers and exporters as well as inspection \n     requirements and other regulatory compliance activities, \n     among other provisions.\n       We commend the sponsors for their efforts to include \n     numerous protective measures in the bill that address the \n     inherent risks of importing foreign products and other safety \n     concerns relating to the distribution system for drugs within \n     the U.S. However, as currently written, the resulting \n     structure would be logistically challenging to implement and \n     resource intensive. In addition, there are significant safety \n     concerns related to allowing the importation of non-\n     bioequivalent products, and safety issues related to \n     confusion in distribution and labeling of foreign products \n     and the domestic product that remain to be fully addressed in \n     the amendment.\n\n[[Page S12779]]\n\n       We appreciate your strong leadership on this important \n     issue and would look forward to working with you as we \n     continue to explore policy options to develop an avenue for \n     the importation of safe and effective prescription drugs from \n     other countries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Margaret A. Hamburg,\n                                   Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is the 10th day in the debate on \nhealth care reform. I believe it is one of the most important issues we \nhave ever debated, certainly in my time on the floor of the Senate. \nThere have been a variety of amendments offered, and there has been a \nlot of work going on off the Senate floor. Before we could reach this \npoint and start this debate, committees held hearings that went on for \nweeks and months. They started with the base bill and entertained \nhundreds of amendments. The HELP Committee, as well as the Finance \nCommittee, devoted so much time to this.\n  The first time I can recall the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee Max Baucus coming to see me personally on this was over a \nyear ago. So over a year has gone into this effort to come to this \nmoment. I might add, the negotiations and efforts to improve the bill \nhave not stopped. As late as last night, a large group of members of \nthe Democratic caucus in the Senate were meeting to work out pretty \ncontentious issues relating to competition for private health insurance \ncompanies. They worked late into the night, night after night, and \nfinally came up with a consensus where differing points of view had to \nmake concessions and come up with the best way to move forward. That is \nwhat has gone into the base bill that is before us.\n  This is it, 2,074 pages put together through all of the work I have \njust described. I understand the responsibility of the minority party \nin the Senate is to disagree. But we hope they will do it in a \nconstructive fashion. In this situation, we have invited them in from \nthe beginning. In fact, in each of the committees, Republican Senators \nhave been active participants offering amendments, many of which were \nadopted.\n  Beyond that, there were meetings off the Senate floor. The Senator \nfrom Wyoming was a party to meetings that went on for, I am told, more \nthan 60 days in an effort to find a bipartisan middle ground. But the \nfact is, we come here today in the Senate debating this bill, and there \nare several realities. The first reality is, after the House of \nRepresentatives went through a similar exercise, only one Republican \nRepresentative, a Congressman from New Orleans, LA, voted for health \ncare reform, only one. In the Senate to date, only one Republican \nSenator, Senator Snowe of Maine, has voted for health care reform in \nthe Finance Committee. Not one single Republican Senator other than \nSenator Snowe has voted to move forward on health care reform.\n  There is a second reality. There is no Republican health care reform \nbill. None. They have a variety of different ideas, but each one is \ndiscrete and specific. They are not comprehensive. They don't really \naddress the issues this bill addresses. They have not presented a bill \nwhich makes health insurance premiums in America more affordable. This \nbill does.\n  Don't take a politician's word for it. The CBO looked at this bill \nand said it will bring down premiums for the vast majority of Americans \npaying for health insurance today, something we definitely need because \nwe are dealing with a situation where individuals, families, and \nbusinesses can no longer afford health insurance. There has not been a \nbill produced on the other side of the aisle which guarantees that 94 \npercent of Americans will have health insurance. This bill does. They \nhaven't produced that bill. When this bill is enacted into law, we will \nhave a larger percentage of our American citizens covered with health \ninsurance than ever in our history.\n  They have not produced a bill which changes the way health insurance \nis managed and its relationship with its customers across America. This \nbill does. There is a bill of rights in here that says: American \nconsumer, you have a right to have health insurance, even if you have a \npreexisting condition. You have a right to stand up to the health \ninsurance companies when they deny you coverage, saying: We only cover \nyou when you are well, not when you are sick. You have a right for your \nchildren to be covered under your family health insurance policy until \nthey reach the age of 27. These are rights which we guarantee in the \nbill and have not been brought to the floor by the Republican side \nbecause they do not have a health care reform bill.\n  Before us at this moment is a motion to commit by a friend of mine, \nSenator Crapo, who raises a question about will there be taxes. Will \npeople have to pay for what we are doing here? Well, I can tell you, we \nthink we have struck a good balance in terms of shared responsibility. \nFirst and foremost, understand this: If we dropped this debate, as most \nRepublicans would have us do at this moment, and walked away and said: \nWe are not going to do anything, each and every American will continue \nto pay over $1,000 a year in added premium costs to cover the cost of \nuncompensated care.\n  In my hometown of Springfield, IL, we have some wonderful hospitals. \nWhen poor people with no insurance show up, they are treated, they are \ncared for. That hospital, then--whether it is St. John's or Memorial--\nhas to pass along the cost of that health care to the other people who \nare paying for their care, which means each of us is paying $1,000 more \na year for our families in health insurance premiums to cover those \nuninsured. So that $1,000 tax is already there.\n  Let me tell you what this bill does. This bill says, if you are \nmaking less than $80,000 a year, we will help you pay your health \ninsurance premiums, give you tax breaks to pay those premiums. That \nmeans a lot of people who today cannot afford to pay for health \ninsurance premiums will be able to. They will go to this exchange. They \nwill be able to chose from health insurance options, and they will get \na helping hand to pay for health insurance.\n  We also have special provisions in here to take care of the smaller \nbusinesses. If you have fewer than 25 employees and have a small \nbusiness--and that represents a lot of businesses, mom-and-pop \nbusinesses, for example--we are going to give you a helping hand so you \ncan pay for the health insurance coverage for yourself, the owner of \nthe business, and the people who work for you.\n  What about those that are larger companies? Well, let's be honest \nabout it. We expect them to step up and accept this shared \nresponsibility. Most of these companies do not question whether they \nhave to pay into unemployment insurance or workers' compensation. That \nis part of the cost of doing business. We are saying that in this era \nof health care reform, with shared responsibility, businesses should \noffer good health insurance for their employees. In most instances, \nthey do, and they deserve our commendation for doing it.\n  But we also understand there are some that may not cover their \nemployees, may have waiting periods that are unreasonable. We start \nmoving our policy against that so people do have the peace of mind of \nknowing, when they go to work, they have good health insurance that is \ngoing to be there when they need it. It is a new look at it.\n  But we started with a real challenge. America is the only developed, \nindustrialized country in the world where a person can die for lack of \nhealth insurance. We are the only one. There is not another country \nwhere that happens.\n  We are also the only developed country in the world where a person \ncan be driven into bankruptcy because of medical bills. We kind of \naccept it. Well, so and so had an accident, went to the hospital, was \nthere for a month, and has a huge medical bill. They did not have any \nsavings or insurance, and it wiped them out. It wiped them out.\n  It does not happen in other countries. In developed countries, it \ndoes not happen because they take care of people, and they understand \nwhether they are using private health insurance or public health \ninsurance, there is a social obligation to make sure we all have the \npeace of mind of knowing that is not going to happen.\n  So we address this, and we help people pay for their premiums as \nwell. There is $441 billion in tax relief in this bill for families \nover the next 10 years to pay their health insurance premiums. That is \na tax break that will lead to more insurance coverage and more peace of \nmind. That is a reality. For the smaller businesses, with 25 and\n\n[[Page S12780]]\n\nfewer employees, there is a helping hand for them to cover their \nemployees as well.\n  We also provide some competition that in many places does not exist \ntoday. We provide that there is going to be health insurance options \nfor people. Too many small employers whom I have run into say: It is a \ntake it or leave it deal with our health insurance company. We will \nrenew last year's policy at a higher cost with less coverage, and you \nbetter take it because there is no place else to go. That is going to \nchange here. That is part of the change.\n  For all my Republican friends and colleagues who have come to the \nfloor over the last 10 days critical of this health care reform bill, I \nunderstand, that is part of Senate debate, that is part of what we are \nhere for. But make no mistake, these same Senate Republicans do not \nhave a health care reform bill. Most of the amendments that have been \noffered have been to protect health insurance companies, companies that \nare wildly profitable, companies that, frankly, dictate in this system \nhow much people are going to pay and whether they are going to have \ncoverage.\n  Dutifully, now, the Republican Senators have stepped up saying: We \nhave to protect these health insurance companies and their profits. I \ndo not think that is my responsibility. My responsibility is to almost \n13 million people in my State of Illinois and to the rest of the \nNation, to make sure they have the same peace of mind we all want--to \nknow they have quality, affordable health care, to extend the reach of \nhealth care and the peace of mind that comes with it to the largest \npercentage of Americans in history.\n  The last point I wish to make is one about the deficit. We hear a lot \nabout the deficit. This health care reform bill will cut more money \nfrom the deficit--$130 billion over the next 10 years--than any single \nbill ever considered on the floor of the Senate. Again, that is not my \nconclusion but the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office, which \nanalyzes these bills for Democrats and Republicans--a $130 billion \nreduction in the deficit over 10 years and, in the next 10 years, an \nadditional $650 billion. Because as we start to bend the curve to bring \ndown the increase in health care costs, it means we pay less for \nMedicare services, less for Medicaid services, less for many services \nthat are offered through government programs.\n  This bill is fiscally responsible. President Obama challenged us to \nmake it such, and we did it. There has not been a bill offered by the \nSenate Republicans which reduces the deficit--not anywhere near this \namount. No one has ever done it. It took a lot of hard work to reach \nthis point.\n  I would say the net result of the motion to commit by Senator Crapo \nis, unfortunately, to delay this debate even further, to stop the \nmomentum toward health care reform. I do not think that is what America \nwants or needs. This is a once-in-a-political-lifetime opportunity to \naddress an issue on the mind of every American and to do it in a fair \nand comprehensive way.\n  Certainly, this bill is not perfect. As hard as we tried, it never \nwill be. But to just continue to argue there are elements they want to \nquestion, without offering a comprehensive health care reform \nalternative, I do not believe is a fair debate. We have put the time \ninto this. I stand by it. I will be proud to support it. There are \nthings in it I do not agree with; most things I do. But the fact is, it \nis the right thing for us to do at this moment in history. We cannot \nmiss this opportunity. I encourage my colleagues to oppose the Crapo \nmotion to commit.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Twenty-four minutes 40 seconds \nfor the Democrats.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how long have I spoken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand in support of the amendment that \nis being offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. Senator \nDorgan has talked about drug reimportation, and he has raised an issue \nwhich troubles me. Why is it that pharmaceutical companies in America \ncharge Americans more for their product than they charge customers in \nother countries buying exactly the same product? Senator Dorgan had a \nhearing once, and the response was obvious. The pharmaceutical \ncompanies say: We charge Americans more because we can.\n  In all those other countries, such as Canada, when they try to sell \ndrugs to Canadians, the Canadian Government steps in and says: You are \nentitled to a profit, but don't go overboard. We will allow you to \nincrease your profits only so much each year.\n  In the United States, there is no such mechanism and no such effort. \nSo we continue as a nation to pay premium prices for drugs that are \nexactly the same drugs that are sold at a fraction of the cost around \nthe world.\n  The AARP, which is the largest organization of seniors in America, \ndid a study of drug prices published in April. It showed that the price \nof the most commonly used drugs has risen faster than general inflation \nevery year since 2004. This year, drug prices are going to go up \nanother 9 percent, for example.\n  So a lot of Americans are saying: If I can buy the same drug in \nMexico or Canada at a lower price, why wouldn't I be allowed to do \nthat? Why would you stop me under the law? Well, I do not think we \nshould. I think we ought to give people that opportunity.\n  What Senator Dorgan has done is to build in his amendment safety \nfeatures so we know we are not dealing with counterfeit drugs and we \nknow there is accountability as to the source and the purity and the \neffectiveness of the drugs that are bought.\n  This amendment creates a role for the Federal Government in providing \noversight, with the goal of ensuring that Americans have access to \nlower prices and the peace of mind of knowing their drugs are safe.\n  The bill allows pharmacies and drug wholesalers licensed in the \nUnited States to import FDA-approved medications from Canada, Europe, \nAustralia, New Zealand and Japan and pass along the savings to their \nAmerican customers. What does it mean? A 35- to 55-percent lower cost \nfor some of the most widely used drugs in America.\n  This approach will reduce costs when people need it, particularly \nsick people who are dependent on drugs to stay healthy or to avoid even \nfurther illness.\n  The CBO estimates that the new policy will result in Federal savings \nof $19.4 billion over 10 years. I will tell you why I think this is \ncritically important. There are a lot of drugs and drug companies that \nare doing very well. They are very profitable, and they are based in \nthe United States. I think it is unfair they are charging the people of \ntheir own country higher prices than they are charging people in other \ncountries around the world.\n  This reimportation is an effort to try to help bring down some of \nthese drug prices. These companies, incidentally, say: Well, we need \nthe money because we need to do research for new drugs. Well, certainly \nthey need to do research for new drugs. But maybe they can stop and \nexplain to me or to someone why they spend more money on advertising \nthan they do on research. You have seen the ads on television, heard \nthem on the radio, and seen them in magazines. They spend a fortune \nadvertising, trying to lure people into using the highest priced drugs \nin America.\n  These pharmaceutical companies are doing very well. Their profits are \nsky-high, sometimes the highest in America. I think it is fair in this \nbill, as we try to bring down the cost of health care, that we also \nbring down the cost of these drugs by allowing the importation, with \nstrict safety standards, of these drug into the United States.\n  I support the Dorgan amendment and look forward to making more \naffordable prescription drugs available across the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Before I begin my remarks, I would like to yield a couple minutes to \nmy friend and colleague from Oklahoma who would like to respond to the \nquestion that has been raised as to whether\n\n[[Page S12781]]\n\nthe Republicans are presenting reliable, meaningful, and comprehensive \nalternatives.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, the majority whip realizes there is an alternative \nbill. As a matter of fact, there are four alternative bills out there. \nThey were not given a hearing. They did not have the resources. They \ndid not have the CBO that would score them.\n  We have a bill that guarantees if you like what you have now, you can \nkeep it; has absolutely zero tax increases on American families; no \nincreases in taxes on American business; lowers the cost of everybody's \nhealth insurance premiums; covers preexisting conditions, period; \nprotects seniors' high-quality care and choices; increases personal \ncontrol over your own health care; no Medicaid expansion, but, in fact, \nputs Medicaid patients into true coverage without discrimination and \nallows all the doctors in this country to see them. It protects the \nphysician-patient relationship and empowers patients, families, and \nphysicians and providers. It does not empower the government. The \nmajority whip knows that. Yet we have just heard on the floor we have \nnot offered anything.\n  We have offered a bill that outside evaluators say saves the States \nat least $1 trillion in the first 10 years, saves the Federal \nGovernment $70 billion, treats everybody the same, creates access to \nhealth care, and, more importantly, it incentivizes prevention and the \nmanagement of chronic disease and, finally, it attacks some of the $100 \nbillion a year in fraud in Medicare and Medicaid, where this bill \nattacks less than $400 million a year in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  I yield back to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank my friend from Oklahoma because it is frustrating \nsometimes to have it continuously said that there are no alternatives \nbeing put forward when we have for years promoted major and \ncomprehensive alternatives to the kinds of issues Americans are asking \nus to address today.\n  What is it that Americans are asking? I have said this many times on \nthe floor. Americans are asking us to find a pathway to lower health \ncare premiums and costs and to increase access to better quality health \ncare. Yet what is it that we are being faced with in this legislation? \nThis bill drives up the cost of health care, not down, contrary to \nclaims that have been made on the floor repeatedly; raises taxes by \nhundreds of billions of dollars; cuts Medicare by hundreds of billions \nof dollars; grows the government by $2.5 trillion; forces the needy \nuninsured--it doesn't give them a pathway toward subsidized insurance \nor any access to insurance but instead forces them into a failing \nMedicaid Program; imposes damaging unfunded mandates on the struggling \nStates; leaves millions of Americans still uninsured; and establishes \nmassive government controls over our health care economy. And we wonder \nwhy we cannot get engaged in a meaningful bipartisan solution here with \nthis kind of heavy-handed approach being insisted upon.\n  When I talk about the fact that it raises the costs or the size of \ngovernment, often the response is: No, this bill doesn't raise the size \nof government, it doesn't increase the size of government, it is \nbalanced. Actually, CBO has issued a report that says it reduces the \ndeficit. Well, the fact is it grows the size of government over a true \n10-year period by $2.5 trillion. It does provide some increased taxes--\na lot--and it does cut Medicare. By doing so, it does reach an \nequilibrium, according to CBO, with regard to its impact on the \ndeficit. But let's not mistake this deficit with the size of the \ngovernment. This bill will grow the size of the government and the \nreach of the government by $2.5 trillion.\n  With regard to the question as to whether it truly impacts the \ndeficit, I think most Americans have already heard that there are some \nbudget gimmicks here. You could not ever claim this bill doesn't \nincrease the deficit unless you had all the taxes I am going to talk \nabout in a minute and unless you had all of the Medicare cuts we have \nbeen talking about for the last week, and unless you had the budget \ngimmicks that are in the bill. The budget gimmicks are clearly depicted \nright here.\n  Look at the first 4 years of this bill on the spending side: very \nlittle, if any, spending. The actual implementation of the spending \npart of the bill doesn't happen until 2014, but all the taxes start in \nthe first year, and all the Medicare cuts come into place in the first \nyear, and we start seeing the offset side of the bill run for a full 10 \nyears. It is going to be easy to say you have balanced out spending and \ntaxing if you don't count the spending for the first 4 years. But if \nyou look at that first true 10-year period of time, it is a growth of \nthe government by $2.5 trillion.\n  What I am here today to talk about is my motion that is on the floor \nto do one very simple thing: to commit this bill back to the Finance \nCommittee and have the Finance Committee make the bill comply with the \nPresident's pledge to the American people about taxes. And what was his \npledge, repeated many times across this country? In the President's own \nwords:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase . . . not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes . . . you will not see any of your \n     taxes increase one single dime.\n\n  That was the rhetoric. That was the pledge. What is the reality of \nthe bill? In its first 10 years, the bill raises taxes by $495 billion. \nIf you take that 10-year window that starts in 2014 where you are \ncomparing spending and taxing at the same time, the total of taxes in \nthat 10-year window is $1.2 trillion of new taxes, a huge proportion of \nwhich falls squarely on the backs of the middle class whom President \nObama has defined here to be those earning less than $250,000, and that \nis per family. He said under $200,000 per individual.\n  What are some of these taxes we are talking about? First, there is \nthe excise tax on high-cost premium plans. One might say, wait a \nminute, that is a tax on companies, employers who provide very high \nquality insurance to their employees. It is an ingenious way--it is \ntechnically written that way--but it is an ingenious way to actually \nincrease the cost, the tax base, of the workers and not the employer. \nLet's see the first chart. The way this works is the government will \nnow say to an employer: You cannot provide health insurance to your \nemployees that is worth more than a certain amount. Most employees who \nget health insurance--and that is most employees in the country who get \nhealth insurance from their employer--get wages and health care as a \npart of their total employment package.\n  I picked an example of a woman who receives $50,000 in wages and \nlet's assume a $10,000 employer-provided health care benefit. The \ngovernment is now going to say wait a minute, to her employer; we are \ngoing to tax you if you provide that health care benefit on such a \nrobust level. CBO and Joint Tax have told us that the reaction of the \nvast majority of all employers is going to be to reduce the health care \nbenefit down below the level that gets taxed. They are not going to \nreduce the employee's overall benefit, however, their overall \nemployment package. So let's pick a number. Let's say they reduce this \n$10,000 down to $7,000. They will increase the wages by $3,000 and the \nemployee's total compensation package stays the same: $60,000, with one \ndifference. Now that extra $3,000 is wages instead of health care, and \nit gets taxed. And that way the individuals in this country see their \nhealth care values go down. Their total compensation package stays the \nsame, but then gets also reduced as it is taxed, and our Joint Tax \nCommittee and CBO have told us that 84 percent of this $149 billion new \ntax is going to be borne by those with incomes under $200,000.\n  That is one way this bill ingeniously gets at the pocketbook of those \nmaking less money than the $200,000 or $250,000 as a family that the \nPresident talks about.\n  What is the next way? Medical deductions. I think everybody in \nAmerica who itemizes deductions knows about the first line that says \nyou can itemize your medical expenses, and to the extent they exceed \n7.5 percent, you can deduct those medical expenses. So people who have \na large proportion of their income represented by medical costs get a \nbreak in the Tax Code for that deduction. Well, that break is now going \nto be smaller under this bill because the level of where you are able \nto\n\n[[Page S12782]]\n\nget it is no longer going to be 7.5 percent, it will be 10 percent. And \nas I indicated, that 84 percent of the excise tax is going to fall on \npeople making less than $200,000 a year. Ninety-nine percent of the \nmedical deduction restriction will fall on people making less than \n$200,000 a year; as a matter of fact, making a lot less than $200,000 \nper year.\n  Then what about the next one? The next major tax in the bill is the \nMedicare payroll tax. This one has been presented to the American \npublic as a tax on rich people. It starts out primarily impacting \npeople at the higher levels, but at the outset, it will already hit \n345,000 Americans, and it is not adjusted--I think most people \nunderstand how the alternative minimum tax works today. It is not \nadjusted for inflation properly. So over time, the payroll tax itself \nis going to increasingly hit more and more people in that income \ncategory under $200,000.\n  There has been some analysis on these three provisions in the bill. \nJoint Tax has indicated that by the year 2019, at least--and I say at \nleast because we are only talking about three provisions in this bill \nright now, and there are more--73 million American households--not \nindividuals, households--73 million American households earning below \n$200,000 that are going to face a tax increase.\n  Some have responded to this by saying, Wait a minute. Our bill \nactually cuts taxes and you are not characterizing this fairly. The tax \ncuts they are talking about are primarily a $394 billion government \nsubsidy for purchase of health insurance, a subsidy that will be \nadministered through the Tax Code. What they don't tell you is that \n$288,000 of this so-called tax cut is nothing other than a direct \ngovernment payment to those who don't pay any taxes today anyway. It is \nnot reducing their tax liability; they have no tax liability. It is a \ndirect government subsidy, and CBO says so. It is scored by CBO not as \ntax relief; it is scored by CBO as direct government spending. To \ncharacterize that as tax relief I believe is inaccurate.\n\n  Moreover, even if it were true tax relief, is that what the President \nwas saying, that I won't raise your taxes more than I will lower \nsomeone else's or was he saying to the American people that he would \nnot raise taxes on people who are making less than $200,000 a year, or \n$250,000 as a family? I believe it is inherently obvious what the \nPresident was saying. And to say now that we are cutting somebody \nelse's taxes so we can raise yours does not comply with the President's \npledge.\n  To give another couple of perspectives on this in terms of numbers, \nwhen all is said and done, 7 percent of Americans will get this so-\ncalled tax relief that is, in reality, direct Federal spending, and the \nrest of Americans--specifically, those who don't fall in that \ncategory--will get the tax increases. Out of 282 million Americans with \nsome kind of health insurance today, only 19 million of them will be \nhelped by this subsidy. The rest are going to fall into that category \nof those who get to share in the burden by seeing their taxes increase.\n  But let's say we give credit for all of these arguments and say, All \nright, we will let you claim that all of this spending is tax relief. \nWhat is the true story then? Even if you give that argument, which is \nnot valid, by 2019, there will still be at least 42 million American \nhouseholds earning below $200,000 that will face a tax increase. This \nis information from the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  In fact, the data there is rather interesting. Joint Tax data \nindicates that by 2019, individuals earning between $50,000 and \n$200,000 on average will see an increase in their taxes of $593. \nFamilies earning between $75,000 and $200,000 will see on average a net \ntax increase of $670.\n  So what does my amendment do? My amendment says very simply that the \nbill will be committed back to the Finance Committee and that the \nprovisions in the bill that violate the President's pledge should be \nremoved. Simply make the bill comply with the President's pledge. The \nPresident, frankly, shouldn't sign this bill unless this amendment is \npassed and implemented, because that is the direction we need to go.\n  Once again, the President's pledge is that no family making less than \n$250,000 is going to see their taxes increased.\n  There is further information available about this, though. I recently \nsent a letter to the Joint Tax Committee. I recently sent a letter to \nthe Joint Tax Committee asking them about whether there were other \nprovisions in the bill other than these three--the reason I talked \nabout these three taxes is because those three taxes have been analyzed \nby Joint Tax and it is Joint Tax that is telling us what they are going \nto do.\n  In response to my letter saying are there more taxes in the bill than \nthose you have analyzed, the answer has come back, yes, and below, they \nsay, is a list of the provisions that they have not previously \ndistributed and that have statutory incidence on individuals with those \nwho fall below the income threshold which has been defined already. \nWhat are these taxes? There is a confirmed definition of medical \nexpenses for health savings accounts. In other words, the reduction of \nbenefits in health savings accounts will have an impact, and I believe \nthat impact is about $1.5 billion.\n  The increased penalty for nonqualified health savings account \ndistributions and limitations on flexible spending arrangements will \nraise almost $15 billion. Most of this--although we don't have the data \nyet from Joint Tax--most of this comes from families below the income \ntax threshold, as well as the 5 percent excise tax on cosmetic surgery \nand similar procedures and the individual mandate in the bill that will \nforce all Americans to purchase insurance or the IRS will come and \ncollect a fee from them.\n  I don't have the chart here that shows what will happen with the IRS, \nbut think for a minute. The current size of the IRS is about $12 \nbillion in terms of the appropriations we give them to perform their \nfunctions. CBO says that if this bill passes, there will be so much \nadditional business for the IRS in monitoring health care and the new \nplans and programs in the bill, there will have to be at least another \n$5 billion and maybe a $10 billion increase in the size of the IRS just \nso it can implement its enforcement responsibilities under this bill.\n  The bottom line is that the President of the United States, Barack \nObama, has made a pledge. It was that pledge, among a number of \nothers--such as ``if you like what you have, you can keep it''--that \ncaused us to see a strong low-confidence level by the American people, \nand maybe it is time for Congress to truly dig in and build a strong \nhealth care reform package. That pledge is being squarely broken by \nthis bill.\n  Again, all we are asking in this amendment is to send the bill back \nto the Finance Committee and have the Finance Committee make the bill \nconform to the President's pledge. What that will mean to the American \npeople is that in the first 10 years of the bill, just under $500 \nbillion of new taxes will not be imposed, and over the true first 10-\nyear period, when the spending starts kicking in, $1.2 trillion worth \nof taxes will not be imposed.\n  There are many other issues with this bill that we have seen \ndiscussed. There is the question of whether it truly increases the cost \nof premiums in health care. Virtually 10 out of 11 studies say that it \ndoes. The CBO report says that, clearly, for 30 percent of Americans, \nit does it in major ways, and for the other 60 percent, the impact is \nmarginal, or the status quo.\n  As we move forward, some of these big problems with the bill need to \nbe fixed. My motion focuses on taxes. We have debated Medicare for some \ntime now. We need to talk about the unfunded mandates on the States. We \nneed to talk about the impact on premiums in health care because we \ndon't want to be passing legislation that drives up the cost of health \ncare at a time when that is the primary purpose for people calling for \nhealth care reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to let us step down for a moment from the \nintensity of the debate, commit this bill to the Finance Committee, and \nlet's, on a bipartisan basis, work out some of the solutions to these \nproblems and do so in a way that does not result in such a massive \ngrowth of our Federal Government, such a massive increase in taxes, \nsuch a massive unfunded deficit on the\n\n[[Page S12783]]\n\nStates, and all for no control of cost or health care premiums.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of the time I requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, here we go again. We keep hearing it, and \nthe other side keeps using scare tactics. All those Democrats say is \ntax, tax, tax. Scare tactics. They think they can scare people into \nbelieving something that is not true. The fact is, not only does this \nbill not raise taxes on the middle class, this bill is a tax cut for \nAmericans.\n  Look at the chart behind me, which shows that. This is individual \ntaxes. We are talking about taxes on individuals in America. This chart \nshows that in the year 2015, there will be a net tax cut for Americans \nof $26.8 billion--a tax cut. The other side says some of those folks \nare not paying taxes. That is true. It is a refundable tax credit of \nabout $27 billion. In 2017, it is a net tax cut of $40 billion. In \n2019, it is a net tax cut of almost $41 billion.\n  Nobody can read the small print on the chart, so I will read it:\n\n       Combined effects of the high-premium excise tax, health \n     care affordability tax credits, increase in HI tax, increase \n     in HI floor for medical expense deductions.\n\n  It is the basic provisions.\n  It is very important to point out that this is a net tax cut for most \nAmericans. For some, there is a tax increase. But guess what. According \nto CBO, that is because those folks will make more money. Their wages \nand salaries will go up.\n  I don't see a chart-meister behind me to change the charts, but the \nchart shows almost for every year about a 10-percent increase in taxes \nfor upper income areas and about an 80-percent increase in wages or \nincome. That is basically because, according to the CBO, the high-\npremium excise tax will result. People will be paying lower premiums, 7 \nto 12 percent lower premiums as a consequence of the Cadillac tax \nprovision. CBO says that; it is not my prediction. That will be passed \non in the form of higher wages and higher income to people. People will \nbe paying higher taxes, but they will be making more money.\n  Let's make it clear. This bill lowers taxes. At least that is what \nCBO says. It is one thing to make an allegation that it increases \ntaxes, but CBO says there is a net tax cut, which I mentioned.\n  Turning to another subject--small business--one of the goals of \nhealth care reform, clearly, is to ensure employees and small \nbusinesses have access to quality, affordable health care options. \nSmall businesses have a tough time providing health insurance, that is \ntrue. Last year, only 62 percent of small businesses offered health \ninsurance to their employees. Compare that with about 99 percent of \ncompanies with 200 or more employees. Big businesses offer health \ninsurance, but small businesses just can't do it. They have a hard \ntime. Among the very small businesses, fewer than half offered their \nemployees health insurance.\n  Small businesses say the main reason they cannot provide health \ninsurance is because premiums are so high. That is probably true; it is \nexpensive. I have talked to many small businesspeople, and I am quite \ncertain the Senator from Vermont, who is in the chair, has run across \nthe same comments from businesses. It is just too expensive.\n  In the past 10 years, premiums have risen 82 percent for single \nworkers and 93 percent for families employed by small businesses. As \nhealth care costs rise, small businesses are forced to make workers pay \na greater portion of these expensive premiums. Last year, employees in \nsmall businesses that provided health insurance paid more than twice \nwhat they paid in 1999. So in a period of 8 years, the amount employees \npaid more than doubled.\n  The low rate offering and higher cost-sharing responsibilities for \nemployees and small businesses often limit the ability of small \nbusinesses to attract and retain good employees.\n  That is why the health care bill before us today includes provisions \nto make quality coverage more affordable for small businesses and their \nemployees. The bill includes $24 billion in tax credits to help small \nbusinesses and charitable organizations purchase health insurance for \ntheir employees--$24 billion.\n  Starting in a couple of years, eligible small businesses would \nreceive tax credits worth up to 35 percent of the employer's \ncontribution to employee health insurance plans. Then in 2014, eligible \nsmall businesses will receive tax credits worth up to 50 percent of the \nemployer's contribution to employee health insurance plans purchased in \nhealth insurance exchanges. That is half of the cost to the employer. \nAn employer could take half of that cost as a tax credit against that \ncompany's income.\n  To qualify for the tax credits, businesses would have to cover at \nleast half of their employee premium costs. The value of the tax credit \nis based on the size of the business and the average wage of its \nemployees.\n  The small business tax credit will help make health insurance more \naffordable for many small businesses. That is clear. In 2011, 4.2 \nmillion Americans will be covered by quality, affordable health \ninsurance because of this credit. On average, small businesses across \nthe country will receive a new tax credit of around $5,000 to help them \npurchase insurance. The CBO has estimated that the small business \ncredit will help lower insurance costs by 8 to 11 percent for employees \nat small businesses who receive that credit. CBO says, again, that \nsmall business credit will help lower insurance costs by 8 to 11 \npercent for employees of small businesses who receive the credit.\n  One of the reasons many small businesses are currently unable to \nafford health insurance is because they lack the buying power larger \ncompanies have to negotiate group rates. Our bill creates small \nbusiness insurance exchanges, known as shop exchanges, where small \nbusinesses can join together and pool their risks. That will enhance \ntheir choice and buying power. These State-based exchanges will be a \ncritical tool to help small businesses with fewer than 100 employees \nshop for health insurance plans and determine their eligibility for tax \ncredits to buy health insurance. Small businesses that prosper and grow \nbeyond 100 employees will be allowed to continue shopping in the \nexchanges.\n  The insurance plans sold in these exchanges will be subject to the \nsame transparency requirements and consumer protections, so small \nbusinesses can feel confident they are purchasing high-quality plans \nthat will provide quality, affordable coverage for their workers.\n  One more point. We all talk to small businesspeople. Time and time \nagain, they say they like to provide health insurance. But what \nhappens? The insurance company comes along and says: Next year, we are \ngoing to raise your premiums 20, 30, 40 percent. Why? The answer is \nthat we found out one of your employees has a preexisting condition, so \nwe are going to raise your premiums by that much. It puts small \nbusinessmen in a terrible dilemma: they either have to fire that \nemployee to get the lower increase in premiums or eat that big increase \nand keep that employee.\n  I remember a businessman in Billings, a small contractor, whose heart \nsank when he got that notice from the insurance company. He decided to \nkeep the valuable employee, who had worked for him for a good period of \ntime. He will not fire that employee. He shopped around and finally \nfound another insurance company, and the increase was not 30 percent, \nit was more in the nature of 20 percent.\n  Small businesspeople face this great variety of premiums. They go up \nthis much and that much. It is because of the terrible situation we \nhave where companies can deny coverage based on preexisting conditions, \nhealth care status, and so forth. Different States have different \nrating rules and so on. This will help small businesses get more \nstability and quality.\n  The insurance plans sold will be subject to the same transparency \nrequirements and consumer protection that other individuals will also \nfind available.\n  The health care reform bill before us also institutes reforms of the \ninsurance market that will protect individuals and small businesses \npurchasing plans. I already mentioned that. These reforms will stop \ninsurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting \nconditions.\n  Passing health care reform is critical to small businesses. Without \nreform, many small businesses will be forced to drop their health care \ninsurance coverage because they will no longer be\n\n[[Page S12784]]\n\nable to afford the increasing premiums. That would leave employees to \nfend for themselves in the individual market.\n  The CBO tells us these reforms will make coverage more affordable for \nmillions of small business employees. The small business tax credit \nwill help reduce health care costs for small businesses and their \nemployees. As a result of the larger health reform proposals in this \nbill, there will be an increase in the percentage of small firms that \noffer health insurance coverage.\n  I ask unanimous consent to extend the period for debate only until \n4:30, with the time equally divided, with Senators permitted to speak \ntherein for up to 10 minutes each, with no amendments in order during \nthat time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today the Senate is addressing the future \nof health care in our Nation--both Americans' access to care and its \ncost. As we confront projections of escalating health spending--\nexceeding $33 trillion in the coming decade--the imperative is clear \nthat we must address rising costs, or affordable access to coverage \nsimply cannot be achieved and sustained.\n  That is why I am joining Senator Dorgan, who has been a relentless \nchampion on the issue of drug reimportation, in proposing the amendment \nto this legislation, so that Americans can safely and affordably access \nthe medications which they rely upon to improve their health and which \nthe industry has reminded us time and again are critical to reducing \nsevere illness and hospitalization and, of course, extending life.\n  Senator Dorgan has long been the Senate's tireless leader. In fact, \nit has been more than a decade, as I recall, that he began to pursue \nthis endeavor and this journey in seeking to end the inequity which \nresulted when Americans were barred from importing less expensive \nmedications. He has reminded us regularly of the trade inequity which \nhas been imposed on consumers. He also has reminded his colleagues that \ndrug importation, conducted with proper safety measures, provides a \nroute to improving access to lifesaving medications.\n  I am pleased to have joined him in this effort, once again, along \nwith Senator McCain, who has been a stalwart on this issue from the \nvery outset and a tremendous advocate and a driving force. Of course, \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, \nthroughout his career has been pursuing and advocating this inequity to \nbe remedied once and for all.\n  We introduced this legislation back in 2003 for the very first time. \nWe worked on a comprehensive approach required to address the safe, \neconomical importation of medications. I well recall the efforts--the \nyeoman efforts--of the late Senator Kennedy who worked relentlessly to \nremedy this flaw in our policy, along with Senator Grassley, Senator \nStabenow, and Senator Vitter, whose bipartisanship on this vital \nquestion has also been instrumental as we advanced this cause for the \nbetter part of a decade. It has been a greater undertaking than I think \nmany would have surmised or anticipated, frankly.\n  There can be little doubt that the effort to reduce health costs \nposes one of the greatest challenges in health care reform. That is why \nthe Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Baucus, \nhas worked mightily to incorporate provisions in the pending \nlegislation to ``bend the cost curve.'' Let there be no mistake, the \nresistance to reforming spending has been immense. That is in part \nbecause, as so often has been said: ``One man's waste is another man's \nprofit.'' So while other nations pay 35 to 55 percent less for their \nprescription drugs than the United States, we have continued to pay the \nworld's highest prices for brand drugs for the past decade, despite \nnearly 10 years of effort to provide for the safe importation of \nprescription drugs.\n  Fortunately, that has not deterred a broad bipartisan call to arms on \nthis issue, despite the industry's actions that have blocked attempt \nafter attempt to provide Americans both access and assurances that \nimported drugs would be safe. Indeed, this issue of both safety and \naffordability has drawn a bipartisan coalition which has been a model \nfor how we can work together to address this health care problem.\n  We created legislation which the Congressional Budget Office \npreviously estimated would save our Nation approximately $50 billion \nover 10 years. The CBO has not yet estimated the total savings to \nconsumers but has projected a savings to the Federal Government alone \nof $19.4 billion. Since Federal savings was about 20 percent of total \nsavings in the past, one can hypothesize dramatically increased \nconsumer savings likely approaching $80 billion. These are exactly, \nprecisely the kinds of savings we must advance today.\n  One can easily see that the failure to act on this legislation since \nits introduction in April 2004 has needlessly carried a high cost for \nthe American people, made all the more egregious and unacceptable given \nthese difficult economic times, as more Americans are reducing or \nskipping doses or forgoing medication altogether. And this problem is \nnot going to get better. It is regrettably only going to get worse.\n  The trend is undeniable and unabated. We are all painfully aware of \nthe price increases in brand-name prescription drugs this year that \nbear absolutely no relationship whatsoever to our overall economy. \nManufacturers have increased prices of brand drugs by an average of 9 \npercent, just as inflation measured by the CPI actually fell by nearly \n1 percent.\n  We can look at this chart and demonstrate the contrast in increases. \nBrand drugs increasing 9 percent, and here are generics and here is the \nCPI. It truly is emblematic and reflective on this chart how actually \nprices have been decreased by the same amount that brand drug prices \nhave escalated.\n  In other words, just as we are working to expand coverage to tens of \nmillions of more Americans, we have the industry establishing a new \npricing baseline that is entirely off kilter with the rest of the \neconomy, in comparison between the CPI and the cost of brand-name \ndrugs. It is widely unaffordable for the American people and clearly \nunsustainable for the future. How can we possibly not act on this \namendment?\n  This is an industry that has offered $80 billion in concessions \ntoward health care reform--approximately $8 billion over the next 10 \nyears. When one considers that our annual spending, while this single \nprice increase of 9 percent imposed over $290 billion in drug spending, \nwith over two-thirds of that amount representing brand drugs, it is \nclear that this single price increase alone at this 9 percent will \nyield at least twice as much as the industry has pledged to reform in \nthe pending health care reform legislation.\n  Frankly, that is cost shifting of the worst kind because it occurs on \nthe back of the American taxpayer, most especially on those in greatest \nneed who are also the least able to afford these exorbitant prices. \nThere should be no mistake, these most recent increases are following \nthe patterns we have witnessed year after year.\n  How do we know? Following passage of the Medicare Modernization Act, \nSenator Wyden and I requested that the GAO track drug price trends, \nincluding looking back to before the bill was enacted.\n  What did we find? First, that the price of brand drugs has escalated \ntwo to three times the rate of inflation. That means $100 in drug costs \nin 2004 has grown to more than $140 today.\n  Tell me whose income has increased by that amount in the last 5 years \nalone. These unabated, escalating costs for drugs are only widening the \nalready yawning gulf of unaffordability for the American people.\n  But that is not all. When Senator Wyden and I examined the GAO data, \nwe also discovered that as we neared the achievement of a prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare, the rate of price increases actually rose \nfaster. History also appears to be repeating itself once again to the \neverlasting detriment of all those whose health security depends on \nmedications.\n  One year ago, the Associated Press reported a startling find that for \nthe\n\n[[Page S12785]]\n\nfirst time in a decade, prescription drug use was down. Given the \nrising costs imposed on struggling American families, that should come \nas no surprise.\n  It also should serve as a wake-up call, an alarm bell. We are long \npast the point where we should heed Einstein's timeless truism that one \nshould not keep doing the same thing over and over and expect a new \nresult. The fact is, we simply cannot assume pledges of savings in the \nform of the industry's monetary concessions to health reform actually \namount to real, fundamental reforms or that drug assistance programs \nare a substitute for a market which brings consumers better value. They \nare not.\n  It is clear that the time for enactment of this legislation is long \noverdue and, frankly, more urgent than ever, as illustrated by this \nsecond chart of unfilled prescription drugs. Just looking at it, you \ncan see how the unmet need for medications has actually increased since \n2003. Among working age adults, only those with Medicare coverage \nexperienced any improvement in their ability to fill their \nprescriptions. All others saw a rise in their inability to obtain the \nnecessary medications.\n  Among the uninsured, more than one in three individuals went without \na required prescription. And in those with chronic diseases, that \nnumber doubles. This is a travesty. Indisputably, despite manufacturer \nassistance programs, despite the increased use of generics, the high \nand escalating cost of brand-name drugs is directly and negatively \naffecting the health of millions.\n\n  That is why our voices today echo those of an overwhelming 7 out of \n10 Americans who have called for lifting the ban on prescription drug \nimportation. Let there be no doubt, this is a mandate for action. The \nPresident has added his voice to ours, calling for safe drug \nimportation as one means to address health care costs which threaten \nthe health of Americans in perilous economic times.\n  The bottom line is, when nations institute safe, regulated trade in \npharmaceuticals, they achieve results, as Sweden did when it entered \nthe European system of trade and saw a reduction of 12 to 19 percent in \nthe price of traded drugs.\n  Opponents claim importation will cause American consumers harm. For \nthose who did express concern about safety, no one shares that \nsentiment more than I do. So let me be unequivocal in stating that \nsafety is the foundation of this legislation.\n  Our constituents have taken action repeatedly to purchase drugs which \nthey could afford mostly in Canada. That is certainly true in my State \nof Maine. It is true in the State of Vermont, the Presiding Officer's \nState. It has been demonstrated time and again that importation is \nsafe. We can ensure Americans safe access to imports. In Europe, over \n30 years of parallel trading of pharmaceuticals has demonstrated \nindisputable safety. In fact, a former Pfizer executive, Dr. Peter \nRost, has stated from his firsthand experience in Europe:\n\n       I think it is outright derogatory to claim that Americans \n     would not be able to handle reimportation of drugs, when the \n     rest of the world can do this.\n\n  Yet some will point to a recent FDA letter cautioning that drugs must \nbe demonstrated to be safe and effective, that they must be \nmanufactured under the highest standards, that an imported drug must be \ndemonstrated equivalent to existing products used domestically, and \nthat we must guard against contaminated and counterfeit drugs. This \namendment does each of these things and much more to ensure that \nAmericans can safely have access to safe imports.\n  Under this legislation, we see with this next chart, we would import \ndrugs from 31 countries which meet high regulatory standards. Those are \nshown in blue on this chart. There are nations which meet our high \nstandards. In most cases, individuals will purchase an imported \nprescription drug from their local pharmacists. Pharmacies will receive \nthese drugs from U.S. wholesalers which import them. These wholesalers \nwill be registered, inspected, monitored by the FDA. This higher level \nof safety is a first step in establishing a higher standard in the \nhandling of prescription drugs in the United States.\n  Our legislation also allows individuals to directly order medications \nfrom outside the United States when using an FDA-registered and \napproved Canadian pharmacy. Again, just as with wholesalers handling \nprescription drugs, the FDA will examine, register, and inspect these \nfacilities on a frequent basis. FDA will assure the highest standard \nfor such essential functions as recording medical history, verifying \nprescriptions, and tracking shipments. Regardless of whether the \npurchase is from the local pharmacist or a Canadian pharmacy, we assure \nthat a legitimate prescription and a qualified pharmacist are required \nto help assure safety.\n  For those who say that consumers could unwittingly purchase an \nunapproved or suspect drug, our legislation assures that drugs received \nwill always be FDA approved. If any difference exists in a foreign \ndrug--even the most trivial of distinctions--our legislation assures \nFDA will evaluate the product and determine its acceptability.\n  For those who say counterfeiting is a threat, our legislation \nrequires the use of anticounterfeiting technologies to protect drugs. \nToday we can thwart counterfeiting by employing technologies like the \none now used on $20 bills. Our bill not only requires the use of such \ncounterfeit-resistant technologies but also a standardized numerical \nidentifier unique to each package of a drug. Moreover, this bill \nsupports the development of future anticounterfeiting and track-and-\ntrace technologies which we hope will be used to protect all drugs.\n  For those who say the consumers won't know who has handled an \nimported prescription drug, our bill requires a chain of custody--\notherwise known as a pedigree--be maintained and inspected to help \nensure the integrity of imported drugs. A pedigree for medications was \nmandated by law in 1988 and has still not been implemented. This bill \nwill change that.\n  For the first time, in fact, this legislation will include resources \nto inspect all facilities handling medications. So we are not just \nmaking imported drugs safer but also domestic drugs.\n  Some attempt to alarm Americans about the countries from which we \nwould import drugs, citing nations such as Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia. \nThe last time I checked, these are members of the European Union. The \nsame is true for Ireland, for example, where Lipitor is made.\n  So let me get this straight: It is fine for those countries to \nmanufacture drugs in their plants for domestic U.S. companies and ship \nthose drugs here where we then have the privilege of paying higher \nprices than anywhere else in the world, but we somehow cannot safely \nimport drugs made in those same countries. Exactly what kind of sense \ndoes that make?\n  In fact, going back to this chart where the European Union and other \ncountries from which we would import appear in blue. So all those \ncountries that are in blue are areas in which this amendment would \nallow the importation of drugs, which we see infrequent FDA inspections \nare in these red countries. All of these countries that are designated \nin red are the ones in which we have manufacturers importing \ningredients for the final product. Yet there are infrequent FDA \ninspections. There are plants right now--today--shown on the chart in \nred that are making drugs that are sold and consumed in the United \nStates, plants where there are few FDA inspections. In fact, it has \nbeen estimated that approximately 40 percent of the active ingredients \nin prescription drugs consumed in the United States are actually made \nin India and China, and we know oversight there is lacking. In fact, \nsuch plants may be inspected as infrequently as every 12 years.\n\n  Currently, there are more than 3,200 foreign manufacturing plants \nthat make medications for the United States market according to GAO. \nThe GAO also found that FDA, in the words of an Associated Press \narticle on the matter, ``isn't even sure how many foreign facilities \nare producing for the American market. One government database suggests \nit's 6,760. Another says about 3,000.''\n  With the explosion of drugs coming in from nations such as India and \nChina, as reported in the Washington Post, the FDA's ``budget for \nforeign inspections has not kept pace,'' and as a\n\n[[Page S12786]]\n\nresult, as of 2007, ``foreign drug and drug ingredient makers are \ninspected on average once every eight to 12 years, while American-based \nmanufacturers must be inspected at least once every two years.''\n  The article also reported that China itself has more than 700 plants, \nbut the FDA only has the resources to conduct about 20 inspections a \nyear there.\n  So let me just indicate, on this chart again, that we, under this \namendment that is pending before the Senate, would allow drugs to be \nimported from those countries designated in blue. The countries that \nare designated and reflected in red are those countries where we \ncurrently manufacture the ingredients of the final product. We are not \nsuggesting that drugs be imported from these nations. Yet our \nlegislation will make it safer because of the resources that we have \nincorporated in this legislation before the Senate and all of the \nstandards that will be required for FDA to inspect these facilities \nthat are currently not inspected.\n  We have seen the dangers in ignoring these problems, and that is why \nthis legislation would fund enhanced FDA foreign inspections to \nfundamentally improve the safety of drugs consumed in the United \nStates. But that is not all. While opponents will cite current law on \ndrug importation, the fact is, in the Medicare Modernization Act--the \ncurrent drug importation statute which has never been implemented--\nthere are just six safety provisions over as many pages--as detailed in \nthis chart--versus the 31 major provisions in our amendment.\n  So when we passed the Medicare Modernization Act back in 2003, we \nincluded safety features because we heard from many of our colleagues \nwho simply did not want to have drug importation. They claimed we had \nto have a safety certification process, which we have had numerous \ntimes for the last decade, to which nothing has advanced with respect \nto importation. Obviously, a safety certification hasn't been made \nbecause we haven't given any resources. We haven't implemented that \ncertification in good faith.\n  Under the pending amendment, we incorporate 31 major provisions in \nour legislation to address each and every issue. We systematically \nanalyze and identify every issue that has been raised by the opponents \nto the drug importation legislation--every safety-related issue, every \nstandard-related issue, every failure that has occurred with respect to \nthe FDA inspection system on where they are importing drugs currently \nand where they have not inspected those facilities. We have 31 \ndifferent provisions in order to address every facet of safety-related \nissues.\n  So for those who say importation isn't safe, we show that it shall \nbe. This legislation will set a model and a mandate for improving \nsafety in the handling of not only imported prescription drugs but of \nall medications--even domestic ones.\n  But if that is not enough, let me also suggest to the opponents of \nthis legislation that they are failing to observe the greatest safety \nthreat to Americans--that the inability to take a drug as it is \nprescribed undoubtedly exacts a toll on thousands of American lives \nevery year.\n  So beyond question, our measure addresses the crucial issue of \nsafety. I think it is certainly indicative and reflective in this chart \ntoday, all the provisions that have been incorporated in the pending \namendment before the Senate. This clearly will deliver the real savings \nas well as safety for consumers.\n  Organizations across the board are supporting this legislation. They \nrepresent more than 50 million Americans who realize that extending \nthis coverage is fundamentally critically important to the well-being \nof all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I believe we have to amend the previous \norder which restricted speakers to 10 minutes. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that the previous order be changed so that Senators may speak \nfor longer than 10 minutes, and I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee for yielding me the time.\n  Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the Dorgan amendment \nto allow the importation of drugs from 32 different countries in the \nworld into the medicine cabinets of American families. I believe that \nis, at its core, a regressive amendment.\n  This amendment, however well-intentioned, reminds me of a time when \nthe lack of sufficient regulation allowed people to sell snake oil and \nmagic elixirs. Let's not relive that history. Let's learn from it.\n  I am sure many in this Chamber remember a time when the doctor would \ngive us a prescription, we would take that to the local pharmacy, and \nthe one thing we never did was question what was in the bottle. Now, \nwith this amendment, we would not be so certain. We would not be sure \nthat what is in the bottle is what we think it is. We would not be so \ncertain from where it came. It could be directly from countries all \nover the world--Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, or any \n1 of 28 other countries, and I will speak to that. Yes, I have heard \nthey are part of the European Union, but I will talk about what the \nEuropean Union just said about their challenges with counterfeit drugs. \nOr maybe they will come indirectly from any number of countries that \nhave proven to make tainted medicine; those who are not part of the \nEuropean Union but who are counterfeiting their drugs into the European \nUnion, getting into their supply chain and ultimately getting to us, if \nwe were to allow it to happen. We would not be absolutely sure of the \nconditions under which they were manufactured, whether they are safe to \nuse, or where their ingredients originated.\n\n  Health care reform and lowering costs does not mean we should roll \nthe dice with the health and safety of the American people.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' interest in bringing lower cost drugs to \nthe market. In fact, I agree with them. But we cannot risk the health \nand safety of the American people in order to do it, and I am afraid \nthis amendment would do just that.\n  We have heard a lot about the FDA--the Food and Drug Administration. \nYes, they are the ones who safeguard Americans from having the wrong \ntype of drugs get into our marketplace or making sure the right type of \ndrugs are approved and the wrong ones stay out. I have heard the \nstories of Americans searching for affordable prescription drugs and \neither going online to get them or traveling sometimes. But we have to \nensure the drugs they buy are not counterfeit, not tainted, not \nsubstandard, and that they are what the doctor ordered and will work.\n  This amendment would undo current safety protections that ensure that \npatients are getting prescription medications that are the same in \nsubstance, quality, and quantity their doctor has prescribed. So let's \nsee what the FDA said.\n  In a letter from the Food and Drug Administration issued the other \nday to one of our colleagues in the Senate, Commissioner Hamburg said \nthere are four potential risks to patients, in her opinion, that have \nto be addressed.\n  First, she is concerned that some imported drugs may not be safe and \neffective because they were not subject to a rigorous regulatory review \nprior to approval. Second, she says the drugs ``may not be a \nconsistently made, high quality product because they were not \nmanufactured in a facility that complied with appropriate good \nmanufacturing procedures.''\n  Third, the drugs ``may not be substitutable with the FDA approved \nproducts because of differences in composition or manufacturing.''\n  And, fourth, the drugs simply ``may not be what they purport to be'' \nbecause inadequate safeguards in the supply chain may have allowed \ncontamination or--worse--counterfeiting.\n  In addition, the FDA's letter went on to cite significant ``safety \nconcerns related to allowing the importation of nonbioequivalent \nproducts . . . and confusion in distribution and labeling between \nforeign products and the domestic product.''\n\n[[Page S12787]]\n\n  The FDA is also concerned it does not have clear authority over \nforeign supply chains. In other words, there is a very real risk that \nimported drugs either would not make us better or, yes, could very well \nmake us worse.\n  One reason we never question what is in the bottle when we go to the \npharmacy to fill our prescription is because the U.S. drug supply \nsystem is a closed system. That is why it is one of the safest in the \nworld. Everyone in the system is subject to the FDA's oversight--to \nthese very standards--and to strong penalties for failure to comply \nwith the law.\n  The FDA would have to review data to determine whether the non-FDA-\napproved drug is safe, effective, and substitutable with the FDA-\napproved version. In addition, the FDA would need to review drug \nfacilities all over the world to determine whether they manufacture \nhigh-quality products consistently.\n  It is clear that keeping our drug supply safe--in a global economy in \nwhich we cannot affect the motives and willingness of others to game \nthe system for greed and profit--is a monumental task. It is not simply \nallowing for the importation of lower cost medications, as the \nproponents of this amendment would have us believe. It will require a \nglobal reach, extraordinary vigilance, and a serious investment to \nenforce the highest standards in parts of the world that have minimal \nstandards now, so we don't have to ask which drug is real and which is \ncounterfeit; so we don't have to wonder, if the packaging looks the \nsame: Is it approved Tamiflu or is it counterfeit Tamiflu? The \npackaging looks the same, but is the content the same? One is approved; \none is counterfeit.\n  When the swine flu was coming through and everybody started trying to \nget hold of Tamiflu, what did they do? They went online and got \ncounterfeit Tamiflu which didn't do the job. In this photo, the answer \nis no. One is real, one is counterfeit. You can't tell the difference. \nIs this helping people save money, if they just paid for a counterfeit \nproduct? No. Is this an effective treatment for a contagious H1N1 flu, \nif you have just been fooled by a counterfeit bottle of Tamiflu because \nyou thought it was cheaper? No. How is this in the best interest of the \nAmerican people?\n  Here is another example--Lipitor. Can you tell which is counterfeit \nor approved Lipitor? They look the same. Americans who purchase them \nare told they are the same, but how do you tell the difference? Most \npeople can't. So they will go about their normal routine each morning \ntaking the so-called Lipitor, thinking they are treating their high \nblood pressure, but really they are walking around with the same silent \nkiller and not taking the appropriate medication for it.\n  Another example, Aricept, a drug to slow the progression of \nAlzheimer's disease--something my mother was taking when she was alive. \nCan you tell the difference between the pills in this photo? No. And \nthat is the problem.\n  The global economy opens global possibilities to counterfeiting these \ndrugs. It opens the potential for these drugs--or the ingredients used \nin these drugs--to find their way from nation to nation, from Southeast \nAsia where the problem is epidemic to one of the 32 nations listed in \nthe amendment that supposedly are safer, and then ultimately into \nAmerican homes. That is a gamble we cannot afford to take. We should \nnot have to wonder what is in the bottle.\n  Americans suffering from Alzheimer's should not have to wonder if the \ndrug they are taking is real or counterfeit. By the time they figure \nthat out, buying a drug either online or abroad that is counterfeit or \nnot of the same substance or of a different dosage, it could be too \nlate to help reverse the damage, as was promised.\n  One final example, Celebrex, used to treat arthritis and chronic \npain. Can you tell the difference between these pills? No, and neither \nwould those who continue to suffer if they are scammed into buying the \ncounterfeit version. One is approved, one is counterfeit.\n  I fully appreciate my colleagues' desire to keep the cost of \nprescription drugs down, but our first task is to protect the safety of \nAmericans and to prevent counterfeit drugs from infecting the American \nmarket.\n  The real problem is bringing down the cost of prescription drugs as \npart of overall health care reform, and the real solution is expanding \naccess to affordable drugs in the United States.\n  I have heard several of my colleagues refer to 9 percent increases. \nWhat they fail to mention is the deep discounts the industry provides, \nparticularly to the government and other entities, against that \nincrease. They do not do that because, of course, it doesn't serve \ntheir purpose.\n  In this fight to create affordable drugs in the United States, I take \na back seat to no one. But at the same time, I strongly believe we \ncannot roll the dice with the health and safety of the American people. \nThis amendment is that roll of the dice. We should never put Americans \nin the position of having to worry about whether their medicine will \nmake them better or worse. We should never put Americans in a position \nof wondering is that a real pill or is that a poison pill?\n  To see what happens if we allow importation we only need to look to \nthe European Union. One of my colleagues earlier today used it as an \nexample as to why we should pass this amendment. But I listened to the \nwords of the European Union, and I hear quite the opposite.\n  Earlier this week, the European Union Commissioner in charge of this \nissue said:\n\n       The number of counterfeit medicines arriving in Europe . . \n     . is constantly growing. The European Commission is extremely \n     worried.\n\n  To quote another section of the statement:\n\n       In just 2 months, the European Union seized 34 million fake \n     tablets at custom points in all member countries. This \n     exceeded our worst fears.\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       Every fake drug is a potential massacre. Even when a \n     medicine only contains an ineffective substance, this can \n     lead to people dying because they think they are fighting \n     their illness with a real drug.\n       I expect the EU will agree in 2010 that a drug's journey \n     from manufacture to sale should be scrutinized carefully.\n\n  He goes on to talk about other safeguards.\n  So, in fact, the very essence of what some claim is the very reason \nwe should allow importation, the European Union is saying, quite to the \ncontrary, that they think this is a huge problem for them and, in fact, \nwhat seems to be an action that would not hurt someone can actually \nmean the difference between life and death.\n  I don't want American families to see those fears come to life. Yes, \ncounterfeit drugs may happen, but if we pass the amendment, we just \nopen the floodgates. The European Union's experience only proves my \nconcerns, not alleviates them like some others suggest. A $75 \ncounterfeit cancer drug that only contains half of the dosage that a \nperson has been prescribed and needs does not save Americans money and \ncertainly is not worth the price in terms of dollars or risk to life. \nLet's not now open national borders to insufficiently regulated drugs \nfrom around the world.\n  Finally, in a different dimension, I think safety is utmost, but at a \ntime of joblessness in this country, I don't want to offshore those \njobs abroad to allow contaminated and counterfeit prescription drugs to \ncome into this country. We are attacking the one last major research \nand manufacturing entity in the United States, one that has been at the \nforefront of the health care reform effort and put $80 billion of its \nown money in for reform. I want to see more partners like that in this \nprocess.\n  Let's reject this amendment. Let's keep our drug supply one of the \nsafest in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent we extend the \nperiod for debate only until 5 o'clock, with the time equally divided \nwith Senators permitted to speak up to 10 minutes each; with no \namendment in order during this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be \nequally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S12788]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have listened this afternoon to some \nof the opposition to the legislation, the amendment we have offered \ntrying to deal with the increasing price of prescription drugs. Those \nwho are opposed apparently are oblivious to the question of the \ndramatic runup in prices for prescription drugs. They talk about \ncounterfeiting and their worry about that. I wish to talk about that. \nBecause if you are worried about counterfeiting--and, by the way, there \nis a counterfeiting issue with respect to prescription drugs in this \ncountry and several of my colleagues have described that issue--if you \nare worried about that, then you have to support the amendment I and \nSenator McCain and others have offered that provides the only basis for \ngetting to things such as pedigrees on prescription drugs, batch lots, \nand tracers. The only mechanism to do that is in this amendment, which \nwill make the domestic drug supply safer, allow us to track back drugs \nto their origin, and will certainly allow us to import FDA-approved \ndrugs when they are sold in other countries for a fraction of the \nprice.\n  Let me describe what brings us to the floor of the Senate. To those \nwho are opposed to this amendment, if one wants to be oblivious, I \nguess, fine, but the consumers will certainly notice. You want to buy \nsome Nexium, guess what. Nexium is going to cost you $424 in this \ncountry. But if you buy it in Great Britain, it is $41 dollars; Spain, \n$36; Canada, $65; Germany $37. Once again, the American consumer gets \nto pay $424 for an equivalent amount, 10 times the cost of what it \ncosts in Great Britain. Is that fair? To me, it is not. It is not fair \nto me that the American consumer is charged the highest prices in the \nworld.\n  Plavix, you can see what is happening here, $133; $59 in Britain; $58 \nin Spain. The American consumer gets to pay $133 for the equivalent \namount. Lipitor, the popular cholesterol-lowering drug, for an \nequivalent amount of Lipitor, the American consumer pays $125. In Great \nBritain, they pay $40. In Spain, they pay $32. In Germany, they pay \n$48. Again, the American consumer is told: You get to pay $125. I have \ndescribed, over and over again, the two bottles of Lipitor, empty \nbottles made in Ireland by an American corporation and distributed all \nacross the world, the most popular cholesterol-lowering drug. Same pill \nput in the same bottle made by the same company, FDA approved. Only \ndifference is this one has a blue label and this one has a red one. \nThis one went to Canada and this one to the United States. The U.S. \nconsumer got to pay nearly triple the price. Is that fair? Not where I \ncome from.\n  By the way, my colleague from Maine, who spoke moments ago, talked \nabout a nearly 10-percent increase in the price for brand-name \nprescription drugs just this year. This chart shows what is happening. \nYou take the arthritis drug Enbrel; you got a 12-percent increase this \nyear. Singular, for asthma, this year you got a 12-percent increase. \nBoniva, for osteoporosis, an 18-percent increase this year in drug \ncost. The list goes on. Plavix, 8 percent up this year. In fact, I have \na chart that shows what has happened year after year after year. The \nprice of brand-name prescription drugs in the United States is way \nabove the rate of inflation in every single year. In fact, during this \nyear, the rate of inflation has dropped down here and the price of \nprescription drugs has gone up 9.3 percent.\n  Several of my colleagues, at least a couple of my colleagues have \ntalked about the issue of counterfeit drugs. I am concerned about \ncounterfeit drugs as well. In fact, there were proposals in the \nCongress that would have done what we should have done long ago with \nrespect to ensuring a safe drug supply: attaching pedigrees to drugs, \nbatch lots so you can trace them all the way back to their origin and \ntrace them all the way through the chain of custody. That has never \nbeen done, and it should be done. It is in our amendment. That is the \nonly way we will have a totally safe drug supply.\n  A couple of my colleagues have talked about circumstances where there \nhave been counterfeit drugs in this country. That is true. Those were \ndomestic drugs, drugs inside the country. By the way, how does some of \nthat happen when you have not only counterfeit drugs but contaminated \ndrugs? Forty percent of the active ingredients in prescription drugs \nfor the United States comes from India and China. Think of that: 40 \npercent of the active ingredients of all the prescription drugs \nconsumed in our country comes from India or China. I described earlier \ntoday the Wall Street Journal investigative report which shows the \ncircumstances with the active ingredient for Heparin, the production of \nHeparin in a building in China. This shows the development of pig \nintestines for the production of Heparin. You will see this in the Wall \nStreet Journal articles and the expose. Here is a man in this building \nin China who is producing Heparin, stirring a rusty old pot with what \nappears to be a twig from a tree, clearly unsanitary conditions. That \nbecomes ingredients for America's prescription drug supply; 40 percent \nof our active ingredients comes from circumstances in which there is \nvirtually no inspection or very few inspections of those kind of places \nwhere those prescription drugs are developed.\n  By the way, there was a drug called Epogen produced by a \npharmaceutical company, a very reputable one. There is a wonderful book \nwritten called dangerous doses by Katherine Eban. She traced this drug \nto a 16-year-old boy named Timothy Fagan, whose health was dramatically \naffected by what has happened here. This drug found its way all the way \nthrough these places, including a strip joint in Miami, a cooler in the \nback of a strip joint in Miami, in the trunks of automobiles, \ndistributed through all sorts of strange and unusual places, and gets \nto a 16-year-old boy with devastating results because this drug had \none-twentieth the strength that was supposed to have been given to this \nyoung boy for his disease. Does anybody have the capability to \nunderstand where all this happened, how it got tracked? A journalist \ndid the investigative work to find this out. Fortunately for us, we now \nhave a track on this one drug that affected this young boy in a \ndevastating way.\n  That was not importation. That was the domestic drug supply. How can \nthis happen? Because we don't have batch lots and pedigrees and tracers \nand the capability to find out where a drug is produced and where it \ngoes from that production to the final user in every single \ncircumstance. We have that in our amendment. It is the only way it will \nhappen if we pass this amendment.\n  It is interesting to me. There was a man named Dr. Peter Rost. He was \nthe former vice president of marketing for Pfizer Corporation. By the \nway, Dr. Rost also worked in Europe in the parallel trade area for 20-\nsome years. They do this in Europe routinely. They actually have \nparallel trading where you can purchase drugs, one country to another, \nno problem. Here is what he says:\n\n       The biggest argument against reimportation is safety. What \n     everyone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that in \n     Europe reimportation has been in place for 20 years.\n\n  They say this is going to be unsafe, you can't do it. Europe has been \ndoing it for 20 years. Don't tell me we don't have the capability if \nEurope can do it. Why would we do it? Because it is unfair to the \nAmerican people to be paying double, triple or quadruple or 10 times \nthe cost of prescription drugs that are being paid for by people in the \nrest of the world. That is unfair. It doesn't make any sense to me.\n  We offer an amendment. It is one of the few amendments in the Senate, \nin recent days and weeks, that is bipartisan. Most of the things \noffered are not bipartisan. This is an amendment, Dorgan-Snowe. We \noffer it with broad support. The late Ted Kennedy, bless his soul, sat \nright over there. He was a cosponsor of our amendment. John McCain is a \ncosponsor of our amendment. Senator Grassley and Senator Stabenow are \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is broadly bipartisan. It is one of the few \nbipartisan amendments. My expectation is, we will have a vote on the \nCrapo motion. He offered his last evening and I offered mine last \nevening. My expectation is\n\n[[Page S12789]]\n\nwe will have a vote on the Crapo motion and then a vote on this \namendment and move on. I would hope we will have the votes on this. It \nis the only thing in any health care proposal in the House or the \nSenate that starts to put the breaks on the escalating prices of \nprescription drugs. It is the only thing. Without this, we will pass \nhealth care reform, if, in fact, it passes and if someone says to you: \nWhat have you done to try to put the brakes on the fact that \nprescription drugs are increasing at 9 and 10 percent? What have you \ndone about that? The answer is going to be, we didn't do anything. We \njust couldn't do that.\n\n  The fact is, a whole lot of people in this country use prescription \ndrugs regularly to control their cholesterol, their blood pressure, and \notherwise manage diseases. It keeps them out of the hospital. The fact \nis, many of these prescription drugs are very important in the lives of \npeople. The question for us is, if we are allowing these drugs to be \npriced out of the reach of people, what does that say about the value \nof the drugs? We need to have fair pricing for the American people. We \nmust insist on fair pricing for prescription drugs for the American \npeople. It is that simple. This notion of there being any kind of a \nsafety issue is a total canard by those who ignore the very provisions \nof the bill that establish the most rigorous regime of safety ever \nestablished for the domestic drug supply and for the reimportation of \nprescription drugs. That is just a fact.\n  My hope is, in very short order, we will have an opportunity to have \nthe Members of the Senate cast their votes on this and, at long last, \nSenator Snowe and I, having been at this, I think, now for 8 or 10 \nyears, will have at the right time--and that is health care, when you \nare considering health care, when is a more important or more \nappropriate time to consider the questioning of prescription drugs--and \nin the right place, the ability to pass the legislation. We offer a \nbill as an amendment. Thirty Senators having cosponsored it, Republican \nand Democrats, conservatives and liberals and moderates having \ncosponsored it. It is my expectation, we will have this vote and at \nlong last be successful in doing something for the American people.\n  The question is, does the pharmaceutical industry have a lot of \nclout? The answer is, they sure do. As I said many times, I have no \nbeef against that industry. I want them to succeed and earn profits. I \nthink their pricing strategy is unfair to the American consumer. Do \nthey have a lot of clout. Yes, they do. But it is my hope that when it \ncomes time for a vote, the American people and the interests of the \nAmerican consumers will have as much clout in this Chamber, based on \nthe facts, facts that suggest the American people ought to be treated \nfairly.\n  This amendment is all about freedom, giving the American people the \nfreedom to do what everybody else can do and that is participate in the \nglobal marketplace. When the medicine they need that is FDA-approved is \navailable somewhere else for half price or for an 80-percent reduction, \nwhy on Earth should they not be able to acquire that lower priced drug \nthat is FDA-approved? The answer is, they should have the freedom to do \nthat. The only way that freedom will exist is if we pass this \namendment. That is just a fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield the time remaining on our side \nto the Senator from Maryland.\n  Might I ask, how much time is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, not withstanding the prior agreement, I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maryland be allowed to \nspeak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I might amend that by asking unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Kansas also be recognized for 15 minutes \nfollowing the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. CARDIN are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I understand I am recognized for 15 \nminutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan wishes to attend the very important Democratic conference \non a brand new health care bill. I understand that, and I shall try to \nexpedite my remarks, only with the suggestion to the Presiding Officer \nthat when you are late in the Senate, you are early, and they are not \ngoing to say anything important without you.\n  I wish to yield at this time to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, who I understand has a statement to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I thank my friend from Kansas.\n  I rise to discuss the tax implications that this health care bill \nwill have on Americans.\n  Last year, President Obama made a promise to the American people. He \nassured us over and over that he would not raise ``a single dime'' of \ntaxes on Americans earning less than $250,000 per year.\n  But the health care bill presently before this body--the very bill \nthat the President has demanded--will not only raise taxes, it will \ncreate new ones.\n  And as of yet, we have no idea what the Congressional Budget Office \nwill say about how much the deal my colleagues apparently struck last \nnight will cost taxpayers.\n  But we know that this $2.5 trillion proposal is going to hit three \ngroups with new or higher taxes: families, businesses, and the health \ncare industry itself. And we know that under the current bill taxes \noverall are estimated to go up by $867 billion.\n  Tax hikes are detrimental at any time. But they are doubly hurtful in \nthe bad economy we are in.\n  Under the terms of this bill, in 2019, more than 42 million \nindividuals and families--this is 25 percent of all tax returns under \n$200,000--will see their taxes increase.\n  In addition, if we pass this bill, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that $36 billion in new taxes and fines will be forced upon \nindividuals and businesses.\n  Families without insurance would be fined up to $2,250. And according \nto the Joint Committee on Taxation, some of those are expected to have \nincomes below $200,000.\n  Also, businesses with more than 50 workers that do not offer coverage \nwill be forced to pay a penalty of $750 for every full-time worker if \nany of those workers get subsidized coverage through insurance \nexchanges.\n  Many of these businesses will not be able to afford the cost of \nproviding health insurance or the fine. According to the CBO, 5 million \nAmericans will lose employer coverage. Others may find their pay \nreduced so employers can cover the cost of these new taxes and fines.\n  This bill has been sold as an attempt to ``help businesses be more \ncompetitive in the marketplace.''\n  But the National Federation of Independent Business--which actually \nrepresents small businesses--disagrees.\n  In a letter to the majority leader, the NFIB was very clear--and this \nis a quote: ``The current bill does not do enough to reduce costs for \nsmall business owners and their employees.'' It also called this bill \n``the wrong bill at the wrong time.''\n\n  Also hit hard would be the health care industry and medical-device \nmanufacturers.\n  Now, it may not be popular to worry about fees imposed on health \ninsurers and the like, but the fact is, the $100 billion in taxes and \nfees this bill will impose on them will be passed on to Americans in \nthe form of higher premiums. That is also according to the CBO.\n  Our health care system needs to be reformed. We absolutely need to \ncover those with preexisting conditions, and\n\n[[Page S12790]]\n\nAmericans in the medical fight of their lives should not be kicked off \ntheir insurance.\n  But swapping out a system that needs fixing with just another broken \nsystem that also raises taxes on Americans who need every dime of their \npaychecks to get through the month is not the way to go.\n  We need to move in the right direction. We need to emphasize wellness \nand prevention.\n  We need to reduce frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits that add so \nmuch to the cost of practicing medicine. Senator Graham and I have \nintroduced a ``loser pays'' bill that would do just that.\n  We also need to allow health insurance purchases across state lines, \nand allow small businesses to pool resources to buy insurance for their \nemployees.\n  But do we need an insurance tax, an employer tax, a drug tax, a lab \ntax, a medical device tax, a failure-to-buy-insurance tax, a cosmetic \nsurgery tax, and an increased employee Medicare tax?\n  We don't need to impose eight new taxes on the American people.\n  The absolute last thing we should be doing during the worst economy \nwe have had in decades--with 10 percent, 26-year-high unemployment--is \nhiking taxes on the middle class and on small businesses, both of which \nare the backbone of America.\n  The NFIB is right--this is the wrong bill at the wrong time.\n  Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, President Obama has repeatedly made two \npledgees to the American people--and we have heard it and heard it \nbefore, and we will probably hear it again--about health care reform. \nThe first is, if you like the health care you have, you can keep it.\n  We know the bill before us breaks this pledge because all but two in \nthe majority voted to preserve the nearly $500 billion in cuts to \nMedicare, which includes $120 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, has confirmed \nthat these cuts to Medicare Advantage mean that ``approximately half'' \nof the Medicare Advantage benefits will be cut for the nearly 11 \nmillion seniors who are enrolled in this program.\n  This vote confirms whether Americans will be able to preserve and \nkeep the health care benefits they have and like. That answer, \nunfortunately, is no.\n  So now let's look at the President's second pledge: that he will not \nraise taxes on families earning under $250,000 or individuals earning \nunder $200,000.\n  A number of my colleagues have pointed to comments made last year in \nDover, NH, by then-Candidate Obama, who said:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge--\n\n  And we have heard this before--\n\n       . . . no family making less than $250,000 will see their \n     taxes increase--not your income taxes, not your payroll \n     taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\n\n  I think he said ``by one dime'' at the end of that.\n  Yet time and again in this bill, that pledge is also broken. This \nbill calls for nearly $500 billion in new taxes, penalties, and fees \nthat hit virtually every American, including middle-class families \nmaking less than $250,000 and individuals earning less than $200,000.\n  Even though the majority has tried to disguise these taxes as various \n``fees'' and presents them as being paid for by targeted health care \nindustries, the reality is that this bill taxes the average American \ncoming and going.\n  It taxes you if you have health insurance. It taxes you if you do not \nhave health insurance. It taxes you if you use medical devices, such as \na hearing aid or a pacemaker. It taxes you if you save on your own to \npay for your health care expenses. And it effectively increases taxes \nfor individuals and families with catastrophic medical expenses.\n  Americans should understand that the higher taxes called for in this \nbill will come straight out of their pockets, with the middle class \nbearing much of this tax burden.\n  Let me give you a few examples of the new taxes proposed and who will \npay for them.\n  The bill imposes a 40-percent excise tax on health insurance \nproviders that offer high-cost health insurance plans. This provision \nis the largest tax hike in the bill and raises almost $150 billion and \nwill be paid for primarily by individuals--not the health insurance \nprovider, but by individuals--through increased income and payroll \ntaxes.\n  By the time this bill is fully implemented, 84 percent of this tax on \n``high-cost plans'' will be paid by Americans who earn less than \n$200,000--taxpayers the President promised would not pay additional \ntaxes.\n  Second, the bill imposes new taxes on health insurance providers and \nmedical device manufacturers. Both the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice and Joint Committee on Taxation have said these taxes will be \npassed on to consumers in the form of higher insurance premiums. The \nnew $60 billion tax on health insurance providers alone could raise \npremiums by as much as 2 percent according to some analyses, and that \nincrease could come as early as next year.\n  Not only that, the $19.3 billion in new taxes on medical devices \ncould increase costs for up to 80,000 medical products, such as heart \nstents, blood pressure monitors, eyeglasses, pacemakers, hearing aids, \nand advanced diagnostic equipment. Such a tax would stifle and will \nstifle innovation and reduce the ability for manufacturers to develop \nnew lifesaving devices and technologies.\n  So make no mistake, the cost of this tax will be passed on to and \npaid for by anyone who uses a medical device, including those middle-\nclass taxpayers the President has pledged will not experience any tax \nincrease.\n  If you need a pacemaker or a stent, you will pay more for it because \nof these new taxes. If you need a diagnostic procedure, you will pay \nmore for it because of this new tax.\n  Furthermore, under this bill, the floor for deducting medical \nexpenses from income tax is raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of \nadjusted gross income. Those who will take this deduction are most \noften seniors and those with serious or catastrophic medical issues.\n  For a family of four, earning $57,000 in 2013, limiting the deduction \nmeans they would lose a tax deduction of $1,425. A family of four \nearning $92,000 would lose a tax deduction of $2,300.\n  It goes without saying, I think, that losing a portion of your tax \ndeduction means you pay more in taxes. These are real dollars to hard-\nworking Americans. This provision alone raises $15 billion in new taxes \non Americans who deduct medical expenses.\n  Finally, this bill raises taxes for the more than 35 million \nAmericans who participate in flexible spending accounts, or FSAs. For \nthe first time, this benefit to middle-income workers is taxed to pay \nfor new government spending and an expansion of entitlement programs.\n  FSAs are a key benefit for many families for whom health insurance \ndoes not cover or does not cover sufficiently some of their highest \ncost health care expenses such as dental, vision, as well as \nprescription drug costs. They are also important for individuals who \nmanage chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.\n  Flexible savings accounts allow the participants to set aside money \nout of their own pocket to pay for these necessary expenses. However, \nunder this bill, the government caps how much can be set aside in an \nFSA account at $2,500, effectively raising the tax burden on certain \nFSA participants and increasing their health care costs.\n  The typical worker who contributes more that $2,500 to their FSA has \na serious medical condition. This means that under this bill, workers \nwith serious illnesses and earning an average of $55,000 will be paying \nmore in taxes.\n  I have highlighted a few of the many tax hikes in this bill and the \nfact that the middle-class taxpayers will bear the brunt of these \nhigher taxes, but if there are any doubts remaining about what this \nbill means for Americans' pocketbooks, let's consider this. An analysis \nby the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation looked at four tax \nprovisions in the bill and how, when taken together, they will affect \nAmericans. They looked at the tax credit for health insurance, the \nadditional Medicare payroll tax, and several I have already mentioned, \nincluding the high-cost plan tax and the medical expense deduction \nlimit. Their analysis shows that when this bill is in full effect, on \naverage individuals making over $50,000\n\n[[Page S12791]]\n\nand families making over $75,000 would see their taxes go up under this \nbill. Even after taking into account the premium tax credit, the \nsubsidy that the government will provide to help people offset the cost \nof health insurance, when this bill is fully in effect, more than 42 \nmillion individuals and families or 25 percent--one-quarter of all tax \nreturns under $200,000--will see on average their taxes go up as a \nresult of this bill.\n  In addition, based on the same information, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation identified two groups of taxpayers. The first are those \nindividuals and families who are not eligible to receive the premium \ntax credit to purchase health care, and second are those individuals \nand families whose taxes will increase first before they then see some \ntype of tax reduction as a result of their premium tax credit. Taking \nthese two groups together, the number is even more disturbing: 73 \nmillion individuals and families or 43 percent of all tax returns under \n$200,000 will on average see their taxes increase under this bill, says \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  To put it another way, under this bill, for every one individual or \nfamily that benefits from the tax credit to purchase insurance, this \nbill raises taxes on three middle-income individuals and families. \nThese tax increases are on top of those I discussed earlier, such as \nthe new taxes on FSAs, so the estimates I have already mentioned \nunderstate the tax impact, again, on middle-income taxpayers. The JCT \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation--has confirmed that these additional \ntaxes, such as the FSA tax, will likely further raise the taxes of \nmiddle-income Americans.\n  All Americans, and middle-class taxpayers especially, need to take \nnotice of what these higher taxes will mean for them and their \nfamilies. They need to know these taxes will be used in part to pay for \na vast expansion of the role of government in health care and more \ngovernment intrusion into families health care choices.\n  Paying for health care on the backs of the middle-class and working \nAmericans is the wrong solution for health care, violates the \nPresident's pledge to these taxpayers, and is terribly \ncounterproductive in regard to the No. 1 issue facing this country, and \nthat is jobs and the economy.\n  I urge my colleagues--I plead with my colleagues--to support the \nCrapo motion to prevent the enormous tax hike this bill inflicts on \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your indulgence. I know you are ready to \ngo to your conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida.)

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I assume it is our turn to talk a bit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I remind all Senators that we have an \nhour, equally divided, with each Senator able to speak up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate that. I appreciate the effort to try to \nsolve a hard problem. It is easy to criticize in this business, and it \nis hard to bring folks together. Maybe one day we can solve a hard \nproblem where we get 70 or 80 votes. I don't think this is that day.\n  One thing I will point out about the process is that somehow between \nthe time this started until now, something went wrong. This is what \nhappened. This is what was said by Candidate Obama in January 2008:\n\n       That's what I will do in bringing all parties together. Not \n     negotiating behind closed doors, but bringing all parties \n     together and broadcasting these negotiations on C-SPAN so \n     that the American people can see what the choices are.\n\n  In November 2007, he talked about, in his Presidency:\n\n       We are going to have a big table and everybody is going to \n     be invited--labor, employers, doctors, nurses, hospital \n     administrators, patients, and advocate groups. The drug and \n     insurance companies, they will also get a seat at the table, \n     and we will work on this process publicly. It will be on C-\n     SPAN. It will be streaming over the Net.\n\n  March 2008:\n\n       But here's the difference: I'm going to do it all on C-SPAN \n     so the American people will know what's going on.\n\n  August 2008:\n\n       When we come together around this health care system, I am \n     going to do it all in the open. I am going to do it on C-\n     SPAN.\n\n  August 2008:\n\n       I am going to have all the negotiations around the big \n     table. We will have the negotiations televised on C-SPAN.\n\n  The truth is, Mr. President, I am not so sure negotiating on C-SPAN \nis the way to find a solution to hard problems. But being at the table \nwith all parties represented is probably a very good idea. And the \nprocess, as I understand it now, is that our Democratic colleagues are \ntrying to negotiate among themselves to get to 60 votes. There was an \nannouncement made last night by the majority leader that we have had a \nbreakthrough. He said, ``I can't tell you what it is, but it is good.''\n  Mr. President, that is not the way we want to change one-sixth of the \neconomy. I argue that is not the best process by which to make major \ndecisions that affect the quality of Americans' lives.\n  The idea of Medicare being changed so dramatically by one party is \nprobably not a good idea. What have we done on the Medicare front? The \nactual bill that has been proposed increases spending by $800-something \nbillion. To pay for that, there are cuts in Medicare of close to $400 \nbillion to $500 billion. The money that would be taken out of the \nMedicare system is not plowed back into Medicare but used to fund other \naspects of this bill. This is at a time when Medicare--the trust fund--\nis $36 trillion underfunded and will begin to be exhausted in 2017.\n  I argue that both parties should be trying to find a way to save \nMedicare from the pending bankruptcy and do something about \nentitlements in general, Social Security and Medicare, to make them \nsolvent so that, one, they don't run out of money and we don't have to \nraise taxes in the future or cut benefits for young people because \nthose are the choices we will pass on to the next generation if we do \nnothing.\n  Instead of coming together to save Medicare from bankruptcy, we are \nactually reducing the amount of money going to an already-strapped \nsystem and using it for something else. There is another idea floating \naround that one of the solutions that may come out of this deal, which \nwe don't know the details of yet, is we are going to allow more people \nto buy into Medicare under the age of 65, and we will be expanding the \nnumber of people going into a system that is already about to go \nbankrupt. If we add new people to the system, approaching insolvency, \nsomething has to give. Who will be coming into the system from 55 to \n64? I argue those people are going to be in as a result of the process \nof adverse selection, people who have health care problems. It is going \nto put more pressure on a system that can't stand one more drop of \npressure. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.\n  We know this Medicare system is very much under siege, that the baby \nboomers are about to come into the system by the millions. There are \nthree workers for every retiree today, and in 20 years there are going \nto be two. So what do we do? We take money out of the Medicare system \nand use it for other things, and we are adding more people into the \nsystem that are going to drive up the cost overall to those already on \nMedicare.\n\n[[Page S12792]]\n\n  So if you are over 65, your ability to receive treatment is going to \nbe compromised because now we have to accommodate more people. If you \ndon't believe me, ask the hospitals and doctors who are very worried. \nThe Medicare reimbursement system now makes it very difficult for \ndoctors and hospitals to pay the bills. So the hospital association, \nthe Mayo Clinic, and others have warned Congress: Please don't expand \nMedicare because we can't survive on the reimbursement rates we have \ntoday.\n  If we add more people, we create more stress on a system that is \nhanging by a thread. I argue that is not change we can believe in or \naccommodate. If you had run for President on the idea that you are \ngoing to put more people on Medicare and expand that system, not reform \nit, take money out of it and use it for another purpose, you would have \nnever had a chance of getting elected. No one during the campaign for \nPresident ever suggested any of these ideas.\n  I just hope we will, as a Congress, stop and think about what we are \ndoing and realize if we do this--if we cut Medicare and expand the \nnumber of people who will be in the system--we make it impossible to \nsave it down the road and make it difficult for people coming behind us \nto have the same quality of life we have enjoyed. Between Medicare and \nSocial Security and other entitlement programs, we are about $50 \ntrillion short of the money we are going to need in the next 75 years \nto pay the bills.\n  In trying to reform health care, we have taken a weak system and \nalmost made it impossible to reform. We have expanded taxes at a time \nwhen the economy can't bear any more tax burdens because part of the \nbill raises taxes by about $500 billion. You will never convince me or \nanybody else that if you raise $500 billion in taxes to pay for this \nnew health care bill, it would not affect the economy in general. There \nhas to be a better way.\n  I am on the Wyden-Bennett bill. I am a Republican who agrees with \nmandated coverage for everybody. Senators Wyden and Bennett have a \ncomprehensive proposal that is revenue neutral. We would take the tax \ndeductions given to business over a period of time and give them to \nindividuals so that all of us would have tax deductions to go out and \npurchase health care in the private sector. We would have exchanges \nwhere we can go shop for health care that is best for us.\n  If you are single and 22, you would want a plan that is different \nthan if you were 45 and had 3 kids. The tradeoff is that the \nRepublicans, on the Wyden-Bennett bill, would agree to mandate \ncoverage. The Democrats would allow people to purchase health care in \nthe private sector. We would all use the Tax Code to fund those \npurchases. If you didn't make enough money to have the tax deductions, \nyou would get a subsidy. That makes perfect sense to me.\n  I want to solve the problem. I want to make sure everybody is covered \nbecause a lot of us are paying health care bills for those who are not \ncovered that could afford to pay--about 7 million or 8 million people \nmake over $75,000 a year, and they don't pay anything for health care \nof their own. So the rest of us have to pay it when they get sick. That \nis not right.\n  There is a better way, in my view. I just hope we will understand \nthat what we are doing with one-sixth of the economy is going to have a \nlasting effect on the quality of American life, and now is not the time \nto cut Medicare or add more people to it. Now is the time to come \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to save Medicare from impending \nbankruptcy. Now is not the time to raise taxes.\n  I hope our colleagues will understand that there is a better way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Ohio be recognized following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had a conversation earlier today with the \ndistinguished Republican leader. It appears now that we are going to \nget the appropriations bill from the House of Representatives. The bill \nis bipartisan, and everybody has worked hard. There are some conference \nreports we have completed. Yet we didn't find them to work on the \nfloor, for reasons everyone understands. That bill will come over from \nthe House tomorrow. We can move to that with a simple majority vote, \nand then if I have to file cloture on it tomorrow, we would have a \nSaturday cloture vote. Thirty hours after that--sometime Sunday \nmorning--we would have a vote on the conference report.\n  I have indicated to the Republican leader that it would probably be \nto everyone's advantage if we allow people to go home for the weekend, \nrather than going through all these procedural gyrations.\n  We have worked hard. I had a Senator come to me and say she hadn't \nbeen home in 2 or 3 weeks, and it was not a good situation. That \nSenator said if we have to be here this weekend, she will be here. We \nneed to not be doing things just to delay. I understand the Republican \nleader doesn't want to do health care. I appreciate that, and we have \ndifferent positions on that issue.\n  I see no reason to punish everybody this weekend. I hope the minority \nwill give strong consideration to the proposal I have made. We are \nwaiting for a score to come back from CBO anyway. Anybody who has had \nexperience with CBO knows that will take a matter of days. So I hope \nthe minority will allow a little bit of time to go by so that we can \nhave our respite from the tedious work we have been doing on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I have come to the floor most days \nreading letters from people in Ohio--from Springfield to Mansfield to \nMarion--who thought they had good insurance a year or two ago, if you \nasked them, but found out their insurance was not so good when they had \na preexisting condition or when they got very sick and the costs were \nhigh and the insurance companies cut them off. In some cases, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, in my State and across the country, women so \noften are paying higher premiums than men.\n  Our bill will fix a lot of those things. One of the things the bill \nstill needs to fix--and we have gotten letters on this--is what \nhappened with the price of prescription drugs. There are many things I \nlike about the bill and a few I don't. Here is one.\n  I rise to support the Dorgan amendment No. 2793. I will start with a \nstory.\n  About a decade ago, maybe a little more than that--I live in northern \nOhio--and I used to take a bus load of senior citizens every couple of \nmonths--maybe a dozen times--from Elyria to Sandusky into Toledo and \ninto Detroit and into Ontario--across the river into Windsor, Ontario. \nI did that so seniors could buy less expensive prescription drugs. I \nwould go into a drugstore in Windsor--same drug, same packaging and \ndosage, but the price would be one-half, sometimes one-third of what \nseniors paid in the United States. In many ways, it broke my heart \nthat, as a Federal official, I was going to another country to buy \nsomething that was more often than not made in the United States, when \nthe drug companies charge twice or three times that to the United \nStates as in Canada. But I thought it made sense for seniors in my \nState--congressional district in those days--to go to Canada and be \nable to get those prescriptions.\n  They then would be able to get a refill every 3 or 6 months at least \na couple times with that doctor's signature they got in Canada to buy \nthose drugs.\n  I appreciate Senator Dorgan and Senator Snowe offering this \namendment. I hope it is signed into law as part of health care reform. \nIf the drug companies were struggling and not making any money, it \nwould be a different situation. Drug companies earn higher profits than \nalmost any other industry in America. In fact, they have been one of \nthe three most profitable industries in our Nation for decades.\n  Just last year, the pharmaceutical industry was the third most \nprofitable industry in America, ranking right up there with the oil \nconglomerates.\n  Let's face it, to call these corporations American is a stretch. Most \nof them are multinational, and most reap huge profits from around the \nglobe.\n  It is true they earn higher profits in our country than in any other, \nbut that hardly qualifies them as patriotic.\n\n[[Page S12793]]\n\n  As drugmakers earn billions, U.S. drug spending is fueling double-\ndigit increases in health insurance premiums. There is a reason health \ninsurance premiums go up. Certainly, the insurance industry is one of \nthe reasons. We know about insurance industry profits. We know about \ninsurance industry executive salaries. In the 10 largest health \ninsurance companies in this country, CEO's average around $11 million \nin income. That is part of the reason.\n  Another reason is drug prices continue to fuel the high cost of \nhealth insurance. Drug prices continue to drain tax dollars out of the \nFederal Treasury, and drug spending is undermining the financial \nsecurity of millions of seniors and other Americans, of course, but \nespecially seniors who can ill afford to be the piggy bank for big \nPhRMA's--that is a drug company trade association--global operations.\n  Because we do not allow importation--a decision our government has \nreached in all too close consultation with the drug lobby--Americans \nare forced to pay more for the same drugs than everyone else in the \nworld.\n  It is not about safety. We know that. The equivalent of the Food and \nDrug Administration in Canada or in France or in Germany or in Israel \nor in Japan knows how to make sure drugs are safe in their country. It \nis not a question of safety. It is a question of industry profits.\n  Prohibiting importation has cost American consumers and taxpayers \ndearly. It has driven up the cost of insurance premiums and it has \ndriven up the cost of Medicare, paid by taxpayers, Medicaid, paid by \ntaxpayers, TRICARE, paid by taxpayers, and all Federal health care \nprograms, again paid by taxpayers.\n  It has reduced--and this is equally important--not just the cost, but \nit reduces access to lifesaving medicines. Some people simply cannot \nafford the cost of these drugs. It has reduced seniors' budgets to the \npoint where they buy groceries or heat their homes or purchase \nprescription drugs but not both. Too often seniors cut their pills in \nhalf, take their prescriptions in smaller doses, and that, obviously, \nis jeopardizing health also.\n  This amendment is a step in the right direction for increasing access \nto those drugs.\n  In 2008, the pharmaceutical industry had more than a 19-percent \nprofit margin and had sales of $300 billion. I am way more interested \nin protecting U.S. consumers, U.S. taxpayers, and U.S. small businesses \nthat are burdened by these high drug costs than I am U.S. drugmakers \nand their inflated drug prices.\n  The CBO estimates this amendment will save the government $20 billion \nover the next 10 years--$20 billion. I wish to encourage more \ncompetition. I do not want this body, again, to come down on the side \nof preserving monopolies.\n  As it stands now, the U.S. Government permits the drug industry to \nhold American consumers hostage. Meanwhile, the largest drug \ncompanies--Pfizer, Merck, and others--continue to outsource operations \nabroad to cut costs and increase profit margins.\n  Here is what happens: It is OK for big PhRMA to look abroad to cut \ncosts and boost profits while American consumers and businesses are \nstuck paying the bill. The drug industry is trying to convince us--the \nSenate, the House and, more importantly, trying to convince the \nAmerican people--that importation is unsafe. Wait a second. They go to \nChina--I had hearings about this in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee. We have had hearings, which Senator Kennedy, a \ncouple years ago, asked me to chair, involving American drug companies \noutsourcing their production to China. They could not tell us about the \nentire supply chain that supplied the ingredients to these drug \noperations in China that later made their way back to the United \nStates. We know about Heparin, a drug that killed several people in \nToledo, OH, because it was contaminated with who knows what ingredients \nthat came from China.\n  So these drug companies are arguing these products are unsafe, these \ndrugs you can buy in Windsor, Ontario, or pharmaceuticals you can buy \nin Bristol, England, or pharmaceuticals you can buy in Marseilles, \nFrance, or pharmaceuticals you can buy in Dusseldorf. They are saying \nthose are unsafe, but they are unwilling to import drugs themselves.\n  Lipitor, one of the best-selling drugs in the United States, for \nyears, was made in Dublin. They can import their drugs from abroad. \nThey can import ingredients from China, which has nothing like the Food \nand Drug Administration, and they are going to hire all their lobbyists \nand they are going to go around desk to desk, Member to Member, office \nto office--435 House Members, 100 Senate Members--and they are going to \ntell us these drugs are unsafe? We know better than that.\n  This amendment would simply make imported medicines available to \nconsumers. It is a free-market mechanism. Open it so people can \ncompete, giving customers more purchasing power so they can pay lower \nprices. The drug industry should not be protected from the same \ncompetition that every other industry faces in a global marketplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan amendment of Senator \nDorgan from North Dakota, Senator Snowe, Senator Grassley, and Senator \nMcCain--all three Republicans from Maine, Iowa, and Arizona. This \namendment makes sense for taxpayers. It makes sense for consumers. It \nmakes sense for businesses. It makes sense for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to speak to a couple issues this \nevening. The first one has to do with what we understand to be the \nevolving so-called deal that is being worked out by the other side on \nthe public option/government plan and the attempt to try and reach 60 \nvotes on the other side, in what appears to be a process that continues \nto unravel and break down because every single day there is a new story \nabout some new gimmick thrown out there to attract the requisite number \nof Senators to get to that threshold of 60.\n  The most recent one--and, of course, as I said, I cannot verify all \nof this because we have not been privy or included in any of the \ndiscussions that have occurred behind closed doors. In fact, one of \nthose meetings just occurred earlier this evening.\n  We read from press reports that one of the proposals contemplated by \nthe majority to get that requisite number of votes is the expansion of \nthe Medicare Program. What is interesting about that is that has \nengaged organizations that prior to this time had essentially been at \nthe table and negotiated their own kind of agreement. But that has \ngotten the interest level up of the American Hospital Association, the \nFederation of American Hospitals, the AMA, the physician group, and I \neven have something here from the Mayo Clinic.\n  It is interesting that would be considered now as an alternative to \nwhat previously had been discussed in terms of a public option. Here is \nwhy. Medicare, as we all know, is destined to be bankrupt in the year \n2017. It is a very large program that benefits a lot of seniors across \nthe country. We all support reforming it, making it more sustainable, \nputting it on a pathway to where it will be solvent well beyond that \ndate and extending its lifespan.\n\n  What this would appear to do is allow people younger than 65 or 62, \ndown to 55, to buy into Medicare. Essentially, you would allow more \npeople to participate in a program that, as I said before, is destined \nto be bankrupt in the year 2017. So what you are doing with this \nproposal--because we all know the underlying bill cuts Medicare \nreimbursements to hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, home health \nagencies, and to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries by about $1 trillion \nover 10 years, when it is fully implemented--you are going to take $1 \ntrillion of revenue out of Medicare--remember, this is a program that \nis already destined to be bankrupt in 2017--you are going to take $1 \ntrillion of revenue out of it over the 10-year period, when it is fully \nimplemented, and expand and add the number of people who are going to \nbe on it. It is equivalent to putting more people on a sinking ship. In \nfact, that is what has gotten the attention of provider groups around \nthe country.\n  Hospitals, as we know, cannot recover their costs with the \nreimbursements they are currently receiving under Medicare. In most \nStates, it varies a little bit--80 to 90 cents on the\n\n[[Page S12794]]\n\ndollar. So hospitals, every time they serve a Medicare patient, shift \nthat cost over to the private payers and increase costs for everybody \nwho is receiving insurance in the private market.\n  Essentially, what you will be doing is expanding the government-run \nMedicare Program which underreimburses hospitals, physicians and other \nhealth care providers and forcing even more of a cost shift. You are \nexacerbating the cost shift already occurring, making it worse and \ngetting all the provider hospital groups--the American Hospital \nAssociation, the American Medical Association--engaged in this debate \nbecause they see what a train wreck it would be for them.\n  Frankly, what that means is you would have a lot of providers that \nwould not be able to make ends meet. They would have to shut their \ndoors and go out of business because many of them are very dependent on \nMedicare patients.\n  In my State of South Dakota, most of our hospitals, especially in \nrural areas, are heavily dependent--70 percent or thereabouts--between \nMedicare and Medicaid. If they are not a critical access hospital and \nstill getting reimbursed under the traditional Medicare Program, they \nare going to have a very hard time making ends meet because right now \nwhat they do is what all hospitals do. They shift costs over to the \nprivate payers.\n  Here is what AMA said about the proposal:\n\n       AMA has a longstanding policy of opposing expansion of \n     Medicare given the projections for the future.\n\n  That is what the doctors group said.\n  The American Hospital Association urged all Senators to reject \nexpansion of Medicare and Medicaid as part of the public option, saying \nMedicare pays hospitals just 91 cents of each dollar of care provided. \nThis again would expand the number of people they would have to cover \nand shrink the private-payer market and lump more and more of the costs \non those so everybody else's premiums would go up.\n  The Federation of American Hospitals, which is the private hospitals \nacross the country, said any Medicare buy-in would invariably lead to \ncrowdout of the private health insurance market, placing more people \ninto Medicare. Such a policy will further negatively impact hospitals \nafter we have already agreed to contribute a maximum level to \nsustainable reductions in the deal they struck earlier. It seems to me \nthese deals have fallen off the table.\n  This latest proposal--if, in fact, what we are reading is true--I \nthink they recognize would be a disaster. Here is what the Mayo Clinic \nin their letter said:\n\n       Any plan to expand Medicare, which is the government's \n     largest public plan, beyond its current scope does not solve \n     the nation's health care crisis, but compounds it.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Expanding the system to persons 55 to 64 years old would \n     ultimately hurt patients by accelerating the financial ruin \n     of hospitals and doctors across the country. A majority of \n     Medicare providers currently suffer great financial loss \n     under the program. Mayo Clinic alone lost $840 million last \n     year under Medicare. As a result of these types of losses, a \n     growing number of providers have begun to limit the number of \n     Medicare patients in their practices.\n\n  That is what we are talking about. If you expand this program and you \nhave a reimbursement system that currently does not cover the cost of \nhospitals, they are going to cease covering Medicare patients in the \nsame way they currently are not covering Medicaid patients.\n  They say about 50 percent of physicians today have chosen not to \naccept Medicaid patients. So you compound the access problem that many \npeople in rural areas already experience.\n  There are big problems with this proposal. I have to come back to \nwhat Congressman Anthony Weiner said about this issue:\n\n       Extending this successful program to those between 55 and \n     64, a plan I proposed in July, would be the largest expansion \n     of Medicare in 44 years and would perhaps get us on the path \n     to a single payer model.\n\n  Therein, I think, lies the ultimate goal, and that is to expand \nMedicare to where we have a whole government-run health care system in \nthis country on the way to single-payer status. That is precisely what \nmany of our colleagues on the other side want to see happen.\n  Ironically, there are some who have expressed concern about this. Our \ncolleague from North Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad, said when asked about this proposal:\n\n       It's got many of the same problems I have with previous \n     versions of the public option. That then ties you to Medicare \n     levels of reimbursements for a whole new population.\n\n  He contended that the hospitals in his State would go bankrupt. His \nState of North Dakota is not unlike my State of South Dakota. Hospitals \nare not going to be able to make it if these reimbursement levels that \nare currently afforded them under Medicare are extended to a whole new \npopulation.\n  I hope this is a bad idea that is just being thrown out as one of \nthese things that is being thrown at a wall and hoping it sticks in a \ndesperate effort to get to 60 on the other side because this is a bad \nidea and the provider groups are weighing in heavily against it.\n  It is pretty clear it would be a disaster for health care delivery in \nrural areas of the country and, for that matter, Mayo Clinic and many \nof the providers that weighed in on this. It would literally make it \nmore difficult for people to have access to health care and \nexacerbating the cost-shifting issue that already exists with regard to \nthe private-payer market and make their costs and everybody else's \ncosts go up more.\n  I want to shift gears for a moment because tomorrow Senator Hutchison \nand I will be offering a motion to commit. Basically, what it deals \nwith is the whole tax component of this health care reform bill. In \nvery simple terms--and I will demonstrate exactly why this is a \nrelevant issue--if you look at the cost of this health care proposal, \nthe Reid proposal before us, you can see what the costs are in the \nearly years and then you can see how the costs explode in the outyears. \nThere is a reason for that. The revenues kick in right away. The tax \nincreases start coming in right away, but the spending proposals and \nmany of the benefits that will go out under this bill don't occur until \nmuch later.\n  So what we have is a 10-year budgetary picture and cost for this \nprogram that completely understates what the true cost of the program \nis. If you look at this particular chart, look at the years 2010 to \n2019, you can see how, particularly in the early years, it doesn't look \nlike there is that much spending. In fact, the number in the first 10 \nyears is $1.2 trillion in spending. However, if you look at the cost of \nthis when it is fully implemented--take the year 2014 and extend it \nthrough the year 2023--you can see how the costs explode, and the total \nfully implemented cost over a 10-year period is $2.5 trillion.\n  There is a reason for that, as I said. A lot of budgetary gimmicks \nwere used to understate the cost, particularly in the first 10 years, \nso people could say it costs only $1 trillion. In fact, as you can see, \nwhen it is fully implemented, it is $2.5 trillion. One of the major \nreasons for that is because the tax increases in the bill take effect \n23 days from now--January 1 of the year 2010. That is when many of the \ntax increases in this legislation go into effect. But the spending and \nthe benefits that are going to be distributed--the exchanges and the \npremiums, the premium subsidies, and that sort of thing, the tax \ncredits--don't begin to kick in until the year 2014 or 1,484 days \nlater. So for those 1,484 days--well, back out the 23 days from that--\nso for those 1,461 days, taxes are going to be assessed and levied \nagainst people in this country--on small businesses, families, and \nindividuals--but you will not see any benefits for over 1,000 days, \nalmost 1,500 days.\n  What the Hutchison-Thune motion to commit does is it aligns the tax \nincreases, the fees--the taxes included in this proposal--with the \nbenefits in terms of timeline so that the tax increases and the \nbenefits occur at the same time. In other words, we would delay the tax \nincreases in this bill until such time as the benefits package and \nstructure would kick in so that they are in sync.\n  Right now, there is essentially 4 years--at least 4 years--of tax \nrevenues coming in, tax increases being borne by people all across this \ncountry, including businesses. Incidentally, there is a lot of \ndiscussion now about job creation and the need to grow the economy. The \nworst thing you can do to small businesses, when you are trying\n\n[[Page S12795]]\n\nto create jobs, is to levy new taxes on them. But that is what this \nbill does. And, by the way, in that first 4 years, almost $72 billion \nof taxes will be collected. I say the first 4 years, I think that is \nthrough the year 2014. But you have all these taxes that kick in on \nJanuary 1 of 2010--less than 23 days from now--and then actually you \nhave this amount of time--as I said, almost 1,500 days--before the \nbenefits begin to pay out.\n  So all we are saying in our motion to commit is let's align the tax \nincreases and the benefits structure so you don't have this period of 4 \nyears where people are paying taxes and receiving literally no benefits \nunder this health care reform bill.\n  The advantage that has is that it accurately reflects the cost of \nthis program in the first 10 years, rather than understating it because \nof the revenues that kick in immediately and the benefits that don't \nkick in until much later. It is very straightforward, very simple, very \nunderstandable. Tax increases that are designed to kick in on January 1 \nof this next year would not kick in until such time as the benefits \nkick in. So the fees, the taxes, and the tax increases in this bill are \nall aligned and sync'd up, so to speak, with when the spending under \nthe bill begins.\n  Of course, what that does is give us a more accurate reflection of \nthe overall cost of the bill. And many of these tax increases which \nwill kick in 3 weeks from now, or a little over 3 weeks from now, on \nJanuary 1 of next year, are going to be distributed across a wide range \nof businesses, but most will be passed on to consumers across this \ncountry. In fact, the CBO, in a letter to Senator Evan Bayh on November \n30 of this year, said essentially that all these fees and taxes in the \nbill--and there are fees on medical devices, there are fees on \nprescription drugs, there are fees on health care plans--all these fees \nwould tend to raise insurance premiums. In testimony in front of the \nFinance Committee, the CBO, when this question was posed during the \ndeliberations at the Finance Committee level as to what all these fees \nwould do to insurance premiums, they said, roughly, it would increase \npremiums dollar for dollar.\n  So we have the taxes and fees that will kick in immediately, and that \nwill have an upward impact on premiums so that people across the \ncountry will begin to see those premium increases take effect. The tax \nincreases, of course, are taking effect on medical device manufacturers \nand on prescription drugs, and there is a whole other range of taxes in \nhere--there is the tax on high-cost insurance plans, there is a health \ninsurer fee, there is a Botox tax, which starts January 1 of 2010, and \nyou can kind of go down the list. There are limits on FSAs, flexible \nspending accounts, which is something people use to put aside money so \nthey can buy a high-deductible plan and have dollars available to deal \nwith the incidental health care costs they have. So the taxes are going \nto go up on those. You can go through this whole list of taxes, all of \nwhich, as I said, are going to go into effect in the near term, but \nnone of the benefits kick in until many years later.\n  Unfortunately for the American public, they are going to see the \npremium increases that will come as these taxes are imposed on all \nthese various sectors of the health care economy and which will all be \npassed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums. So the American \nconsumer--the American public, the taxpayers of this country--are going \nto see the costs immediately and won't see the benefits for 5 years. \nThat is not fair. It is not the right way to set policy here in \nWashington, DC. It is much more transparent if we have these dates of \nthe tax increases and the fees and the taxes in this bill sync'd up--\nsynchronized, aligned--with the benefits when they begin so that \neverything starts at the same time.\n  So the motion to commit is, again, simply a motion to commit this \nback to the Finance Committee, and to create a level playing field \nwhere the revenues that are raised under the bill don't begin to kick \nin until the benefits start to kick in and the spending starts to kick \nin. That will give us the true picture, the actual picture of the cost \nwhich, as I said before, is $2.5 trillion over 10 years when it is \nfully implemented, and not the $1 trillion, or under $1 trillion that \nis being used by the other side. You have to look at the full picture \nover a 10-year period, when it is fully implemented. Obviously, that \ngives you a very different perspective about the overall true cost of \nthis particular proposal.\n  The basic contours of this bill we have in front of us have not \nchanged, nor do we expect them to change. They will tweak around with \nthis government plan. There was already a vote on the issue of \nabortion, which I happen to believe taxpayer funds should not be used \nto finance. We have had that vote. There will be some other votes on \nindividual aspects. But some of those things are not going to affect \nthe fundamental core elements of this plan, which have stayed the same \nthroughout the entire process. And those core elements are a massive \nexpansion of Federal spending--$2.5 trillion over 10 years when it is \nfully implemented--massive cuts to Medicare--about $1 trillion over 10 \nyears, when fully implemented, affecting hospitals, nursing homes, home \nhealth agencies, hospices, and beneficiaries of Medicare Advantage, of \nwhich there are about 11 million across the country--and it is also \nfinanced with increases in taxes, which I have mentioned. Those are the \nbasic components of this bill. Seventy new government programs are \ncalled for. All the new spending, all the new bureaucracy, all the new \ntaxes, and all the Medicare cuts, those things have not changed since \nthis bill first started being debated several months ago.\n\n  That is where we are today. That is why I believe this is such a bad \nproposal for the future of this country. Because even after all that, \nif you look at the impact it has on premiums, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, 90 percent of Americans end up the same or \nworse off. When I say the same, I mean year over year increases in \ntheir insurance premiums that are double the rate of inflation. So if \nyou are buying in the small-group market today, or the large-group \nmarket, according to the Congressional Budget Office, you are going to \nsee your insurance premiums continue to go up over time. If you buy in \nthe individual market, you are going to see them continue to go up, but \nway more--a 10- to 13-percent increase in premiums for people who buy \nin the individual marketplace, above and beyond the rate of inflation \nthat will impact people in the large- and small-group markets.\n  So the bottom line is, if you are looking for reform, if you are the \naverage American citizen out there, the person I represent in South \nDakota, who is hearing about health care reform, to them it means a \ncouple of things. It means affordable access to health insurance for \npeople across this country; and something that most of us--at least \nhere on our side--think ought to be a part of this, and that is \nmeasures or proposals that actually bend the cost curve down rather \nthan up. But what we have seen consistently throughout the course of \nthis debate, with all the spending and all the tax increases and all \nthe Medicare cuts, is no positive impact on premiums. The best that 90 \npercent of Americans can hope for is to maintain the status quo--stay \nwhere you are--which is double your increases year over year, double \nthe rate of inflation in your health insurance premiums or, worse yet, \nincreases of 10 to 13 percent above and beyond that. That is what 90 \npercent of Americans are looking at as a result of the health care \nreform proposal that is currently before the Senate.\n  There is a better way, and we believe the way to get this right is to \nstart over and to actually focus on solutions that will drive down the \ncost of health insurance, that will bend that cost curve down, such as \ninterstate competition, allowing pooling for small businesses, medical \nmalpractice reform. We have a whole series of things that we think \nrepresent the consensus view of the people in this country. There is \ncommon ground we can all stand on. But regrettably, we have not been \nincluded in any of the discussions, nor have any of our ideas been a \npart of those discussions. Rather, they have chosen to pursue this \ncourse of a big spending program, with the higher taxes, and the \nMedicare cuts and the higher premiums.\n  I truly hope there will be support, as this process moves forward and \nwe get onto the critical votes ahead of us, for a more rational step-\nby-step approach, doing this right, getting away from\n\n[[Page S12796]]\n\nthis huge massive expansion of the Federal Government here in \nWashington, DC, and seriously focusing on solutions that actually do \nbend the cost curve down, that don't rely on these huge cuts to \nMedicare, that don't rely on these huge tax increases, but that \nactually find savings. And they can be achieved in the market by \nputting policies in place that will constrain costs and put downward \npressure on the prices most people pay for health insurance in this \ncountry. It can be done. But it is going to require some boldness on \nthe part of some of our colleagues on the other side.\n  I think our side is pretty well united. This is a bad policy, a bad \nprescription, if you will, for America's future. But we are going to \nneed some help from a courageous Democrat or two to make sure this \nmassive expansion of the Federal Government is defeated and that we can \ngo back, start over, do this in a step-by-step way--the right way--and \nin a way that actually does lower costs for people in this country. I \ncertainly think that is what my constituents in South Dakota expect, \nand I think that is what most Americans expect. They deserve to have \nhealth care reform that gives them that outcome--lower cost and access \nto affordable health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask for 10 minutes to be allotted to \nme under the minority time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in the past few months this body has \nbeen forced to stand aside as Senator Reid and a few others crafted a \n2,000-page bill behind closed doors, the one we are on right now. \nUnfortunately, the product that was resolved at the closed-door \nmeetings--at least the one we have now, I don't know about a future \none--still raises taxes by $\\1/2\\ trillion. Probably under any new bill \nthat comes out you are going to have taxes going up $\\1/2\\ trillion, \ncut Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion, raise premiums on American families, \nfail to bend the cost curve down, and expand government's encroachment \nfurther and further into people's health care decisions.\n  What I want to go through is a series of charts about how inflation \nis going to end up being the tax collector's best friend in this \noverall plan and how the tax of inflation is going to be one of the key \nfeatures of how the overall bill is paid for.\n  I hope most people remember when we had inflation. A lot of people \nmaybe don't remember when we had significant inflation. It is a cruel \ntax. It is a very cruel tax on people on fixed income, a very cruel tax \non people in low-income status because constantly the dollars you have \nstay pretty stable, and everything you are buying goes up. So inflation \nkills you. It kills you in the pocketbook and is one of the things we \nhave to be concerned about, particularly with the amount of money that \nis out in the money supply today and the likelihood of this moving \nforward and how it is built in to pay for this huge expansion that we \ncan't afford in this bill.\n  I am joining my colleagues today in speaking against the $500 billion \nin new taxes that are in the Democrats' proposal to levy on the \nAmerican people and the job-creating small businesses this is going to \nbe put on, in an attempt to pay for this big 2,000-page bill.\n  This monstrous bill is flawed economic policy. I will develop that \npoint for you as well. It fails to lower health care premiums, fails to \nbend the cost curve down, and will further cripple the struggling \neconomy with massive and burdensome tax increases.\n  This careless legislation reminds me of a cautionary tale that is \nstill being played out in another part of the world. That is what \nhappened in the early 1990s in Japan. Japan, a surging economic giant \nat the time, suffered a severe economic recession in the early 1990s, \nof which the effects are still lingering even today in Japan.\n  During Japan's ``lost decade,'' from 1991 to 2003, their gross \nnational product grew a paltry 1.4 percent annually, creating a decade \nof stagflation--that is where you have a stagnant overall growth but \ninflation in the economy--and limited economic growth. Most economists \nbelieve that Japan's economic recession would not have lasted nearly as \nlong as it did had it not been for one fatal error that the Japanese \ngovernment made. In the late 1990s, as their economy was recovering and \nappearing to be pulling out of its economic slump--so the economy is \njust getting going, starting to pull out of the economic slump--the \nJapanese government made a catastrophic decision to raise taxes. The \nresult was that this one decision aborted the strong recovery the \nJapanese economy was starting to experience and plunged it back further \ninto an economic downturn that lasted for many more years, the hangover \nfrom which is still on them today.\n  What are we doing here today, discussing a $2.5 trillion government \nentitlement expansion that raises taxes $\\1/2\\ trillion, plays budget \ngimmicks with our $12 trillion deficit and raises health premiums and \ncosts for all Americans in the middle of the country's economic \nrecession? What are we even talking about, why are we doing it? That is \nwhat I get from the people back home. They say why are you talking \nabout this while are we in this recession? Why are you talking about \nthis with the health care situation the way it is, to raise the cost, \nraise the insurance premiums, cutting Medicare when Medicare needs \nmore, not money taken out of it? Now is not the time, this is not the \nbill, and this is not the way the American people want to see their \nhealth care reformed. What the American people want is for this body to \nlower health care costs and induce an economic recovery that creates \njobs, not kills them, and grows the American economy, not thwarts it.\n  The way to do that is not to raise taxes, as is evidenced by what \nhappened in Japan. Increased mandates, increased regulations, and \nincreased taxes are a recipe for disaster. It is a recipe that kills \njobs. In fact, President Obama's chief economic advisor, Dr. Christina \nRomer, stated earlier this year that as many as 5.5 million jobs could \nbe lost due to the Democrats' new tax proposal in this 2000-page \ngovernment takeover of health care. Nothing can be worse at a time when \nthe Nation is already experiencing a 10-percent unemployment, a 26-year \nhigh. This bill will impose $28 billion in new taxes on employers that \nwill ultimately be paid by American workers in the form of reduced \nwages and lost jobs.\n  Under this burdensome legislation employees will face stunted wages \nand the loss of their benefits as their employers attempt to find ways \nto fund these newly imposed mandates. As small businesses struggle to \nkeep their doors open, tough decisions will have to be made on whether \nto raise prices, cut wages, or let go workers in order to find the \nfunds necessary to comply with the Federal mandates imposed in this \nbill.\n  Furthermore, this bill will kill jobs by penalizing small businesses \nwho are looking to grow--and small businesses are the growth engine for \nthe country. In this bill, firms with more than 50 workers that did not \noffer coverage would have to pay a penalty or a tax to the Federal \nGovernment for each full-time worker if any of their workers obtain \nsubsidized coverage through the government-run exchange.\n  What businessman would decide to hire that 50th employee, knowing \nfull well if he did that the government would penalize his business and \nslam him with a new costly tax? So now people try to stay under this \nlimit rather than constantly looking to grow the business.\n  Furthermore, under certain circumstances, firms with relatively few \nemployees and relatively low average wages would be eligible for tax \ncredits to cover portions of their health insurance premiums. That is \nrelatively few would be eligible.\n  I ask, what employer would decide to increase the number of employees \nor increase the amount of their wages if they stand to lose government \nhandouts, supports, subsidies, or face an increased tax burden? They \nsimply will not be willing to do it.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of this legislation is the use of \ninflation\n\n[[Page S12797]]\n\nto fund it--the use of inflation, a hidden tax increase on working \nfamilies, to fund it.\n  I am the ranking member on the Joint Economic Committee and we look \nat these aspects a great deal. The use of inflation is built into the \nbase of this to fund it. We know the consumer, the individual taxpayer, \npays all taxes. No matter how the government claims to assess those \ntaxes, they are paid by individuals.\n  I have a couple of examples I want to show. First, I want to talk \nabout: High-cost Plans Tax Hits the Middle Class. Let me talk about \nthat. This is the tax on the so-called Cadillac health insurance plans.\n  We know that insurance policies and benefit plans will be altered to \navoid that tax. In other words, if you get an insurance plan that is up \nabove a certain level you get taxed on that higher end, that so-called \nCadillac plan. So in all probability most groups will not provide this \nhigh-quality health care because they say you are going to get taxed on \nit.\n  Benefits that taxpayers with insurance currently receive on a pretax \nbasis--right now they get it so the company is paying for it, is pretax \nto the individual--will gradually shift to after-tax benefits resulting \nin higher payroll and income taxes. So now that you have cut this \nCadillac plan to get underneath it being taxed, and then the company \nsays OK, we will pay you in wages or we will do this somewhat \ndifferently. Then you have to go around and supplement or have a lower \nquality of health insurance. You are going to have to pay for it with \nafter-tax dollars. That will result in more taxes, but you don't get \nmore benefits from this. This is a big tax hit on the middle class of \npeople who are going to have to pay this as their higher income or \ntheir higher based insurance plans are taxed.\n\n  Here is what the Joint Committee on Taxation said about the \ndistribution impact of the high-cost tax plans: Despite the President's \npromises the majority claims--91 percent of taxpayers will be affected \nby this tax earning under $200,000. The tax will hit married filers \nmore severely than singles; 62 percent of the high-cost plans tax \nimpact will fall on married filers compared to 25 percent on single \nfilers. Why are we building the marriage penalty back into the \ninsurance? We worked a long time in this body to get rid of key \nportions of the marriage penalty, saying we should not tax marriage, we \nshould support this institution. It is being built back into this plan.\n  This bill also imposes an additional Medicare tax on wage and \nsalary--or certain types of business incomes of single taxpayers with \nincomes above $200,000 and married taxpayers with incomes of more than \n$250,000. Right off the bat there is a new marriage penalty. People \nliving together but unmarried making $150,000 each won't pay the tax. \nTwo married people paying the same amount will. What is right about \nthat?\n  Making matters worse, the thresholds are not indexed for inflation--\nno indexing for inflation. Inflation is a cruel tax and unfortunately \nin this situation it is not only going to be inflation, but you are \ngoing to be taxed, then, as you get inflated into these categories. \nFrom 2013 to 2019, the number of returns of people earning under \n$200,000 in today's dollars will rise from 75,000 to 345,000 under the \ncurrent trajectory on inflation. We are making the tax man's best \nfriend inflation. That is wrong. So you are going to move 75,000 to \n345,000 for new tax revenue. Married couples will be hit hard, as I \nmentioned earlier. Then you are looking at inflation: 2013, 2015, 2017, \n2019--the number of people growing into this taxable category affected \nby this Medicare tax that will increase in 2009 dollars from $75,000 to \n$345,000.\n  If you want to think about this, think about when the alternative \nminimum tax was first put in place. The alternative minimum tax was \nsupposed to be on very wealthy individuals. That was all it was going \nto be on. But it was not indexed for inflation. Now you get whole \nswatches of people hit by it and this body regularly tries to change \nthat or deal with it on a 1-year basis because it was not indexed for \ninflation. What you build into the base of this bill is, if you want to \npay for the bill, you want inflation. So you get inflation and it hurts \npeople on fixed incomes and you get more people taxed than you started \noff with. You didn't tell them about it at the outset.\n  This plan clearly should be indexed for inflation. We know that \nshould take place. Yet this is where a major part of the money for the \nbill comes from--inflation. Is that something the Federal Government \nshould be banking on, that we will get inflation to pay for this health \ncare bill? I don't think the American public wants to see that taking \nplace.\n  To put this in context, let's not just look at returns under \n$200,000, let's look at all returns and how this tax will spread. \nAccording to the Census Bureau estimates, between 2013 and 2019, the \nworking-age population of the country will grow by 1.6 percent. Joint \nTax estimates that the number of returns that will be affected by this \ntax will grow by 52.6 percent and revenue collected as a result of the \ntax will grow by more than 54 percent. Over time, the Reid bill \nMedicare tax isn't just for the wealthy. Comparing the increase in \ntaxes with growth in the working-age population, this is how many more \npeople will be impacted. Inflation becomes the tax man's key friend.\n  During Japan's lost decade, from 1991 to 2003, their gross national \nproduct grew a paltry 1.4 percent annually, creating a decade of \nstagflation and limited economic growth. It was because of policies \nsuch as this where you have inflation, where you have tax increases put \nin place. These are the things that caused that to take place. It \nshould not be done.\n  I will just add as a final note, when I am talking with people back \nhome, all the time they raise this health care bill. They talk about it \nconstantly. If they are small businesspeople, they are talking about \nnot doing anything until the political environment is more stable in \ntheir estimation, about how much taxes we are talking about, about how \nmuch regulation we will be talking about.\n  You have what is going on with a climate change debate and \nregulations in Copenhagen. That tells a lot of people in my area who \nare energy users and producers, don't do anything until this \nstabilizes. When you talk about tax increases or inflation being a part \nof this proposal, you have a bunch of people saying: Don't do anything. \nJust stay on the sideline. That is a prescription for no job growth. \nThat is a prescription for killing jobs. You want people out there \ninvesting and creating jobs and opportunities. You want them to see a \nstable political environment where they are not worried about \nincreasing taxes, not worried about increasing regulation but, rather, \nsaying: This is a stable environment in which we can invest and grow. \nThat is not what they are doing today. That is repeating the lesson the \nJapanese learned of raising taxes when you are coming out of a \nrecession. It is harmful. It is the wrong economic strategy. It should \nnot be a part of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I voted to support Senator McCain's motion \nto commit the bill back to the Finance Committee to protect all seniors \nfrom the Medicare cuts in this bill.\n  Section 3201(g) of the Reid bill shields Florida from the sweeping \npayment reductions to Medicare Advantage plans. Democratic Senators \nfrom Florida, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania have also reportedly \nsought carve outs to protect seniors in their States from these cuts.\n  It is unfair to protect only seniors in Florida from these cuts. \nPresident Obama said if you like what you have, you can keep it. I \nbelieve that principle should apply to all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  At least some of my Democratic colleagues are honest about what they \nare doing. The New York Times yesterday quoted the Senator from Florida \nas saying, ``It would be intolerable to ask senior citizens to give up \nsubstantial health benefits they are enjoying under Medicare . . . I am \noffering an amendment to shield seniors from those benefit cuts.''\n  Bloomberg News also quoted that same Senator as saying, ``We're \ntrying to grandfather in seniors so that they don't lose the benefits \nthey have.''\n  Now, I disagree with these sweetheart deals. But I understand the \nmotivation behind them. We should not be\n\n[[Page S12798]]\n\ntaking benefits away from Medicare beneficiaries.\n  What I don't understand is how other Democrats can deny that the Reid \nbill cuts Medicare benefits. I have heard my Democratic colleagues \nrepeatedly argue that there no cuts of any ``guaranteed benefits'' in \nthe Reid bill.\n  I was not familiar with the term ``guaranteed benefits,'' so I asked \nmy staff to review the Medicare statute. They searched through the \nentire Social Security Act, which governs Medicare, and could not find \nthat term anywhere. That is because the term doesn't exist. The other \nside just made it up.\n  Medicare Advantage plans provide extra benefits to beneficiaries who \nenroll in these plans. These are the benefits that will be cut under \nthe Reid bill. Clearly the Senator from Florida understands the value \nof these benefits. That is why he and other Democrats are fighting \ntooth and nail to undo the cuts in their States.\n  At the same time, other Democratic Senators continue to argue that \nMedicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an advantage.\n  That is false. Medicare Advantage is Part C of Medicare. If you go to \nthe Web site of the Department of Health and Human Services, it says \nMedicare Advantage is part of Medicare.\n  As to the ``advantage'' part, Medicare Advantage does provide extra \nbenefits, and seniors place great value on them. It's that simple. That \nis why the Senator from Florida and others are trying to get carve outs \nfor seniors in their States.\n  Under the Reid bill, seniors will lose vision benefits. Apparently, \nthe other side does not think vision care is an advantage.\n  The Reid bill will cut dental benefits for seniors. These are also \napparently not an advantage for seniors.\n  The Reid bill will cut hearing benefits for seniors. These are \napparently not an advantage for seniors.\n  The Reid bill will cut home care for seniors with chronic illnesses. \nThe other side thinks these benefits are not an advantage.\n  The Reid bill will cut disease management programs for seniors. These \nbenefits are also apparently not an advantage.\n  The Reid bill will cut nurse help hotlines for seniors. The majority \napparently does not believe this is an advantage.\n  The Reid bill will end reduced cost sharing for primary care \nphysician visits. This is apparently not an advantage for seniors.\n  The Reid bill will eliminate reduced premiums for Part B. This is \napparently not an advantage for seniors.\n  The Reid bill will eliminate reduced cost sharing for breast cancer \nscreening. This is apparently not an advantage for seniors.\n  The Reid bill will eliminate reduced cost sharing for prostate cancer \nscreening. This is apparently not an advantage for seniors.\n  Most disturbing of all, the Reid bill will cut seniors' protections \nagainst catastrophic costs under Medicare Advantage. The other side \nsays they want to keep medical bills from driving folks into \nbankruptcy. At the same time, they are eliminating Medicare Advantage \nbenefits that actually protect Medicare beneficiaries from catastrophic \nmedical costs.\n  How is catastrophic coverage not an advantage to seniors? It seems to \nme few things could be more advantageous than not losing your life \nsavings because of medical bills.\n  It is obvious to anyone who listened to the list I just read that \nthese are real benefits. Furthermore, it should be equally clear that \nthe Reid bill will take these benefits away from millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Anyone who doubts what affect the Reid bill will have on Medicare \nbeneficiaries should look at the last time that Congress made cuts like \nthis. The impact was severe.\n  Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which included \nsimilar types of cuts. Once it took effect, nearly one out of every \nfour of the plans, then known as Medicare+Choice, pulled out of the \nprogram.\n  According to an article in the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, when the \nPrudential Medicare+Choice plan withdrew from Florida, nearly 12,000 \nseniors in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade lost their coverage of \nprescription drugs, eyeglasses, hearing aids or other benefits.\n  You can bet seniors in Broward, Palm Beach and Broward counties \nhaven't forgotten these cuts, losing their plans, sometimes their \ndoctors, and certainly those benefits.\n  According to the Baton Rouge Advocate, over 50,000 Louisiana seniors \nlost the extra benefits that had been provided by Medicare+Choice \nplans. The cuts were so disruptive and confusing that State Insurance \nCommissioner Jim Brown had to air public service announcements. You can \nbet Louisiana seniors remember those cuts.\n  After these cuts went into effect, the Chicago Daily Herald reported \nthat the Senior Health Insurance Program run by the Illinois Department \nof Insurance was ``deluged with phone calls from senior citizens \naffected by the move of some health maintenance organizations to drop \nMedicare.''\n  By that time, United Healthcare had decided to no longer offer \nMedicare+Choice plans in DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will counties. This \naffected 12,000 seniors in these Chicago suburbs.\n  By 2000, the Daily Herald reported that Aetna and Humana were also \npulling out, dropping coverage for 2,794 beneficiaries in Lake County \nand 6,180 Aetna enrollees in Cook, Lake, Kane and DuPage counties. All \nof these beneficiaries lost the extra benefits they had previously \nreceived from their plans.\n  Brian Carey, director of Senior Services for Schaumburg Township, was \nquoted as saying, ``It's just thrown so many people into, in some \ncases, a complete state of panic.''\n  By 2002, the Chicago Tribune quoted CMS administrator Tom Scully as \nsaying there were no--that's zero--Medicare plans serving Chicago and \nits suburbs.\n  If the Reid bill is passed, we will again see millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries lose the benefits they currently receive from Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Medicare beneficiaries understand this program provides real \nadvantages to those who enroll in the program. They do not want to lose \nthese benefits.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues support the McCain amendment and \nensure that these seniors continue to receive these benefits.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \noverwhelming need for health care reform. Earlier this year I asked \nSouth Dakotans to share their personal health care stories with me, the \ngood and the bad, so that I could share these with my colleagues and \nensure that the people of South Dakota have a voice in this national \ndebate. Thousands have responded to my request and through their \nstories I have gained immeasurable insight into the challenges my \nconstituents face in our current health care system. The experiences of \nthese hard working families, business leaders, patient advocates, and \nhealth care providers poignantly demonstrate the urgent need for health \ncare reform.\n  David, a farmer in Madison, SD, was forced to sell his land when a \nheart attack left him with $60,000 in medical bills. His wife Patty \nwrote to me to tell me his story. As a farmer, David couldn't afford to \nbuy private health insurance in the individual market but didn't \nqualify for public programs. Insurance companies refused him coverage \nafter his heart attack because he now had a serious preexisting \ncondition. Last year he suffered a second heart attack and accrued \nanother $100,000 in medical bills. Struggling to pay this debt, Patty \nand David exhausted all their resources. David feels he has no hope of \nfinding insurance coverage for his heart health, the very condition \nthat requires treatment the most. Patty and David live in fear of a \nserious illness knowing that, like many families, adequate health \ninsurance is beyond their reach.\n  The situation Patty and David find themselves in is not unique. A \nrecent study by the Access Project found that 44 percent of ranchers \nand farmers in South Dakota get their health insurance on the nongroup \nmarket, where they pay on average $10,395 for coverage. For the past \nfew decades, premium rates have been rapidly outpacing increases in \nincomes. According to the study, almost half of those surveyed spent \nover 10 percent of their income on health care. Like Patty and David, \none in four of the farmers and\n\n[[Page S12799]]\n\nranchers surveyed had to dip into savings, retirement funds, or take \nloans against their farms or ranches to cover health care costs.\n  Managing heart disease requires regular checkups and treatments to \nmanage the disease, improve overall health and prevent future \ncomplications. Without access to these services, Patty fears what will \nhappen to their family and their farm in the event David suffers \nanother heart attack.\n  There are several provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act to benefit Americans like Patty and David. It will extend \naccess to affordable and meaningful health insurance for all Americans. \nThe bill stands up on behalf of the American people and puts an end to \ninsurance industry abuses that have denied coverage to hardworking \nAmericans when they need it most. According to the non-partisan \nCongressional Budget Office, the Senate reform proposal will extend \ncoverage to 31 million more Americans when fully enacted.\n  Immediately after enactment, a new program will be created to provide \naffordable coverage to Americans with preexisting conditions who have \nbeen denied the coverage they need. People like David will be \nguaranteed health insurance coverage after years of struggling without \nthis basic security.\n  In addition, this legislation will create health insurance exchanges \nin every State through which those limited to the individual market \nwill have access to affordable and meaningful coverage. The exchange \nwill provide easy-to-understand information on various health insurance \nplans, help people find the right coverage to meet their needs, and \nprovide tax credits to significantly reduce the cost of purchasing that \ncoverage. No matter what plan you have, every American will have the \nadded security of knowing that your insurance company will no longer be \nable to deny coverage for preexisting conditions and won't be able to \ndrop your coverage if you get sick. Patty, David, and all Americans \ndeserve this basic security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we live in a world that is being poisoned \nby greenhouse gases of our own making. If we do not act, we face \nirreversible, catastrophic climate change. My grandchildren face a \nworld where there will be not enough food, water, or fuel, a world that \nis less diverse, less beautiful, less secure. As I speak today, we are \nwitnessing a critical moment in our fight against global warming both \nat home and abroad.\n  This past Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency acted by \nreleasing its final determination that ``greenhouse gases threaten the \npublic health and welfare of the American people.'' This was an action \nrequired by law and ordered by the Supreme Court. This finding will \nrequire EPA regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.\n  Monday's endangerment finding is a critical step in our country's \nefforts to stop global warming, which not only poses a threat to public \nhealth and welfare but to our national security. I am proud of the \nstrong science-based actions taken by this administration to live up to \nits Clean Air Act obligations to protect our health. But I strongly \nbelieve that the best way for our country to solve the problem of \ngreenhouse gas emissions is through comprehensive legislation enacted \nin the Congress of the United States. Legislation that invests in clean \nenergy and new, high-tech infrastructure will bring us to long-sought \ngoals: energy independence, good jobs for our citizens, and a healthy \nplanet for our children and grandchildren.\n  We are now closer to that kind of legislation than we have ever been. \nThe House has passed a bill that puts a limit on the pollution in our \nair. It dedicates funding to develop new domestic sources of clean \nenergy. It invests in a new infrastructure that is less dependent on \nforeign fuels and creates American jobs. And we need those jobs. Here \nin the Senate, we have improved on our colleagues' work. Senate \nlegislation makes additional investments in clean transportation. It \nprovides additional oversight and accountability and support for \ndeveloping countries. It ensures we do not add one penny to our \nnational deficit. This legislation is consistent with the budget of our \ncountry to try to help reduce the deficit and yet make us energy \nindependent, create jobs, and be sensitive to our environment.\n  But because climate change is a global problem, we need a global \nsolution. This past Monday was also an important day in the \ninternational effort. The international community began a 2-week \nmeeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, to work on an international agreement \nto address climate change.\n  The international community has set the right objectives to make the \nmeeting a success: a political agreement that promises both immediate \naction and contains the structure for a future formal treaty.\n  The agreement reached in Copenhagen should include the following \npoints: specific near-term greenhouse gas emission reduction targets--a \ncritical part--the support the developed countries will provide to the \ndeveloping world to adapt to a changing industrial economy and a \nchanging climate--we have a responsibility to help the developing \nworld--the core elements that will make up the final treaty; and a \ntimeline for reaching that agreement within the next year. We cannot \nput this off. It is critical we act timely.\n  The administration has taken several very important actions over the \npast few weeks to help us secure a global agreement in Copenhagen. \nEPA's endangerment finding sends an important signal to the world about \nthe United States commitment to take decisive action.\n  Similarly, the President's announcement that the United States will \ncommit to an emissions reduction in the range of 17 percent below 2005 \nlevels by 2020 and his pledge to contribute the fair share of the \nUnited States of $10 billion a year in financial support for the \ndeveloping world by 2012 demonstrate that we are prepared to be serious \npartners in the fight against climate change.\n  That is the type of action we want to see, not only in the United \nStates but in other countries that are major emitters.\n  Many of my colleagues, however, have legitimate concerns that if the \nUnited States enacts strong carbon standards, carbon-intense imports \nwill have an unfair advantage in our market. We need to make sure we \naccomplish our goals internationally and also have a level playing \nfield.\n  To address this fear, I believe it is critical that our international \nnegotiators include in Copenhagen strong verification and compliance \nprocedures that will make it clear that every state has a \nresponsibility to take action to reduce greenhouse gases.\n  I have seen too many international agreements that include the \nhighest ambitions for labor, environmental, and human rights \nprotections that fail to achieve those goals in the absence of any \nconsequences for violations of those principles.\n\n  The groundwork for achieving a final international agreement in \nCopenhagen must ensure that major emitting Nations take on clearly \ndefined emissions reductions targets, adopt standardized systems to \nmeasure, report, and verify actions and commitments, and it must \nprovide for consequences if countries fail to meet those commitments. \nInclusion of these principles in the Copenhagen agreement allows us to \npursue these critical components in any final agreement, and sends an \nimportant signal that all party countries are committed to real \nemissions reductions.\n  I am proud that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee climate change \nbill introduced by Senator Kerry last week includes language I authored \nthat makes clear our expectations that any international agreement \nshould include strong verification and compliance mechanisms, along \nwith emission reduction targets, and a strong commitment to provide \nassistance to the developing world.\n\n[[Page S12800]]\n\n  I will be watching the negotiations and hope it will produce the kind \nof agreement I have discussed here today. But regardless of what \nCopenhagen brings, I will continue to advocate for domestic legislation \nthat invests in clean, domestic energy, and frees us from energy \npolicies that undermine our national security and our economy by being \ndependent upon imported oil.\n  I will advocate for legislation that invests in the industries of \ntomorrow to stem the loss of clean energy jobs--jobs that stem from \nAmerican inventions and ideas--to countries overseas. I will advocate \nfor legislation that provides significant investment in clean fuels and \npublic transit, so we seize an opportunity to build the infrastructure \nof tomorrow and change the way we move people and goods around this \ncountry. Right now, the transportation sector represents 30 percent of \nour greenhouse gas emissions and 70 percent of our oil use. If we could \nonly double the number of transit riders every day, we could reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil by 40 percent. That is equivalent to the \namount of oil we import every year from Saudi Arabia.\n  That kind of legislation is good for our country and good for \nMaryland. But we must remember that even after Copenhagen, any deals we \nreach, any papers we sign, are still but the foundation. The work must \ncontinue with earnest followthrough, dedicated to truly changing the \nway we work and live and move around this Earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12800-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OSCE MINISTERIAL MEETING\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, last week the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, held its annual Ministerial Meeting in \nAthens. As always, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly was strongly \nrepresented there. Today, in my capacity as Chairman of the Commission \non Security and Cooperation in Europe, I would like to offer a few \nreflections on the outcome of the meeting, and what this might mean for \nthe future of European security, in which the U.S. has a vital stake.\n  Each year, a different country serves as the OSCE's ``Chairman in \nOffice.'' This year, Greece was the Chairman-in-Office and this year's \nMinisterial Council meeting subsequently took place in Athens. In \nrecent years discord and paralysis have increasingly begun to overwhelm \nthe cooperation and consensus that once characterized the OSCE. The \nGreeks thus began their chairmanship facing a difficult challenge.\n  At last year's meeting in Helsinki under Finland's able chairmanship, \nthe Ministers decided that the OSCE should look for ways to overcome \nthis gridlock and to give the organization a new impetus. Greece took \nthis task to heart and launched the ``Corfu Process'' to do just that. \nThis effort has already borne fruit. In Athens, the ministers resolved \nto continue to try to reaffirm, review, and reinvigorate security in \nthe OSCE region by continuing this process.\n  The Ministers also agreed on decisions that addressed such \nfundamental and persistent problems as hate crimes, tolerance and \nnondiscrimination, nonproliferation, terrorism, and the ``protracted \nconflict'' in Nagorno-Karabakh. One of these decisions, on countering \ntransnational threats, was sponsored by the U.S. and Russia, the first \nsuch joint effort in several years. I hope this is a positive portent \nfor the future.\n  The Ministers were not able to agree on how to tackle some other \nequally important and pressing problems. These included the protracted \nconflicts in Georgia and Moldova, OSCE assistance to Afghanistan, and \nthe Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. Clearly, much work remains to \nbe done in putting the OSCE fully back on track.\n  I would be remiss if I concluded my remarks without commending the \nGreek chairmanship for its untiring and ultimately successful efforts \nduring the course of this year. The chairmanship rekindled the trust \nand confidence among the participating states that had steadily eroded \nover the past decade. Greece has clearly set the stage for a brighter \nand more productive future for the organization, and my colleagues on \nthe Helsinki Commission, and I would like to congratulate the Greek \nchairmanship on this significant accomplishment.\n  We would also like to wish Kazakhstan, the first Central Asian nation \nto hold this office, every success in its historic chairmanship in 2010 \nand to offer them our full support. Indeed, in our view the Kazakh \nchairmanship is already off to a promising start, for in Athens, at the \ninitiative of the Kazakhs, the Ministers decided to hold a high-level \nconference on tolerance next year. This proved to be a timely decision, \ncoming as it did just as Switzerland voted to ban the construction of \nMuslim minarets, and the president of the Swiss Christian Peoples Party \ncalled for a ban on Muslim and Jewish cemeteries. These actions \nreminded us that not even countries that have played a leading role in \nestablishing international human rights standards are immune from the \ntendencies to discriminate against immigrants and minorities and to \nplace limits on the free expression of religious beliefs.\n  It is very important for the OSCE to combat these troublesome trends. \nIt is also important that all the organization's participating states \nreaffirm, and commit themselves to upholding, the rights of all \nreligious communities to create places of worship and to rest in line \nwith their own traditions. I very much hope the OSCE's conference on \ntolerance next year will advance this effort.\n  Finally, let me say that we look forward with great interest to the \nforthcoming discussions of Kazakhstan's proposal to hold a meeting of \nheads of state and government during its chairmanship. Should it \nhappen, this would be the first such ``summit'' under OSCE auspices, \nsomething that was previously a regular occurrence. In Athens, in \nacceding to this proposal, the United States expressed the view that it \nis open to considering such a meeting if, but only if, such a summit \ncan produce results of substance. I think this is the correct approach, \nand it is one I fully support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12800-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12800-S12801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EDUCATION TAX INCENTIVES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I offered legislation to make \npermanent a number of education-related tax relief measures. My \nlegislation, S. 2851, also improves and makes permanent helpful \nprovisions for 529 plans and the American opportunity tax credit for \neducation.\n  At the first hearing I held when I became chairman of the Finance \nCommittee in 2001, I made clear that education tax policy was a \npriority of mine. As chairman, I was able to remove the 60-payment \nlimit for deducting student loan interest and I was able to increase \nthe income limits for that deduction. This was not the only time I \nfought hard to allow students to deduct their student loan interest. In \n1997 I was able to reinstate the student loan interest deduction that \nCongress had eliminated from our tax laws. However, the 60-payment \nlimit on the deductibility of student loan interest remained. I ensured \nthat the 2001 tax relief bill took care of that problem. Other \nincentives for education that I was able to enact into law in 2001 \nincluded raising the amount that can be contributed to an education \nsaving account from $500 to $2,000; making distributions from prepaid \ncollege savings plans and tuition plans tax-free; and making permanent \nthe tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance. \nThese tax policies and many others, including those for school \nrenovations, repairs and construction, have proven their value to Iowa \nstudents in dollars and cents, year after year. The tax relief has \ndelivered measureable educational assistance to Iowans and students and \nfamilies nationwide, making education more affordable and accessible.\n  One drawback of enacting these provisions in the 2001 tax relief \nbill, however, is that there was a sunset provision attached to that \nentire piece of legislation. All of the tax relief needs to be made \npermanent. Especially the education-related tax provisions. And that is \nwhat my bill today does. My bill makes these provisions permanent.\n  It is no coincidence that I introduced my education tax bill on the \nday the President of the United States talked about jobs. Our economy \ndemands well-educated workers. The popularity of education tax \nincentives is good news for workers who find themselves unemployed or \nwho want to go back to school to advance, or even change,\n\n[[Page S12801]]\n\ntheir careers. Congress is willing to consider permanent tax relief for \ncompanies to buy machinery. Why isn't Congress willing to make an \ninvestment in people? That's what tax relief for education is. An \ninvestment in our future. It is just as important as job-creating tax \nincentives for businesses. Some will say we can't afford this, but we \nreally can't afford to lose billions of dollars of help for Americans \nworking hard to educate their kids.\n  Education has made this country great. We should not let this \nopportunity pass us by. We should not let these education-related tax \nprovisions expire. We should also continue to help make education \naffordable for families and students. This makes education accessible \nfor all. I look forward to working with my colleagues on passing this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12801-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12801-S12802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PENDING NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, I challenged Senate Republicans \nto do as well as Senate Democrats did in December 2001 when we \nproceeded to confirm 10 of President Bush's Federal judicial nominees. \nRegrettably my plea has been ignored. Since the confirmation of Judge \nJacqueline Nguyen last Tuesday to fill a vacancy on the Federal bench \nfor the Central District of California; Republican objections and delay \nhave prevented progress on any of the nine judicial nominees pending on \nthe Senate Executive Calendar. Judge Nguyen was herself delayed almost \n6 weeks, from October 15 until she was at last confirmed on December 1. \nWhen Republicans finally agreed to allow a vote, she was confirmed \nunanimously, 97 to zero. Why the 6-week delay? Why the stalling? That \nquestion was not answered. In fact, during the time reserved for debate \non this nomination no Republican spoke a word about it.\n  I know how hard pressed the Federal judges in Los Angeles are, and \nonly wish we followed the action on Judge Nguyen's nomination by \nproceeding, as well, to the confirmation of another nominee for a \nvacancy on that court. Dolly Gee's nomination to the Central District \nof California remains pending before the Senate. She was reported by \nvoice vote and without dissent from the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nOctober 15, as well. Once confirmed, she will be able to go to work \nhelping to eliminate the backlog and delays in that court.\n  I was glad we were finally allowed to proceed with Judge Nguyen's \nnomination, but urged at that time that Senate Republicans allow votes \non the other nominations as well. That has not happened. I noted that \nwe had shown what we can do when we want to make progress. The Senate \nconfirmed Judge Christina Reiss of Vermont and Judge Abdul Kallon of \nAlabama before the Thanksgiving recess, and 17 days after their \nhearing. That prompt action by the Senate demonstrates what we can do \nworking together in good faith. It should not take weeks for the \nJudiciary Committee to report nominations, and additional weeks and \nmonths before Senate Republicans allow nominations to be considered by \nthe Senate.\n  There remain nine judicial nominations that have been given hearings \nand favorable consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee but that \nremain stalled before the Senate. They are: Beverly Martin of Georgia, \nnominated to the Eleventh Circuit; Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey, \nnominated to the Third Circuit; Edward Chen, nominated to the Northern \nDistrict of California; Dolly Gee, nominated to the Central District of \nCalifornia; Richard Seeborg, nominated to the Northern District of \nCalifornia; Barbara Keenan of Virginia, nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit; Jane Stranch of Tennessee, nominated to the Sixth Circuit; \nThomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania, nominated to the Third Circuit; and \nLouis Butler, nominated to Western District of Wisconsin. These nine \nnominees all await final action by the Senate. Some have been waiting \nsince being reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee as long as 12 \nweeks ago.\n  Acting on these nominations, we can confirm 10 nominees this month. \nThat is what we did in December 2001 when a Democratic Senate majority \nproceeded to confirm 10 of President Bush's nominees, and ended that \nyear having confirmed 28 new judges nominated by a President of the \nother party. We achieved those results with a controversial and \nconfrontational Republican President after a mid-year change to a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate. We did so in spite of the attacks of \nSeptember 11; despite the anthrax-laced letters sent to the Senate that \nclosed our offices; and while working virtually around the clock on the \nPATRIOT Act for 6 weeks.\n  It is now December 9 and the Republican minority has consented to \nallow votes on only nine of President Obama's nominations to fill \ndistrict and circuit court vacancies. We confirmed a tenth, Judge David \nHamilton, after invoking cloture to overcome a Republican leadership-\nled filibuster. In comparison, by this date in 2001, we had confirmed \n21 of President Bush's nominations, including six to fill circuit court \nvacancies. We will certainly fall well short of the total of 28 \njudicial confirmations our Democratic Senate majority worked to confirm \nin President Bush's first year in office.\n  This year we have witnessed unprecedented delays in the consideration \nof qualified and noncontroversial nominations. We have had to waste \nweeks seeking time agreements in order to consider nominations that \nwere then confirmed unanimously. Judge Nguyen is the most recent \nexample. We have seen nominees strongly supported by their home state \nSenators, both Republican and Democratic, delayed for months and \nunsuccessfully filibustered. I have been concerned that these actions \nby the Republican leadership signal a return to their practices in the \n1990s, which resulted in more than doubling circuit court vacancies and \nled to the pocket filibuster of more than 60 of President Clinton's \nnominees. The crisis they created eventually led even to public \ncriticism of their actions by Chief Justice Rehnquist during those \nyears.\n  I hope that instead of withholding consent and threatening \nfilibusters of President Obama's judicial nominees, Senate Republicans \nwill treat the nominees of President Obama fairly. I made sure that we \ntreated President Bush's nominees more fairly than President Clinton's \nnominees had been treated. In the 17 months that I served as chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, \nthe Senate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominations.\n  I want to continue that progress, but we need Republican cooperation \nto do so. I urge them to turn away from their partisanship and begin to \nwork with the President and the Senate majority leader.\n  Unlike his predecessor, President Obama has reached out, reached \nacross the aisle to work with Republican Senators in making judicial \nnominations. The nomination of Judge Hamilton, which the Republican \nleadership filibustered, was supported by the most senior Republican in \nthe U.S. Senate, my respected friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar. Other \nexamples are the recently confirmed nominees to vacancies in Alabama \nsupported by Senators Sessions and Shelby, in South Dakota supported by \nSenator Thune, and in Florida, supported by Senators Martinez and \nLaMieux. Still others are the President's nomination to the 11th \nCircuit from Georgia, supported by Senators Isakson and Chambliss, his \nnomination to the 6th Circuit from Tennessee, supported by Senator \nAlexander, and his recent nominations to the 4th Circuit from North \nCarolina, supported by Senator Burr. President Obama has reached out \nand consulted with home State Senators from both sides of the aisle \nregarding his judicial nominees.\n  Instead of praising the President for consulting with Republican \nSenators, the Republican leadership has doubled back on what they \ndemanded when a Republican was in the White House. No more do they talk \nabout each nominee being entitled to an up-or-down vote. That position \nis abandoned and forgotten. Instead, they now seek to filibuster and \ndelay judicial nominations. They have also walked back from their \nposition at the start of this Congress, when they threatened to \nfilibuster nominees on which home state Senators were not consulted. We \nsaw with Judge Hamilton that they filibustered a nominee supported by \nSenator Lugar.\n  When President Bush worked with Senators across the aisle, I praised \nhim\n\n[[Page S12802]]\n\nand expedited consideration of his nominees. When President Obama \nreaches across the aisle, the Senate Republican leadership delays and \nobstructs his qualified nominees. I fear that Senate Republican \ndelaying tactics will yield the lowest judicial confirmation total in \nmodern history. If Senate Republicans continue their delaying tactics, \nthe total could be as low as that during the 1996 session, during \nPresident Clinton's first term, when a Republican Senate majority would \nonly allow 17 judicial confirmations, none for circuit courts.\n  Although there have been nearly 110 judicial vacancies this year on \nour Federal circuit and district courts around the country, only 10 \nvacancies have been filled. That is wrong. The American people deserve \nbetter. As I have noted, there are nine more qualified judicial \nnominations awaiting Senate action on the Senate Executive Calendar. In \naddition there are another four pending before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that have been given hearings and could be reported to the \nSenate before Christmas. They will be available to be considered by the \nSenate once approved by the Judiciary Committee. The Senate should do \nbetter, and could if Senate Republicans would remove their holds and \nstop the delaying tactics.\n  During President Bush's last year in office, we reduced judicial \nvacancies to as low as 34, even though it was a Presidential election \nyear. Judicial vacancies have now spiked. There are currently 97 \nvacancies on our Federal circuit and district courts, and 23 more have \nalready been announced. This is approaching record levels. I know we \ncan do better. Justice should not be delayed or denied to any American \nbecause of overburdened courts and the lack of Federal judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12802-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING ABE POLLIN\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life and \nlegacy of my friend Abe Pollin. He was a businessman, community leader, \nphilanthropist, familyman. He was someone who simply made our community \nand our Nation a better place.\n  Abe was a great man who did great things. But he did it without a lot \nof fanfare. He was a team owner who thought first about the community \nthat supported his teams. He was an employer who didn't treat his \nathletes or his employees as commodities--but as members of his team.\n  Abe Pollin was also a developer. But he didn't just invest in \nbuildings, he invested in communities. He built one of the first big \napartment buildings in Bethesda, named after his beloved wife Irene, \nlong before Bethesda became the vibrant downtown that it is today. He \nnever lost faith in Washington--building the MCI Center, now the \nVerizon Center, in the mid 1990s--which led to the revival of downtown \nWashington.\n  Here in the DC Metro area, there are few community organizations that \ndid not benefit from his advice, his philanthropy or his leadership. \nAbe made our region a better place, and will be greatly missed.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the Pollin family--his wife Irene, \nwho is a founding mother of the effort to empower women to fight heart \ndisease, and his children and grandchildren. I will be forever grateful \nfor the Pollin family's early support of a young city council woman \nfrom Baltimore who wanted to run for Congress. Abe Pollin was one of my \nearliest supporters, and his faith in me meant a great deal.\n  Last night, thousands of people gathered at the Verizon Center to \ncelebrate Abe Pollin's life. His legacy is a community that is \nstronger, more vibrant--and simply a better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12802-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the recent \nsuicide bombing in Somalia and the broader security situation in that \nregion. While our attention is necessarily focused on the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, this latest bombing is a stark reminder that we \ncannot take our eye off of the Horn of Africa.\n  Last week, Somalis had a reason to celebrate. The graduation of \nseveral medical students from a university in Mogadishu was a welcome \nglimmer of hope for the future. Unfortunately, a suicide bomber \nintruded, blew himself up, and killed more than 20 others, including \nthree Ministers from the fledgling Somali transitional government. \nThere is, seemingly, no end to the violence which has plagued Somalia \nfor a generation.\n  Somalia continues to lack a truly functional government, and for \nseveral years, we have watched the slow but steady development of \nextremism there. Though we support the development of a moderate \ngovernment for Somalia, success is far from assured. The transitional \ngovernment lacks control of significant parts of the country and \nstruggles to provide the most basic services to the Somali people.\n  The most significant challenge to the transitional government comes \nfrom extremist groups such as al-Shabab, a group of Islamist terrorists \nwith deep roots in Somalia that came to prominence after the defeat of \nthe Islamic Courts Union 3 years ago. As we have seen throughout the \nworld, if there is a power vacuum, violent extremists will seek to fill \nit, and that is what is taking place in Somalia. Somalia cannot succeed \nwhile groups such as al-Shabab grow and thrive.\n  Al-Shabab's future depends in no small part on support from outside \nthe country. Al-Shabab gets new recruits from all over the world, it is \nstrengthening ties to al-Qaida and the global jihadist network, it \nreceives support from regional actors such as Eritrea, who use al-\nShabab as a proxy for its own interests. Al-Shabab will not be defeated \nwhile this outside support continues.\n  For this reason, I hope that our administration will work hard to \nsupport and pass a draft resolution now circulating at the United \nNations Security Council. Uganda, one of the Council's current rotating \nmembers, has drafted a resolution that addresses Eritrean support for \nSomali extremist groups, including al-Shabab. The resolution, which \nfollows strong warnings to Eritrea from the U.S. and the African Union \nnot to support al-Shabab, would ban weapon sales to Asmara, prohibit \ntechnical, financial and other assistance related to military \nactivities, and freeze the assets of Eritrean political and military \nleaders as well as restrict their travel.\n  Al-Shabab seeks to undermine any attempt to stabilize Somalia. A \nvolatile Somalia jeopardizes the stability of the Horn of Africa \nregion, which is itself important to security in Africa, the greater \nMiddle East, and the rest of the world. Support for extremist groups \nsuch as al-Shabab is unacceptable, and as long as Eritrea provides arms \nto al-Shabab, there will be no chance for peace in Somalia. I hope that \nthe Security Council can take up and pass this resolution soon, and I \nhope the United States will be a strong supporter of this effort. \nSomalia ought not be a safe haven for extremists or a playground for \noutside powers pursuing their own agendas. Though Somalia's future is \nfar from clear, the Security Council should have no difficulty in \nagreeing on the need to take steps to cut al-Shabab's lifelines of \noutside support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12802-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12802-S12803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VIDA CHAN LIN\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, today I commemorate the beginning of an \nexciting chapter for the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce. For more \nthan 20 years, this group of entrepreneurial southern Nevadans has \nworked together to provide resources and promote economic growth in the \nAsian community. Today, they will install the first woman to be \npresident of their esteemed organization. Vida Chan Lin steps into this \nrole--respected by her peers and energized by her passion for \nfurthering the goals of the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce.\n  While this leadership role is a new opportunity for Ms. Lin, her \nlifetime of experience has prepared her to take on this role. As a \nchild, she was exposed to running a business as she saw firsthand the \ndaily challenges and joys in the restaurants her family owned. She then \nfound great satisfaction in the insurance industry where she continued \nto exceed expectations and eventually start her own company.\n  Ms. Lin has always balanced her business drive and success with her \ncommitment to community service. She has been an instrumental force \nbehind the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce for many years. Her \nability\n\n[[Page S12803]]\n\nto bring people together, develop innovative programming, and mentor \nyoung leaders has helped ensure the long-term success of the Asian \nChamber well beyond just her tenure.\n  She has been recognized by countless organizations for her business \nacumen and her heartfelt commitment to public service. I am proud to \ncongratulate Vida Lin on this special day, and I wish her great success \nin the coming term of her presidency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12803-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RECOGNIZING WHITNEY WREATH\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, one of the great symbols of the \nwinter holiday season we are just beginning is the wreath. Between the \nbeautiful green needles and the fragrant smell, wreaths are reminders \nof a simpler time. And nowhere is the wreath more emblematic than my \nhome State of Maine. Indeed, Maine is the largest producer of balsam \nfir wreaths in America, owed in large part to the tree's prevalence in \nour State's landscape. Furthermore, sales of these stunning wreaths \ncontribute millions of dollars to the Maine economy. In recognition of \nthese critical facts, I rise to honor the Whitney Wreath company, a \nrenowned small business headquartered in Washington County.\n  Whitney Wreath is in its 21st season of producing fragrant and vivid \ngreen wreaths for display during the winter holidays. The company was \nstarted in 1988 when David Whitney, the company's founder, sold \nhandmade wreaths from the back of a pickup truck during his teenage \nyears. Two decades later, Whitney Wreath is now America's largest mail-\norder wreath company, selling its products through its own Web site, as \nwell as several other catalogues and outlets including QVC. Incredibly, \nits wreath sales are now in the hundreds of thousands each year. The \ncompany has nine facilities throughout the State, and is in the process \nof building a tenth to improve productivity. And this year, despite the \nturbulence in our Nation's economy and an uncertain employment picture, \nWhitney Wreath was able to hire 250 additional employees over last \nseason because of a substantial new contract.\n  Decorated with a range of colorful and timely ornaments, such as pine \ncones, Maine blueberries, sleigh bells, and of course bright red bows, \nWhitney's wreaths are nothing short of spectacular. Made using fresh \nMaine balsam fir, the smell of a Whitney wreath is unmistakable, and an \noutstanding symbol of the season it represents. The company also \nmanufactures a range of Christmas centerpieces and the unique Maine \nKissing Ball, consisting of ``snow'' covered pine cones combined with \nbrilliant red berries.\n  Whitney Wreath has been celebrated over the years for its commitment \nto quality wreaths. In 2007, the Small Business Administration honored \nthe company with its Jeffrey H. Butland Family-Owned Business of the \nYear award because of the company's efforts to be involved in the \ncommunity and provide critical employment opportunities to the citizens \nof Downeast Maine. The award also paid homage to David Whitney's other \nsmall businesses, Whitney's Blueberries and Whitney's Tool Shed.\n  Finally, in the spirit of the holiday season, it is fitting to \nacknowledge the magnanimous work Whitney Wreath is doing to support our \nNation's breast cancer survivors. Last year, the company asked Facebook \nusers to join the fight against breast cancer and for every 20 people \nwho joined, Mr. Whitney pledged to bring special wreaths with pink \nribbons to survivors of the disease. On December 22, 2008, after almost \n500 people took his message to heart, David Whitney arrived at Cancer \nCare of Maine in Brewer with 30 special wreaths.\n  This year, Mr. Whitney has promised to donate 25 percent of every \nbreast cancer awareness wreath purchased to the Susan G. Komen Breast \nCancer Foundation. The company has also announced that it will donate \n20 percent of the proceeds from the sales of its Original Christmas \nWreaths to the National Autism Association. As we work to combat these \nterrible illnesses, I am proud to have caring and thoughtful \nindividuals like David Whitney doing their own part to encourage and \nsupport those afflicted.\n  A downeast staple for nearly a quarter of a century, Whitney Wreath \nhas become a leader in its field by combining attention to detail and \nconcern for the community. I thank David Whitney and everyone at \nWhitney Wreath for all they do to lift our spirits during the holiday \nseason, and wish them many more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12803-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO KENNETH CHRISTOPHER SATTERLEE\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCTED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BEGICH (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2852. A bill to establish, within the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, an integrated and comprehensive ocean, \ncoastal, Great Lakes, and atmospheric research, prediction, and \nenvironmental information program to support renewable energy; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today, I, along with my colleague Senator \nSnowe, are introducing legislation to establish a comprehensive ocean, \ncoastal, Great Lakes, and atmospheric research program to support \nrenewable energy. Renewable energy is the most rapidly growing U.S. \nenergy sector. Increasing the use of renewable energy is dependent on \nbaseline atmospheric and oceanic data. Improving NOAA's ability to \nprovide the observations, forecasts, and climate information tailored \nto the needs of the renewable energy industry will promote growth of \nthis energy sector. This bill would require NOAA to establish a \ncomprehensive research, prediction, and environmental information \nprogram to support renewable energy. Specifically, the legislation \nwould require NOAA to develop observation systems and models and \ncollect baseline environmental data to support renewable energy \ndevelopment on land and in the marine environment; and provide best \nmanagement practices to avoid adverse effects in the marine and coastal \nenvironment. The legislation would authorize $100 million annually for \nfiscal year 2010 through 2014 and allows for up to 50 percent of funds \nto be available to educational institutions or states to carry out \nactivities in support of the program. As we work as a Nation to \ndecrease our dependency on foreign oil, to encourage scientific \nadvancement, technological innovation and job creation, the Renewable \nEnergy Environmental Research Act of 2009 will be an important \ncomponent in advancing progress in those areas. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation to support critical research in support of \nadvancing renewable energy development.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2852\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Renewable Energy \n     Environmental Research Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish an integrated and \n     comprehensive ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmospheric \n     research, prediction, and environmental information program \n     to support renewable energy.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SAVINGS PROVISION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to supersede or \n     modify the jurisdiction, responsibilities, or authority of \n     any Federal or State agency under any provision of law in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S 2854. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand modify the credit for new qualified hybrid motor vehicles, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with \nSenator Hatch that would provide tax credits for purchasers of hybrid \nand plug-in hybrid heavy duty trucks. Specifically, this bill would \nextend the existing heavy duty hybrid tax credit and create a tax \ncredit for heavy duty plug-in hybrid trucks. The plug-in tax credit was \nincluded in the Senate passed stimulus bill, but was dropped in \nconference. Both tax credits would begin at $15,000 for those vehicles \nweighing up to 14,000 lbs and max out at $100,000\n\n[[Page S12808]]\n\nfor vehicles weighing more than 33,000 lbs. The tax credits would \nexpire in 2014.\n  The challenge for hybrid and plug-in hybrid technologies is cost. \nAdvanced batteries and components are new and expensive technologies. \nIn the medium and heavy duty sector, these costs are even higher and \nvehicle turnover is lower. The incremental cost of a heavy duty plug-in \nhybrid over 23,000 lbs can be as much as $85,000. We are introducing \nthis bill to provide the needed incentives for manufacturers to develop \nand install hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology on heavy duty trucks.\n  This bill also includes a tax credit of up to $3,500 for trucks stops \nto install electrification units so that truckers could plug in their \nvehicles to operate necessary systems without idling the engine. \nBecause the Department of Transportation mandates that truckers rest \nfor 10 hours after driving for 11 hours, truckers idle at truck stops \nfor several hours. With this tax credit, truckers would be able to \noperate the heater, air conditioner, television, and other appliances \nwithout running the engine, which saves fuel, reduces air pollution, \nand reduces engine wear. The tax credit would end in 2014.\n  In addition to reducing oil use in their drive cycles, \nelectrification is an important technology for reducing idle costs and \nemissions. U.S. trucks idle an average of 1830 hours per year. The \nidling of commercial vehicles is estimated to consume more than 2 \nbillion gallons of fuel annually, while producing unwanted emissions. \nBy promoting onboard electricity options for powering vehicle functions \nwhile idling and by expanding off board options, through truck stop \nelectrification, this legislation will reduce oil use and emissions \nfrom this sector even further.\n  This bill, which has the support of the Electric Drive Transportation \nAssociation, will help manufacturers reach the economies of scale by \nbringing down the costs of hybrid and plug-in hybrid technologies. The \ntax credits will promote the purchases of clean, efficient electric \ndrive trucks and the installation of anti-idling equipment that will \nimprove our environment and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself Mr. Hatch, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n        Lugar):\n  S. 2857. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe qualifying advanced energy project credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, a recent report by the New America \nFoundation finds that ``the United States ran an overall green trade \ndeficit of -$8.9 billion in 2008, including a deficit of -$6.4 billion \nin the critical category of renewable energy. . .'' To halt this trend \nand promote American leadership in clean technology manufacturing, I \nwas pleased to see the Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit, \ncodified as Section 48C of the Internal Revenue Code, established under \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Under Section 48C, \nqualifying projects receive a 30 percent tax credit for capital \nexpenditures related to new, expanded, or re-equipped advanced energy \nmanufacturing projects. But Section 48C was enacted subject to a $2.3 \nbillion limitation in allocation authority--and we expect the full $2.3 \nbillion soon to be exhausted. Because we cannot allow this credit to \nlapse, I rise today to introduce the American Clean Technology \nManufacturing Leadership Act, which would add $2.5 billion in \nallocation authority to the Section 48C Advanced Energy Manufacturing \nTax Credit program. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Hatch, Senator \nStabenow, and Senator Lugar in introducing this bill.\n  By establishing the Section 48C credit, Congress took a significant \nstep--but we cannot slow down now. In the near- to mid-term, we can \nanticipate rapid growth in demand for renewable energy technologies, \ndue to the long-term extension of the production tax credit and the \ncommercial and residential investment tax credits; declining product \ncosts; the anticipated enactment this Congress of a national renewable \nportfolio standard; and the anticipated implementation of a carbon \ncontrol system. But without robust incentives, foreign-based \nmanufacturers are poised to seize a large share of this domestic growth \nin the clean power market with products exported to the United States. \nAs New America explains: ``If current trends continue, the green trade \ndeficit can be expected to widen further as the administration's agenda \nincreases domestic demand but without sufficient measures to increase \ndomestic production. If the deficit continues to grow, the United \nStates will forego the creation of millions of high-wage, high-skill \ngreen manufacturing jobs and lose its potential to be a global producer \nas well as a consumer of green technologies.''\n  The reality is that we need a level playing field to bring \nmanufacturing jobs to the United States. For years, Germany, China, \nIndia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have offered incentives that have \nplaced the United States at a competitive disadvantage. For instance, \nfor solar photovoltaic manufacturers, Malaysia and the Philippines \noffer income tax holidays, 15 years in the case of Malaysia, and \nGermany offers up to 30 percent of investment costs for large \nenterprises and 40-50 percent for smaller enterprises.\n  The Section 48C Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit made an \nimportant stride in leveling that playing field. ARRA instructed \nTreasury and DOE to establish a selection procedure for allocating \ncredits, thus ensuring that only the most promising projects receive a \nFederal investment. But the program is oversubscribed and we anticipate \nthat by January 15, the full $2.3 billion authorized under ARRA will be \nallocated.\n  We cannot afford to have this credit lapse. There are additional \nqualified applications ready to be evaluated, and an existing selection \ninfrastructure to make these awards quickly. To keep us on track, our \nbill would add an additional $2.5 billion in allocation authority--\nenough to leverage an additional $8.3 billion in investment in domestic \nmanufacturing facilities.\n  Yesterday President Obama himself called for an expansion of this \ncredit. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, the President said that \nthe Treasury program has received a substantial response and warrants \nan expansion: ``It's a positive sign that many of these programs drew \nso many applicants for funding that a lot of strong proposals--\nproposals that will leverage private capital and create jobs quickly--\ndid not make the cut,'' President Obama said. ``With additional \nresources, in areas like advanced manufacturing of wind turbines and \nsolar panels, for instance, we can help turn good ideas into good \nprivate-sector jobs.''\n  We should move immediately to meet the President's call, by adding \n$2.5 billion in allocation authority. Allowing this credit to lapse \nwould only cede high-paying jobs to other countries at a time when our \nunemployment rate hovers above 10 percent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2857\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Clean Technology \n     Manufacturing Leadership Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF QUALIFYING ADVANCED ENERGY PROJECT \n                   CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 48C(d)(1)(B) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking \n     ``$2,300,000,000'' and inserting ``$4,800,000,000''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to allocations for applications submitted after \n     December 31, 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Casey):\n  S. 2858. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nan Office of Mitochondrial Disease at the National Institutes of \nHealth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we work to reform our health care \nsystem, it is crucial that we encourage the development of new \ntreatments and cures for diseases by investing in health research and \ninnovation. Today, I am proud to introduce the Brittany Wilkinson \nMitochondrial Disease Research and Treatment Enhancement Act of 2009, \nwhich, for the first time,\n\n[[Page S12809]]\n\nwould coordinate the federal investment in researching the cause of, \nand treatments and cures for, mitochondrial disease.\n  Known as the cell's ``powerhouse,'' mitochondria are specialized \ncompartments within cells that help sustain life by producing 90 \npercent of the energy our cells and bodies need. Mitochondrial disease \ncauses defects that reduce the ability of mitochondria to produce \nenergy, which leads to cell dysfunction or death. When cells in our \nbodies begin to fail or die, then whole organ systems can fail.\n  Due to the essential nature of the function of mitochondria, \nmitochondrial dysfunction is suspected to be associated with a large \nnumber of diseases including, Parkinson's, autism, diabetes, cancer and \nmany other afflictions. However, we cannot learn more about how these \ndiseases are related until we invest enough resources in mitochondrial \ndisease research.\n  First recognized in the 1960s, mitochondrial disease is relatively \nnewly diagnosed, yet every 30 minutes a child is born who will develop \na mitochondrial disease by age 10, and one recent study showed that one \nin every 200 people has a genetic mutation that may lead to \nmitochondrial disease.\n  Despite its prevalence, mitochondrial disease has no known treatment \nor cure, those afflicted with this disorder--many of them children--go \nuntreated.\n  This legislation would create an Office of Mitochondrial Disease, \nwithin the National Institutes of Health, to develop a Mitochondrial \nDisease Research Plan, to promote and coordinate efforts to educate \nresearchers and health providers about mitochondrial diseases and to \naward grants to increase research of mitochondrial disease.\n  In addition, this legislation would establish Mitochondrial Disease \nCenters of Excellence to promote basic and clinical research, \nfacilitate training programs in mitochondrial disease, and develop and \ndisseminate programs to provide continuing education in mitochondrial \ndisease. This legislation also instructs the Director of the CDC to \nestablish a national registry and a biorepository to help collect and \nshare information about patients with mitochondrial disease.\n  The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, UMDF--the voice for the \nthousands of children, adults and their families who face this disease \nalmost alone--greatly supports this bill because they know it is \ncritical to research, understanding and future treatments for \nmitochondrial diseases.\n  Brittany Wilkinson, for whom this act is named, was herself a \nmitochondrial disease patient. Earlier this year I met this young woman \nwhen she visited my office as a UMDF Youth Ambassador; I was greatly \nimpressed by her poise and dedication to her cause. Although Brittany \nhad experienced medical problems since birth, she was not diagnosed \nwith mitochondrial disease until the age of seven.\n  Though Brittany was in constant pain, spent months in the hospital \nand sometimes stopped breathing at night, she devoted her life to \nraising awareness about the disease she shared with so many others. As \nthe first ever Youth Ambassador for the UMDF, Brittany helped \nfundraise, made phone calls and dictated letters--sometimes from her \nhospital bed.\n  In addition to her work as a Youth Ambassador, Brittany was also \nactive in her local government, where she worked to pass \n``Mitochondrial Disease Awareness Week'' resolutions in Clovis City and \nFrenso, California. On the state level, this year she was able to get a \npermanent resolution through the California Assembly to make the third \nfull week in September every year ``Mitochondrial Disease Awareness \nWeek''. I was devastated to hear that this September Brittany passed \ndue to the effects of her debilitating illness.\n  Brittany Wilkinson worked tirelessly to advance public awareness of \nthis devastating disease, now I urge my colleagues to join me in taking \nthe next step by supporting this investment in mitochondrial disease \nresearch, for the thousands of families across our nation coping with \nmitochondrial disease.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Inouye (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2859. A bill to reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of \n2000, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor the Coral Reef \nConservation Amendments Act of 2009. This bill reauthorizes and \nstrengthens the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, a program that I \noriginally sponsored in the 106th Congress establishing the Coral Reef \nConservation Program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA.\n  Coral reefs are among the oldest and most economically and \nbiologically important ecosystems in the world. They provide habitat \nfor more than one million diverse aquatic species, a natural barrier \nfor protection from coastal storms and erosion, and are a potential \nsource of treatment for many of the world's diseases. In addition, \nreef-supported tourism is a $30 billion industry worldwide, and the \ncommercial value of U.S. fisheries from coral reefs is more than $100 \nmillion. However, our coral reef ecosystems face many threats including \npollution, climate change and coral bleaching, and overfishing to name \na few. Coral reefs cover only one-tenth of one percent of the ocean \nfloor, yet provide habitat for more than 25 percent of all marine \nspecies.\n  The original Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 recognized the need \nto preserve, sustain and restore the condition of these valuable coral \nreef ecosystems. It directed NOAA to develop a National Coral Reef \nAction Strategy, established a NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program, \nand created a Coral Reef Conservation Fund to support public-private \npartnership projects. The Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 also \nauthorized NOAA to provide emergency grants to address unforeseen and \ndisaster-related impacts to coral reefs.\n  The Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2009 would strengthen \nNOAA's ability to comprehensively address threats to coral reefs and \nempower the agency with tools to ensure that damage to our coral reef \necosystems is prevented or effectively mitigated. It also establishes \nconsistent practices for maintaining data, products, and information, \nand promotes the widespread availability and dissemination of that \nenvironmental information.\n  The bill allows the Secretary to further develop partnerships with \nforeign governments and international organizations as well as with \nFederal agencies, State and local governments, tribal organizations, \neducational institutions, nonprofit organizations, commercial \norganizations, and other public and private entities. These \npartnerships are critical not only to the understanding of our coral \nreef ecosystems, but also to their protection and restoration. Finally, \nthe bill allows for any amount received by the United States as a \nresult of illegal activity resulting in the destruction, take, loss, or \ninjury of coral reefs to be used toward restoration efforts.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and \nI hope that we may pass this bill quickly to continue supporting NOAA's \nleadership role in coral reef conservation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2860. A bill to protect students from inappropriate seclusion and \nphysical restraint, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in 1998, the Hartford Courant ran an award-\nwinning series of stories about the use of restraint and seclusion in \nhospitals, residential facilities, and group homes for individuals with \npsychiatric and developmental disabilities.\n  The Courant uncovered a hidden epidemic, confirming 142 deaths \noccurring during or after the use of restraint or seclusion.\n  One of those 142 was an 11-year-old boy from my home State of \nConnecticut. He was restrained face-down in a position that restricted \nhis air flow. He died as a result.\n  In response, I led the charge to establish Federal standards to \nprevent the misuse of these practices. I helped pass The Children's \nHealth Act of 2000, which included the Compassionate Care\n\n[[Page S12810]]\n\nAct that I originally drafted to put these standards in place in \ncertain hospitals and residential facilities. We wanted to include \nschools in this legislation, but were unable to do so. Sadly, the need \ncould not have been greater.\n  Over the past year, reports from the National Disability Rights \nNetwork, NDRN, the Alliance to Prevent Restraint, Aversive \nInterventions, and Seclusion, APRAIS, the Council of Parent Attorneys \nand Advocates, Inc., COPAA, and the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, have painted a picture disturbingly similar to the one the \nHartford Courant discovered more than a decade ago.\n  The statistics are chilling--hundreds of incidents of physical \ninjury, psychological trauma, even death--but the stories are \ndevastating.\n  Here are some of the examples the GAO found in their report released \non May 19, 2009.\n  A 14-year-old boy was restrained face-down by a teacher because he \nwould not stay seated in class. The 230 lb. teacher sat on the 129 lb. \nboy, restricting his airflow and resulting in the boy's death.\n  A 4-year-old girl with cerebral palsy and autism was restrained in a \nwooden chair with leather straps for being ``uncooperative.''\n  In one school district, children with disabilities as young as 6 \nyears old were allegedly placed in strangleholds, restrained for \nextended periods of time, confined to dark rooms, tethered to ropes, \nand prevented from using the restroom until they urinated on \nthemselves.\n  To be clear, school personnel mean no harm, and my concern signifies \nno disrespect for the difficult job they do or the dangers they \nsometimes face.\n  But these tragic stories reflect inadequate training, and a lack of \nresources on the local level to implement effective interventions, such \nas school-wide positive behavioral supports.\n  Just as students have a right to learn in a safe environment, \neducators have a right to work in a safe environment. They should be \nprovided with training and support to prevent injury to themselves and \nothers.\n  In some States, like Connecticut, parents have successfully advocated \nfor laws that provide these resources, as well as guidelines to ensure \nthat they are used effectively.\n  But the patchwork of State laws and regulations is confusing.\n  According to the GAO study, 19 States have no law or regulations \nconcerning restraint and seclusion in schools.\n  Some laws apply to only certain schools or situations.\n  Some apply to restraint but not seclusion.\n  Only 19 States require parental notification.\n  Only 17 States require staff training.\n  Only 8 specifically prohibit restraints that restrict air flow.\n  Furthermore, this patchwork is obviously inadequate; according to a \nreport by COPPA, over 71 percent of the 185 incidents they identified \noccurred in schools with no positive behavioral interventions or \nsupports.\n  Therefore, I rise today to introduce the Preventing Harmful Restraint \nand Seclusion in Schools Act, a bill that will address this void.\n  It will establish clear minimum standards for the use of restraint \nand seclusion in schools, closely based on the Children's Health Act of \n2000. It will also provide resources to assist with policy \nimplementation and provide school personnel with necessary tools, \ntraining, and support.\n  Finally, it will improve data collection, analysis, and \nidentification of effective practices to prevent and reduce restraint \nand seclusion in schools, so we may better understand the scope of the \nproblem and the effectiveness of our solutions.\n  Specifically, the legislation will prohibit the use of restraint and \nseclusion in schools unless the student's behavior imposes an immediate \ndanger of physical injury and less restrictive interventions would be \nineffective.\n  It will prohibit the use of mechanical, chemical, and physical \nrestraints that restrict air flow to the lungs.\n  It will require adequate training and state certification of school \npersonnel imposing restraint or seclusion, immediate parental \nnotification when such an incident occurs, and debriefing to prevent \nfuture incidents.\n  As a condition of receiving federal education funding, states will be \nrequired to submit annual plans to the Secretary of Education which \ndescribe their restraint and seclusion policies, and certify that \nminimum standards are being met.\n  States will also be required to report annually the total number of \nincidents of restraint and seclusion, disaggregated by demographic and \nother categories.\n  In order to assist States, local educational agencies, and schools \nwith implementing policies and procedures to meet the minimum \nstandards, competitive grants will be provided. Grants will also assist \nwith the implementation of school-wide positive behavioral supports to \nfurther prevent incidents of restraint and seclusion.\n  Finally, the Department of Education will conduct, and provide to \nCongress, a national assessment which analyzes data on restraint and \nseclusion and effective practices in preventing and reducing incidents. \nThis will provide us with a more accurate picture of the extent of \nrestraint and seclusion in schools and help direct additional future \nefforts to ensure that our children and those who educate them are \nsafe.\n  I want to thank the many organizations representing individuals with \ndisabilities, students, teachers, and schools that all came to the \ntable with recommendations. I am also grateful to Secretary Duncan for \nhis leadership on this issue. Finally, I want to thank my colleague and \ngood friend Chairman George Miller in the House of Representatives. \nToday, he's introducing companion legislation, and I look forward to \nworking with him to make it law.\n  Every child has a right to be safe in the place where they go to \nlearn and grow. Every educator deserves the training and support they \nneed to do their jobs safely and effectively. This legislation will \nhelp to prevent tragedies in our schools. I am proud to introduce it \ntoday, and I urge my colleagues to join me.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2861. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to establish an \nAssistant United States Trade Representative for Small Business, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senate \nSmall Business Committee Chair Landrieu, to introduce the Small \nBusiness Trade Representation Act of 2009. This bipartisan measure \nwould once and for all establish an Assistant United States Trade \nRepresentative for Small Business, to ensure that small businesses are \nrepresented in trade negotiations and in U.S. trade policy.\n  I first introduced legislation in 2001, in the 107th Congress, to \nestablish a United States Trade Representative for Small Business, in \norder to ensure that small business interests are reflected in U.S. \ntrade policy and trade agreement negotiations. Since that time, we've \nheard excuse after excuse, from Administrations of both parties, about \nwhy we don't need an Assistant USTR for Small Business. Currently, less \nthan one percent of all small businesses are exporting their goods and \nservices to foreign customers. Until we see significant gains in small \nbusiness participation in international trade, we must make it a \npriority across the Federal government--and especially in our trade \npolicy--to help small businesses compete in the global marketplace.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, and as a senior member of both the Senate Finance and \nCommerce Committees, one of my top priorities is to ensure that small \nbusinesses get the promised benefits of our international trade \nrelationships and are able to compete in the world economy.\n  While globalization has created opportunities for U.S. small \nbusinesses to sell their goods and services in new markets, not enough \nsmall businesses are taking advantage of these international prospects. \nIn fact, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, less than one \npercent of the approximately 27 million U.S. small businesses currently \nsell their products to foreign buyers. Small businesses are a vital \nsource of economic growth and job creation, generating nearly \\2/3\\ of \nnet new jobs each year. Small businesses are essential to our economic \nrecovery, and\n\n[[Page S12811]]\n\nwe must help them take advantage of all potential opportunities, \nincluding those in foreign markets.\n  Small businesses can survive, diversify, and compete effectively in \nthe international marketplace by developing an export business. But, as \nI mentioned, too few small businesses are expanding into international \nmarkets. This legislation will help ensure that small businesses are a \npriority in the U.S. government's trade policy and in future trade \nagreements.\n  We cannot overlook the impact of trade on small businesses. An \ninvestment in small business exporting assistance is an investment in \nour economy. I ask all of my Senate colleagues to support this vital \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2861\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Trade \n     Representation Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ASSISTANT UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE FOR \n                   SMALL BUSINESS.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Position.--Section 141(c) of the Trade \n     Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2171(c)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6)(A) There is established within the Office the \n     position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for \n     Small Business, who shall be appointed by the United States \n     Trade Representative.\n       ``(B) The Assistant United States Trade Representative for \n     Small Business shall--\n       ``(i) promote the trade interests of small-business \n     concerns (as that term is defined in section 103 of the Small \n     Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 662));\n       ``(ii) advocate for the reduction of foreign trade barriers \n     with respect to the trade issues of small-business concerns \n     that are exporters;\n       ``(iii) collaborate with the Administrator of the Small \n     Business Administration with respect to the trade issues of \n     small-business concerns;\n       ``(iv) assist the United States Trade Representative in \n     developing trade policies that increase opportunities for \n     small-business concerns in foreign and domestic markets, \n     including polices that reduce trade barriers for small-\n     business concerns; and\n       ``(v) perform such other duties as the United States Trade \n     Representative may direct.\n       ``(C) The Assistant United States Trade Representative for \n     Small Business shall be compensated at the rate provided for \n     level IV of the Executive Schedule under section 5315 of \n     title 5, United States Code.''.\n       (b) Conforming Repeal.--Section 2112 of the Bipartisan \n     Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 3812) is \n     repealed.\n       (c) Technical Corrections.--Section 141 of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2171), as amended by subsection (a), is \n     further amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c), by moving paragraph (5) 2 ems to the \n     left; and\n       (2) in subsection (e)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``5314'' and inserting \n     ``5315''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``the maximum rate of pay \n     for grade GS-18 as provided in section 5332'' and inserting \n     ``the maximum rate of pay for level IV of the Executive \n     Schedule in section 5315''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2862. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to improve the Office \nof International Trade, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senate \nSmall Business Committee Chair Landrieu, to introduce the Small \nBusiness Export Enhancement and International Trade Act of 2009. This \nbipartisan measure would provide improved and expanded support for \nsmall businesses, through critical programs and reforms, to ensure \nthat, as we emerge from this protracted recession, American small \nbusinesses are primed for success in the global marketplace and are \nable to create and sustain high-paying jobs.\n  I would like to thank Chair Landrieu for her efforts on this critical \nissue and for working with me and my staff to merge our respective \nbills into one bipartisan measure that will help small businesses stay \ncompetitive, help them grow, and speed the recovery of our economy as a \nwhole.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, and as a senior member of both the Senate Finance and \nCommerce Committees, one of my top priorities is to ensure that small \nbusinesses get the promised benefits of our international trade \nrelationships and are able to compete in the world economy.\n  While globalization has created opportunities for U.S. small \nbusinesses to sell their goods and services in new markets, not enough \nsmall businesses are taking advantage of these international prospects. \nIn fact, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, less than one \npercent of the approximately 27 million U.S. small businesses currently \nsell their products to foreign buyers. Small businesses are a vital \nsource of economic growth and job creation, generating nearly \\2/3\\ of \nnet new jobs each year. Small businesses are essential to our economic \nrecovery, and we must help them take advantage of all potential \nopportunities, including those in foreign markets.\n  Small businesses face particular challenges in exporting. It can be \ndifficult for small exporting firms to secure the working capital \nneeded to fulfill foreign purchase orders, for instance, because many \nlenders won't lend against export orders or export receivables. Small \nbusiness owners may not know how to connect with foreign buyers, or may \nnot have the time or resources necessary to understand other countries' \nrules and regulations.\n  Currently, Federal programs are grossly inadequate at helping small \nbusinesses overcome the challenges of exporting. The Small Business \nExport Enhancement and International Trade Act, which we are \nintroducing today, gives small businesses the critical resources and \nassistance needed to explore potential export opportunities, or to \nexpand their current export business.\n  Our bipartisan legislation includes provisions from bills I have \nintroduced in past Congresses, since the 109th, to elevate the head of \nthe Small Business Administration, SBA, office responsible for trade \nand export programs to the Associate Administrator-level, reporting \ndirectly to the administrator.\n  Further, it includes all of the key provisions from the small \nbusiness trade bill that I introduced earlier this year, S. 1208, the \nSmall Business Export Opportunity Development Act of 2009. These \ncritical provisions would bolster the SBA's technical assistance \nprograms and improve export financing programs to ensure that small \nbusinesses have access to the capital needed to support export sales. \nThe legislation also increases the coordination among other federal \nagencies--the Department of Commerce, the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, and the Export-Import Bank--to ensure that small \nbusinesses benefit from all the export assistance the Federal \nGovernment offers.\n  This legislation also includes a program I proposed earlier this year \nin S. 1208 to provide grants to help small businesses start or expand \nexport activity, such as participation in foreign trade missions, \nforeign market sales trips, training workshops and payment of website \ntranslation fees. It also improves the SBA's network of international \ntrade counselors and enhances the export assistance provided to small \nbusiness clients through the Small Business Development Center network, \nwhich has over 1,000 locations nationwide.\n  Our bill increases the maximum size of SBA-guaranteed export working \ncapital and international trade loans from a current level of $2 \nmillion to a new level of $5 million, consistent with the levels \nestablished in my bill, S. 1615, the Next Steps for a Main Street \nRecovery Act, which I introduced in August and the President called for \nlast month. This bill also establishes a permanent Export Express \nprogram, a streamlined, expedited loan program to get capital to \nexporters quickly and efficiently, so they can focus on the terms of \nthe sale and preparing their product for shipment. It also establishes \na program to provide support for small businesses related to trade \ndisputes and unfair international trade practices, which is critical \nfor our entrepreneurs who have suffered from illegal activities by our \ntrading partners.\n  Small businesses can survive, diversify, and compete effectively in \nthe international marketplace by developing an export business. But, as \nI mentioned, too few small businesses are expanding into international \nmarkets. This legislation will help small\n\n[[Page S12812]]\n\nbusiness owners take the crucial steps of finding international buyers \nfor their goods and services and will enable small business owners to \nsecure the financing needed to fill orders from foreign buyers.\n  This investment could yield tremendous returns for our economy. The \nUnited States spends just one-sixth of the international average on \nexport promotion and assistance among developed countries in promoting \nsmall businesses exports. Every additional dollar spent on export \npromotion results in a 40-fold increase in exports, according to a \nWorld Bank study.\n  We cannot overlook the impact of trade on small businesses. An \ninvestment in small business exporting assistance is an investment in \nour economy. I ask all of my Senate colleagues to support this vital \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2862\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as chair of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to join the committee's \nranking member, Olympia Snowe of Maine, in introducing the Small \nBusiness Export Enhancement and International Trade Act of 2009. \nBuilding upon legislation that I have introduced in the last three \nCongresses, including, S. 1196 the Small Business International Trade \nEnhancements Act of 2009 that I introduced in June of this year, this \nbipartisan legislation will ensure that small businesses seeking to \nexport their goods and services will have access to the resources they \nneed to successfully expand into foreign markets. With health premiums \nincreasing more each year and cash registers at home not ringing like \nthey used to, exporting has become a practical solution for small \nfirms. Expanding opportunities for small business trade is not only \nvital to the financial security of our entrepreneurs, it is vital to \nthe recovery of our economy.\n  Last year, $70 billion in exports maintained or created 600,000 high-\npaying American jobs. By creating jobs, as well as lessening the trade \ndeficit, an increase in small business exporting will lead us out of \nthis recession and make our nation better able to compete in the global \nmarketplace. Furthermore, any investments we make in export programs \nwill essentially pay for themselves. Every dollar invested in export \nprograms increases exports by 40 percent, a World Bank study found.\n  In my home State of Louisiana, we have experienced firsthand the \nbenefit of expanding and investing in export opportunities. With over \n40 ports and an extensive rail system, Louisiana has long been a top \ndestination for companies seeking to export their goods and services, \nparticularly exporters. Despite the devastation caused by Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, Louisiana has experienced a tremendous growth in \ntrade activity during the last five years, largely due to increased \nexports. For example, in 2008 alone, Louisiana exported nearly $41.9 \nbillion dollars worth of goods and services, representing a 38-percent \nincrease from 2007, more than triple the national export growth rate \nfor that year.\n  However, while most of our Nation's exporters--about 97 percent--are \nsmall businesses, most of our small businesses are not exporting. In \nfact, small businesses make up just more than a quarter of the \ncountry's export volume--trade remains dominated by larger businesses. \nThis is also true in Louisiana where, despite tremendous growth in \nexports in recent years, small businesses represent 85 percent of \nexporting companies, but account for only 30 percent of the export \nvolume. What is holding our entrepreneurs back?\n  As chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I \nhave heard from small exporters across the country. I held a roundtable \non June 11--``Entrepreneurial Development: Investing in Small \nBusinesses to Strengthen our Economy''--to hear from small business and \nexporting leaders. I also held a field hearing in New Orleans on June \n30--``Keeping America Competitive: Federal Programs that Promote Small \nBusiness Exporting''--at which United States Trade Representative, \nAmbassador Ron Kirk, U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, \nAdministrator Karen Mills, U.S. Export-Import Bank Chairman and \nPresident Fred Hochberg and several small exporters testified. At these \nevents, small exporters told me that the programs and services at the \nSmall Business Administration, SBA, and other Federal agencies are \nhelpful--but they are not doing everything they could and should do. \nBetter coordination and improvements to the programs are needed.\n  Like many small businesses, one of the biggest hurdles faced by small \nexporters is access to capital. The current economic conditions \nexacerbate this problem for small firms. The SBA\n\n[[Page S12817]]\n\noffers several loan programs to help small exporters, but years of \nneglect under the previous administration have sometimes rendered these \nvaluable tools both unattractive and impractical for borrowers and \nlenders alike.\n  One of these programs is the International Trade Loan, ITL, program. \nThis program allows exporters to borrow up to $2 million with $1.75 \nmillion guaranteed by the SBA. Exporters can then use this money to \nhelp develop and expand overseas markets, upgrade equipment and \nfacilities or provide an infusion of capital if they are being hurt by \nimport competition.\n  While the original goal of this program is on target with the needs \nof larger exporters, it has not evolved to meet the financing needs of \nsmall exporters in an ever-changing global economy. The volume of loans \nmade through this program has dropped by more than 90 percent since \n2003. The SBA's other signature trade financing product--the Export \nWorking Capital Program--has also seen a significant drop in its loan \nvolume, declining by more than 31 percent over the same period.\n  With a few small but significant changes to these programs, the SBA \nwill once again be able to provide a user friendly and attractive \nfinancing option that makes sense for both borrowers and lenders. For \nexample, one of the biggest problems with the ITL program is a \ndiscrepancy between the loan cap and the guarantee, forcing borrowers \nto take out a second loan to take full advantage of the guarantee. \nAdditionally, ITL's can only be used to acquire fixed assets, rather \nthan working capital, a common need for exporters. ITL's also do not \nhave the same collateral or refinancing terms as SBA 7(a) loans.\n  The provisions in this legislation, and previous versions of the \nlegislation that I have introduced in the last three Congresses, \naddress these concerns. The bill raises the loan guarantee to $4.5 \nmillion and the loan cap to $5 million, makes working capital an \neligible use of proceeds, and extends the 7(a) program's terms for \ncollateral and refinancing. The end result is a more relevant and more \npractical tool for small exporters.\n  By making these simple changes and requiring the agency to publish an \nannual list of all participating banks and lending institutions, the \nSBA's export finance programs will once again provide small exporters \nwith the practical and modern financing options small businesses need \nand deserve. These programs, however, are only useful if a small \nbusiness owner can identify which loan products are right for them. \nLocal lenders that specialize in export financing can help get these \nproducts into the hands of the small exporters that need them the most, \nbut they are not always the most effective ones to do so.\n  The SBA has 18 finance specialists posted at one-stop assistance \ncenters throughout the country operated by the Department of Commerce. \nThese specialists, at a minimal cost, have facilitated more than $10 \nbillion in exports in the last 10 years, helping to create 140,000 new \nand higher paying jobs. Unfortunately, this program suffered staff cuts \nunder the previous administration. Legislation that I introduced \nearlier this year, S. 1196, as well as other version of this \nlegislation that I have introduced in previous Congresses, would \nrestore the staffing levels to what they were in 2002, establishing a \nfloor of 22 export finance specialists with priority staffing going to \nthose centers who have been without a finance specialist since 2003. I \nam pleased that Ranking Member Snowe has included language from my \nlegislation establishing a minimum staffing level for the program and I \napplaud her efforts to expand the program at a realistic rate by \nrequiring that no fewer than three export finance specialists are \nassigned to each SBA region within two years of enactment. I am also \npleased that the bill includes language that I proposed, requiring the \nSBA to conduct a reoccurring, biannual study on the availability of \nexport finance specialists in high and low export volume areas. This \nwill ensure that future assignment of SBA personnel and resources are \nallocated to the areas with the greatest need.\n  With more than 20 federal agencies involved in export and trade \npromotion, small exporters often don't know where to turn for help, or \neven that help--like the local finance specialists--even exist. This \nlegislation would help bring small business trade to the forefront in \ntwo ways:\n  First, it gives the SBA's Office of International Trade, OIT, more \nresources and a higher profile within the Agency, making it directly \naccountable to the Administrator instead of part of the Office of \nCapital Access, OCA, where it is currently housed. It also requires \nthat OIT make numerous internal improvements by requiring the office \nto: maintain a trade information distribution network in partnership \nwith other Federal agencies and SBA resource partners; properly staff \nand clarify the role of existing OIT positions in both regional and \ndistrict offices; provide more coordinated training between employees \nof the office and lenders, small exporters and other resource partners; \ndevelop a comprehensive trade dispute technical assistance program; and \nfinally, to develop targeted annual goals and performance metrics. OIT \nis doing an adequate job now, but with these proposed changes, the \noffice would have the potential to become a more robust partner and \nvisible advocate for small exporters seeking assistance from the SBA. I \nhave long advocated for these simple yet important changes and I am \npleased they made it into the final legislation.\n  In addition to improving the coordination and advocacy among Federal \nagencies and making needed changes to existing SBA resources, this bill \nseeks to increase the number of small businesses involved in exporting \nby using State resources more effectively. It does this by creating the \nState Trade and Export Promotion, STEP, program, a 3-year pilot grant \nprogram modeled after the SBA's successful SBIR-FAST program. Unlike \nexisting Federal programs which tend to focus their resources in States \nthat already possess a high percentage of small exporters or a large \nexport volume, STEP seeks to reach small businesses in States with \nminimal export assistance resources to target businesses that typically \ndo not export their goods and services. I have worked closely with the \nsmall business community in Louisiana and I believe that this program \nwill have a tremendous impact not only in my State, but also \nnationally.\n  Finally, this legislation requires the SBA to report back to the \ncommittee on their efforts to promote exports to small businesses \nlocated in rural areas. With the technology that we posses today, there \nis no reason why a small business located in a rural or traditionally \nnonexporting area shouldn't have access to the same opportunities \navailable to those located in urban, or high-export areas. Creating \naccess to exporting opportunities for rural small businesses could lead \nto the creation of new jobs and increased development in these \ncommunities, especially in Louisiana. I am pleased this language was \nincluded in this bill.\n  The Small Business Export Enhancement and International Trade Act of \n2009 is an important first step toward ensuring that small firms will \nhave more opportunities to grow. By increasing exporting opportunities \nfor small businesses, we will help them expand into international \nmarkets, create new and higher-paying jobs and strengthen the economy. \nI have heard from some of the members of my committee and I know how \nimportant this issue is to many of them, especially Ranking Member \nSnowe whom I have worked closely with these past months to develop this \ncomprehensive, bipartisan bill. I thank Senator Snowe for her attention \nto this issue and strong willingness to make the changes our small \nexporters so desperately need.\n  The 111th Congress will be the third consecutive Congress that I have \nintroduced or cosponsored legislation to help our small exporters. I \nintroduced a version of this legislation in the 109th Congress as \nS.3663, in the 110th Congress as S. 738 and earlier this year as S. \n1196.

Res. 373\n\n       Whereas dating, domestic, and sexual violence affect women \n     regardless of their age, and teens and young women are \n     especially vulnerable;\n       Whereas, approximately 1 in 3 adolescent girls in the \n     United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or verbal \n     abuse from a dating partner, a figure that far exceeds \n     victimization rates for other types of violence affecting \n     youth;\n       Whereas nationwide, 1 in 10 high school students (9.9 \n     percent) has been hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose \n     by a boyfriend or girlfriend;\n       Whereas more than 1 in 4 teenagers have been in a \n     relationship where a partner is verbally abusive;\n       Whereas 20 percent of teen girls exposed to physical dating \n     violence did not attend school because the teen girls felt \n     unsafe either at school, or on the way to or from school, on \n     1 or more occasions in a 30-day period;\n       Whereas violent relationships in adolescence can have \n     serious ramifications for victims by putting the victims at \n     higher risk for substance abuse, eating disorders, risky \n     sexual behavior, suicide, and adult revictimization;\n       Whereas being physically and sexually abused leaves teen \n     girls up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant and more \n     than 2 times as likely to report a sexually transmitted \n     disease;\n       Whereas nearly 3 in 4 children ages 11 to 14 (referred to \n     in this preamble as ``tweens''), say that dating \n     relationships usually begin at age 14 or younger and about 72 \n     percent of eighth and ninth graders report ``dating'';\n       Whereas 1 in 5 tweens say their friends are victims of \n     dating violence and nearly \\1/2\\ of tweens who are in \n     relationships know friends who are verbally abused;\n       Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as \n     parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know little \n     or nothing about the dating relationships of tweens;\n       Whereas teen dating abuse most often takes place in the \n     home of 1 of the partners;\n       Whereas a majority of parents surveyed believe they have \n     had a conversation with their teen about what it means to be \n     in a healthy relationship, but the majority of teens surveyed \n     said that they have not had a conversation about dating abuse \n     with a parent in the past year;\n       Whereas digital abuse and ``sexting'' is becoming a new \n     frontier for teen dating abuse;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship say they have been \n     called names, harassed, or put down by their partner through \n     cellphones and texting;\n       Whereas 3 in 10 young people have sent or received nude \n     pictures of other young people on their cell or online, and \n     61 percent who have ``sexted'' report being pressured to do \n     so at least once;\n       Whereas targets of digital abuse are almost 3 times as \n     likely to contemplate suicide as those who haven not \n     encountered such abuse (8 percent vs. 3 percent), and targets \n     of digital abuse are nearly 3 times more likely to have \n     considered dropping out of school;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to be greater in cases where the pattern of \n     violence has been established in adolescence;\n       Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of \n     addressing teen dating violence and many successful community \n     examples include education, community outreach, and social \n     marketing campaigns that also understand the cultural \n     appropriateness of programs;\n       Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are \n     also necessary for youth victims and abusers; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Teen Dating Violence \n     Awareness and Prevention Month will benefit schools, \n     communities, and families regardless of socioeconomic status, \n     race, or sex: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of February 2010, as ``National \n     Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month'';\n       (2) supports communities to empower teens to develop \n     healthier relationships; and\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States, including \n     youth and parents, schools, law enforcement, State and local \n     officials, and interested groups to observe National Teen \n     Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month with \n     appropriate programs and activities that promote awareness \n     and prevention of the crime of teen dating violence in their \n     communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/09/senate-section/article/S12818-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12818-S12819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3079.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Medical Liability Reform \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. __2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Medical liability laws create a significant portion of \n     the overall costs of health care, and contribute to \n     Americans' lack of access to health care.\n       (2) A 2006 study by PriceWaterhouse Coopers found that \n     medical liability laws and the practice of defensive medicine \n     contribute to 10 percent of all health care costs.\n       (3) The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated \n     that the Federal Government could directly save about \n     $5,600,000,000 by enacting certain medical liability reforms, \n     and that total health care spending could be reduced even \n     further if these reforms reduced the practice of defensive \n     medicine.\n       (4) According to economists Daniel P. Kessler and Mark B. \n     McClellan, defensive medicine alone costs Americans more than \n     $100,000,000,000 every year.\n       (5) Medicaid and Medicare costs must be lowered to keep \n     these crucial programs solvent.\n       (6) In part because of the costs of medical liability, 40 \n     percent of physicians refuse to see new Medicaid patients.\n       (7) Reform of the medical liability laws has been proven to \n     increase access to doctors and specialists while lowering \n     health care costs.\n       (8) In 2003, Texas adopted medical liability reforms that \n     placed a cap on non-economic damages in medical liability \n     cases and combated junk science by raising the standards of \n     qualification for expert witnesses.\n       (9) After Texas passed this reform, premiums for medical \n     malpractice liability insurance fell by 27 percent on \n     average, and in some cases, by more than 50 percent.\n       (10) Because the Texas reforms led to more affordable \n     health insurance premiums, more than 400,000 additional \n     Texans are covered by health insurance than if reform had not \n     passed.\n       (11) Because of the Texas reforms, Texas saw an overall \n     growth rate of 31 percent in the number of new physicians.\n       (12) The growth rate in the number of physicians in Texas \n     was particularly pronounced in long-underserved geographic \n     areas such as the rural and border regions, and in key \n     specialties such as obstetrics, neurosurgery, and orthopedic \n     surgery.\n       (13) Arizona adopted medical liability reforms that \n     deterred frivolous litigation by requiring expert opinion \n     testimony at the threshold of medical liability suits and by \n     raising the standards of qualification for expert witnesses.\n       (14) The health care and insurance industries are \n     industries affecting interstate commerce and the health care \n     liability litigation systems existing throughout the United \n     States are activities that affect interstate commerce by \n     contributing to the high costs of health care and premiums \n     for health care liability insurance purchased by health care \n     system providers.\n       (15) The health care liability litigation systems existing \n     throughout the United States have a significant effect on the \n     amount, distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n\n     SEC. __3.
