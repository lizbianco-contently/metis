Mr. President, the American people have made their \nvoices heard in the health care debate. Their message is clear. They \nwant reforms that bring down the staggering cost of health care and \nincrease access,\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\nand they do not want insurers turning people away.\n  In short, Americans are not happy with the status quo. But they are \njust as concerned, if not more so, with the alternatives that the White \nHouse and a handful of Democrats on Capitol Hill are pushing through \nCongress.\n  Soon, the last of the five committees involved in this debate will \nfinish its work. After that, a handful of Democratic Senators will get \ntogether in a closed conference room somewhere in the Capitol to hash \nout a final product. Their proceedings may be private, but based on \ntheir stated preferences we have got a good sense of the basics.\n  We know that the bill they send to the Senate floor will cut seniors' \nMedicare by half a trillion dollars; we know that it will raise taxes \non virtually everyone; we know it will limit the health care choices \nAmericans now enjoy. And we know it will be a big government bonanza: a \n$1 trillion pricetag and 1,000 pages of indecipherable text.\n  For the past 2 weeks, Americans have been focused on the Senate \nFinance Committee. The real focus should be on the conference room \nwhere the final bill will be decided. That is because it is in that \nroom that the Democratic leadership from the White House and Congress \nwill attempt to decide the fate of health care for everyone. Their \ndeliberations will be secret. And there is only one direction these \nSenators plan to take this legislation, and that is to the left.\n  We have seen what happens in these kinds of closed deliberations \nbefore. Over the summer, members of the HELP Committee discovered after \na month-long markup that a wellness measure they had agreed to \nunanimously in front of the cameras in July was mysteriously taken out \naway from the cameras sometime after a final vote was taken on the \nbill.\n  And we all remember how executives at AIG ended up with multimillion \ndollar bonuses after nearly driving the company off a cliff. Those \nbonuses were blessed in a closed-door meeting somewhere in the Capitol \nafter a final vote on the stimulus bill had already taken place.\n  This bill already starts out with a flawed foundation of Medicare \ncuts, more taxes, more debt, and fewer health care choices. That is \nreason enough for Americans to oppose it. Now the finishing touches \nwill be added on in secret before a rush to the finish.\n  Proponents of the administration's health care plan have been working \nhard over the past 2 weeks to convince the American people their \nconcerns are being heard. We will see if that has just been window \ndressing. The fact is, the final bill will be worked out, out of sight, \nby a mere few whose decisions will affect everyone in America. Away \nfrom the cameras, they will make decisions that affect every single \nAmerican and one-sixth of our entire economy.\n  Americans want commonsense reform. Reshaping the entire economy, \nlimiting their choices, expanding government control over health care, \ncutting Medicare, and raising taxes in the middle of the worst economy \nin memory, and then pushing it through with as little public scrutiny \nas possible is not what they would call reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10122-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

PEREZ TO BE AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Thomas E. Perez, of \nMaryland, to be an Assistant Attorney General.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:15 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first let me say how pleased I am that we \nare now considering Tom Perez to head the Civil Rights Division. We in \nMaryland are particularly proud because Tom Perez hails from our State. \nHe has had a distinguished record in the State of Maryland in service \nto the people of our State and also to the people of our Nation.\n  I am very pleased that we finally have gotten to this moment. The \nCivil Rights Division is the Nation's moral conscience. It has been \nimportant to protect the rights of all Americans against all forms of \ndiscrimination whether it is in employment, whether it is in education, \nwhether it is in housing, whether it is in voting, whether it is in \npersonal liberties or hate crimes. It is what Americans turn to to \nprotect their rights. It has had a very proud history, the Civil Rights \nDivision, since its inception, both under Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. It has had a steady course.\n  There has been one notable exception. I think we all understand that \nduring the previous administration there was an effort made to diminish \nthe importance of the Civil Rights Division. It triggered joint reports \nby the Office of Personal Responsibility and the Office of the \nInspector General. They issued a joint report on January 13, 2009. It \nfound there was consideration of political and ideological affiliations \nin hiring career attorneys at the Department of Justice, Civil Rights \nDivision, which was a violation of Federal law. We also know that \nduring the previous administration, the number of cases brought to \nprotect the civil liberties of Americans was greatly diminished, and \nthe Department took a different view, one that compromised the \nintegrity and independence of the Civil Rights Division.\n  So it is important we get back on track, and that is why I am so \npleased today that we are considering the confirmation of Tom Perez to \nbe the head of the Civil Rights Division. Tom brings a great background \nto this important assignment. He was educated at Brown University where \nhe received his undergraduate degree, the John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment, and Harvard Law School. He had experience right out of law \nschool as a prosecutor in the Civil Rights Division of the Department \nof Justice. So from day one Tom Perez knew he had a calling to help \nimprove the civil rights of Americans. Maybe it was because of his \nfamily background, the son of an immigrant, maybe it was because of his \ncommitment to the American dream, but he had that passion to help other \npeople, to protect the civil liberties and civil rights of Americans. \nHe rose to become the Deputy Chief in the Division's criminal section. \nHe was a trial attorney for the Department of Justice. He then later \ntook a very important assignment in the Senate. He became special \ncounsel to Senator Ted Kennedy. What a mentor for him. He has commented \nfrequently about his year in the Senate and what a great learning \nexperience it was to understand the importance of the Civil Rights \nDivision from the champion of civil rights in the Senate, Senator \nKennedy.\n\n  He then became a professor in civil rights law and later returned \nwith an appointment to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department \nof Health and Human Services, continuously working to promote civil \nrights. He decided to take on a unique challenge and ran for county \ncouncil in Montgomery County, MD. I am familiar with all the \njurisdictions of Maryland. Perhaps the most challenging is to be a \ncounty councilman in Montgomery County, one of our most diverse \ncounties and the largest. He was the first Latino to become president \nof the county council and took on the great challenges in that county \nin a professional way and was well respected.\n  Governor O'Malley appointed him as secretary of Labor, Licensing and \nRegulation, a critically important part of the O'Malley cabinet. Then, \nPresident Obama tapped him to be the head of the Civil Rights Division \nof the Department of Justice. On June 4, the Judiciary Committee \nrecommended, by a 17-to-2 vote, strongly bipartisan, to recommend his \nconfirmation to the entire Senate. As to reservations raised in the \ncommittee, after the confirmation vote, we had meetings with Mr. Perez \nand Members of the Senate to get a\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\nfurther understanding of their concerns and to understand where Tom \nPerez would lead the Civil Rights Division. I don't want to comment for \nmy colleagues, but I thought those meetings went extremely well. That \nis the type of person Tom Perez is. He tries to work things out without \ncompromising the responsibilities of promoting civil rights of all \nAmericans.\n  With this vote today, we can take a major step forward to restore the \nintegrity, confidence, historical role, and the reputation of the \nNation's most important agency to protect the civil rights of all \nAmericans.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport we have received from the following individuals: Martin \nO'Malley, Governor of the State of Maryland; Thomas Mike Miller, \npresident of the Maryland Senate; Mike Busch, speaker of the house of \nthe Maryland General Assembly; John McCarthy, States attorney for \nMontgomery County; along with Anthony O'Donnell, the Republican leader \nof the Maryland house of delegates; and our colleagues in the Congress, \nChris Van Hollen, who represents the eighth district; Elijah Cummings, \nwho represents the seventh congressional district; Dutch Ruppersberger, \nwho represents the second congressional district; Steny Hoyer, majority \nleader of the house from the fifth congressional district; and Erik \nPaulsen, who represents the third congressional district of Minnesota.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            State of Maryland,\n\n                                    Annapolis, MD, April 21, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: I am \n     writing to express my strong support for the nomination of \n     Thomas Perez to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil \n     Rights at the Department of Justice. Tom is a committed \n     public servant who has devoted his entire career to the \n     people of Maryland and this nation, and he is highly \n     qualified to lead the revitalization of the Civil Rights \n     Division.\n       The Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (DLLR) \n     has 1600 employees and wide ranging jurisdiction. Its \n     responsibilities range from enforcement of labor laws to the \n     oversight of our state banking system and regulation of \n     certain mortgage originators, to the administration of \n     Unemployment Insurance and workforce development programs. \n     The Department has additional consumer protection \n     responsibilities, and the job requires a person with a wide \n     breadth and depth of knowledge and experience.\n       When I asked Tom to serve as Secretary of DLLR in 2007, I \n     frankly had no idea that the issues within his agency's \n     jurisdiction would occupy such a prominent role in my \n     administration so soon. Shortly after I assumed office, we \n     were immediately confronted by the foreclosure crisis and the \n     national recession.\n       Tom immediately rose to the occasion, and has been \n     especially instrumental in leading the charge to combat the \n     foreclosure crisis, and in helping me craft an economic \n     security package to assist straggling Marylanders. In 2007 he \n     co-chaired the Homeownership Preservation Task Force, and by \n     working with all stakeholders, including both consumer groups \n     and banking representatives, he was able to craft consensus \n     reforms that gained broad bipartisan support in the General \n     Assembly. Those reforms, which lengthened the foreclosure \n     process, strengthened lending and licensing standards and \n     created new tools to combat fraud, have been recognized as \n     some of the most sweeping in the nation. One of the nation's \n     largest mortgage fraud prosecutions originated in Tom's \n     office, and has been a model of collaboration between the \n     state and federal prosecuting authorities.\n       I have been particularly impressed with Tom's leadership \n     and management skills, as well as his ability to work across \n     party lines with the Maryland General Assembly. Tom inherited \n     an agency with great potential that was not firing on all \n     cylinders. He tackled critical management and leadership \n     challenges head on, and transformed DLLR from a second tier \n     to a top tier agency. He has brought the Department \n     recognition it never before received from lawmakers and other \n     officials in the State. Republicans and Democrats alike in \n     the Maryland General Assembly have praised his policy and \n     legal acumen, and his inclusive, engaging style.\n       While Tom's nomination by President Obama leaves us with \n     the difficult task of finding someone as able and well-\n     respected to fill his shoes, I know he is the right person to \n     lead the Civil Rights Division back to prominence. I strongly \n     support his confirmation, and I urge you to do the same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Martin O'Malley,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Maryland General Assembly,\n\n                                    Annapolis, MD, April 22, 2009.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to offer an unqualified and \n     unhesitating endorsement of Thomas Perez's nomination to \n     serve as Director of the United States Department of \n     Justice's Office for Civil Rights. We know Mr. Perez to be a \n     passionate and tireless advocate, a dedicated and responsible \n     civil servant, and a thoughtful and respected leader. He will \n     be a tremendous asset to the Department of Justice.\n       Mr. Perez was appointed to serve as Maryland's Secretary of \n     Labor, Licensing and Regulation in January, 2007. He \n     inherited a historically underfunded agency beset by \n     political challenges and morale problems--a weaker leader \n     could easily have been overwhelmed by the agency's inertia. \n     Where others might have seen problems, Mr. Perez saw \n     opportunity. From his first day as Secretary, Mr. Perez \n     breathed new life into the department with a goal-oriented \n     agenda and a commitment to pro-active, results-driven \n     management.\n       The Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation \n     supervises job training and match services, unemployment \n     insurance, and many of the State's licensing and regulatory \n     boards. As Secretary, Mr. Perez had to balance the interests \n     of the business community against our State's commitment to \n     consumer protection. That can be a precarious tightrope, but \n     he won praise from business leaders and consumer advocates \n     for his willingness to listen and his ability to forge \n     consensus.\n       In addition to his responsibility for the day-to-day \n     operations of the agency, Mr. Perez helped shepherd the \n     Governor's agenda through the General Assembly. He conducted \n     himself with grace and aplomb, confronting skeptics and \n     cynics with his earnest desire to improve the lives of \n     ordinary Marylanders. His work ethic and meticulous attention \n     to the details of policy-making earned him the trust of \n     lawmakers across the political spectrum, and he parlayed that \n     trust into extraordinary legislative success for working \n     families in our state.\n       Mr. Perez championed Maryland's efforts to combat the \n     foreclosure crisis. He brought the banking industry together \n     with consumer advocates to craft meaningful reform that put \n     Maryland at the forefront of this critical issue. During this \n     year's legislative session, he brought labor organizations \n     together with industry groups to fight fraudulent \n     misclassification of employees as independent contractors. In \n     both instances, he won praise for bringing everyone to the \n     table and crafting compromises which might otherwise have \n     proved elusive.\n       We would be remiss if we did not raise the time honored \n     cliche: the nation's gain will be the State of Maryland's \n     loss. Mr. Perez's unwavering obligation to the highest ideal \n     of public service will be an asset to the Department of \n     Justice. His untiring commitment to his work will earn him \n     respect and admiration from his colleagues. His innate \n     intelligence and problem-solving abilities will help him move \n     the Office of Civil Rights forward to the benefit of all \n     Americans.\n       In the plainest and strongest terms possible, we urge you \n     to confirm Mr. Perez as Director of the Office of Civil \n     Rights. He is a remarkable public servant, and he will be an \n     exceptional asset to our nation during this tumultuous period \n     in our history.\n           Respectfully,\n     Thomas V.

In \n     that capacity, Tom took on the challenge of revamping a state \n     agency that had been long neglected and widely seen as \n     ineffective. Under Tom's leadership, this agency has gained \n     stature and become well respected by lawmakers and other \n     government officials.\n       Tom has also served as Maryland's leader to combat the \n     mortgage foreclosure crisis. Tom played a key role in helping \n     to craft a legislative package that has been called among the \n     most sweeping in the nation. Tom was the first public \n     official, that I am aware of, that several years before the \n     current mortgage crises became apparent, publicly talked \n     about the danger that lurked ahead in America's housing \n     market due to a crisis in sub-prime mortgages.\n       Tom is a committed career public servant. Tom spent 12 \n     years in federal public service, the majority as a federal \n     prosecutor for the Civil Rights Division. Tom served as \n     special counsel to Senator Edward Kennedy and was his \n     principal advisor on civil rights and criminal justice. Tom \n     was a law professor at the University of Maryland School of \n     Law from 2001-2007 where he taught a civil rights clinic \n     focusing on employment issues, health law and criminal \n     justice.\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\n       Tom is married to Ann Marie Staudenmaier (a public interest \n     lawyer) and father of three. Educated at our nation's finest \n     universities including Brown and Harvard, Tom is a brilliant \n     and articulate man of tremendous depth.\n       I urge you to act favorably on Tom's nomination and confirm \n     him as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights \n     Division at the Department of Justice.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 John J.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: As Minority Leader of the Maryland \n     House of Delegates, I am pleased to support the nomination of \n     Thomas Perez for the position of Assistant Attorney General \n     for Civil Rights.\n       In my dealings with Secretary Perez, I have always found \n     him to be fair-minded and willing to listen to a variety of \n     views on an issue. While we have not always agreed \n     ultimately, I have been impressed by his willingness to reach \n     across the aisle. That is one reason I believe Tom Perez is \n     an excellent choice to lead the Division of Civil Rights at \n     the Department of Justice.\n       During Secretary Perez's tenure at the Department of Labor, \n     Licensing, and Regulation, he has convened diverse groups of \n     stakeholders on the foreclosure crisis, adult education and \n     workforce training, and the misclassification of Maryland \n     workers to forge consensus and find common ground. During the \n     legislative session, he regularly seeks input from both \n     Democratic and Republican members of the Maryland General \n     Assembly. He also has been very responsive to my office \n     regarding constituent issues and helping to resolve the same \n     without regard to party.\n       It is my belief that the reason Tom works so hard to find \n     comprehensive solutions to the everyday problems Americans \n     face because he truly has their best interests at heart. He \n     is a committed public servant. I am confident that Tom will \n     lead the Division with commitment and integrity.\n       For those reasons, I support his nomination and strongly \n     urge his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Anthony J. O'Donnell,\n     Minority Leader.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2009.\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: I am \n     writing to offer my wholehearted support for the confirmation \n     of Thomas E. Perez as Assistant Attorney General for Civil \n     Rights. I've known Tom since 2002, and have had both the \n     honor of serving as his representative to Congress and the \n     privilege of having him serve as my representative to the \n     Montgomery County Council.\n       I have seen firsthand Tom's ability to bridge divides and \n     build coalitions in the interest of advancing the common \n     good. Throughout his service to the people of Montgomery \n     County and Maryland, this ability has gained him strong \n     support from the business community as well as the nonprofit \n     and faith communities. It has also allowed him to \n     successfully spearhead the State's nation-leading efforts to \n     combat the foreclosure crisis. He has a proven track record \n     for making decisions based on input from all stakeholders, \n     and for being open to all opinions even when they differ from \n     his own.\n       Prior to his service to his community and his state, Tom \n     served this country ably as a career attorney in the Civil \n     Rights Division. His knowledge of the law and his respect for \n     the Department of Justice as an institution guarantee that he \n     will lead the Division with integrity and with respect for \n     the career staff and their tireless work. His talent for \n     building coalitions makes him a natural to reinvigorate the \n     Division.\n       Tom is an outstanding citizen and a devoted public official \n     who has served his county, his state and his country with \n     distinction. I am honored to ask you to support his \n     nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chris Van Hollen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate. Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I write to express my strong, \n     unqualified support for the confirmation of Thomas Perez as \n     Assistant Attorney General for the Rights Division of the \n     United States Department of Justice.\n       The urgent need for strong, experienced and motivated \n     leadership of the Civil Rights Division cannot he overstated.\n       The historic ascension of our first African American \n     President and Attorney General reflect progress that is both \n     substantive and lasting. As far too many Americans are \n     painfully aware, however, this progress does not mean that \n     our nation's long journey toward becoming a truly just and \n     inclusive society is at an end.\n       President Obama and Attorney General Holder need the most \n     qualified and determined leadership in the Civil Rights \n     Division that America's legal community can provide. I am \n     firmly convinced that Thomas Perez exemplifies the character, \n     experience and dedication that will be required.\n       Tom Perez is gifted with a penetrating intellect honed at \n     Brown, The Harvard Law School and The John F. Kennedy School \n     of Government. His professional work has coupled that \n     intellectual acumen with an exemplary record of public \n     service and dedication to civil rights.\n       He has consistently advanced and defended civil rights as a \n     federal prosecutor for the Civil Rights Division, Special \n     Counsel for Senator Edward Kennedy, Deputy Assistant Attorney \n     General for Civil Rights under former Attorney General Janet \n     Reno, Director of the Office of Civil Rights at the \n     Department of Health and Human Services and, currently, as \n     Maryland Secretary of Labor, Licensing and Regulation.\n       In addition, Tom Perez taught at the University of Maryland \n     School of Law from 2001 until 2007, where he advanced the \n     school's nationally recognized clinical law and health \n     program--and he currently serves on the faculty of the George \n     Washington School of Public Health.\n       On a personal note, I have been privileged to work with \n     Thomas Perez in his current role as Secretary of Maryland's \n     Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. He has been a \n     vocal leader in our shared efforts to combat foreclosures and \n     improve workplace protections.\n       He has shown a great ability to bring parties together and \n     build consensus in important policy areas without \n     compromising his commitment to helping people. In these times \n     of great economic distress, Tom has been a true voice for all \n     Marylanders.\n       Chairman Leahy, it is hard to imagine how President Obama \n     and Attorney General Holder could have made a better choice \n     to help them restore the Civil Rights Division as this \n     nation's leading defender of our fundamental freedoms. While \n     I acknowledge proper deference to the Senate's constitutional \n     power and responsibility in this matter, I also believe that \n     it is essential--and appropriate--to add my personal voice in \n     support of this nomination.\n       Tom Perez has committed his entire career to advancing \n     civil rights and serving the public good. He is uniquely \n     qualified to repair what has been broken at the Civil Rights \n     Division--and I urge his speedy confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Elijah Cummings,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2009.\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: I am \n     writing to express my strong support for the nomination of \n     Thomas Perez for Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \n     Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice \n     and urge his confirmation.\n       Secretary Perez's qualifications and credentials are \n     exceptional. He is a nationally recognized civil rights \n     lawyer whose breadth and depth of experience makes him an \n     ideal choice to lead the Civil Rights Division. He knows the \n     Division inside and out, because he worked there for almost a \n     decade in a variety of critical positions. As a prosecutor in \n     the Division, he was lead attorney in some of the \n     Department's most high profile and complex civil rights \n     cases. As Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, \n     he oversaw complex litigation in the employment and education \n     areas. As a member of the nonpartisan Kaiser Commission on \n     Medicaid and the Uninsured and the former Director of the \n     Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and \n     Human Services, he has a keen understanding of health care \n     issues that are front and center in our national dialogue.\n       In Maryland, Secretary Perez, in his current capacity as \n     Secretary of Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and \n     Regulation, has been a principal architect of Governor Martin \n     O'Malley's wide ranging, successful foreclosure prevention \n     initiative. Secretary Perez led the legislative effort that \n     resulted in the passage of a package of reforms that were \n     comprehensive and consensus. He negotiated written agreements \n     with six major mortgage servicing companies to provide \n     meaningful relief to Maryland homeowners in danger of \n     foreclosure. One of the largest ongoing mortgage fraud \n     prosecutions in the nation originated in Secretary Perez's \n     office.\n       He has held leadership positions in federal, state and \n     local government, and has worked in all three branches of the \n     federal government. As such, he has an acute understanding of \n     the need for the federal government to work in partnership \n     with state and local governments to safeguard the civil \n     rights of all Americans.\n       Leading the Civil Rights Division, like running an Attorney \n     General's office, requires extensive legal, management and\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\n     leadership skills, as well as extensive experience in \n     building coalitions. Secretary Perez has led important \n     agencies. He currently heads a Department of roughly 1600 \n     employees, and has held other leadership positions in the \n     federal government. He has a well earned reputation as a \n     consensus builder.\n       Mr. Perez's distinguished career demonstrates his vast \n     leadership ability, integrity and commitment to public \n     service. I am confident that Mr. Perez would make an \n     exceptional Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights \n     Division and urge you to confirm his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Erik Paulsen,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2009.\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: I wish to add my \n     strong support for the nomination of Thomas Perez to be \n     Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the U.S. \n     Department of Justice.\n       Tom has dedicated his life to public service, to the \n     citizens of Maryland and to the nation. He has a breadth of \n     experience in the law, public policy and management, and, he \n     is known as a fair minded, knowledgeable and agreeable \n     advocate for his clients, his law students and the public at \n     large.\n       I was impressed that after Tom's service in very important \n     posts in the Administration of President Bill Clinton, he \n     worked to put into practice the policies he advocated. He \n     chose to work in local government, winning election to the \n     Montgomery County Council in Maryland and earning the support \n     of his constituents and confidence of his colleagues on the \n     Council when they elected Tom their President. At the same \n     time, Tom commuted to Baltimore and taught public service \n     advocacy to law students at the University of Maryland, \n     Baltimore Law School.\n       Most recently, Tom demonstrated his management skills as \n     the Secretary of Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing \n     and Regulation. He energized the agency and put it at the \n     forefront of the effort to help Maryland homeowners facing \n     foreclosure, along with many other reforms to help protect \n     consumers. He was well respected by legislators in Annapolis \n     from both sides of the aisle serving in the Maryland General \n     Assembly.\n       I believe Tom possesses the talents and skills to make the \n     Civil Rights Division an outstanding performer in the Justice \n     Department. I hope your Committee will act favorably and \n     expeditiously on the President's nomination for Tom to serve \n     our Country again.\n           Respectfully,\n     C.A.

I urge his speedy confirmation. \n     Currently leading Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing \n     and Regulation, Secretary Perez has shown outstanding \n     leadership throughout his career at all levels of government.\n       I have worked with Secretary Perez on many critical issues, \n     and I consider him an excellent choice for the Civil Rights \n     Division. He has already served there in a variety of key \n     positions. As a prosecutor in the Division, he was the lead \n     attorney in many high-profile civil rights cases. As Deputy \n     Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, he oversaw \n     complex litigation in the employment and education areas. As \n     a member of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the \n     Uninsured, as well as the former Director of the Office for \n     Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     Secretary Perez would also bring to his new role a deep \n     understanding of health care disparities. In my state of \n     Maryland, Secretary Perez led a 1,600-employee department and \n     was the principal architect of Governor O'Malley's wide-\n     ranging foreclosure prevention initiative. Secretary Perez \n     also negotiated written agreements with major mortgage \n     servicing companies to provide relief to homeowners facing \n     foreclosure.\n       Leading the Civil Rights Division requires high-level \n     management and consensus-building skills.

Mr. President, this morning I rise to make a few remarks \nin support of the nomination of Tom Perez as Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Civil Rights Division. Mr. Perez is an exceptionally qualified \nnominee. His nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on \na strong bipartisan vote of 17 to 2. He has the backing of a bipartisan \ngroup of former heads of the Department of Justice Civil Rights \nDivision, the backing of State attorneys general, and the backing of \nother elected officials. His varied experience will serve him well in \nmany aspects of this position.\n  He was a career employee with the Civil Rights Division for 10 years \nand understands the importance of enforcing the law without regard to \npolitics. He has taken on racially motivated crime through the \nprosecution of White supremacists who went on a fatal crime spree in \nLubbock, TX, and the perpetrators of cross burning designed to \nintimidate an interracial family.\n  Mr. Perez served as Director of the Office for Civil Rights at the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he worked to expand \nopportunities for individuals with disabilities to receive care and \ntreatment in community-based settings rather than institutions and \nhelped develop landmark medical records privacy regulation. He was a \nspecial counselor to Senator Ted Kennedy. Currently, Mr. Perez serves \nas Maryland's Secretary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. In this \nposition, he enforces workplace safety laws, protects consumers through \nthe enforcement of a wide range of consumer rights laws, and \ncollaborates with businesses and workers to address critical workforce \ndevelopment needs. It is hard to imagine anyone better prepared to \nserve as the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.\n  Mr. Perez has firsthand experience fighting racially motivated \ncrimes. Mr. Perez has firsthand experience standing up for the disabled \nand patient privacy. He has firsthand experience protecting the rights \nof workers and consumers.\n  I urge my colleagues to move expeditiously to confirm this nomination \nand put a man of rare and extensive experience in charge of the Civil \nRights Division for the benefit of all of our citizens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10125-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10125-S10137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, as we debate this Defense appropriations \nbill, many of my colleagues have discussed the commitment we make to \nthose who serve this country in uniform. It is a commitment that begins \non the day they volunteer for military service, and it extends through \ntheir retirement and beyond.\n  Just as we have an obligation to servicemembers who work in harm's \nway, we need to offer strong support for those who are left here at \nhome.\n  Military families bear a burden that must not be forgotten. They \ndeserve our utmost gratitude. And their stability and well-being affect \nthe readiness of our Armed Forces. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines cannot afford to be distracted by worries about those they \nleave at home. We need to address the needs of these families, not only \nto honor the sacrifices they make, but also to provide stability. \nQuality\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\neducation is at the very center of these needs.\n  That is why we must increase funding for Impact Aid, a program which \nprovides assistance to school districts that serve military families.\n  Throughout my career in public service, I have been a strong believer \nin education as a powerful force to shape lives--to give people the \ntools they need and the inspiration that will help them succeed. It is \nthe foundation upon which we build our Nation's future.\n  But even when we see an improvement in scholastic performance at the \nnational level, some groups of students fall further and further \nbehind. Many children of Federal workers, including military personnel, \nfall into one of these groups.\n  Military bases--and other Federal facilities--occupy land that might \notherwise be zoned for commercial use. Because of this, local school \ndistricts suffer from a reduced tax base to fund their expenses. This \nlimits the amount that can be spent in the classroom and leaves \nstudents at a serious disadvantage compared with kids in neighboring \ntowns.\n  We need to correct this inequity.\n  In North Chicago, IL--the home of the Great Lakes Naval Training \nCenter--only half of the 4,000 students meet or exceed State standards. \nEven with some Federal assistance, North Chicago's School District 187 \nis able to spend just under $7,000 per student, per year.\n  But in nearby District 125, they have the resources to spend nearly \ntwice as much per pupil, and the school performs among the best in the \nState. An increase in Impact Aid funding would help to level this \nplaying field, ensuring that the children of our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines are not at a disadvantage because of their parents' \nservice.\n  Impact Aid funds are delivered directly to the school district in \nneed, so they do not incur administrative costs at the State level. \nThis makes Impact Aid one of the most efficient--and effective--Federal \neducation programs.\n  Scott Air Force Base is located in Mascoutah, IL--a community that \nreceives Impact Aid funding. The local school district is able to spend \nonly $6,000 a year on each child, but 90 percent of the students meet \nor exceed State standards. If these are the results that some students \ncan achieve with only $6,000 per year, imagine how well Mascoutah might \nperform with even a small increase in available funds.\n  It is vital that we target Federal assistance to the people who need \nit most--like the students in North Chicago and Mascoutah. That is why \nI am proud to be a member of the Senate Impact Aid Coalition, a group \nof 35 Senators devoted to protecting this important program. And that \nis why I believe that the $30 million we have set aside for Impact Aid \nis simply not enough.\n  It is time to step up our commitment to military families. It is time \nto make sure all children have access to a quality education, \nregardless of who they are or where they are from.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the House version of \nthis appropriations bill, which commits $44 million to the Impact Aid \nProgram. And when the legislation reaches conference committee, I urge \nChairman Levin to defer to the House mark.\n  The $14 million difference between the House and Senate versions may \nnot seem significant compared to the size of the Federal budget. It may \nnot seem significant next to the amount we spend to equip and deploy \nour men and women in uniform. But it will be significant to the \nstudents.\n  Students in North Chicago, and Mascoutah--O'Fallon, and Rockford--and \nhundreds of communities in Illinois and over 260,000 students in 103 \nschool districts across the United States.\n  We owe them the same support we continue to show to their parents in \nuniform. And it is time to step up our efforts to meet that commitment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold that request?\n  Mr. BURRIS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I rise today to express my serious \nconcerns about the nomination of Mr. Tom Perez to head the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Department of Justice. First, given his affiliation \nwith CASA de Maryland, an extreme immigrant advocacy organization for \nwhich he served as president of the board, I am concerned that he will \nutilize the Civil Rights Division to undermine immigration enforcement.\n  Second, Mr. Perez has made statements indicating that he believes \nhealth care is a civil right and he has a disturbing view of the \nresponsibilities of health care providers. Third, his views on a \nClinton-era executive order requiring health care providers to provide \nservices and documents in languages other than English infringes on the \nright of States to declare English as the official State language. \nFinally, though not directly related to Mr. Perez's qualifications, I \nam deeply troubled by the Department of Justice's failure to respond to \nlegitimate requests for information by the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights regarding the \nDepartment's decision earlier this year to dismiss the New Black \nPanthers voter intimidation case.\n  I know some of my colleagues have more thoroughly discussed Mr. \nPerez's positions on immigration issues, but I want to briefly mention \nsome of my concerns. Mr. Perez served on the board of CASA Maryland \nfrom 1995-2002 and as president of the board from 2001-2002. CASA \nprovides assistance to Latinos and immigrants in Maryland; it also \npromotes day labor sites, opposes restrictions on immigrants receiving \ndriver's licenses, and supports in-State tuition for immigrants. More \nconcerning, CASA has been criticized for issuing a pamphlet that \ninstructed immigrants targeted by Federal authorities on what to do if \nthey are arrested or detained. The Washington Times ran an article on \nthe brochure, noting that it ``features cartoonlike drawings of armed \nblack and white police officers escorting Hispanic men in handcuffs and \nshows babies crying because their fathers are behind bars.'' I have \nconcerns about Mr. Perez's lengthy association with an organization \nthat advocates these extreme positions.\n  I also believe Mr. Perez has a disturbing view of the health care \nsystem and particularly of the responsibilities of health care \nproviders. Mr. Perez has made statements indicating that he believes \nhealth care is a civil right. He also has said that health care \nproviders receiving Federal funds must provide services in languages \nother than English or risk forfeiture of those funds due to title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act and a Clinton-era executive order directing \nFederal departments and agencies to ensure that those with limited \nEnglish proficiency, LEP, are given meaningful access to programs and \nactivities conducted by the Federal Government or by recipients of \nFederal funds. I would note that this executive order was not enforced \nby the Bush administration. I disagree with Mr. Perez's interpretation \nof the Civil Rights Act, and in 2006, I offered an amendment to \nimmigration legislation to repeal the executive order. After I offered \nthat amendment, Mr. Perez wrote an article in which he stated that I \nhad a ``distressing disregard for the doctor-patient relationship,'' \nand that I would ``undermine meaningful communication between doctors \nand patients--thus relegating those who do not speak English to a lower \nrung of our health care system.''\n  After all my years of practicing medicine, I take offense at someone \nstating that I have a ``distressing disregard'' for the doctor-patient \nrelationship. I have treated numerous patients who do not speak English \nand found ways to communicate with them. Often these patients have \nfamily members who speak some English or they find other ways to \ncommunicate. There is no reason to burden health care providers with \nthe expense of having to provide services in languages other than \nEnglish.\n  Following the Judiciary Committee vote on his nomination, Senators \nSessions, Cardin, and I met privately with Mr. Perez to discuss my \nconcerns about his positions on health care issues, and not only did he \nnot alleviate my concerns, but he also made no effort to apologize for \nhis incendiary comments. I believe Mr. Perez fails to understand how \nthe executive order undermines\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\npatient care, and I fear this lack of understanding will affect similar \npolicies he will implement if he is confirmed to head the Civil Rights \nDivision.\n  Although Mr. Perez clearly has a passion for limited English--\nproficiency individuals, I am afraid this passion clouds his judgment \nas it pertains to health care treatment and costs and will affect his \njudgment as the head of the Civil Rights Division. As proof, I offer \nthe following example. In 2002, the Office of Management and Budget, \nOMB, issued a study which stated, ``we anticipate that the cost of LEP \nassistance, both to government and to the United States economy, could \nbe substantial, particularly if the Executive Order is implemented in a \nway that does not provide uniform, consistent guidance to the entities \nit covers . . . provision of language services could be most costly for \nthe healthcare sector.'' In contrast, Mr. Perez has stated that he does \n``not believe that Executive Order 13166 has a fiscal impact on State \nor Federal Governments because it imposes no new requirements on \nthem.'' This lack of judgment is concerning to me.\n  In addition to my disagreement with Mr. Perez on the treatment of \nhealth care as a civil right, his views on the Clinton-era executive \norder requiring health care providers to provide services and documents \nin languages other than English infringes on the right of States to \ndeclare English as the official State language. Specifically, the \ncurrent acting assistant attorney general for the Office of Civil \nRights sent a preemptive letter to Oklahoma's attorney general, \nthreatening prosecution and retraction of Federal funds if Oklahoma \nenacted a constitutional amendment pending before the State legislature \nat that time, which would declare English as the official State \nlanguage. It is unprecedented for DOJ to send such a preemptive letter. \nApproximately 30 other States have English-only policies, and, to my \nknowledge, none of these States has received such a letter. Three of \nthose States have laws similar to the Oklahoma proposal. Thus, this \nletter to Oklahoma was not directed against its current law, but aimed \nat preventing such a law from being enacted because DOJ views it as \npossibly violating civil rights laws. Subsequently, the Oklahoma \nLegislature passed the amendment, and it will be presented to the \npeople for approval in 2010.\n  I am disturbed that in written questions for the record, Mr. Perez \naffirmed the Department's position. I asked Mr. Perez if it would be \nappropriate for the Office of Civil Rights to send such a preemptive \nletter, and he stated ``if the Civil Rights Division believes that a \nstate's `English Only' provisions do not comply with Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, it would be appropriate for it to issue that \nsort of letter.'' He also stated that the Clinton-era executive order \ndoes not undermine ``the rights of states to declare English as their \nofficial language.'' Furthermore, Mr. Perez believes that the executive \norder ``does not create new obligations for states.'' As a result of \nthe Office of Civil Rights' letter to Oklahoma, all members of the \nOklahoma delegation have sent a response letter to Attorney General \nHolder. The letter asks him to explain why the Office of Civil Rights \nsent the letter to Oklahoma, whether similar letters have been sent to \nother States or cities with English-only policies, outline what type of \nfunding would be denied to Oklahoma if the law was enacted, and whether \nthis preemptive letter-writing process is DOJ's policy. To date, the \nState of Oklahoma has not received a response. Without such \nexplanation, it appears that Oklahoma was specifically targeted in a \npolitical maneuver by DOJ since there was no Oklahoma law enacted that \nviolated civil rights laws at the time it sent the letter.\n  In his writings, Mr. Perez also has advocated for affirmative action \nin admissions to health care schools because he believes minority \napplicants are more likely to work in underserved populations. On March \n30, 2009, Linda Chavez--former Staff Director of the U.S. Commission on \nCivil Rights, 1983-1985, and Secretary of Labor nominee--wrote an \narticle critical of Mr. Perez's arguments for race-conscious admissions \npolicies for health professions schools. She notes that in one article, \nMr. Perez ``cited a handful of studies that purport to show that \nminority doctors are more likely to provide medical care to underserved \npoor minority populations than white physicians are. He then leapt to \nthe conclusion that the best way to improve access to medical care for \nunderserved populations was to insist that medical schools use race or \nethnicity in choosing which students to admit.'' She claims that this \nappears to be an argument in support of ``a form of medical apartheid \nin which minority patients should be served by minority doctors under \nthe presumption that both groups benefit from this practice.'' She \ncalls this argument ``insulting and dangerous'' and notes that \n``doctors who primarily treat patients enrolled in government programs \nare less likely than those with private insurance to have passed \ndemanding board certification in their specialties and to have access \nto high-quality specialists in other fields. Under Perez's rationale, \nit shouldn't matter whether the doctors who serve poor people are less \nlikely to be board-certified so long as they are black or brown.'' She \nfurther notes, ``Perez's solution to the problem is to lower standards \neven further so that more under-qualified minority physicians are \nadmitted to practice medicine. Medical schools already admit black and, \nto a lesser degree, Hispanic students with lower qualifications than \nwhites or Asians.''\n  Finally, I am deeply troubled by the Justice Department's failure to \nrespond to legitimate requests for information regarding its decision \nnot to pursue the prosecution of the New Black Panther Party voter \ncase. Earlier this year, House Judiciary Committee Members exchanged a \nseries of letters with the Justice Department requesting an explanation \nfor why the Department decided not to pursue the case against the New \nBlack Panther Party for alleged voter intimidation that occurred in the \nNovember 2008 elections in Philadelphia. These Members sought an \nexplanation for the dismissal of the case, which the Bush Justice \nDepartment had filed in early January 2009. The Justice Department did \nnot respond to these inquiries until mid-July, and even then they were \nvague and indicated possible political interference with this case. \nFollowing the denial of this request for information, the House Members \nasked members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold Mr. Perez's \nnomination until the Department provided a more thorough response. \nSenator Sessions also sent a letter to the Justice Department and did \nnot receive an acceptable response. The independent U.S. Commission on \nCivil Rights also has demanded that the Justice Department explain its \ndismissal of the lawsuit against members of the Black Panther Party and \nhave not received a satisfactory response from DOJ.\n  Voter intimidation is unacceptable, and Congress deserves an \nexplanation of the Justice Department's actions. Oversight of the \nDepartment is a legitimate function of Congress, and Members deserve an \nexplanation rather than stonewalling. For this reason, I will vote \nagainst cloture on Mr. Perez's nomination--as a protest to this lack of \ncooperation. I will vote against Mr. Perez's nomination based on the \naforementioned concerns about his policy positions.\n  Madam President, I thank Senator Cardin because he graciously \narranged a meeting between myself and Senator Sessions and, I believe, \nSenator Kyl several months ago. There is no question that Mr. Perez is \na very bright, engaging, and competent individual.\n  Regretfully, my concerns with his nomination were not allayed by that \nmeeting. I think Senator Cardin has done a great job shepherding this, \nand I know the outcome. I still think the American people ought to hear \nabout the concerns I have.\n  We are in the midst of a lot of difficulty in our country. We are \nstruggling somewhat with our mojo, our confidence, with where we are \ngoing and how we are going to get there. A lot of it comes back to how \ndid we ever get to the depth of problems we are having today? I think \nabout this a lot, because I think the answer to it is the solution for \nhow we get out of the problems we are in. Where do we go? How is it \nthat we have an almost $12 trillion debt right now, $100 trillion in \nunfunded liabilities, and a budget deficit this year that, by the time \nyou count what we stole from Social Security and\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\nall the other trust funds, is about $1.8 trillion, and debt that will \ndouble in 5 years and triple in 10--how did we get there?\n  I think this nomination is a key answer for us. How we got there was \nbuilding a Federal Government that has forgotten several things, but, \nmost importantly, what the Constitution said about its real role. No. \n2, it has allayed the concerns and the benefits of personal \nresponsibility in this country.\n  I think Mr. Perez is a fine man, but I think his viewpoint is a \ndisaster for the future of this country in terms of what is a civil \nright and what isn't. It is a civil right, according to Mr. Perez, that \nI have to, as a physician or a hospital or a grocery store, interpret \nlanguage for anybody who would come to this country and cannot speak \nthe language.\n  Our history is that people who have come to our country learned the \nlanguage so they can succeed. One of the things that has made us great \nhas been the commonality of English. The very statements Mr. Perez \nwould make--that doctors who don't agree and health care providers who \ndon't agree with his perception of a civil right of having somebody \nspeak your language, no matter what it is, that they don't care about \ntheir patients and don't care about healing--is a step too far. But \nthose are his statements.\n  If we are to get out of the problems we are in as a nation, it is \ngoing to take us time to relook at what made us successful. I mentioned \nall these other problems before, because in the Constitution--I read a \nletter from a constituent this morning about how my obligation for \nOklahoma is to represent only Oklahoma's interests. I said, you know, \nthat isn't the oath I took. The oath I took was to uphold the \nConstitution. So now we have this expansive Federal Government we are \nchoking on, not just in terms of its costs but also in terms of how its \ntentacles reach into people's lives. We are getting ready to have a \nhealth care debate to enhance that by another 25 percent in terms of \nthe reach of the Federal Government into your individual lives, and we \nhave a nominee for the Justice Department who believes that individual \nresponsibility and personal accountability don't fall equally across \nthis country, it falls only on those providing services.\n  The other issue is the fact that 30 States have English-only \nlanguage. The Justice Department this past spring and summer sent \nnotification to the State of Oklahoma on a bill that was in the \nlegislature, threatening the State of Oklahoma if they passed that \nbill. Well, 13 other States have identical bills, or laws, on what was \nbeing passed in the legislature in Oklahoma, and it will come to a vote \nof the people. So the legislature passed it, and it will come to the \nvote of the people this November. But they sent a threatening letter. \nThey won't answer our letter asking how many other States have you sent \nthat letter to. They didn't. It was about discussing whether an \nindividual has any personal responsibility to be able to communicate.\n  Finally, we have the Justice Department refusing to answer questions \nabout true voter intimidation and the dropping of a case where that \noccurred. You cannot be on both sides of the civil rights issue. You \ncan't say it is good over here but not over there. Denying people or \nmanipulating voters has as great an impact on individual civil rights \nas any other thing.\n  I come to the floor not to say Mr. Perez is not a fine man. But it is \nhis kind of thinking that expands well beyond what our Founders ever \nthought was a guaranteed civil right. I readily admit that our Founders \nwere wrong on several of those issues. But when we expand it beyond the \ncase, that goes away from personal responsibility and accountability. \nThere is a balance, and we need to protect everybody's civil rights in \nthis country. We are having a human rights hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee right now on some of these very issues.\n  Mr. Perez's extreme views, in fact, are that if States have English-\nonly laws, he will go after that, and if we don't have the same \nviewpoint he has, rather than what the Constitution says and what the \nprecedent from court hearings says, I think that will not lead to an \noutcome that will be favorable for our country.\n  I will finish up by saying our problems are gigantic. They are not \nsimple. There are not simple answers.\n\n  The condition in which we find ourselves is from excess--whether it \nis excess earmarking, excess program, lack of oversight, or the excess \nof one hardened position over a balanced system that protects human \nrights but also does not destroy our system. I believe although Mr. \nPerez is qualified, his foundational biases should eliminate him from \nthis position.\n  I again thank my colleague from Maryland. He has been very \naccommodating during this course. I had lifted previously my hold on \nMr. Perez, and I think he knows that. But I am concerned with the \ndirection of his leadership and what it will mean in terms of where we \ngo as a country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his \ncooperation as we have moved this nomination to the Senate floor and \nwill have a vote today. I thank him for the manner in which he handled \nhis concerns, his willingness to meet with Mr. Perez, and to talk \nopenly about these issues.\n  He and I may disagree on one fundamental principle; that is, I think \ncivil rights is a basic responsibility of the Federal Government to \nenforce. I think every person in this country should have the \nopportunities that are granted in America. I want to make sure our \ngovernment actively pursues a civil rights agenda because I think that \nis important to protect everyone's rights.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Through the Chair, I ask the Senator, my problem is not \nwith that; I agree with the Senator on that. My question is as we carry \nout expansion beyond that in terms of Executive orders that are not in \nthe law but are Executive orders that we have never ruled on, and then \nwe are going to consider that.\n  Specifically I ask him, does he recognize the estimated $6 billion \ncost in the health care system if, in fact, Mr. Perez's interpretation \nof that Executive order was carried to its fullest extent by making \ntranslation services available to anybody of any language at any time \nthroughout the whole country? That would be my question. I appreciate \nhis thought.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague for the question. \nTom Perez, in our discussions, said he would clearly use a reasonable \nstandard. I might point out that the Executive order to which the \nSenator is referring was strengthened both under the Clinton \nadministration and Bush administration. President Bush's administration \nalso believed this was an important provision. The Senator is correct.\n  I also point out in regard to the understanding of English, Tom Perez \ncomes from an immigrant family and believes very strongly that everyone \nshould learn English; that it is an important part of our country. He \nhas expressed that openly. He also has indicated that we should be \ndoing more to help immigrant families be competent in English.\n  The issue here deals with the receipt of health care. One has to be \nable to communicate. One has to be able to communicate with the people \nwith whom one comes in contact. We know that is one of the key issues \non quality care. It was for that reason that both the Clinton \nadministration and the Bush administration adopted regulations to deal \nwith the ability to communicate when people enter our health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. Perez has indicated in interpreting that regulation that a \nreasonable test must be complied with, but it is certainly an important \nissue in dealing with quality care.\n  Let me, if I may, quote one of the individuals who has recommended to \nus that we confirm Mr. Perez as the head of the Civil Rights Division \nand compliments President Obama on his choice; that is, the former \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services under George \nBush. I am referring to Dr. Sullivan. Dr. Sullivan states:\n\n       Tom Perez is a nationally recognized civil rights lawyer \n     who enjoys an impeccable reputation as someone who is \n     knowledgeable, inclusive, effective, and even-handed. He is\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\n     an ideal nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil \n     Rights.\n\n  I point out it is unfair to judge Mr. Perez on an Executive order, \nand I think that Executive order is an important part of our health \ncare in this country. He, as the enforcer of our civil rights, will \nenforce that Executive order because he knows it is important in \nprotecting the civil rights of the people who are in America. But he \nalso has a reputation for doing that in a fair manner, an effective \nmanner, and an evenhanded manner. That should be the judgment that we \nuse in this body as to whether to support his confirmation.\n  I think third party validators have made it clear that Tom Perez is a \nperson who will exercise that judgment correctly. I hope my colleagues \nwill support his confirmation on the floor of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to address the nomination of \nThomas Perez to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights \nDivision at the Department of Justice.\n  That is an important position. It requires ability and experience and \nfairness. I think President Obama, as all Presidents, is entitled to \nsome deference in selecting executive branch nominees such as this one. \nI have come to the conclusion after some contemplation that I am not \nable to support this nominee. I do not desire that his nomination be \ndelayed unless there will be some additional matters that need to be \nlooked at of which I am not now aware. So I am prepared to vote up or \ndown. I know we have only one vote, and that is a question of cloture, \nwhether to bring this nomination up for an up-or-down vote.\n  I guess I am at a point where I don't feel comfortable voting either \nway on that if we don't have any other votes. I will wrestle with that \ndecision.\n  The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is charged \nwith protecting the civil rights of all Americans. It is an important \ndivision. As such, it is critical that the division be free from \npartisanship and not be used as a tool to further an agenda of one \ngroup or another, one ideology or another.\n  The President has chosen this nominee, someone who has a record of \nand a reputation for very strong political activity. That is not \ndisqualifying, but it is a matter I am concerned about because I am \nconcerned about this division.\n  In reviewing Mr. Perez's past statements and his record, I am \nconcerned whether he is capable of putting aside partisan beliefs and \nwhether he is, therefore, suited to head the Civil Rights Division of \nthe U.S. Department of Justice.\n  Over the past several months, news reports have raised concerns that \ndecisionmaking at the Department and the Civil Rights Division in \nparticular have been based on politics and not on protecting civil \nrights. I hate to say that, but real objections have been raised.\n  In May, the Justice Department voluntarily dismissed a lawsuit that \nit had won against the New Black Panther Party. During the last \nelection, two of that group's members had dressed in military-style \nuniforms and intimidated voters outside a Philadelphia voting place.\n  A long-time civil rights activist who was there and who saw it, \nBartle Bull, called it ``an outrageous affront to American democracy \nand the rights of voters to participate in an election without fear.''\n  On July 30, the Washington Times reported that a political appointee, \nThomas Perrelli, the Associate Attorney General of the Department of \nJustice, and third in charge of that great Department, approved the \ndecision to suddenly reverse course and drop the complaint. Many people \nhave seen the video of that utterly unacceptable activity by the New \nBlack Panther Party. Mr. Perrelli's decision to allow this voter \nintimidation to go unprosecuted stands in stark contrast to his \nstatements made during the nomination process when he stated:\n\n       I agree that both civil and criminal laws for governing the \n     conduct of elections should be enforced.\n\n  Of course, that is fundamental.\n  In May, the Members of the House Judiciary Committee sought an \nexplanation from the Department. They had taken a judgment in the case, \nsenior career prosecutors had, against this group. The question was, \napparently they began a discussion of giving it away, setting it \naside--a judgment they had already taken. Eventually that is what the \nDepartment did, through some maneuvers that I do not think are \nconsistent with the normal processes of the Department of Justice. They \nfound one group within the Department whose responsibility did not \ninclude making these kinds of decisions, they made a decision that it \nwas okay to set aside the judgment against them, a civil judgment, I \nthink, that they had taken. It was not good.\n  The House Judiciary Committee, our colleagues, demanded an \nexplanation. The responses of the administration were vague and \nincomplete. In addition, the independent U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights has demanded that the Justice Department explain the dismissal \nof that lawsuit, but the administration rebuffed the request, claiming \nthat the Department decided to investigate the case internally through \nits Office of Professional Responsibility. The Department of Justice \nclaims it cannot provide information to anyone on the outside until \nthat internal investigation is complete.\n  Based on the lack of document production and lack of answers from the \nDepartment of Justice, on September 30, the Civil Rights Commission \nChairman, Gerald Reynolds, wrote to Attorney General Holder, repeating \nhis request for information on previous voter intimidation \ninvestigations so the Commission could determine whether the \nDepartment's reversal of course in this case constituted a change in \npolicy and what the implications of this would be.\n  Chairman Reynolds also pointed out that:\n\n       [M]any aspects of the Commission's inquiry have no \n     connection with the matter, subject to the OPR jurisdiction . \n     . .\n\n  And that if the Department were nonresponsive, the Commission would \nbe forced to propound interrogatories and interview requests directly \non affected Justice Department personnel.\n  So even the independent Commission on Civil Rights is concerned about \nthis. If you care about voting rights, how did this happen that we \ndismiss a case when there is a video of one of the most blatant \nintimidations you can imagine at a polling place? Serious questions \nhave arisen. Was the dismissal of the case a blatant partisan political \nmove by the Department of Justice? Was this Black Panther group \nprotected because they were on the right side of the election? If so, \nit implicates serious dangers for voter intimidation prosecutions in \nthe future, I suggest. Before we vote to approve Mr. Perez as head of \nthe Division of Civil Rights, the Senate needs to know how he will \nconduct the office.\n  Unfortunately, this kind of issue is only one of the important issues \nhe will be facing. In June, it became apparent that the Justice \nDepartment would work against commonsense measures by States to ensure \nthat only citizens would be allowed to vote in elections. The Supreme \nCourt has held that States can pass and enforce voter identification \nlaws to protect the integrity of elections. Yet according to the \nAssociated Press, the Civil Rights Division under Attorney General \nHolder has:\n\n     . . . rejected Georgia's system of using Social Security \n     numbers and driver's license data to check when prospective \n     voters are citizens.\n\n  Rather than working alongside the State of Georgia to ensure that \nonly citizens are allowed to vote, which would be a good goal and role \nfor the Department of Justice, the Department has worked to ensure that \nthe system remains broken. As the Georgia Secretary of State has \nobserved:\n\n       The Department of Justice has thrown open the door for \n     activist organizations such as ACORN to register noncitizens \n     to vote in Georgia elections, and the State has no ability to \n     verify an applicant's citizenship status or whether the \n     individual even exists. The Department of Justice completely \n     disregarded Georgia's obvious and direct interest in \n     preventing noncitizens from voting.\n\n[[Page S10130]]\n\n     Clearly, politics took priority over common sense and good \n     public policy.\n\n  The Georgia Secretary of State said that. That is a serious charge. \nThis is very troubling.\n  There seems to be a view by some that the more people who vote, the \nbetter elections are; that voting in itself is a good thing and we \nshould want more and more people to vote. Of course, we want all \neligible people to vote. It seems to be implicit in this argument that \nit matters little if the people who vote are illegal or the votes cast \nare fraudulent votes. But I contend, I think without much dispute, it \nis as damaging to a fair election to allow someone to vote who is not \neligible or someone to vote twice, fraudulently, or someone to vote for \nsomeone who did not show up on election day and slip into the ballot \nbox and say: I am John Jones and vote for that person--that does as \nmuch damage to the integrity of elections as if an individual somehow \nwere wrongfully denied the right to vote in the outcome of an election.\n  I would be the first to acknowledge that in our past we have, and \nparticularly in the South, had blatant examples, before the Voting \nRights Act predominantly, when people were blatantly denied the right \nto vote. It was a stain on our election process and a stain on the \nintegrity of that process. But this is a time we need to be working \ntogether to make sure every vote is honest and fair and not fraudulent.\n  Another example of apparent politics at play in the Civil Rights \nDivision occurred in Missouri, where the Department has quietly refused \nto continue an existing ongoing lawsuit that was brought under the \nNational Voter Registration Act. That lawsuit was brought 4 years ago \nto enforce a provision that required States to clean up their \nregistration lists to prevent voter fraud. According to commentator \nHans von Spakovsky:\n\n       When the suit was filed in 2005, one-third of the counties \n     had more registered voters than voting-age residents. One \n     county's list was 153 percent of the Census count. And the \n     State had done virtually nothing to clean up its rolls.\n       Fast forward to March. There remains no evidence that the \n     voter registration rolls in most Missouri counties have been \n     purged of their thousands of nonresidents and decedents. \n     Registration numbers from the November elections show that \n     there are still more than a dozen Missouri counties with more \n     registered voters than voting-age residents.\n\n  Yet rather than continuing the case to ensure that Missouri cleans up \nits voter registration rolls, the Department of Justice refused to \npursue the case and dropped it, a distressing sign to me that it does \nnot take the integrity of the voting process seriously--certainly not \nseriously enough. Is the Department of Justice committed to integrity \nin the process? Or just allowing anybody who wants to walk in and vote \nto vote? Of course, these decisions have been made by the Civil Rights \nDivision before Mr. Perez has been confirmed, that is certainly true. \nHe does not have any culpability in these actions. But it just raises \nconcerns of mine about: Is he committed to fixing it? Will he correct \nthese kinds of decisions? Is he committed to fairness, regardless of \npolitical impact in an election? There are important rules in voting. \nThose rules must be followed.\n  Will he reinstate the case in Philadelphia where there was a clear \nindication of threats and intimidation against voters? Will he correct \nthe course that the Civil Rights Division has taken in undermining \ncommonsense voter identification laws? Will he reinstitute National \nVoter Registration Act lawsuits to ensure that States clean up their \nvoter rolls to prevent voter fraud?\n  The way this happens is you have a large number of names on a voter \nroll and a voting precinct and that creates a real danger, if you don't \nhave identification, if you don't require the voter to produce any \nidentification, the person walks in there and says: John Jones?\n  I am John Jones.\n  OK, you get to vote, and he votes.\n  He goes to the next voting place, he knows somebody's name is on the \nlist who is not allowed or not in the district or not going to vote \nthat day, and he says: I am Ralph Smith and he signs and votes and goes \nin again and again and again and people have been known to travel all \nover multiple precincts casting votes in the names of persons not their \nown name. It is fraudulent. It demeans the integrity of the entire \nelection process as much as if the person had wrongly been denied the \nright to vote.\n  I am concerned where Mr. Perez will be in this. He has been pretty \nactive politically. When he ran for the Montgomery, MD, county council \nhe responded to a question asking ``What would you like the voters to \nknow about you?'' Mr. Perez said: ``I am a progressive Democrat and \nalways was and always will be.''\n  This is a free country and that is all right. I am just saying, in \nall fairness, that statement makes me a little nervous.\n  As a councilman, Mr. Perez expressed disdain for Republicans, at one \npoint, according to the report, giving ``a 5-minute speech about how \nsome conservative Republicans do not care about the poor.''\n  In an April 3, 2005, Washington Post article, Mr. Perez was described \nas ``about as liberal as Democrats get.''\n  I am also concerned Mr. Perez will not be committed to fully \nenforcing our Nation's immigration laws, some I have worked hard on. We \nneed to create a lawful system of immigration. We cannot continue in \nthis lawless method as we are, and one of the first things you do to \nreduce illegal immigration is you stop rewarding people who violate our \nlaws to come here. He previously served as the President of the Board \nof CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy organization that has taken \nsome extreme views and been criticized by a number of people in the \nmedia. CASA de Maryland issued a pamphlet instructing immigrants \nconfronted by the police to remain silent. CASA also promotes day labor \nsites. This is where people, often without lawful status, come and seek \nwork and opposes restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving drivers \nlicenses. He was President of the Board.\n  Mr. Perez, himself, has spoken in favor of measures that would assist \nillegal aliens in skirting U.S. immigration laws. For example, as a \ncouncilman in 2003, Mr. Perez supported matricula consular ID cards \nissued by Mexico and Guatemala as a valid form of identification for \nlocal residents who worked and used services, without having any U.S.-\nissued documents to prove their identity.\n  Of course, after a good bit of examination and public discussion, \nthose matricula cards were shown to be unreliable, and that is an \nunworkable way to determine the legal status of someone. But he was a \ndefender of the matricula cards, which I think is troubling given the \nposition he will be seeking to assume.\n  He also supported a bill granting instate tuition rates to illegal \nimmigrants in Maryland and stated:\n\n       We have a legal obligation to make the same commitment to \n     hundreds of immigrant high school students who have made \n     Maryland their home.\n\n  We don't have a legal obligation to give people who are illegally in \nthe country tuition and certainly not cheaper instate tuition than our \nout-of-state tuition.\n  Although Mr. Perez has taken many of these positions while acting in \na political capacity--and there is a distinction between that political \nadvocacy and being the head of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights \nDivision--I do think it is reasonable for us to be concerned about \nwhether he will use the Department of Justice's resources to advance \nhis ideas and an agenda that is not consistent with the highest ideals \nof civil rights.\n  I don't believe establishing lawful rules of immigration or lawful \nrules for voting is unfair and contrary to civil rights. Indeed, they \nare a cornerstone. The law is civil rights in a true sense.\n  So I am concerned, and we are going to be watching to ensure that the \nCivil Rights Division not be politicized. It must be above politics. It \nmust work to protect the rights of all Americans regardless of their \npolitical party, their race, or background.\n  Given the very political decisions apparently being made now in the \nDepartment of Justice, I think it takes someone committed to rising \nabove this kind of activity and to right the ship.\n  I have talked with him. I enjoyed that conversation. I certainly have \nno ill will toward Mr. Perez personally.\n\n[[Page S10131]]\n\nBut I have to say, I think it is important that we have honesty in \nvoting, I think it is important that we have a legal system that works \nwith regard to immigration, and at this point I am not convinced Mr. \nPerez has demonstrated he has the will to do those things, and that is \nwhat troubles me about the nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is available on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was going to speak, but I see the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland, who has done a superb job in this matter, and I would \nyield him 5 minutes. If he needs more time, I will yield more time.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for the way he handles the matters that are brought to the \nfloor, the way he handled the nomination of Tom Perez, allowed all \nsides an opportunity to get all the information they wanted. It was \ndone in a very fair manner, and I compliment him on his leadership on \nthis appointment.\n  I wish to comment briefly on Senator Sessions' points relating to \nseveral issues.\n  First, in regard to voting rights, I am in complete agreement with \nSenator Sessions that I want the Civil Rights Division and its \nleadership to deal with the concerns we have of voting in this Nation.\n  I am very disappointed that the previous administration basically \ndidn't bring any cases to allow people who were intimidated to be able \nto cast their votes. We have had serious problems of groups sending out \nnotices on the wrong date of when the elections take place, targeted to \nminority communities. We have had episodes where letters were sent to \nminority communities threatening that if they tried to vote and had \noutstanding parking tickets, they could be arrested. We have seen \nintimidation. I have been a victim myself of that type of activity in \nmy campaign for the U.S. Senate where on the day before the election \nfraudulent literature was handed out trying to mislead minority voters.\n  So I want the next head of the Civil Rights Division to be actively \ninvolved in protecting our right to vote. I would hope my colleague \nfrom Alabama would join me in trying to strengthen the laws. We had a \nbill that then-Senator Obama presented that I joined with Senator \nSchumer and others to give the Department of Justice more power to make \nsure those types of fraudulent activities can't take place.\n  I would welcome the support of my friends on the other side of the \naisle for this important legislation. Let's work together to make sure \nevery eligible voter has the opportunity to cast their vote and have it \ncounted without intimidation. I know that is certainly going to be a \nmajor goal of the Civil Rights Division under the leadership of Tom \nPerez.\n  My friend from Alabama mentioned the Black Panther case. Well, let me \npoint this out: The decision in that case was made by a career \nattorney, not by a political appointee. And that is what I would hope \nall of us would want from the Civil Rights Division, that we take \npartisan politics out of that division, as it was so apparent under the \nprevious administration. Tom Perez is committed to allowing career \nattorneys to make those types of decisions. And quite frankly, there \nwas an injunction to prevent one of the defendants from that activity. \nSo I think we should look at the record and look at what we are trying \nto achieve. Let's not use labels. Let's look at the issues and not \nlabels. Look at his record.\n  On the immigrant issue, let me point out that Tom Perez is firmly \ncommitted to enforcing the laws in a fair, evenhanded manner. His 10-\nyear record at the Justice Department is the best evidence of that \ncommitment.\n  Quite frankly, I am going read into the Record endorsements because I \nthink third-party validators are a good way for us to know what type of \nperson we have in Tom Perez. The Judiciary Committee received letters \nof support from a number of former assistant attorneys general to the \nCivil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, including Bill Lann \nLee, John Dunne, Deval Patrick, Stanley Pottinger, Stephan Pollak, \nJames Turner, Ralph Boyd, and Wan Kim. Several were appointed under \nRepublican administrations. This is a quality person who has the \nconfidence of those who know of his professionalism in moving forward \nthe Civil Rights Division under its traditional leadership in this \ncountry.\n  Lastly, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters \nwe have received from law enforcement officials and organizations, \nincluding Colonel Terrance Sheridan, the superintendent of the Maryland \nState Police; Tom Manger, chief of police from Montgomery County, MD; \nRaymond Knight, sheriff for Montgomery County, MD; and the State Law \nEnforcement Officers Labor Alliance of Maryland, and others.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Borough of Haledon Council,\n\n                                       Haledon, NJ, April 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I congratulate President Barack Obama \n     and Attorney General Eric Holder for nominating Thomas Perez \n     for Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division. \n     There is no doubt that Mr. Perez's qualifications and record \n     are outstanding. Mr. Perez will lead gracefully the division \n     of the Department of Justice responsible for enforcing \n     federal statutes prohibiting discrimination particularly \n     those statutes that protect the voting rights of our diverse \n     populations. As you know, prior to his election to the \n     Montgomery County Council in 2002, Perez served as deputy \n     assistant attorney general for civil rights, and director of \n     the Office for Civil Rights for the Department of Health and \n     Human Services in the Clinton administration.\n       I am aware that one of Perez's most important tasks will be \n     enforcing the Voting Rights Act, one of the most successful \n     enactments of the U.S. Congress in the previous century. It \n     provided millions of African-Americans with the right to \n     register and vote. It also gave African Americans the power \n     to elect candidates of their choice, in turn providing \n     African Americans with a voice in government and the decision \n     making process. The Voting Rights Act has had a positive, \n     albeit less dramatic effect on the election of Latino public \n     officials. According to the US Census Bureau the estimated \n     Hispanic population of the United States as of July 1, 2003, \n     is 39.9 million, making people of Hispanic origin the \n     nation's largest race or ethnic minority. This number is \n     expected to rise significantly in the near future, and does \n     not include the 3.9 million residents of Puerto Rico. It is \n     imperative that the Latino population be better represented \n     in government, and in the electoral process.\n       I strongly support Mr. Perez for Assistant Attorney \n     General, and I am confident that he will work with Congress \n     and administration officials to fortify the federal voter \n     registration and election reform laws. With his experience, \n     commitment, and knowledge, Thomas Perez will help to \n     eliminate inequitable barriers in the electoral process; and \n     make certain the Civil Rights Division carefully scrutinizes \n     state redistricting efforts following the 2010 Census.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Reynaldo R. Martinez,\n     Councilman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Maryland State Police,\n\n                             Pikesville, Maryland, April 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to provide you with a \n     favorable recommendation for Mr. Tom Perez for the position \n     of Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, \n     Department of Justice. I have had the privilege and pleasure \n     of working with Tom Perez for the past two years in his \n     capacity as the Secretary of the Maryland Department of \n     Labor, Licensing and Regulation (D.L.L.R.). During this time, \n     Tom was instrumental in assisting the Maryland law \n     enforcement community in its seven year endeavor to enactment \n     regulatory legislation which requires secondhand precious \n     metal dealers and pawn brokers to report transactions \n     electronically. Tom's stewardship of this legislation through \n     the General Assembly was key to its passage during the 2009 \n     Legislative Session,\n       Under Tom's leadership, his D.L.L.R.. staff has \n     collaborated with various Maryland law enforcement entities \n     to provide training on the regulatory laws controlling scrap \n     metal, pawn, secondhand precious metal, jewelry and traveling \n     gold shows, Additional educational initiatives directed by \n     Tom toward the industries regulated by his agency have \n     resulted in the affected businesses to become more compliant \n     with the state's regulations and to work more closely with \n     law enforcement. As such, D.L.L.R. and law enforcement have \n     become good partners in enforcing the regulations and laws \n     controlling these industries.\n       Tom Perez has also been most helpful to the Maryland \n     Department of State Police and the citizens of this state by \n     working closely with businesses who were facing layoffs and \n     downsizing by providing information\n\n[[Page S10132]]\n\n     on recruiting by Maryland Department of the State Police. \n     During these economic times, Tom has shown care and \n     compassion toward those in need of his assistance.\n       Tom truly is an honorable man. I would add that Tom has \n     always been fair and honest in our conservations. If he \n     disagreed with a position, he would foster open discussion \n     and listen to opposing viewpoints. In the end, Tom would \n     never allow policy differences interfere or influence a \n     relationship. I believe Tom Perez is an excellent choice for \n     the position of Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights \n     Division, Department of Justice. He is a proven leader who \n     can make a difference and has a long history of ensuring the \n     rights of Americans are protected. Thank you again for \n     allowing me the opportunity to provide you with my \n     recommendation of Tom Perez for this most important position.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Terrence B. Sheridan,\n     Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Department of Police,\n\n\n                                        Montgomery County, MD,\n\n                                    Rockville, MD, April 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: I am writing to \n     wholeheartedly support the nomination of Thomas Perez for the \n     position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \n     During Mr. Perez's tenure as a Montgomery County (Maryland) \n     Councilman, I was impressed by his integrity, intellect and \n     work ethic. He was a public servant in the truest sense of \n     the word. Mr. Perez brings an ability to tackle complex \n     problems and issues with consensus and common sense.\n       Mr. Perez is a public-safety advocate and brought his \n     experience as a civil-rights attorney to benefit the \n     Montgomery County Police Department. His assistance in \n     training our senior police officials was very well received.\n       The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice \n     requires someone with high ethical standards and a strong \n     legal mind. Mr. Perez superbly fits the bill. I urge you to \n     support his appointment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 J. Thomas Manger,\n     Chief of Police.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Office of the Sheriff,\n\n\n                                        Montgomery County, MD,\n\n                                    Rockville, MD, April 21, 2009.\n     Re recommendation for Thomas E. Perez.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I first met Tom Perez following his \n     election to the Montgomery County (Md.) Council in 2002. At \n     that time I was not familiar with his distinguished career as \n     a federal prosecutor, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for \n     Civil Rights, and law school professor. But between 2002 and \n     2006, as Montgomery County Sheriff, I was fortunate to be \n     able to work with Tom on numerous public safety and fiscal \n     matters affecting the operation of the Sheriff's Office.\n       I became impressed with Tom's ability to quickly assess the \n     nuances of complex law enforcement, budgetary and employment \n     law issues. He addressed public policy issues with fairness, \n     and in a manner that recognized and balanced the diverse \n     positions involved in governmental decision making.\n       Tom's appointment as Secretary of the Maryland Department \n     of Labor, Licensing and Regulation gave him an opportunity to \n     use his expertise to confront problems generated by the \n     current housing foreclosure crisis. Again he was able to \n     craft legislative solutions that recognized and successfully \n     addressed the respective concerns of consumers and commercial \n     interests.\n       Speaking as a lifelong law enforcement officer and \n     official, I would be delighted to witness Tom's confirmation \n     and swearing in as the Assistant Attorney General, Civil \n     Rights Division, Department of Justice.\n       Please accept my appreciation for your consideration of my \n     views on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond M. Kight,\n     Montgomery County Sheriff.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             State Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                      Officers Labor Alliance,\n\n                                                    Annapolis, MD.\n       On behalf of State Law Enforcement Officers Labor Alliance \n     (SLEOLA), I am writing to express support for Tom Perez to \n     become the next Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights \n     in the Department of Justice. Having seen his work ethic and \n     fair mindedness at work at Maryland's Department of Labor, \n     Licensing and Regulation (DLLR), we would like to see him \n     bring that same approach to this vitally important Justice \n     Department position.\n       The SLEOLA's primary purpose is to unite into one labor \n     organization all eligible organizations whose members are \n     employed with the Maryland State Police, the Natural \n     Resources Police, the State Forest and Park Service, the \n     Maryland Department of General Services and the Maryland \n     State Fire Marshal. One of our constituent groups is the \n     Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation Police Force. \n     This is a small contingent of sworn officers responsible for \n     security at DLLR in Baltimore.\n       Our officers who work with Secretary Perez see firsthand \n     the dedication he has to the mission of DLLR and the people \n     of Maryland. DLLR is experiencing a renaissance, and it is \n     easily attributed to Secretary Perez's tenure. He displays \n     the character and integrity that make us confident he will \n     bring the kind of rejuvenation we saw at DLLR to the \n     Department of Justice.\n       We believe Tom Perez will make an excellent Assistant \n     Attorney General for Civil Rights, and urge you to confirm \n     his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jimmy Dulay,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. We have a quality person who will return the Department \nof Justice Civil Rights Division to its historic role, increasing the \nmorale and professionalism in that Department. I am proud to support \nhim and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I applaud the distinguished Senator from Maryland. He has \nbeen a star in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and his support of Tom \nPerez is one of the reasons Mr. Perez went through our committee with \nan overwhelming vote.\n  Incidentally, we do have letters of support. One I have which is very \nmeaningful--and I think the Senator from Maryland would agree--is the \nletter we received from Senator Kennedy, the late Senator Kennedy. \nWhile this matter is pending, I ask unanimous consent to have the \nletter from the late Senator Kennedy printed in the Record, as well as \nletters of support from numerous attorneys general, including the \nattorney general of Vermont.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat, Arlen and Members of the Committee: I write to \n     enthusiastically endorse Tom Perez's nomination to be \n     Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Department \n     of Justice. As you know, Tom did an excellent job for me from \n     1995 to 1998, on my Judiciary Committee staff when I was a \n     member of the Committee. I believe he's an exceptional choice \n     for Assistant Attorney General, and I urge his prompt \n     confirmation.\n       During Tom's impressive service on my staff, he worked hard \n     and well on civil rights, hate crimes, and a variety of \n     immigration, criminal and constitutional issues. Work on \n     civil rights has been at the core of Tom's career, which \n     began as a prosecutor in the Criminal Section of the Civil \n     Rights Division, where he helped bring to justice the \n     perpetrators of hate crimes, including racially-motivated \n     shootings. He also prosecuted law enforcement officials \n     involved in violent and corrupt practices, and his work as a \n     career prosecutor earned him promotion to deputy chief of the \n     Criminal Section.\n       After serving on my staff, Tom returned to the Civil Rights \n     Division as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, supervising \n     the Division's criminal prosecutions, and its litigation in \n     the areas of education and employment discrimination. He had \n     a key role in establishing the interagency Worker \n     Exploitation Task Force, which coordinated enforcement of \n     laws against involuntary servitude and trafficking in \n     persons.\n       In 1999, Torn became Director of the Office for Civil \n     Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, where \n     he led a staff of 230 people in ensuring that health and \n     human services providers complied with civil rights laws.\n       Upon leaving the federal government in 2001, Tom became a \n     professor of law at the University of Maryland School of Law. \n     Motivated by his strong desire to make a difference in \n     peoples' lives, Tom also was elected to the Montgomery County \n     Council in Maryland, and became a leader in promoting \n     affordable housing and affordable health care, as well as \n     improvements in education. Finally, for the past two years, \n     Tom has served as Secretary of Maryland's Department of \n     Labor, Licensing and Regulation.\n       A main unifying theme of Tom's career is his desire to help \n     people, by ensuring that their rights are protected and that \n     they receive the services they need. His commitment to public \n     service and his ability to be effective in both executive and \n     legislative positions is impressive. He has been energetic in \n     seeking change, and working cooperatively with others to \n     achieve it.\n       A second main theme of Tom's career has been his \n     exceptional performance as a lawyer. He's been highly \n     successful as a prosecutor, as a lawyer serving this \n     Committee, as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General and\n\n[[Page S10133]]\n\n     as a law professor. Importantly, Tom understands the role of \n     a government lawyer. Having been a career attorney in the \n     Department of Justice, he knows the importance of developing \n     effective working relationships with career employees and \n     making sure that law enforcement decisions are made on the \n     basis of the facts and the law, without favoritism based on \n     partisanship or ideology. In light of the challenges that the \n     Department of Justice, and especially the Civil Rights \n     Division, have faced in recent years, these are indispensible \n     qualities in an Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n       Tom's outstanding legal skills, his years of impressive \n     experience as a prosecutor, his career-long commitment to \n     enforcing civil rights, and his thorough familiarity with the \n     legal and policy issues in the Civil Rights Division make him \n     uniquely well qualified to lead the Division now. I strongly \n     urge the Committee to report his nomination favorably.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy.\n                                  ____\n\n         State of New Jersey, Office of the Attorney General, \n           Department of Law and Public Safety,\n                                       Trenton NJ, April 23, 2009.\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: I am \n     writing to express my support for the nomination of Thomas E. \n     Perez for Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights \n     Division of the United States Department of Justice. Mr. \n     Perez is exceptionally qualified to lead the Division, \n     possessing demonstrated and impeccable legal, management, and \n     leadership skills.\n       I served in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights \n     Division, Criminal Section, from 2001 to 2005, and I remain \n     engaged with the Department through participation in the \n     Executive Working Group. Currently, as Attorney General for \n     the State of New Jersey, I am the chief law enforcement \n     officer in the State, with a mandate to enforce the State's \n     civil rights and criminal laws. I know Mr. Perez to be a \n     committed, dedicated, and highly effective advocate and \n     prosecutor. I look forward to working with Mr. Perez in \n     addressing shared federal and state civil rights priorities.\n       Mr. Perez will bring a breadth of advocacy, policy, and \n     leadership experience to the Division. He has had a \n     distinguished career in the Department of Justice, serving in \n     several roles in the Division. He has prosecuted civil rights \n     cases in the Criminal Section and, as the Deputy Assistant \n     Attorney General for Civil Rights, oversaw the Division's \n     complex criminal, education, and employment litigation. Since \n     leaving the Department, Mr, Perez has continued his \n     commitment to public service as a faculty member at the \n     University of Maryland School of Law and a member of the \n     Montgomery County Council. In his current capacity as \n     Secretary of the Department of Labor, Licensing and \n     Regulation in Maryland, Mr, Perez bas gained valuable \n     experience and insights into the priorities and workings of \n     state government, which complements his considerable federal \n     and local leadership experience.\n       For these reasons, I am pleased to recommend Mr. Perez to \n     the Committee. Please feel free to contact me if you have any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Anne Milgram,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: As the \n     chief law enforcement officers of our respective states, we \n     write to express our strong support for the nomination of \n     Thomas Perez for Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \n     Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice. \n     We urge his confirmation.\n       Secretary Perez's qualifications and credentials are \n     exceptional. He is a nationally recognized civil rights \n     lawyer whose breadth and depth of experience make him an \n     ideal choice to lead the Civil Rights Division. He knows the \n     Division well, having worked there for almost a decade in a \n     variety of critical positions. As a prosecutor in the \n     Division, he was lead attorney in some of the Department's \n     most high profile and complex civil rights cases. As Deputy \n     Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, he oversaw \n     complex litigation in the employment and education areas.\n       In Maryland, Secretary Perez, in his current capacity as \n     Secretary of Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and \n     Regulation, has played a key role in the state's response to \n     the ongoing mortgage crisis. He negotiated agreements with \n     six major mortgage servicing companies to provide relief to \n     Maryland homeowners in danger of foreclosure. One of the \n     largest ongoing mortgage fraud prosecutions in the nation \n     originated in Secretary Perez's office. With housing at the \n     top of the Department of Justice's agenda, Secretary Perez \n     will be well-situated to play a major role.\n       He has held leadership positions in federal, state and \n     local government, and has worked in all three branches of the \n     federal government. As such, he has an acute understanding of \n     the need for the federal government to work in partnership \n     with state and local governments to safeguard the civil \n     rights of all Americans.\n       Heading the Civil Rights Division, like running an Attorney \n     General's office, requires extensive legal, management and \n     leadership skills, as well as extensive experience in \n     building coalitions. Secretary Perez has led important \n     agencies. He currently heads a Department of about 1600 \n     employees, and has held other senior positions in the federal \n     government. He has a well-earned reputation as someone who \n     listens, learns quickly, builds consensus, and leads \n     effectively.\n       Mr. Perez's distinguished career demonstrates his \n     leadership abilities, integrity and commitment to public \n     service. We are confident that Mr. Perez would be an \n     exceptional Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights \n     Division and urge you to confirm his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Terry Goddard,\n       Attorney General of Arizona.\n     Tom Miller,\n       Attorney General of Iowa.\n     Martha Coakley,\n       Attorney General of Massachusetts.\n     Jon Bruning,\n       Attorney General of Nebraska.\n     Mark Shurtleff,\n       Attorney General of Utah.\n     Rob McKenna,\n       Attorney General of Washington.\n     William H.

We \n     believe that Mr. Perez has the experience, knowledge, and \n     abilities to lead this important Division.\n       Secretary Perez would bring exemplary advocacy, leadership, \n     and prosecutorial experience and qualifications to the Civil \n     Rights Division.

It is interesting that finally we are getting to this \nnomination. What is troubling to me, as someone who has been here for \n35 years, is\n\n[[Page S10134]]\n\nto see what is happening this year that is really unprecedented: having \nto overcome a Republican filibuster of a nomination that was voted out \nof committee 17 to 2. All but two Republicans voted for it. That was 4 \nmonths ago.\n  There are no questions about the qualifications of Tom Perez. He is a \nformer special counsel to Senator Kennedy. He has been nominated to run \nthe division where he previously served with distinction, spending 10 \nyears as a trial attorney in the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights \nDivision, rising to Deputy Chief of the section.\n  There is no question about the critical need for leadership in the \nCivil Rights Division, the division charged with enforcing our landmark \ncivil rights laws and protecting all Americans from discrimination. Our \ndelays in considering this nomination have hindered the work of \nrestoring the division's independence and the tradition of vigorous \ncivil rights enforcement, especially after the Bush administration \ncompiled one of the worst civil rights records in modern American \nhistory and injected partisan politics into the division's hiring and \nlaw enforcement decisions.\n  We need real leadership to restore the traditional sense of purpose \nthat has guided the Civil Rights Division, a division that has acted in \na totally nonpartisan way to uphold the civil rights of all Americans \nno matter what their political background, as is the priority of \nAttorney General Holder.\n  It is a shame this filibuster has held up Mr. Perez for 4 months. The \nPresident designated Mr. Perez on March 13 and formally nominated him 2 \nweeks later. We held his confirmation hearing April 29, over 5 months \nago. I thank Senator Cardin, who chaired that hearing and did a very \nable job of it. And then after accommodating the request of the senior \nRepublican and other Republicans of the Judiciary Committee, we did not \nmove immediately to it; we held it over until after the Memorial Day \nrecess so they could ask other questions. Mr. Perez's nomination was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee on June 4. Senator Hatch voted for \nhim; Senator Grassley voted for him; Senator Kyl, the deputy Republican \nleader, voted for him; Senator Graham and Senator Cornyn voted for him.\n  The ranking member, Senator Sessions, and Senator Coburn asked to \nmeet the nominee before consideration by the Senate. That meeting took \nplace almost immediately after the request. It reportedly went well. \nUnfortunately, despite these efforts, it has taken 4 months to schedule \nSenate consideration of this well-qualified nominee. That makes a \nmockery of the kind of way we should treat the Department of Justice, \nwhich is the Department of Justice of America for all Americans. It is \nnot a partisan place, it is there for all of us.\n  In fact, if the Senate Republican minority applied the same standard \nto the consideration of President Obama's nomination of Tom Perez as \nDemocrats and Republicans used in considering President Bush's first \nnomination to serve the Civil Rights Division, Ralph Boyd, Mr. Perez \nwould have been confirmed many months ago.\n  I remember the Boyd nomination well. I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee at the time he was confirmed. We held Mr. Boyd's hearing just \na little over 3 weeks after his nomination. Compare that with the \ndelays here. He was reported by the Judiciary Committee with every \nsingle Democrat voting for him. Did he have to wait 4 months after \nthat? No. He was confirmed 1 day later by a voice vote in the Senate. \nNo shenanigans. No partisanship. No posturing for narrow special \ninterests. I want to be sure that was heard: no posturing for narrow \nspecial interests.\n  By comparison, it has now been 188 days since Mr. Perez was nominated \nto the same post, even longer since he was designated. It should not \nhave taken more than twice as long to consider President Obama's first \nnomination to this post as it took for President Bush's.\n  Then President Bush had a second nomination to head the Civil Rights \nDivision, Alex Acosta. We moved even more quickly. At that point, the \nDemocrats were in the minority. We did not filibuster. We did not \nobstruct. We did not delay. We knew how important it was. We \ncooperated. We agreed to a hearing less than 4 weeks after he was \nnominated. He was reported from the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous \nvote. He was confirmed by a Senate voice vote. It took just 36 days. \nRepublicans have dragged the process out on the Perez nomination to \nextend more than five times that long. Democrats didn't do that to \nPresident Bush. No shenanigans, no partisanship, no posturing for \nnarrow special interests.\n  President Bush's third nomination to the civil rights division, Wan \nKim, was also considered and confirmed much more quickly than Mr. \nPerez. He was confirmed in the Senate by a voice vote. There was no \nfilibuster. There were no shenanigans. There was no partisanship. There \nwas no posturing for special interests. Then Mr. Kim had to resign \nalong with Attorney General Gonzales and the entire senior leadership \nof the Bush-Cheney Justice Department in the wake of the U.S. Attorney \nfiring scandal and revelations of political hiring and decisionmaking \nthat threatened the morale and independence of the Civil Rights \nDivision and the Department.\n  Indeed, it was that scandal that prevented us from considering \nPresident Bush's fourth nomination to head the Civil Rights Division. \nGrace Chung Becker refused to answer many questions at her confirmation \nhearing about whether she was involved in politicized hiring and \ndecision-making, repeatedly citing the then-ongoing internal \ninvestigation by the Department as a reason not to answer. In light of \nMs. Becker's repeated invocation of the investigation in response to \nquestions, we had to await its conclusion before moving forward on her \nnomination. Unfortunately, the report from the Department's Inspector \nGeneral and Office of Professional Responsibility was not completed \nuntil it was too late to consider Ms. Becker's nomination. There is no \nsimilar cause to delay the consideration of Mr. Perez's nomination. We \nshould instead have treated his nomination as we did that of Mr. Boyd, \nMr. Acosta, and Mr. Kim.\n  I say this because the filibuster of Mr. Perez's nomination is \nindicative of the double standard that Republican Senators seem intent \nto apply with a Democratic President. It is wrong. I am not saying that \nRepublican Senators don't have the power under Senate rules to do it or \nthat it is even unconstitutional. What I am saying is, it is not in the \ninterest of the American people. It is bad judgment. It is misspent \ntime. It is something we can ill afford. The Civil Rights Division, \nfollowing the scandals of the last administration, needs to be restored \nto the level of prestige it held under both Republican and Democratic \npresidents in the past.\n  Ten months into President's Obama's first term, President Obama \nhaving won overwhelmingly, we find that 16 nominations reported by the \nJudiciary Committee, many of them unanimously, remain pending on the \nSenate's executive calendar. Seven of them were before the last recess, \nincluding the nomination of Mr. Perez. Five of these nominations are \nfor appointments to be assistant attorneys general at the Department of \nJustice. The Department of Justice, which during the Gonzales days \nreached probably its low point, certainly since I have been old enough \nto practice law, we saw was demoralized. We saw the scandals. Now we \nare trying to build it back up.\n  So what has happened? Because of Republican foot dragging and \nshenanigans and appealing to special interests, we find five out of a \ntotal of 11 divisions at the Department do not have a confirmed and \nappointed head. The Office of Legal Counsel, as well as the Civil \nRights Division, the Tax Division, the Office of Legal Policy, and the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources Division remain without Senate-\nconfirmed Presidential appointees to guide them.\n  President Obama won the election. President Obama inherited a Justice \nDepartment that had been wracked by scandal. He ought to be commended \nfor trying to put it back. But look what has happened with some of \nthese delays. Even his attorney general was delayed for weeks and \nweeks. And when they finally allowed him to have a vote, he got a \ngreater vote than any of the last four attorneys general. Is this delay \nfor the sake of delay? Is there such resentment that President Obama \nwon the election? Then talk to those who voted, but don't hold up the \nDepartment of Justice. The Department\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\nis there for Republicans and Democrats and Independents, for all of us. \nWe have to do a better job of confirming the leadership team of the \nJustice Department to ensure that the Nation's top law enforcement \nagency is fully equipped to do its job. I hope that all Senators who \ndelayed law enforcement in this country will be reminded of that when \nthey go home and speak about being in favor of law enforcement.\n\n  I was privileged to spend 8 years of my public life in law \nenforcement. I still breathe deeply the sense of being in law \nenforcement. Every one of us favors good law enforcement. But you are \ndamaging law enforcement by holding up these people. I hope now, \ndespite this unnecessary filibuster, Republicans and Democrats who \njoined together in the past to help law enforcement will join together \nto confirm this well-qualified nominee.\n  Mr. Perez has been nominated to lead the Civil Rights Division, which \nfor 50 years has stood at the forefront of America's march toward \nequality. It has a long tradition of independent law enforcement that \nhas helped transform the legal landscape of our country and brought us \ncloser to the ideal of a ``more perfect union.'' A strong and \nindependent Civil Rights Division is crucial to the enforcement of our \nprecious civil rights laws.\n  During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Perez made clear his commitment \nthat the Justice Department would enforce the law. In the arena of \ncivil rights, living up to those assurances is particularly important, \nbecause the nation's civil rights laws ensure that the system works for \nall Americans--no matter the color of their skin, their gender, their \nreligious affiliation or their sexual orientation. The civil rights \nlaws are the foundation of our Nation's aspiration toward a just and \nfair society.\n  That is why so many people were concerned during the last \nadministration when we witnessed an abandonment of the Division's \nfinest traditions of independence and a rollback of the priorities upon \nwhich it was founded. The report released nine months ago by the \nJustice Department's Inspector General and Office of Professional \nResponsibility confirmed some of our worst fears about the last \nadministration's political corruption of the Civil Rights Division.\n  The report confirmed our oversight findings that political appointees \nin the Division marginalized and forced out career lawyers because of \nideology, and injected a political litmus test into the Division's \nhiring process for career positions. It should come as no surprise that \nthe result and the intent of this political makeover of the Civil \nRights Division led to a dismal civil rights enforcement record. This \nreport was just one of the final chapters in the regrettable legacy of \ndamage that the Bush administration inflicted on the Justice \nDepartment, our civil rights, and our fundamental values. It also \nreinforced the need for new leadership.\n  Given that Tom Perez has a distinguished record of public service and \na long career advancing civil rights, I have full confidence that he is \nthe right person to restore the Civil Rights Division to its finest \ntraditions of independent law enforcement. He is the first person \nnominated to head the Civil Rights Division in over 35 years who has \nexperience as a career attorney in the Division.\n  In addition, he has worked on civil rights at various levels of \nFederal, state and local government, serving as Special Counsel to \nSenator Kennedy, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, \nDirector of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, and currently as Maryland's Secretary of Labor, \nLicensing, and Regulations. His impressive credentials also include \ngraduating from Brown University, Harvard Law School, and the Kennedy \nSchool of Government. By confirming this highly qualified nominee \ntoday, we will take a significant step forward.\n  Numerous major civil rights and law enforcement organizations have \nwritten to endorse Mr. Perez's nomination, including the Leadership \nConference for Civil Rights, the National Women's Law Center, and the \nchief law enforcement officers of the States of Arizona, Iowa, \nMassachusetts, Nebraska, Utah, Washington, and Vermont. Those chief law \nenforcement officers wrote: ``Secretary Perez's qualifications and \ncredentials are exceptional'' and ``[h]e is a nationally recognized \ncivil rights lawyer whose breadth and depth of experience make him an \nideal choice to lead the Civil Rights Division.'' The Leadership \nConference of Civil Rights wrote: ``It will take strong and reliable \nleadership combined with extensive experience at the Division to \nrestore the Division to its previous prominence in the enforcement of \ncivil rights laws. Tom Perez is the right person to take on that \nchallenge.''\n  Mr. Perez's nomination has also earned support from both sides of the \naisle. Former Republican staff members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee have described him as ``a public official of the highest \nintegrity . . . whom the Committee and the nation can be proud.'' These \nRepublican staffers who worked with Mr. Perez describe him as a person \n``more interested in `moving the ball forward' for the common good than \nin scoring political points at the expense of his adversaries.'' \nCongressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who worked with the nominee \nwhen he served as Maryland's Secretary of Labor, Licensing, and \nRegulation, wrote that Tom Perez is committed to ``serving the public \ngood.'' He also wrote ``it is hard to imagine how President Obama and \nAttorney General Holder could have made a better choice.'' Senator \nMikulski of Maryland said, ``I am confident Tom Perez will get the \nCivil Rights Division back on track'' and he ``will restore our \nreputation . . . of tolerance and equal rights and protection for \nall.''\n  Mr. Perez intends to make restoration of the Civil Rights Division \nand its mission a priority. He has pledged to follow in the footsteps \nof his mentor, his former boss, Senator Kennedy, and rekindle the \nbipartisanship that has characterized the fight for civil rights \nthroughout our Nation's history by returning the division to its law \nenforcement roots. Let us not go back to an era in the Senate when we \nwere opposed to civil rights enforcement. Let's support this well-\nqualified nominee. Let's go back to enforcing the civil rights laws.\n  Does the Senator from Vermont have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Less than 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am so proud the Senate will confirm \nMaryland's own Thomas Perez to be Assistant Attorney General for the \nCivil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. I commend the \nSenate for its action. The Civil Rights Division has gone far too long \nwithout leadership that achieves its goals.\n  Secretary Perez is well suited for this crucial position. As \nMaryland's secretary of labor, Mr. Perez inherited a department that \nhad been neglected and minimized. He quickly took control by \nreenergizing and reinvigorating the Department and I have no doubt that \nhe will do the same for the Civil Rights Division.\n  The Civil Rights Division was created in 1957 and was a key force in \ndesegregation. The division was charged with protecting minority rights \nincluding the right to vote. However, a division that was once a source \nof pride at the Department of Justice was decimated and caught up in \npolitical hiring under the previous administration. Civil rights \nenforcement was put on the back bench and productivity plummeted. Now \nmore than ever the Department of Justice needs someone to restore \nmorale to hardworking career employees and public confidence in \nDepartment. Thomas Perez is the right man for the job.\n  Thomas Perez meets my criteria for nominees: competence, commitment \nto the mission of the agency, and integrity. His competence to serve in \nthis position is unquestionable. Mr. Perez graduated cum laude from \nHarvard Law School, and has amassed extensive experience in civil \nrights laws as a chief of the Civil Rights Division and Director of \nCivil Rights Office for Health and Human Services. His commitment to \nthe agency was demonstrated by his work as a civil rights attorney at \nthe Department, where he secured convictions in a high profile race-\nmotivated hate crime in Lubbock, TX, involving defendants who went on a \nkilling spree directed at African Americans. Lastly, his integrity \nstems from his upbringing in a hard-working\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\nimmigrant family. It was demonstrated as he prosecuted public officials \nfor corruption and violators of our Nation's laws.\n  I am confident that Mr. Perez will get the Civil Rights Division back \non track with enforcing this country's civil rights laws. I have no \ndoubt that he will combat discrimination, protect minorities, and hold \nviolators accountable. Today we restored our reputation of embodying \nthis country's values of tolerance and equal rights and protection for \nall. I thank my colleagues for their strong support of his \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I have any remaining time, I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Vermont is \nyielded back.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Tanker Pricing\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to discuss a matter that \nis unrelated to the pending nomination. I have been concerned about the \ncompetition for the Air Force's No. 1 acquisition priority, the KC-X \nreplacement aerial refueling tanker. This competition was opened for a \nsecond time on September 25 with the release of the RFP to the two \nbidders. We know this has been a troubled acquisition program. People \nactually went to jail early on in the process for attempting to create \na sole source lease agreement. That breach of the public trust caused \nthe Senate and Congress to mandate that a full and open competition be \nheld to replace the Air Force's aging tankers. Full and open \ncompetition language was included in the 2005 Defense Authorization Act \nexplicitly to prevent one competitor from having an unfair advantage \nover the other.\n  A troubling fact has come to my attention regarding the second round \nof tanker competition. The Air Force released Northrop Grumman's \nproposed pricing for the KC-X tanker to Boeing, the other competitor, \nat the end of the first competition, a competition that resulted in \nNorthrop Grumman being declared the winner. I am told that such a \nrelease of pricing data was within acquisition regulations and that it \nis customary that the pricing data for the winning proposal, in this \ninstance the Northrop Grumman proposal, be shared with the other \ncompetitors. The Department of Defense has stated that the Air Force \ndid disclose the winner's pricing information to the losing competitor \nafter last year's source selection. The Department of Defense further \nstated:\n\n     . . . this disclosure was in accordance with regulation and \n     more importantly that it created no competitive disadvantage \n     because the data in question are inaccurate, outdated, and \n     not germane to this source selection.\n\n  That statement might sound reasonable if it were not your pricing \ndata that had been given to your competitor, but it certainly flies in \nthe face of even the simplest definition of fairness. Let's be clear. \nThis round of the KC-X competition is based on the same capabilities \ndevelopment document, the CDD, as the last, and the winner of the last \ncompetition is going to be bidding using the same aircraft they won \nwith last time. How is their pricing data not germane to this round of \ncompetition? If is it not relevant, why won't the Department give both \ncompetitors the same insight to each team's pricing from the last \ncompetition?\n  Earlier this year we passed the Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act \nof 2009 and dedicated an entire section of that act to the need for \nfair competition. A basic tenet of effective competition is \ntransparency to all bidders. In both versions of the 2010 authorization \nbills currently pending in this session, there is language that directs \na fair and open competition, as has been true in previous years as we \nconsidered this acquisition project. It is a big one. It is important. \nIt is the Air Force's No. 1 acquisition priority.\n  I stand behind the Air Force in their recognition of the need to \nreestablish their credibility. It had been lost somewhat in the \nimproprieties that turned up several years ago. But I am disheartened \nby the fact that they don't seem to understand this issue of not \nsharing the same pricing data between the two bidders undermines their \ncredibility and fairness. The Air Force certainly can't take the \nNorthrop team's pricing data back. It has already been given to Boeing. \nIt is too late for that. There is a simple fix to this problem. Both \ncompetitors should have the pricing data from the last competition. \nThat is the only practical way to level the playing field. It is the \nright way to go forward with replacing an aging tanker fleet, some of \nwhich are over 50 years old. By the time the new tankers are in place, \nsome existing tankers will be 80 years old. Releasing this data is what \na fair competition requires and what the Air Force should do.\n  I understand that the bill managers have selected a certain number of \namendments to consider and this amendment will not be selected for a \nvote. I have some amendments that have been selected. I understand the \nmanagers' constraints, but I believe the Air Force should consider this \nsimple step toward fairness and should be committed to making sure one \nside does not have an unfair advantage over the other.\n  I have talked with Senators Coburn and Vitter who have an interest in \nthis nomination. They have agreed to vitiate the cloture vote and \nproceed to an up-or-down vote on the nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on this matter be vitiated and that it be in order to request the \nyeas and nays for a vote up or down at 12:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Thomas E. Perez, of Maryland, to be an Assistant Attorney General?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the Senator from \nVermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter), and \nthe Senator from Colorado (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, a lot of what we say in Washington, DC, \ndoesn't make its way through to the people out across the country who \nhire us. It is called, in different words, Washington-speak or \ngobbledygook by some people. Sometimes we have a hard time \nunderstanding ourselves. But one thing has gotten through to the \nAmerican people: the idea that we should, No. 1, read the bills that \ncome before us and, No. 2, we should know what they cost before we vote \non them.\n  I think the reason for that is because, over the last several months, \nwe have suddenly seen a whole series of Washington takeovers and 1,000-\npage bills and the people in this country are getting worried about a \nrunaway Federal Government, thinking we may be overreaching here. We \nhad a 1,200-page bill in the House of Representatives on energy and \nglobal warming. It was available for 15 hours before the vote. We had a \nstimulus bill--that was $800 billion, not counting interest--that was \n1,100 pages and was available online for 13 hours. We had a $700 \nbillion bailout, called the financial sector rescue package, which was \navailable for 29 hours. The other day in the Finance Committee, \nRepublicans said let's put the bill online for 72 hours. That was voted \ndown by the Democratic members of the committee.\n  What we Republicans would like to say is this: We want health care \nreform. We have our ideas and suggestions that we have made. We think \nwe should focus on reducing costs, that we should go step by step in \nthat direction, starting, for example, with allowing all small \nbusinesses to pool together so they can offer health insurance to their \nemployees at a reasonable cost. The estimates are that millions more \nAmericans would be able to get health insurance from small businesses.\n  We have other suggestions for reducing costs. But the first thing we \nwould say is, as this bill comes to the Finance Committee--and I see \nthe Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Texas, who are both \nmembers of that Finance Committee--we want to be able to read the bill \nand know what it costs. Over the next 3 weeks, we hope, on the \nRepublican side, to help the American people understand what this \nhealth care bill means for them. You hear lots of competing claims \nabout it--it does this or that, and we are scaring you or they are \nscaring you. Let's take it one by one.\n  If we have time to read the bill, and we know what it costs--the \nPresident said this bill cannot have a deficit. If we don't know what \nit costs, how can we do what the President wants us to do? I hope we \ntake a sufficient amount of time. The bill is in concept form now, and \nthen the majority leader will take it into his office and merge the \nFinance Committee bill with the bill that we on the HELP Committee \nworked on in July, and out of that will come another bill. We will need \nthe CBO to look that bill over, which I am sure will be well over 1,000 \npages. It will take a couple weeks to see what it costs. Then we can \nwork on it.\n  Why is it so important that we actually have the text of the bill and \nknow what it costs? Because the bill has $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare \ncuts in it. On the other side, they say: Don't say that; you are \nscaring people. Well, it either has it or not. We say it has it. The \nPresident said there will be Medicare savings. The truth is, it is \nworse than that. What it appears to be is we are going to cut Grandma's \nMedicare and spend it on somebody else. There may be savings in \nGrandma's Medicare, but, if anything, we ought to spend any savings on \nmaking Medicare solvent because the trustees of Medicare have told us \nit will go broke in 2015 to 2017. So the people have a right to know \nwill there be cuts to hospitals, hospices, home health, to Medicare \nAdvantage. One-fourth of seniors on Medicare have Medicare Advantage, \nand it is going to be cut.\n  We need ample time to say: What do those cuts in Medicare mean to \nyou? Will the bill raise your taxes? We say it will; some say it will \nnot. But from our reading of the bill, it looks like there will be at \nleast a $1,500 tax per family, if you don't buy certain government-\napproved insurance. There is the employer mandate requiring you to \nprovide insurance. That is a tax. There are $838 billion of new taxes \non insurance companies, medical device companies, which will be passed \non to consumers. That is a tax.\n  The Presiding Officer was a Governor, as I was. He was chairman of \nthe National Governors, and many Governors are very upset because we \nare expanding Medicaid in their States and sending a large part of the \nbill to them. So that could be more State taxes.\n  Now we hear from the Governors. There was an article in the \nWashington Post yesterday, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The article says: ``States Resist Medicaid Growth. \nGovernors Fear For Their Budgets.''\n  The Tennessee Governor--a Democrat--said:\n\n       I can't think of a worse time for this bill to be coming. \n     I'd love to see it happen. But nobody's going to put their \n     state into bankruptcy or their education system in the tank \n     for it.\n\n  The Governor of South Dakota said:\n\n       That's a heck of an increase, and I don't know how I'm \n     going to pay for it.\n\n  The Governor from Ohio said:\n\n       I have indicated that I think the States, with our \n     financial challenges right now, are not in a position to \n     accept additional Medicaid responsibilities. Governor \n     Schwarzenegger of California said it will add up to $8 \n     billion to California, and California is nearly going broke \n     anyway. Senator Feinstein said she cannot support a bill that \n     puts that kind of additional tax on States.\n\n  Basically, it is the old trick of we in Washington saying here is a \ngreat idea, we will pass it, and send part of the bill to the States. \nWhat will the States have to do? They will have to cut the money that \ngoes to the University of Texas or Delaware or Tennessee. They have to \nraise taxes, or they cannot cut benefits because cutting benefits is \nagainst the law.\n  So how much will these Medicaid mandates cause taxes to be raised in \nyour State?\n  There are other questions we would like to ask. Will this bill raise \nyour insurance premiums? The whole point of this exercise, we think--\nand a lot of the American people think--is we want to reduce costs--\ncosts to you when you buy your health insurance and costs to your \ngovernment. Your Federal Government is going broke if we don't do \nsomething about rising health care costs, just as you might.\n  You would think this bill would reduce your costs--to you for \npremiums and to you for your government. But that is not what the CBO \nsays. It says that, in some cases, premiums for exchanged plans would \ninclude the effect of these new taxes and the premiums would increase. \nThen there will be more government-approved insurance plans, which may \nturn out to be more expensive for you to buy. In other words, you would \nnot be able to buy the plan you now have. You will have to buy a new \ngovernment-approved plan that will cost more.\n  There will be higher premiums for young Americans under this bill. \nAlmost everybody thinks that. So we\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\nneed to have a full discussion over the next 2, 3 or 4 weeks. Is this \ngoing to raise your health care premiums? If so, why are we doing that? \nThen, is it going to raise the Federal debt? Well, everybody is saying \nno, no, no, this will be deficit neutral. The President says: Don't \nsend me a bill without it. Except this bill, as we understand it, \ndoesn't include what we elegantly call the doc fix. Every year, we have \nto approve, or overturn, provisions in the law for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. Those are provisions that set the \npayment rates for physicians. We always do that. We know we are going \nto do it. We do it every year. Yet this bill assumes we are not going \nto do that. If we do include the doc fix, that adds $285 billion to the \ndebt.\n  We are going to be asking these questions. Please give us the text so \nwe can read the bill. We are going to ask the CBO: Exactly what does it \ncost? Then we will be coming to the floor and going to town meetings at \nhome and we are talking to the American people about how this affects \nthem. Does it cut your Medicare? If so, how? Does it raise your taxes? \nIf so, how? Will it bankrupt your State or hurt education in your \nState? If so, how? Does it increase or reduce your health care premiums \nor add to the Federal debt of your government?\n  These are the questions we need answers to, and we are looking \nforward to the debate; and then we are looking forward to passing \nhealth care reform that, step by step, begins to reduce the cost of \nhealth care to you and your government.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 5, 2009]\n\n                     States Resist Medicaid Growth\n\n                          (By Shailagh Murray)\n\n       The nation's governors are emerging as a formidable \n     lobbying force as health-care reform moves through Congress \n     and states overburdened by the recession brace for the \n     daunting prospect of providing coverage to millions of low-\n     income residents.\n       The legislation the Senate Finance Committee is expected to \n     approve this week calls for the biggest expansion of Medicaid \n     since its creation in 1965. Under the Senate bill and a \n     similar House proposal, a patchwork state-federal insurance \n     program targeted mainly at children, pregnant women and \n     disabled people would effectively become a Medicare for the \n     poor, a health-care safety net for all people with an annual \n     income below $14,404.\n       Whether Medicaid can absorb a huge influx of beneficiaries \n     is a matter of grave concern to many governors, who have cut \n     low-income health benefits--along with school funding, prison \n     construction, state jobs and just about everything else--to \n     cope with the most severe economic downturn in decades.\n       ``I can't think of a worse time for this bill to be \n     coming,'' said Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen (D), a member of \n     the National Governors Association's health-care task force. \n     ``I'd love to see it happen. But nobody's going to put their \n     state into bankruptcy or their education system in the tank \n     for it.''\n       These fears are resonating with members of Congress and \n     have already yielded some important legislative changes, \n     including alterations to the Senate Finance bill, which \n     includes billions of dollars in additional funding, added \n     after governors raised a fury about the original, lower sum. \n     But House and Senate negotiators are reluctant to make \n     further concessions, and in recent days, House Democrats have \n     debated whether to trim Medicaid funding in their bill to \n     make room for other priorities.\n       Yet lawmakers are wary about imposing a huge new burden on \n     an imperfect program that serves one of the most challenging \n     segments of the population, through a fragmented network of \n     state-run systems.\n       Among the 11 million people the nonpartisan Congressional \n     Budget Office estimates will sign up for Medicaid under the \n     new rules, many are single adults and parents who have gone \n     for years without health coverage. Many of these individuals \n     also live in communities that lack the services to treat \n     them.\n       ``States are already at a breaking point, and so they \n     should be thankful that this bill is only going to cost them \n     an additional $30 billion,'' Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), \n     the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, told \n     colleagues during the panel's two-week-long debate on reform. \n     But Grassley added: ``We are deluding ourselves, though, if \n     we think that we are going to do anything in this bill to \n     make Medicaid a better program for the people it serves.''\n       The response from Democratic governors to the new burdens \n     that may be imposed on them has ranged from enthusiastic to \n     restrained. On Thursday, the Democratic Governors Association \n     delivered a letter to House and Senate leaders signed by 22 \n     of its members. It was silent on Medicaid but lauded the \n     broader reform effort as essential. ``We recognize that \n     health reform is a shared responsibility and everyone, \n     including state governments, needs to partner to reform our \n     broken health care system,'' the letter noted.\n       Yet congressional Democrats are sufficiently alarmed about \n     the potential impact that they already are seeking special \n     protections for their states. Even Senate Majority Leader \n     Harry M. Reid cut a deal with Senate Finance Committee \n     Chairman Max Baucus (Mont.) to ensure that the federal \n     government would pay the full cost of expanding Medicaid in \n     Reid's state, Nevada.\n       Reid, who faces a potentially difficult 2010 reelection \n     bid, responded to a Republican outcry over his stealth move \n     by pointing to Nevada's crippling foreclosure crisis. ``I \n     make no apologies, none, for helping people in my state and \n     our nation who are hurting the most,'' Reid said on the \n     Senate floor.\n       Among the most vocal opponents of Medicaid expansion are \n     Republican governors from Southern and rural Western states \n     that offer minimal coverage under current law and are less \n     equipped to handle an influx of new beneficiaries, compared \n     with more urban states with better-established social-\n     services infrastructures. The list includes Mississippi, \n     governed by Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican \n     Governors Association. Barbour denounced the proposed \n     Medicaid expansion at a news conference last month as a \n     ``huge unfunded mandate'' likely to result in state tax \n     increases.\n       The wake-up call for the nonpartisan National Governors \n     Association came early in the summer, when Baucus and \n     Grassley announced that they were considering only a \n     temporary increase in federal funding to pay for new Medicaid \n     enrollees. NGA leaders mobilized through their health-care \n     task force, and after a round of conference calls with \n     committee negotiators and bilateral talks between individual \n     governors and senators, the temporary increase was made \n     permanent.\n       Governors still worry that the boost is not enough to fully \n     close the funding gap. Recession victims already are flocking \n     to Medicaid, and enrollment is expected to rise through \n     fiscal 2010, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's \n     Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The pace of \n     increase is expected to ease after fiscal 2010, leaving \n     states with a short window before an anticipated onslaught in \n     2014, when the proposed Medicaid expansion would take effect.\n       South Dakota Gov. Mike Rounds (R) saw Medicaid enrollment \n     in his state climb to 104,000 residents this year, costing \n     the state $265 million out of a budget of $1.2 billion. But \n     he expects a $50 million increase next year, and, even taking \n     into account federal aid from the economic stimulus bill, \n     South Dakota faces a $100 million shortfall. ``That's a heck \n     of an increase, and I don't know how I'm going to pay for \n     it,'' Rounds said.\n       Bredesen said Tennessee could face $1 billion in extra \n     Medicaid costs for the first five years of the expansion. ``I \n     have no idea how we're going to afford it,'' he said.\n       Nor can governors say for certain how many people will show \n     up to claim the new benefits. Because low-income people are \n     harder to track--they tend to move more frequently, and they \n     often don't file tax returns--state officials don't know \n     precisely how many will be eligible. Rounds estimates an \n     enrollment increase of about 75,000 people but concedes that \n     the number could be much higher.\n       Another mystery is how many people who qualify for Medicaid \n     under current rules--a sizable portion of the uninsured \n     population--will decide to finally sign up. This is the \n     ``woodwork effect'' that unnerves state officials around the \n     country because it could lead to much higher costs.\n       ``That's part of the problem we're having, is getting hard \n     numbers,'' Rounds said. ``We just don't know.''\n       In South Dakota and many other states, communities lack \n     doctors and other healthcare providers who are willing to \n     treat Medicaid patients, either because the providers aren't \n     available or because Medicaid payment rates are so low. The \n     House reform bill would increase Medicaid payment rates to \n     the same level as Medicare rates, at a 10-year cost of $80 \n     billion. In some states, Medicaid rates are as low as 40 \n     percent of Medicare rates. But the finance panel rejected a \n     Grassley amendment that would have increased provider rates \n     in the Senate bill.\n       Despite Medicaid's drawbacks, including rigid rules and a \n     complex bureaucracy, many health-care experts still view it \n     as the most practical way to insure the poorest Americans. \n     Low-income adults account for about half of the uninsured \n     population, and in states that provide minimum Medicaid \n     coverage, few parents and no childless adults are covered \n     unless they meet other eligibility criteria.\n       ``If you're trying to expand coverage, at least Medicaid is \n     already up and operational in every state,'' said Diane \n     Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on \n     Medicaid and the Uninsured. ``You're not creating something \n     new with start-up glitches. For any of its flaws, it has been \n     operating, it is paying bills, it is contracting with managed \n     care, it has an eligibility system already in place.''\n       As the reform debate unfolds on the House and Senate \n     floors, health-care negotiators are prepared for a flood of \n     pleadings like the one Reid made that could add up to many \n     billions, forcing reductions to other portions of the bill. \n     California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), for one, estimated \n     that\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\n     the Medicaid expansion could cost his state $8 billion a \n     year. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) underscored those \n     concerns with her own pledge: ``I could not support a bill \n     that pushes additional costs on California state government \n     or its counties.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Tennessee in \ndiscussing health care, which, as the Presiding Officer knows, has been \nthe subject for several weeks now in the Finance Committee and across \nthe entire country for the last few months.\n  Currently, we are waiting for the CBO to come back to the Finance \nCommittee and tell us what the preliminary cost estimate is of the \nFinance Committee bill, as voted with amendments that were passed in \nthe Finance Committee. Soon, if we can believe the reports, the \nmajority leader will bring to the floor a so-called merged bill from \nthe two Senate committees--the HELP Committee and the Finance \nCommittee--and then we will be asked to offer amendments and vote on \nthat bill.\n  While we are waiting for the process to unfold, I think it is very \nimportant to carefully ask the questions that the American people--\nincluding my constituents in Texas--are asking me, questions I believe \nSenators should ask themselves as we debate health care reform on the \nSenate floor.\n  The first question I would like to propose is: Will we have a \ntransparent debate? The American people want transparency. I cannot \ntell you how many of them have contacted me from my State and elsewhere \nand have said: We want to read the bill language. Amazingly enough, \nmany have cited back to me pages--references either from the House \nbills or the HELP Committee bill or otherwise--and said: What does this \nmean? I have concerns about that.\n  The second question is: Will Congress actually listen to the concerns \nof our constituents once they learn more about what is in these bills? \nIn other words, ultimately, the question is: Will we know what is in \nthe bill before we are required to vote on it? Will we know how much it \nis going to cost before we vote on it, both in committee and on the \nfloor of the Senate?\n  If you will remember, way back in August of 2008--that seems like a \nlong time ago, but it is almost yesterday--President Obama pledged that \nour debates on health care reform would be transparent. I applauded him \nfor that at that time. He said negotiations should take place on C-\nSPAN, so anybody and everybody who cared about it could see it. I \nremember, on January 20 of this year, sitting up there near the dais \nwhen our President spoke, and he said things I agreed with, such as: \n``We need greater transparency in government.'' He said: ``Transparency \npromotes accountability and it promotes public confidence in what we do \nhere.''\n  Well, the converse is also true; secrecy breeds suspicion and \nultimately promotes cynicism about what we do here. That is why this is \nsuch an important issue. Unfortunately, those Americans who have been \ncounting on a transparent process in Washington have been disappointed \nso far. We have seen special deals negotiated by the White House with \nlobbyists which have not been disclosed to the American people, some \nwhich we have learned about and some which we may not yet know about. \nOne is the deal with the pharmaceutical industry--holding their \nexposure to $80 billion under this legislation. That deal was \nreinforced last week by a vote in the Finance Committee.\n  I wasn't a party to that deal. I am sure the Presiding Officer was \nnot. I wonder how many other deals have been cut between the White \nHouse and various interest groups that we don't know about. We also \nlearned about a deal cut with some hospitals--some but not all. A CBO \nscore on an amendment last week had to be redone because it was $11 \nbillion off because the CBO, the nonpartisan office charged with \ntelling us how much this bill will cost, didn't know about this hold \nharmless agreement with the hospital association.\n  We need to know of these deals because they will not necessarily be \nreflected in the bill language, and only the White House, presumably, \nand the special interest groups that cut these deals know about \nthem. But I think it is important the American people know about them \nso they can evaluate whether we are appropriately doing our job.\n\n  I have heard it time and time again, particularly since the passage \nof the stimulus bill that we got roughly at 11 o'clock on a Thursday \nnight and were required to vote on in less than 24 hours--my \nconstituents are saying: Is it asking too much to have you read the \nbill before you vote on it? I voted no on that bill for a lot of \nreasons, but I didn't have the time, nor I suspect did many Members of \nCongress have the time, to read it before we were required to vote on \nit.\n  We don't set the voting schedule; the majority leader does. I think \nthat is another reason they want us to slow down. Let's find out what \nis in the bill. Let's let the American people read what is in the bill. \nTell us what it is going to cost, and let's have a good, old-fashioned \ndebate about what is in the best interests of the American people.\n  The third special deal that was disclosed had to do with Medicaid. \nYou remember the majority leader from Nevada said: The unfunded mandate \nfor Medicaid expansion is too much for my State to absorb. Lo and \nbehold, a new deal was cut with new language that would give four \nStates a better deal than they would have had in the original proposal \nby the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus. One of those \nfour States, lo and behold, happens to be the State represented by our \ndistinguished majority leader. I think these examples reveal why \ntransparency is so important.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Tennessee pointed out, we are going \nto have this mysterious merger of the Finance Committee proposals with \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee bill behind closed \ndoors, presumably--I heard reports it is occurring now, maybe even as \nwe speak, in the conference room of the majority leader without any of \nus being present. I think it is a perilous, indeed, a dangerous way for \nus to do business.\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, the first amendment \noffered by our side of the aisle last week in the Finance Committee was \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning. His amendment would \nhave required a 72-hour waiting period before we would vote on the \nFinance Committee bill. During those 72 hours, we would, hopefully, \nhave had actual legislative text not just conceptual language available \nto us and available to the American people so they could read it. We \nwould also insist, under his amendment, on a score; that is, a cost of \nthe Congressional Budget Office telling us how much Medicare was going \nto be cut, how much taxes would be raised, and how the bill would be \npaid for. That seemed like an eminently reasonable amendment to me. \nBut, unfortunately, a majority did not carry the day in the committee, \nand it failed.\n  I hope we have another chance to come back to that issue, perhaps \neven as one of the first amendments as we take up this bill on the \nfloor because I think it is incredibly important to public confidence, \nto accountability, to try to do something about the cynicism that has \ncrept into the public's perception of what we are doing. That is \nreflected in 16 percent of respondents in a recent Rasmussen poll \nsaying they rate Congress as either good or excellent--16 percent. We \nneed to do better than that. We need to restore confidence in what we \nare doing, and I think transparency will help; otherwise, what are we \nleft with? We are left with people wondering whether there is some \nreason we don't want the public to read the bill. Maybe there is a \nreason that they don't think the public should read the language \nbecause maybe they don't intend to read the language before they vote \non it.\n  Some have said the language is just simply too complicated; that an \naverage person cannot understand it if they read it, and that even some \nSenators would not be able to understand it if they read it before they \nvoted on it.\n  I ask us all to take a deep breath and one step back and think about \nthe consequences. If some staffer is the one writing the language, and \nMembers of Congress, members of committees, Members of the Senate do \nnot read it and it perhaps is not written in understandable language so \nwe know what the impact will be, how does that promote public \nconfidence? It is something that ought to give us pause, and\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\nwe ought to reconsider as we reflect on what the message sends.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask, in conclusion, for my colleagues to \nthink about what we are doing. One-sixth of the economy is going to be \naffected by our decision on these health care proposals. What we do in \nthese bills will literally affect the life of every man, woman, and \nchild in the United States of America--all 300 million of us. I don't \nthink it is too much to ask that we slow this down, that we get the \ntext, the actual bill language, that we know how much it is going to \ncost, and we post it online so the American people can read it and give \nus their reaction.\n  We are called representatives for a reason. We represent \nconstituents. I am proud to represent 24 million Texans. I guarantee, \nthey want to know what is in this bill and how it is going to impact \nthem and their families. It is very important that we answer this \nquestion in the affirmative.\n  That question again is: Will this be a transparent debate? That is \nthe first question I have but not the last that I will be appearing \nback on the Senate floor in the coming days to ask. These are the kinds \nof questions that deserve a candid answer. I hope, in the interest of \nbipartisan good faith, we will somehow find a way to come together and \nhelp make this a more transparent process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nreflected equally, taken from both times on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have been down on \nthe Senate floor today talking about probably the biggest issue the \nCongress will deal with this year, and arguably for many years, either \nin the past or in the future, and that is the issue of health care \nreform. We know that issue is now staring us squarely in the face. The \nvarious committees that have jurisdiction over that issue in the \nCongress have acted: three in the House, now two in the Senate. It is \nexpected the Senate Finance Committee will produce a bill sometime \nlater this week.\n  It is a critical debate for the Senate, for the American people, \nbecause it does represent literally one-sixth of the American economy. \nOne-sixth of our entire GDP today consists of spending on health care--\ngovernment heath care, privately delivered health care, but health care \nnonetheless.\n  The question before the Senate in the next week or two when this \neventually reaches the floor is, what are we going to do to try to \naddress the fundamental problem I think most people perceive with our \nhealth care system today, which is it costs too much? Arguably there \nare lots of Americans who do not have access to health insurance. All \nof us want to see that issue addressed and that those Americans who \ncurrently do not have health insurance have a way of being able to \naccess that health care coverage.\n  Many today use emergency services. It is not that people are going \nwithout health care, but they do not have coverage. We need the people \nin this country to have the assurance and the confidence they are going \nto have some sort of insurance that will protect them against those \ntypes of life-threatening illnesses, just the day-to-day illnesses that \nafflict people across this country. Yet I think the big issue for most \nAmericans is the issue of cost.\n  As I said before, when you look at double-digit increases for small \nbusinesses, for families, that really does affect all Americans in one \nform or another. It is a very personal issue. Health care is personal \nto people for obvious reasons, but it is an issue that affects their \npocketbooks in a real, tangible way, and that is why I think there is \nso much attention and concern focused on the direction in which \nCongress intends to proceed.\n  One of the issues that bears heavily upon that debate is the whole \nfiscal situation in which we find ourselves. If we were having this \ndebate at another time, perhaps the circumstances being somewhat \ndifferent, you might come to different conclusions. But one thing we \nall have to keep in mind as we look at how do we address this issue of \nhealth care in this country is doing it in a way that is fiscally \nresponsible. The reason for that is we see deficits, huge deficits as \nfar as the eye can see. For the fiscal year we just concluded on \nSeptember 30, $1.6 trillion annual deficit; next year it is expected to \nbe $1.5 trillion--trillions and trillions of new spending each and \nevery year.\n  This last fiscal year I mentioned, the deficit being $1.6 trillion, \nthat literally represents 43 cents out of every dollar the Federal \nGovernment spent. Forty-three cents out of every single dollar the \nFederal Government spent this last year was borrowed. It is all debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the Republican side has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to proceed until such time as the \nother side comes and claims their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. The point I want to make simply is this: To put that into \nperspective for an average American family, if you are an average \nAmerican family and your annual income is $62,000--from all your hard \nwork and labor over the course of the year you generate $62,000 for \nyour household--that would be the equivalent of spending $108,000. What \nthe Federal Government is doing by borrowing 43 cents out of every \ndollar it spends is the equivalent to a family, a household in this \ncountry making $62,000, of spending $108,000. What family in America \ncan do that? What small business in America can do that, can continue \nto borrow like that? They cannot. It is fundamental; you cannot do \nthat.\n  The Federal Government does it. We continue to borrow from the \nChinese, and we say we will pay the bills at a later date. But one \nthing most Americans understand is, No. 1, you can't spend money you \ndon't have; and, No. 2, when you borrow money, it does have to be paid \nback. What we are looking at right now is deficits and debt mounting to \nthe point that 10 years from today the amount that every household will \nowe in this country is $188,000.\n  How would you like to be a young couple just getting married, you \njust exchanged your marriage vows, and knowing when you start out your \nlife as a family you are going to get a wedding gift from the Federal \nGovernment to the tune of a $188,000 IOU? That is in effect what we are \ndoing to the next generation of Americans.\n  That is the backdrop against which this whole health care debate gets \nunderway. We have deficits and debt that is piling up to the tune of \n$188,000 per household at the end of the year 2019. So we ought to be \nlooking at how we, No. 1, solve the health care crisis in a fiscally \nresponsible way that does not spend trillions of more dollars and raise \ntaxes and borrow more and more money.\n  Those are all issues I think need to be very carefully considered by \nall Members of the Senate as we make these important votes.\n  The other point I will make is this: There are, in the proposals that \nhave been put forward--in all of them--tax increases to pay for this. \nThe most recent version, the Finance Committee bill, is a $1.7 trillion \ncost over a 10-year period. That is the least expensive, I might add, \nof all the bills that have been produced so far. There are five bills \nthat have been produced by the Congress. The Finance Committee bill, to \ntheir credit, is at least the least costly of those, $1.7 trillion over \n10 years. That is still $1.7 trillion in new spending.\n  Bear in mind that we already have a Medicare system which is destined \nfor bankruptcy in the year 2017. We have all kinds of other long-term \nliabilities and Social Security and Medicaid and entitlement programs \nthat pile up. We are going to have to do something about those at some \npoint. Yet here we are talking about adding an almost $2\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\ntrillion new entitlement on top of that crumbling foundation. I think \nmost Americans would take issue with elected leaders who would do that, \nwould take a program that literally is on the verge of bankruptcy and \ntry to add another $2 trillion program on top of it.\n  There is the overall cost of it to the taxpayers, but it is also how \nit is paid for. Obviously, it has to be paid for somehow or we deal \nwith this issue of borrowing, which I mentioned earlier, so what is \nbeing proposed is a series of tax increases and a series of \nreductions--cuts in Medicare programs.\n  The Medicare cuts are going to be bad enough. Medicare Advantage \ntakes a big whack, which is going to affect a lot of seniors around the \ncountry. The providers take a whack; hospitals, home health agencies, \nhospices, all those things will take a big whack. But you also have \nabout $400 billion of tax increases embedded into the latest version of \nthe proposal--much higher than that in some of the other bills moving \nthrough the House--but nevertheless the American public is going to be \nhanded the bill for this which will inevitably lead to higher taxes. So \nmuch so that the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget \nOffice have estimated that 71 percent of the penalty will hit people \nearning less than $250,000 a year. That conflicts and contradicts \ndirectly the commitment the President made of not raising taxes on \npeople making less than $250,000 a year.\n  They have also gone so far as to say the taxes that would be imposed, \nand there are a series of taxes as I said--insurance companies will be \nhit with taxes--the Congressional Budget Office said those taxes will \nbe passed on, dollar for dollar, to people across this country. So the \ninsurance companies, yes, they may remit the taxes, but they are going \nto pass on the cost. So you are going to see not only higher taxes on \nthe insurance companies that get passed on in the form of higher \npremiums to individuals in this country--in other words, you are going \nto have higher insurance costs--but you also have taxes put in here \nthat hit people who do not have health insurance. Those taxes get up to \nbe about $1,500 per year for people who do not have insurance. So \npeople would be penalized, and that would apply, again, across all \nspectrums of earners, wage earners in this country.\n\n  But the CBO, as I said earlier, estimated 71 percent of that penalty \nis going to fall on people who earn less than $250,000 a year. If you \nproject on further--this, again, is the Congressional Budget Office and \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation--they have said by the year 2019 89 \npercent of the taxes will be paid by taxpayers earning less than \n$200,000 a year. So that huge tax burden, that $400 billion initially \nthat will grow when the bill is fully implemented, will fall \ndisproportionately on people making less than $250,000 a year; 89 \npercent of those taxes paid by taxpayers earning less than $250,000 a \nyear.\n  So the enormous amounts of taxation that are contemplated in this \nbill--in addition to the Medicare cuts that are proposed to pay for and \nfinance these changes in health care--are being passed off as health \ncare reform.\n  My view on this is, No. 1, we, the American people, need to know \nthese facts. I think what that would suggest is there ought to be an \nample amount of time when we finally do have a bill. I know the Finance \nCommittee is marking up their version of it. They expect to report it \nout later this week. But what we are going to see reported out is \nconcepts, generalities. We do not have a bill with legislative language \nto react to yet. That is going to be put together with the bill \nproduced by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nearlier. Those will be merged. At some point, that will be reduced to \nlegislative language. When it is, we expect it will be in excess of \n1,000 pages.\n  We now are talking conservatively about having a bill on the Senate \nfloor, not next week but the week after, which will be fully longer \nthan 1,000 pages, none of which any Member of the Senate has yet seen. \nThe American people, the people who are going to be most impacted, will \nnot have had an opportunity to be engaged in this debate or have their \nvoices heard. So we need to make sure, at a minimum, we slow this \nprocess down so we take it step by step so we are not rushing to do \nsomething very quickly and hurriedly that would be a big mistake for \nthe American people.\n  I suggest at a minimum we ought to have a very transparent, open \nprocess. When we have a bill, if it is in excess of 1,000 pages, that \nwe have plenty of time not only for Members of the Senate to review it \nand read it and understand it but also for the American people to have \nthat same opportunity.\n  There were amendments offered in the Senate Finance Committee that \nwould allow a 72-hour period. That seems to be reasonable. That is 3 \ndays, 3 days to look at something in excess of 1,000 pages. Yet that \nwas voted down. My Republican colleagues on the committee offered that \namendment, and it was voted down by the Democratic majority on the \ncommittee. But 72 hours at a minimum--I can't imagine that you could \ncontemplate and fully grasp and understand that amount, that volume of \ninformation, and that kind of a bill in 72 hours, to start with. But at \na minimum that should have been passed. That amendment was defeated at \nthe Senate Finance Committee as were a number of other amendments that \nwere offered by my colleagues on the Republican side.\n  Having said that, first off I think we ought to have an ample amount \nof time to review this bill. Second, I argue in terms of the process \nitself that rather than throwing overboard, throwing away what is a \nvery--it is flawed. We have a flawed health care system in this \ncountry. It is not perfect. OK? It has its problems. We all acknowledge \nthat. We can fix those problems. But we should not throw everything \ngood about it overboard. This will create all kinds of new government \ninvolvement and intervention in the decisions pertaining to health \ncare. Now government is going to dictate what kinds of insurance plans \nor what should be in an insurance plan that, in order to be in \ncompliance with this bill, you would have to be able to put forward. So \npeople are going to have less and less choice, less and less freedom. \nGovernment is going to have more and more say, more control, more \ndecisionmaking.\n  I think most people across this country find that to be very \nthreatening. I think they are genuinely, honestly concerned about \nhaving the government have more and more influence on one-sixth of the \neconomy on an issue that is as personal to them as their health care.\n  At a minimum, they ought to have an opportunity to review the bill. \nSecond, we ought to take this thing and do it step by step and not \nthrow it all overboard, not take what is good about the American health \ncare system and throw it in the ditch simply because it has some flaws \nthat need to be fixed. Those issues can be addressed.\n  We need to cover those who don't have coverage. We need to try to \naddress the issue of cost. But these bills do not do that. We have not \nseen a bill yet, of the five that are being worked on in Congress, \nthat, No. 1, reduces health care costs.\n  They all bend the cost curve up. You ask the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and in every circumstance they will tell you: This does not \nreduce or drive down health care costs; it actually increases health \ncare costs for most Americans.\n  Secondly, we have not had a bill yet that is actually what I would \nnot characterize as a budget buster. All of these bills are several \ntrillion dollars, as I said earlier, on top of programs that are \ndestined for bankruptcy in the very near future.\n  Let's start slow. Let's take this step by step. Let's do this in a \nway that allows the American people to be engaged in this debate. It \ndoes affect them and their livelihoods in a very personal way. It does \naffect their pocketbooks. It will raise their taxes. And it will also--\nagain, not my words; the Congressional Budget Office's--``lead to \nhigher health care costs, not lower health care costs,'' which, at the \nend of day, was that not the whole purpose of this exercise in the \nfirst place?\n  So we are going to do everything we can on our side to open this and \nallow the American people to see it, to give ample time for them to be \nengaged and, secondly, to make sure that when health care reform is \ndone by Congress, it is done in a way that is consistent with what I \nthink most Americans believe should be done; that is, reducing\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\nand driving down health care costs, not increasing premiums as these \nbills do, not spending trillions of dollars of their tax dollars in \npiling on additional entitlement programs on programs that are already \ngoing out of business here in the next few years. But we should do it \nin a way that is fiscally responsible. I think that is the least the \nAmerican people expect of us. I think we ought to deliver on that. We \nought to deliver on health care reform but reform that truly \naccomplishes those important goals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding that we have someone coming down \nwanting to speak, but there are a couple of things I wanted to mention.\n  First of all, when the Senator from South Dakota talks about health \ncare reform, there are some things we can do for health care reform \nthat we have promoted for quite some time. Certainly, medical \nmalpractice is very significant. It is a huge cost. Defensive costs are \na very large part of our health care costs. HSAs came into being a few \nyears ago, and we have pilot programs where they--let's keep in mind, \nhealth care is the only product or service in America that I know of \nwhere there is no encouragement to shop around. Well, if you have HSAs, \nthis is encouragement because if you spend less, you can enjoy the \nbenefits of that; that is, put that into other programs. So I think \nthere are some things we can do.\n  The second thing I would say about the subject that was covered very \nwell by the Senator from South Dakota is that we don't know for sure \nwhat is going to be in the bill that comes out, but we do know this: \nSpeaker Pelosi, over on the House side, has said that any bill that \ncomes out of conference is going to have a government option. So they \ncan masquerade it, they can talk about co-ops, they can talk about all \nof these things; we are going to eventually get something that comes \nout of conference and it is going to have a government option. That is, \nsome people would say, socialized medicine. You can't compete with the \ngovernment and have a system that has delivered the benefits our system \nhas.\n\n\n                             Cap and Trade\n\n  Secondly, the Senator from South Dakota could just as well be talking \nabout another piece of legislation that is up right now; that is, the \ncap-and-trade bill. It is another one that has the same thing where you \ndo not know the blanks.\n  Last Wednesday, there was a news conference by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, \nand they gave this program--they talked about this new kind of cap and \ntrade, but they did not give any specifics. Nothing that was in there \nwas specific in terms of where is the cap, how does the trading take \nplace, how does the rationing take place.\n  The bottom line is this, though: Anything that has to do with any \nkind of cap and trade is going to be at least--at least--a $300 billion \nannual tax increase. That was true back as long ago as the late 1990s \nwhen the Kyoto bill was up. We had the Kyoto bill; they did a study on \nthis thing; it was done by the Wharton School of Economics. They said \nthat the cost of this, if we were to comply with the restrictions of \nthat treaty, would be somewhere between $300 and $330 billion a year. \nTo put that into perspective, because sometimes it is confusing when \nyou are talking about billion dollars and trillions of dollars, I \nremember the largest tax increase that was a general tax increase was \nback in 1993 in the Clinton-Gore White House, and it was $32 billion. \nSo this would be 10 times that amount.\n  So we have had several bills in the Senate since that time, and I \nwould only say this: This is a different debate. It is going to come up \nand we are going to have a chance to talk about it. But the bottom line \nis that the Administrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, a very fine person, \na person who was appointed by President Obama, made the statement that \nif we were to pass the Waxman-Markey bill, something like that, sign it \ninto law, it wouldn't have the effect of reducing CO2 at \nall. The reason is very obvious: We would only be doing that here in \nthe United States.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2566 to H.R. 3326\n\n  Lastly, I did want to make one comment about a couple of votes that \nare going to come up, or at least one vote that is coming up at 3:45 \ntoday. My junior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, has an amendment. \nIt is an excellent amendment. It is one I will support, although I have \nto say that I was tempted not to because I would only like to start the \nball rolling, that if this body is willing to redefine what an earmark \nis, we could be unanimous on this side. An earmark should be an \nappropriation without authorization. This has been a 200-year fight \nbetween authorizers and appropriators, and if we will get to the point \nwhere we will accept the fact that if something has gone through the \nscrutiny of an authorization--the highway bill is a good example of \nthis. We have 30 criteria in that authorization bill. We come up with \ncriteria to determine how much should be spent in different categories. \nAnd on the floor, there are always things coming up that did not go \nthrough the authorization process, and therefore I would call those \nearmarks.\n  So I would only say this: In the amendment Senator Coburn has, it is \ngoing to address some 55 that are called earmarks, of which 6 were \nauthorized. I would like to be able to take those six out. I don't know \nwhether we can do that. It would be very difficult to do prior to the \nvote.\n  But nonetheless, for future reference, if we are going to talk about \nearmarks, I think we need to define what an earmark is. It is an \nappropriation that has not been authorized. That is the thing we need \nto get after, and that will be one of my new wars I am starting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2601 to H.R. 3326\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to use this opportunity to say a \nfew words about an amendment that will be voted on later this \nafternoon, and it is the Sanders-Dorgan Yellow Ribbon outreach \namendment, No. 2601.\n  Every Member of the Senate knows that we have seen many thousands of \nsoldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and they have come home \nwith post-traumatic stress disorder in very large numbers. They have \ncome home with traumatic brain injury, TBI, also at frightening \nnumbers. The government, in a number of ways, has developed many \nprograms to try to provide help and medical care for these brave \nsoldiers and for their families.\n  In Vermont, a couple of years ago, we helped establish what I think \nis an excellent program that many other States around the country are \nbeginning to look at, and the basic premise of the program we have \nestablished in Vermont is that while it is enormously important to make \nsure those who come home from Iraq and Afghanistan get the best \nservices possible, we establish those health care services, those \nservices don't mean anything unless the soldiers are able to take \nadvantage of the services.\n  Given the nature of PTSD and TBI, that is sometimes, especially for \nthe members of the Reserve and National Guard, very difficult. So you \nwill have instances, especially in rural America, where people will \ncome home from Iraq, they are going to be in emotional trouble, and \nthere are going to be strains and stresses on their families, with \ntheir kids. They may be suffering from PTSD, but one of the symptoms of \nPTSD is you do not stand up and say: You know what, I have troubles and \nI need help. That is not what you do.\n  What we established in Vermont was an outreach program which was \nlargely filled with the veterans from Iraq who would go out to the \ncommunities and drop in and sit down with soldiers and their wives face \nto face and just get a sense of how they are doing and through that \npersonal visitation suggest to them that if there is a problem, they \nmight want to take advantage of the services the VA is providing, which \nin my State are quite good, and to make them aware that it is not \nunusual, that they are not the only people who are dealing with PTSD or \nTBI. In truth, this outreach program has been quite successful.\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\n  Some years ago, the Congress established a Yellow Ribbon Program \nwhich is doing a good job, and the goal of that program is to educate \npeople who come home from Iraq and Afghanistan about the services \navailable to them. But we have not yet funded the kind of strong \noutreach effort that I believe we need where we are literally sending \npeople out to National Guard families, especially maybe in rural areas, \nand making them understand that their problems are not unique, that \nthere are services available to help them.\n  So outreach is the word here. We do it in Vermont in a very informal \nway, just person to person.\n  This amendment is $20 million, and the offset comes from the $126 \nbillion in funds in title IX of the bill. It does not cut any one \nparticular account. This $20 million represents a fraction of 1 percent \nof the entire title.\n  So the issue here is that we have a serious problem with PTSD and \nTBI. I think it is terribly important that we do everything we can on a \npersonal level to reach out to the families to get them the services \nthey need. But, once again, you can have the greatest service in the \nworld--I know we are trying. The Department of Defense is trying its \nbest--but those services don't mean anything if veterans don't access \nthem. So the goal is to get people into the services.\n  I would very much appreciate support for the Sanders-Dorgan amendment \nwhich will be coming up in a while.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2583 to H.R. 3326\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote on the \nMcCain amendment No. 2583. This amendment would terminate funding for \nresearch and development of the Army's full-scale hypersonic test \nfacility known as the MARIAH hypersonic wind tunnel.\n  The MARIAH Hypersonic Wind Tunnel Program is under development in \nButte, MT. It is the Nation's only program to develop the wind tunnel \ntechnology required to test and evaluate new hypersonic missiles, space \naccess vehicles, and other advanced propulsion technology, technology \nthe Air Force says we will need.\n  MARIAH will be the first true air hypersonic wind tunnel program. The \nprogram has met its technical milestones and has not encountered \nsignificant setbacks. In fact, the Army Aviation Missile Command has \ngiven this project high marks. Here is what the Army has said:\n\n       This research has shown great potential to be used in a \n     missile test facility and is the only technology shown to \n     have any possibility of meeting the requirement for a Missile \n     Scale Hypersonic Wind Tunnel.\n\n  The Army has asked the MARIAH Program to provide testing capabilities \nat speeds of up to Mach 12. This is the next generation of hypersonic \nflight, something that has never been done before. To get to that \ncapability, cutting-edge research and technologies are required.\n  The program already has provided very real and discernible benefits \nto both the scientific community as well as our armed services. There \nis no other facility in the world capable of meeting the performance \nrequirements at Mach 8 and above.\n  According to a 2000 Air Force Science Advisory Board report, this \ntype of testing will be needed for space access vehicles, global reach \naircraft, and missiles that require air-breathing propulsion to reach \nspeeds above Mach 8.\n  The MARIAH project has worked with Princeton University and Lawrence \nLivermore and Sandia National Laboratories to develop technologies and \ncomputer modeling that exists nowhere else in the world.\n  The team has achieved world records by reaching test pressures of \nover 200,000 psi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent for additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  It also has developed one of the most powerful electron beams in the \nworld.\n  Working with Sandia National Labs, MARIAH has developed a 1-megawatt \nelectron beam to boost the energy supply needed to generate the \nenormous pressures required in a wind tunnel of this caliber.\n  It is the most powerful electron beam in the world, and its benefits \ncan be applied well beyond this project to include shipboard missile \ndefense, large- scale sterilization of food, mail and other items that \ncould have a biohazard or bioweapon contaminant.\n  In conjunction with Princeton University, MARIAH has successfully \ndeveloped three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic computer models \ncapable of simulating the previously unexplored physics necessary for \nthe Mach 8 and above conditions.\n  This is groundbreaking research that must be done before any missile, \nrocket or aircraft can be tested at hypsersonic speeds.\n  Why does this matter? Why do we care about hypersonic capabilities?\n  The answer is foreign competition and foreign capabilities.\n  We know that Russia, China, and others are aggressively developing a \nnew type of missile that is believed to be too fast for U.S. missile \ndefense systems that are either planned or in use.\n  In particular, the India-Russia joint venture BrahMos is now engaged \nin laboratory testing of supersonic cruise and antiship missiles \ncapable of speeds in excess of Mach 5.\n  According to the Air Force Research Labs' report of April 2009 \nentitled ``Ballistic and Cruise Missile Threats'':\n  Russian officials claim a new class of hypersonic vehicle is being \ndeveloped to allow Russian strategic missiles to penetrate missile \ndefense systems.\n  That report is referring to comments made by the commander of the \nRussian rocket forces who said last December that ``By 2015 to 2020 the \nRussian strategic rocket forces will have new complete missile systems \n. . . capable of carrying out any tasks, including in conditions where \nan enemy uses anti- missile defense measures.'' This is a direct \nreference to hypersonic capabilities.\n  And yet some have said our military does not need this technology.\n  But when it comes to figuring out how to defeat this potential \nthreat, I believe we should look into the future, not look back at \nreports that are 5 or 10 years old.\n  This project is about seeing a potential threat to our national \ndefense looming on the horizon and finding a way to defeat it. It is \nvital to our national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10143-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3326, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3326) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Coburn amendment No. 2565, to ensure transparency and \n     accountability by providing that each Member of Congress and \n     the Secretary of Defense has the ability to review \n     $1,500,000,000 in taxpayer funds allocated to the National \n     Guard and Reserve components of the Armed Forces.\n       Barrasso amendment No. 2567, to prohibit the use of funds \n     for the Center on Climate Change and National Security of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency.\n       Franken amendment No. 2588, to prohibit the use of funds \n     for any Federal contract with Halliburton Company, KBR, Inc., \n     any of their subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other \n     contracting party if such contractor or a subcontractor at \n     any tier under such contract requires that employees or \n     independent contractors sign mandatory arbitration clauses \n     regarding certain claims.\n       Franken (for Bond/Leahy) amendment No. 2596, to limit the \n     early retirement of tactical aircraft.\n       Franken (for Coburn) amendment No. 2566, to restore \n     $166,000,000 for the Armed Forces to prepare for and conduct \n     combat operations, by eliminating low-priority \n     congressionally directed spending items for all operations \n     and maintenance accounts.\n       Sanders/Dorgan amendment No. 2601, to make available from \n     Overseas Contingency Operations $20,000,000 for outreach and \n     reintegration services under the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration \n     Program.\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\n       Lieberman modified amendment No. 2616, relating to the two-\n     stage ground-based interceptor missile.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Am I correct to assume that the first 30 minutes has been \nequally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  At the beginning of the year, the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee and I announced earmark reforms that go far \nbeyond the transparency requirements enacted in 2007.\n  These reforms include a requirement for Members to post their earmark \nrequests on their Web sites, make substantial reductions in the number \nand amount of earmarks compared to prior years' appropriations bills, \nand early and prompt committee announcements on which projects are \nfunded in each of the annual appropriations bills.\n  There has never been as much transparency in the earmark process as \nthere is today. In most cases, the public has had several months to \nreview their elected Representatives' requests for funding. The bill on \nthe floor today has 200 fewer projects and $300 million less in funding \nfor Member projects than last year's bill.\n  I believe this is a considerable improvement to how Congress does its \nbusiness.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I welcome any \nconstructive suggestions on how to improve the operations and \nefficiency of the ways in which the committee accomplishes its vital \nwork.\n  However, those suggestions should not compromise the constitutional \nprinciple that the power of the purse is invested in the Congress, and \nnot the executive.\n  We must retain the checks and balances and keep the Congress and the \nexecutive as separate and co-equal branches of government.\n  That is why I must oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona. It purports to increase transparency of congressional earmarks \nby subjecting all of them to full and open competition.\n  In reality, it exempts congressional priorities from the normal, \nlawful process of how the Department of Defense purchases equipment, \nengages services, and develops new technologies.\n  For example, we have included a number of earmarks for which the \nDepartment has negotiated contracts already in place. These contracts \nwere negotiated in full compliance with the law.\n  Simply because Congress added funds to accelerate important programs, \nsuch as the TB-33 towed sonar array, handheld radios for Special \nOperations Command, advanced radars for the F-15 fighter, and virtual \ninteractive training equipment for National Guard units around the \ncountry, the McCain amendment would require a new competition to take \nplace.\n  This would disrupt important programs, delay procurement of valuable \nequipment, and cost the taxpayer more money.\n  The McCain amendment also disregards the fact that sometimes the \nPentagon gets it wrong. There are many programs which are now in use on \nthe battlefield that would not be there if the Defense Department's \nviews had prevailed years ago.\n  Congress directed funds to the Predator unmanned aerial vehicle, \nlifesaving Chitosan bandages, and the V-22--programs that would not \nexist if Congress had not directed funds to those specific purposes.\n  I ask my colleagues, What do they suppose would have happened to \nthose programs if the Pentagon's bureaucracy had put these programs \nthrough the redtape required by the McCain amendment? Would the \nPredator be attacking our enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq? Or might it \nstill be an exquisite, complex system that remains on the drawing board \nyear after year?\n  Ultimately the McCain amendment establishes two sets of acquisition \nlaws: one for items requested by the President, which may be subject to \nfull and open, limited or no competition at all; and another set of \nrules for items added by the Congress.\n  The amendment rests on the faulty assumption that the Defense \nDepartment is unable to conduct oversight on congressionally directed \nspending, and that earmarks do not serve valid military purposes.\n  In 2008, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense reviewed \n219 earmarks from the fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations Act.\n  The Inspector General determined:\n\n       The DOD personnel we interviewed and the respondents to our \n     data call said that DOD performs oversight of earmarks \n     identical to the oversight of other expenditures.\n\n  Furthermore, of the 219 earmarks that were reviewed by the Inspector \nGeneral, all but 4 were found to ``advance the primary mission and \ngoals of the Department of Defense.''\n  None of these four earmarks is contained in this year's bill. Even if \nthey were, none of them would be competed under the McCain amendment \nbecause each of those earmarks was awarded to a nonprofit institution.\n  Due to these shortcomings in the amendment which has been offered, I \nhave proposed an alternative amendment.\n  My amendment insures that each earmark added by Congress to benefit a \nfor-profit entity shall be subject to the very same acquisition \nregulations that apply to items requested by the President in his \nannual budget request. This proposal applies the rules of the road \nequally to Congress and the President.\n  The amendment I propose also contains the standard exceptions to \ncompetition, including small business set-asides. The McCain amendment, \non the other hand, would eliminate these standard exemptions to \ncompetition for earmarks that support small businesses, minority-owned \nbusinesses, women-owned businesses, and service-connected disabled \nveteran-owned businesses.\n  My amendment is a reasonable and fair approach to balancing the \nacquisition rules as they apply to congressional spending items and \nitems requested by the President. It insures that all spending items \nthat are funded in this bill, regardless of who proposed them, are \nsubject to the same rules for competition. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment and oppose the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Inouye, for his leadership and the bipartisan way he \nhas gone about managing his responsibilities as chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. The committee has carefully reviewed the \nPresident's budget request in public hearings, calling before the \ncommittee representatives of the various service departments and also \nopening the opportunity for any outside interest to come to talk about \nwhat our needs are. In my judgment it has been a very careful, prudent, \nand workmanlike way to approach this very solemn and important \nresponsibility. So he has brought us to where we are today, scheduled a \nvote, finally, on final passage later today, providing funding for our \nnational security agencies, the Department of Defense, the men and \nwomen who have volunteered to put themselves in harm's way, to wear the \nuniform of our country and to defend our country against aggression \nhere and abroad.\n  The Department is currently being funded by a continuing resolution. \nAlthough forcing the Department to operate under a temporary resolution \nis not a very good way to provide funding for a department charged with \nprotecting our national security interests, it is the best we could do. \nI applaud the leadership of Senator Inouye for bringing a bill before \nus that will cover the entire Department of Defense for the remainder \nof the fiscal year, and for working with our counterparts in the House \nto begin resolving differences between the two bodies so that a bill \ncan soon be presented to the President for signature.\n  There has been much discussion about earmarks. The chairman raised \nthe issue. Later this afternoon we will vote on an earmark-related \namendment or two. There are those who have been striving to inject \nadditional earmark reforms and other ways of doing business. We think \nwe have carefully reviewed all the requests for spending,\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\nall of the provisions that permit spending in this bill, to be sure \nthey are warranted, justified, in the national interest, and is not \nthere only to serve some special interest or private interest of a \nMember of Congress.\n  Congress has worked, the House and Senate together, to improve and \nmake significant changes in the process, adding procedures to \nfacilitate the closest possible scrutiny of congressionally directed \nspending. In addition, the Appropriations Committee has gone beyond \nthose requirements and imposed additional disclosure requirements and \nlimitations on earmarking. But I am not going to support any suggested \nchanges that will take away from the Congress or diminish the power of \nthe Congress specifically to carry out its responsibilities under the \nConstitution to direct spending.\n\n  The committee has recommended, and the Senate has acted in its wisdom \nto approve or reject certain provisions of the bill. We have \nentertained all amendments. There is no closed rule. There is no \nspecified number of amendments. There is no prohibition against any \namendment of any Senator. So anyone who has a problem with this bill or \nany provision has had a right to say what it is, offer a change in the \nway of an amendment, and to have the Senate vote on it. That is the way \nwe conduct business in the Senate on earmarks. It is an open process.\n  There is nothing in the procurement history of the Department of \nDefense to support the notion that the Department has been infallible \nin cost effectively procuring solutions for our Defense Department \nneeds, and doing so in a fair, open, and evenhanded manner. The \ninspector general and GAO reports are replete with examples of poor \njudgment in Defense Department activities having nothing to do with \ncongressionally directed spending. The GAO has upheld protests in \nrecent years in which the Department did not perform its acquisition \nresponsibilities in a lawful and appropriate manner.\n  So there are a lot of checks and balances that are at work in the \nprocess, and I think we have to remind ourselves how thorough and \ndiligent many people are in assuring that the things that are approved \nin this bill serve the public interest, not just the private interests \nor whims of Members of Congress.\n  We have increased funding for the requirement that the Department of \nDefense identified over the summer for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected \nvehicles for our men and women serving in Afghanistan. We have imposed \nnew requirements to help protect our soldiers in uniform and on the \nbattlefield. We have included an additional $1.2 billion for the MRAP \nprogram, and it is above what the administration has requested. I think \nwe have acted responsibly, and I strongly defend the decision the \ncommittee has made on this subject. I have no doubt including funding \nfor the procurement of these additional vehicles will save American \nlives.\n  Congressionally directed defense initiatives should be subject to the \nclosest scrutiny of the Appropriations Committee, and of the \nlegislative process as a whole including the authorizing procedure \nwhich precedes the appropriations process. The activities of the \nDepartment of Defense were carefully scrutinized by the Armed Services \nCommittee, which shares responsibilities for making these decisions, as \nwell as the Appropriations Committee. But I do not think Members of \nthis body should feel ashamed or embarrassed to promote the passage of \nthis bill. It is a good bill. It enhances our national security, and it \nsupports the efforts we are making to protect the security interests of \nthis great country.\n  I thank the Senate for allowing me to make these comments and the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii for being an active, responsible \npartner in the development of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi, the vice chairman of this committee, for his generous \nremarks.\n  I would like to point out to the Senate, this bill represents \nthousands of manhours of study, of research, of discussion, of debate. \nIt contains spending of $636.6 billion. It is a huge amount. We take \nour vows and responsibilities very seriously. It might be interesting \nto note that this measure--this huge measure--was passed by the \nAppropriations Committee by a vote of 30 to 0. It is a bipartisan bill. \nIt was passed unanimously. These things do not happen every day, Mr. \nPresident. It demonstrates and I think it illustrates what \nbipartisanship can do, what work can do, and what investigation can do.\n  Senator Cochran and I are proud to present this measure to the \nSenate, to our colleagues, and we hope it will be passed accordingly.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the \nDefense Subcommittee's recommendations regarding the fiscal year 2010 \nmissile defense programs. This bill supports the administration's \nrequest, stays at the authorized funding levels, and, most importantly, \nrecommends changes that augment programs that this Congress has been \nchampioning year after year.\n  The committee strongly supports the near-term missile defense \nprograms, including ground-based missile defense, Aegis sea-based \nmissile defense, and theater high altitude area defense. The committee \nadded funding to the budget request in order to enhance each of these \ninitiatives and ensure that the administration remains focused on these \nprograms that are supporting the warfighter today.\n  The committee provides an additional $50 million above the budget \nrequest for the ground-based missile defense, GMD, program. After the \nadministration submitted its budget for GMD, the Department of Defense \napproved a new integrated master test plan for the Missile Defense \nAgency, MDA. This plan requires seven additional ground-based \ninterceptors that were not part of the budget request.\n  The Department informed the committee that additional funding was \nneeded to sustain the production line in fiscal year 2010 in order to \navoid costs associated with reconstituting the line in future years. \nThe committee agreed with the Department and increased the funding.\n  This bill also provides funds above the budget request that will \nsupport the administration's new missile defense architecture in \nEurope. I strongly endorse the new plan. This new approach will enhance \nthe protection of our allies in Europe, U.S. forces and their families \ndeployed abroad, and the U.S. homeland from ballistic missile attack \nsooner than the previous program.\n  Some of my colleagues have stated that we are cancelling missile \ndefense in Europe. Those indictments are simply inaccurate. Earlier \nthis month, Secretary Gates responded to those types of criticisms as \n``either misinformed or misrepresenting the reality of what we are \ndoing.'' I would have to agree with him.\n  Under the prior administration's approach, the missile defense system \nwould not be capable of protecting against Iranian missiles until at \nleast 2017. Under the new plan, the more threatened areas of Europe and \nthe U.S. forces stationed there will have protection by the end of \n2011. Given Iran's brazen missile tests late last month and its recent \ndisclosure of a new, secret uranium enrichment facility, we need to get \nthe right capability fielded sooner.\n  The 10 interceptors that would have been emplaced in Poland under the \nprevious plan were only capable of engaging five ballistic missiles \nfrom Iran. Any number greater than five overwhelmed the proposed \nsystem, thereby rendering the U.S. homeland, U.S. allies and partners, \nas well as our deployed troops and their families, vulnerable. \nFurthermore, these interceptors are not effective against short- and \nmedium-range missiles that are proliferating around the world.\n  The system proposed under the new plan is more robust. It will \nprovide the U.S. and its allies with the protection necessary to \ncounter today's real ballistic missile threats. The new plan is more \nresponsive to the increasingly pervasive short- and medium-range \nmissile threat and is adaptable to respond to longer range threats in \nthe future.\n  The new architecture focuses on using the proven standard Missile-3 \non Aegis ships and on the land together with additional sensor \ncapability to provide more effective protection for ourselves and our \nallies.\n  I am pleased to say that the Defense appropriations bill provides \nover $130\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nmillion in additional funding to support this new initiative:\n  The current inventory of SM-3 missiles is woefully inadequate to \noutfit the fleet of Aegis ballistic missile defense ships. The \ncommittee adds nearly $60 million to procure an additional 6 SM-3 \ninterceptors to ensure that more missiles are available. This funding \nwill bring production capacity up to the current level.\n  The bill adds over $40 million to begin procurement of an additional \nTPY-2 radar that could be deployed to Southern Europe. This is \nprecisely what the new plan calls for. The additional sensor coverage \nwill support protection of our European allies and deployed forces. It \nwill also enhance the defense of the United States since it can provide \nearly and precise tracking data for the U.S. ground-based interceptors \nemplaced in Alaska and California.\n  Finally, the committee provides an additional $35 million to continue \ndevelopment of SM-3 interceptors. This increased funding will \naccelerate the future upgrades of SM-3. These advancements are intended \nto increase the range and lethality of the SM-3 missiles on Aegis ships \nand the land-based component of the new European architecture. This is \na critical component to counter the threat of Iranian longer range \nmissiles in the future.\n  In order to stay at the authorized level for missile defense, while \nat the same time adding funds to robustly support the near-term missile \ndefense programs and the new European missile defense plan, the \ncommittee had to make difficult trade-offs.\n  The committee reduced programs that are technically challenging and \nuncertain to show promise for years to come.\n  The committee also reduced funds that were not needed in fiscal year \n2010. For instance, several of my colleagues have expressed concern \nthat this bill reduces funding for tests and targets by $150 million. \nOur committee strongly supports a robust test program for missile \ndefense, but we do not support funding that cannot be executed next \nyear. The committee reduced funds that are premature for fiscal year \n2010 and will not be required until later years. Let me explain.\n  In fiscal year 2009, the Congress appropriated nearly $920 million \nfor test and targets. According to data provided by the Missile Defense \nAgency, as of August 31, they have only spent $360 million of those \nfunds. This means that the Agency will carry forward into fiscal year \n2010 about $560 million.\n  The fiscal year 2010 request for test and targets is nearly $970 \nmillion, a $50 million increase over last year's funding.\n  The committee believes that a $150 million reduction will not impact \nthe testing program in fiscal year 2010. With the unexpended funds from \nfiscal year 2009 and this committee's recommendation for fiscal year \n2010, MDA will have over $1.3 billion for testing purposes.\n  Furthermore, some of my colleagues will say that the reduction in the \ntest and target budget line will stop testing of the two-stage ground-\nbased interceptor that was intended for Poland under the prior \nadministration's plan. That is simply not the case. Nowhere in this \nbill does the committee deny funding for the two-stage interceptor \ntests.\n  Indeed, the bulk of funding for these two tests is not in the test \nand target line of the budget request. Most of the funds for these \ntests are being carried forward from fiscal year 2009 for the European \nthird site and are included in the $50.5 million request in fiscal year \n2010 for the European capability.\n  Let me close by saying that this bill responsibly and robustly funds \nthe missile defense programs that Congress has supported for years. It \nprovides additional funding for GMD, Aegis and TPY-2 radars. It \nprovides funding that is strongly aligned with the administration's new \nplan for missile defense in Europe. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport the committee's recommendation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2588\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the Franken \namendment if it is OK with the bill managers.\n  The amendment would impose the will of Congress on private \nindividuals and companies in a retroactive fashion, in validating \nemployment contracts without due process of law. It is a political \namendment, really at bottom, representing sort of a political attack \ndirected at Halliburton, which is politically a matter of sensitivity.\n  Notwithstanding, the Congress should not be involved in writing or \nrewriting private contracts. That is just not how we should handle \nmatters in the Senate, certainly without a lot of thought and care, and \nwithout the support or at least the opinion of the Department of \nDefense.\n  Senator Franken offered this amendment because he apparently does not \nlike the fact there are arbitration agreements in employment contracts. \nI would suggest that is common all over America today.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has already resolved that \narbitration agreements contained in employment contracts are not only \nvalid but in most instances beneficial. In most instances, arbitration \nis considered to be beneficial. In fact, employees tend to win more \narbitration disputes than they do lawsuits in court. So I think that is \na matter we should consider.\n  This is what Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court wrote in Adams v. \nCircuit City:\n\n       Arbitration agreements allow parties to avoid the cost of \n     litigation, a benefit that may be of particular importance in \n     employment litigation, which often involves smaller sums of \n     money than disputes concerning commercial contracts.\n\n  So I believe that instead of eliminating arbitration, we should \nprobably be looking for ways to utilize mediation and arbitration more \nin these kinds of disputes.\n  Indeed, in a recent JAMS article published in June of 2009, entitled \n``Arbitrators Less Prone to Grant Dispositive Motions Than Courts,'' \nthe author made the following points:\n\n       [A]rbitrators are generally much more reluctant than courts \n     to grant dispositive motions--\n\n  That is, to wipe out a lawsuit altogether--\n\n     whether they are motions to dismiss a complaint or \n     arbitration demand, or motions for summary judgment. Indeed, \n     the rules of most major arbitration providers are silent \n     about whether an arbitrator may entertain dispositive \n     motions.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       While courts have held that arbitrators have the inherent \n     power to grant dispositive motions, the lack of explicit \n     rules on the issue reflects the hesitance that most \n     arbitrators feel in granting dispositive motions without a \n     fact hearing.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       There are at least three institutional reasons, which also \n     highlight some of the advantages of arbitration:\n\n  The article says:\n\n       First, while every litigant is entitled to appeal the grant \n     of a dispositive motion in federal or state court, a final \n     decision in arbitration is subject to far less review. \n     Moreover, appellant court review of such a grant is de novo, \n     with the allegations or evidence, as the case may be, read in \n     the light most favorable to the plaintiff. In addition, to \n     the extent that the trial court has interpreted the law, the \n     reviewing court is free to interpret and apply the law \n     differently.\n\n  Basically, they are saying a person who has filed a complaint about \ntheir employment termination or agreement has a better shake of getting \nto court and having their matter heard than if they had filed a lawsuit \nbecause the strict rules of summary judgment often toss a lot of these \nlawsuits at an early stage.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The second difference between courts and arbitrators that \n     explains why courts are more likely to grant motions to \n     dismiss [an employee's lawsuit] is a differing level of \n     concern about discovery. In the U.S. Supreme Court's recent \n     decision in Twombly, for instance, ``the Court placed heavy \n     emphasis on the `sprawling, costly, and hugely time-\n     consuming' discovery that would ensue in permitting a bare \n     allegation of an antitrust conspiracy to survive a motion to \n     dismiss, and expressed concern that such discovery'' will \n     push cost-conscious defendants\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\n     to settle even anemic cases. Discovery is much more limited \n     in arbitrations and, thus, a denial of a motion to dismiss is \n     less likely to result in such extensive discovery.\n       Finally, some commentators and judges have noted that the \n     pressure of the increasing caseload that federal and state \n     courts have seen over the last two decades makes the courts \n     more tempted to dispose of cases on a motion, instead of \n     after a trial on the merits. . . . [arbitrators have] reacted \n     in precisely the opposite way--by constricting, not \n     expanding, the use of dispositive motions.\n\n  In effect, allowing more cases to be fully heard.\n  There is no doubt that contracts are a property right. We do not have \nany allegations that the contracts Senator Franken is trying to \ninvalidate were imposed on employees or that fraud or coercion was \ninvolved in creating them.\n  To invalidate these contracts would violate not only the due process \nrights of employers but the employees as well. Employees could, indeed, \nbenefit from arbitration rather than having to go to Federal court. The \nCongress is in no position to determine whether an employee negotiated \nfor additional compensation in exchange for signing an arbitration \nagreement----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have one \nadditional moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would conclude by saying that I do \nbelieve this is an important issue; that the Department of Defense is \nnot asking for this. It is a reaction to some specific event, I assume, \nthat has not justified changing Federal law. Arbitration in itself can \nbe better for employees than filing an expensive lawsuit in Federal \ncourt. I believe we ought to at least dig into the issue far more in \ndepth than we have before we up and pass such legislation as this.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii controls the time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, article I, section 8 of our Constitution \ngives Congress the power to spend money for the welfare of our \ncitizens. Because of this, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote:\n\n       Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of Federal \n     funds, and has repeatedly employed that power to further \n     broad policy objectives.\n\n  That is why Congress could pass laws cutting off highway funds to \nStates which didn't raise their drinking age to 21. That is why this \nwhole bill is full of limitations on contractors--what bonuses they can \ngive and what kinds of health care they can offer. The spending power \nis a broad power, and my amendment is well within it.\n  But don't take my word for it. I asked three of our Nation's top \nconstitutional scholars--Akhil Amar, Laurence Tribe, and Erwin \nChemerinsky, authorities regularly cited by everyone from Justice \nScalia to Justice Stevens--what they thought about this amendment. Let \nme read their joint conclusion from this letter, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record:\n\n       Congress' power of the purse is expansive. S.A. 2588 falls \n     squarely within its purview, and clearly does not infringe \n     any constitutional prohibition.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Members of the United States Senate: Pursuant to a \n     request from Senator Franken, we have reviewed his pending \n     amendment (S.A. 2588) to the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act of 2010 (H.R. 3326). Senator Franken \n     invited us to consider whether any aspect of this amendment \n     could arguably be found unconstitutional. We are confident \n     that S.A. 2588 is well within the bounds of Congress' power \n     under the Spending Clause. We are also confident that it \n     raises no separate constitutional concerns.\n       The Constitution empowers Congress to ``pay the Debts and \n     provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the \n     United States.'' Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1. As Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist wrote in South Carolina v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 \n     (1987), ``[i]ncident to this power, Congress may attach \n     conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and has \n     repeatedly employed the power `to further broad policy \n     objectives[.]' '' In South Carolina v. Dole, for example, the \n     Supreme Court upheld the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, a \n     law that limited federal highway funds to states that did not \n     adopt a minimum drinking age of twenty-one. This amendment is \n     precisely the kind of ``general welfare'' legislation that \n     the Spending Clause, as interpreted by South Carolina v. \n     Dole, would permit.\n       Of course, the Spending Clause does not permit actions that \n     are barred by other provisions of the Constitution. See, \n     e.g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 91 (1976) (per curiam). A \n     review of the proposed measure reveals no such barriers.\n       This measure could conceivably impair government \n     performance on certain federal contracts. The Contracts \n     Clause of the Constitution, however, which prohibits passage \n     of any ``Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts,'' \n     explicitly and exclusively applies to the states, not the \n     federal government. See Art. I, 10, cl. 1 (``No State shall . \n     . .''). Hence, the Contracts Clause could not provide the \n     basis for a constitutional challenge to this amendment.\n       Similarly, S.A. 2588 is not remotely a Bill of Attainder. \n     Instead of naming or describing a specific group of entities \n     to be covered, the amendment erects a ``generically \n     applicable rule'' for de-funding: the practice of requiring \n     mandatory arbitration of certain claims. See United States v. \n     Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 450 (1965). Moreover, denial of federal \n     funding to an entity that declines to bring itself into \n     compliance with purely prospective funding guidelines is a \n     far cry from the punitive conduct that the Bill of Attainder \n     clause was written to prohibit. If anything, while the \n     ``distinguishing feature of a Bill of Attainder is the \n     substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of \n     guilt,'' this amendment empowers the courts as the only fora \n     for the resolution of certain claims. De Veau v. Braisted, \n     363 U.S. 144, 160 (1960).\n       The Ex Post Facto Clause is also unavailing. Independent of \n     the fact that the restriction of funding in S.A. 2588 is \n     conditioned on present or future conduct, it is long-settled \n     that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies exclusively to criminal \n     penalties. See Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386 (1798).\n       Nor could it be plausibly argued that S.A. 2588 effects an \n     unconstitutional ``regulatory taking'' without just \n     compensation under the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause. The \n     Takings Clause addresses only the physical seizure of private \n     property and the regulatory destruction of particularly \n     identifiable property rights or interests--air rights, mining \n     rights, intellectual property, and the like. While a \n     plurality of the Supreme Court has once voted to strike down \n     federal legislation under the Takings Clause even where the \n     statute did not seize any identifiable piece of private \n     property or render worthless any particular property \n     interest, it has done so only where the law in question \n     imposed a ``substantial and particularly far reaching'' \n     retroactive monetary liability that unforeseeably brought \n     about a ``considerable financial burden.'' Eastern \n     Enterprises v. Appel, 524 U.S. 498, 529-537 (1998). S.A. \n     2588, in contrast, is entirely unrelated to property, imposes \n     no financial liability, and is in any event of purely \n     prospective effect. Moreover, this measure cannot be said to \n     impose on a narrowly targeted group burdens that in ``justice \n     and fairness,'' Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 65 (1979), \n     ought to be borne by the public as a whole--the singular vice \n     of takings of private property without ``just compensation.''\n       Someone unfamiliar with the jurisprudence of the past six \n     decades might also allege that S.A. 2588 would violate \n     substantive due process. However, the post-Lochner Supreme \n     Court has consistently and wisely expressed an unwillingness \n     to invalidate economic legislation on any such basis so long \n     as it is at least arguably rational. See, e.g., Ferguson v. \n     Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 731 (1963). In fact, the Supreme Court \n     in the post-1937 era has invalidated economic legislation on \n     the basis of substantive due process only where the \n     legislature has acted in an indisputably ``arbitrary and \n     irrational'' manner. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 \n     U.S. 1, 15 (1976). This amendment does not even remotely fall \n     within that narrow prohibition.\n       Congress' power of the purse is expansive. S.A. 2588 falls \n     squarely within its purview, and clearly does not infringe \n     any constitutional prohibition.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Akhil Reed Amar,\n       Sterling Professor of Law, Yale Law School.\n     Erwin Chemerinsky,\n       Founding Dean, University of California at Irvine School of \n     Law.\n     Laurence H. Tribe,\n       Carl M. Loeb University Professor, Harvard Law School.\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I also asked the Congressional Research \nService, Congress's nonpartisan research arm, to take a look. They also \ndid not find any cause for constitutional concern.\n  Senator Sessions says my amendment violates the due process clause. \nBut as Professors Amar, Chemerinsky, and Tribe explain in their letter, \nthe Supreme Court hasn't struck down economic laws on these grounds \nsince 1937--unless the legislation is ``arbitrary and irrational.'' \nTheir conclusion: ``This amendment does not even\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\nremotely fall within that narrow prohibition.''\n  Let me be clear. This amendment does not single out any contractor. \nThe text of the amendment does not list a single contractor by name, \nand if you read the amendment, you would know it. This amendment would \ndefund any contractor who refused to give the victims of rape and \ndiscrimination their day in court.\n  Let me tell my colleagues how I think this amendment does speak to \nthe Constitution. The Constitution gives everybody the right to due \nprocess of law. Today, defense contractors are using fine print in \ntheir contracts to deny women such as Jamie Leigh Jones their day in \ncourt. But it is not just Jamie Leigh Jones. This isn't about one \ninstance, as Senator Sessions said. This is about many women across \nthis country who have been victims of sexual assault and rape in Iraq \nand who have been hired by contractors and who have been forced to \narbitrate by contractors. So women are not given their day in court. \nInstead, they are forcing them behind the closed doors of arbitration \nwhere the Federal Rules of Evidence don't apply, where decisions are \nbinding and secret, and where decisions are issued by a private \narbitrator often paid by the company itself.\n  This amendment does not seek to eliminate arbitration. It seeks to \neliminate arbitration in cases of rape and sexual assault. The \nvictim's----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time has expired.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent for another 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the victims of rape and discrimination \ndeserve their day in court. Congress plainly has the constitutional \npower to make that happen. I ask my colleagues to vote in support of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2567 offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2566\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, later we are going to vote on an amendment \nI have that is a prohibition on taking earmarked money from the \noperation and maintenance account of our armed services. Operation and \nmaintenance--not procurement, not research, but operation and \nmaintenance. The very key thing that funds the ability of our \nwarfighters and our Defense Department to do what they do is being used \nto pay for some very good projects, some not very good projects, most \nof which all are parochial; in other words, directed toward State \nbenefit, through the operation and maintenance account.\n  Last year, I would remind my colleagues, the Navy ran out of \noperation and maintenance money. We had to supplement it. Why did we \nsupplement it? Because we took their money last year and put it into \nearmarks instead of giving the Navy what it needed. I would remind the \npeople listening to these words that when we do a supplemental, we \ncharge the money to our kids and our grandkids. We don't have to live \nwithin the budget parameters.\n  So as we vote for this, earmark is another question. The question is: \nWhere do you take the money when you go to earmark? When we take it \nfrom the very things that support, equip, and protect the people who \nare defending this country, and we put them at risk by not having the \namount of dollars that are necessary for that, I think we are sending a \nterrible signal not just to the American people but to our troops that \nour parochial desires are more important than their well-being.\n  When the amendment comes up, I will defer saying anything else so we \ncan move on. But the American people need to know. This is a couple \nhundred million bucks that is going to be taken away from the very \nnecessary things they need. There are a couple of other gimmicks in \nhere that actually lessen that account that allow for other things to \nbe done in terms of not looking into inflation correctly, but we will \npass on those amendments. But the fact is we ought not be playing games \nwith the money that goes to protect our troops.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2567\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the Barrasso amendment No. 2567.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, my amendment is simple. It prevents the \nCentral Intelligence Agency from using any funds from the fiscal year \n2010 Defense Appropriations bill to create or operate a center on \nclimate change and national security.\n  To me, this center is redundant to activity already conducted by the \nCIA and other Federal agencies. There is no reason to create an \nadditional center to do work already being done.\n  We don't need to duplicate the work of others. Leave the task of \ngathering and analyzing climate change information to the agencies that \ndo that work. Let them pass that information on to the analysts at the \nCIA to incorporate it into their assessments.\n  The experts at the CIA should focus work on foreign intelligence \ngathering to prevent the next terrorist attack. That is what they are \ntrained and equipped to do.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \namendment, introduced by Senator Barrasso, to strike the funding for \nthe Central Intelligence Agency's Center on Climate Change and National \nSecurity. Climate change and the role of the intelligence community has \nbeen the subject of many lively discussions before the Select Committee \non Intelligence.\n  As the vice chairman of this committee, I have worked with the \nchairman, Senator Dianne Feinstein, to resolve many issues of \nimportance to the intelligence community. Unfortunately, on this issue \nof climate change, I have and will continue to disagree respectfully \nwith the chairman.\n  I recognize that many Members on both sides of the aisle have strong \nbeliefs about global climate change, its causes, and its possible \nconsequences. Regardless of how you come down on this issue, however, \nour intelligence agencies are not the appropriate venue for dealing \nwith it.\n  Members who support the creation of this center at CIA have cited the \nnational security implications of global climate change. I agree that \nglobal climate change could have national and global security \nimplications and that elements of the U.S. Government and private \nsector should be studying it, but the intelligence community is not one \nof those elements. Other government entities, such as the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, are far better suited to study this issue.\n  The intelligence community is not a think tank. Its job, put simply, \nis to steal secrets and provide analysis of those secrets. There are no \nsecrets to steal or to analyze when studying current weather patterns \nand estimating the geopolitical effects of an event 20 or more years in \nthe future as this new CIA center would be asked to do.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee is constantly reminded by various \ncommissions, and the intelligence community itself, that our Nation's \nintelligence analysts are overtasked, overworked, and do not have \nadequate time to devote to long-term assessments, even on the important \ncountries and issues they currently cover on a daily basis, such as \nterrorism, proliferation, Iran, Iraq, and China.\n  To those who support this center, I would ask a simple question: As \nwe\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\nface continued threats in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran, which analysts \nare going to be pulled from their current responsibilities to analyze \nthe implications of climate change? Adequately covering all of the \ngeopolitical implications of global climate change would require \nanalysis on dozens of countries by analysts who are familiar with some \nor all of those countries. In short, it would require drawing on a \nsubstantial part of our analytic corp.\n  Can we really afford to have these analysts redirected from their \ncurrent responsibilities to work on global climate change, especially \nwhen our nation is at war? I strongly doubt that terrorist leaders or \nrogue nations will stop plotting against us while our analysts take \ntime off to ponder the potential implications of global climate change.\n  Through my many discussions with Senator Feinstein, I am familiar \nwith the motivation for this center. While I will vote in favor of \nSenator Barrasso's amendment, I would be willing to work with Senator \nFeinstein and others to find alternative avenues to obtain the \ninformation being sought through this center.\n  The bottom line is this--at a time when our Nation is fighting wars \non two fronts, terrorists continue to plot attacks on our homeland, and \nthe threat of proliferation grows, we cannot afford for our overtaxed \nintelligence agencies to take time off to ponder climate change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Barrasso \namendment.\n  The mission of the CIA's Center for Climate Change and National \nSecurity is fully consistent with that of the intelligence community.\n  Creating this center does not require any additional CIA resources. \nIt rearranges ongoing programs within the CIA so that existing funding \ncan be more prudently spent.\n  The work of this center will not divert resources from other \nmissions. It will not divert case officers or the tasking of \nsatellites.\n  This center will continue in the traditional role of the intelligence \ncommunity to support policymakers on national security issues related \nto climate change.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 2618. I \nsend a modification to the desk for its consideration. It would not \nrequire a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2618, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure sustainment, readiness, and acquisition of \n  ammunition for all United States military services in order to meet \n             long term peacetime and wartime requirements)\n\n       On page 245, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8104. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used by the Secretary of the \n     Army to transfer by sale, lease, loan, or donation \n     government-owned ammunition production equipment or \n     facilities to a private ammunitions manufacturer until 60 \n     days after the Secretary submits a certification to the \n     congressional defense committees that the transfer will not \n     increase the cost of ammunition procurement or negatively \n     impact national security, military readiness, government \n     ammunition production or the United States ammunition \n     production industrial base. The certification shall include, \n     the Secretary of the Army's assessment of the following:\n       (1) A cost-benefit risk analysis for converting government-\n     owned ammunition production equipment or facilities to \n     private ammunition manufacturers, including cost-savings \n     comparisons.\n       (2) A projection of the impact on the ammunition production \n     industrial base in the United States of converting such \n     equipment or facilities to private ammunition manufacturers.\n       (3) A projection of the capability to meet current and \n     future ammunition production requirements by both government-\n     owned and private ammunition manufacturers, as well as a \n     combination of the two sources of production assets.\n       (4) Potential impact on national security and military \n     readiness.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, back in August of 2008 there was a \ndirective that we should try to privatize as many of the Army Corps as \npossible. All this does is say, before any more are privatized, the \nArmy should have to certify that--two things--it would not increase the \ncost or negatively impact national security. It has been cleared on \nboth sides. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2618), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to table the motion to reconsider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2588\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2588, offered by the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Franken.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, when she was 19, Jamie Leigh Jones was \ndrugged, gang-raped, and locked in a shipping container while working \nfor KBR in Iraq. She tried to sue, but KBR pointed to the fine print in \nher contract and forced her into arbitration. Jamie Leigh, who came to \nWashington for this vote, has spent 3 years fighting just to get her \nday in court.\n  This is not just Jamie Leigh's story. It is the story of Mary \nKineston of Ohio, Pamela Jones of Texas, and women around this country.\n  Fifty-eight groups across this country have taken a stand by \nsupporting my amendment. As the National Alliance to End Sexual \nViolence said:\n\n       Asking a victim to enter arbitration with someone who raped \n     her, or with a company that wouldn't protect her, is \n     outrageous.\n\n  I agree. Victims of sexual assault and discrimination at least \ndeserve their day in court. My amendment would make sure all military \ncontractors, not just KBR, give victims that basic right.\n  I urge you to support this amendment.\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in December 2007, I became \ninvolved in an issue that I continue to work on today. The issue is our \ngovernment's failure to prosecute multiple incidents of sexual assault \nagainst American civilians working alongside our military in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  After surviving sometimes brutal attacks, these civilians too often \nfound themselves in a legal blackhole. No one could tell them how to \nreport the crime. No one knew who should investigate, putting precious \ntime and evidence at risk. And perhaps worst of all, no one could \nguarantee their personal safety. Their attackers, meanwhile, usually \nfell outside the Uniform Code of Military Justice, UCMJ, the legal code \nthat our men and women in uniform must obey, and beyond the effective \nreach of our criminal laws.\n  Over the last 2 years, I have been in frequent contact with the \nDepartments of Defense, State, and Justice to ascertain the scope of \nthis problem. Although these agencies have, on the whole, cooperated \nwith my requests, I am not satisfied that we have a full picture of the \nnumber of sexual assaults perpetrated against Americans--contractors \nand military--in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nor do I believe that the \nrespective departments have clear policies in place to address crimes \ncommitted by and against U.S. contractors serving in the war zones.\n  In April 2008, I chaired a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee \nthat included harrowing testimony from Mary Beth Kineston and Dawn \nLeamon, who were former civilian contractors for Kellogg Brown & Root, \nbetter known as KBR, which is a former subsidiary of Halliburton. These \npatriots testified that they were sexually assaulted while working for \nKBR in Iraq. In written testimony submitted to the committee, another \nwoman, Jamie Leigh Jones, wrote of being drugged and gang-raped by her \ncoworkers, also while working for KBR in Iraq. When she reported the \ncrime to her superiors, Ms. Jones was locked in a shipping container. \nNot until her father was able to contact Congressman Ted Poe was Ms. \nJones rescued from captivity.\n  When similar crimes are committed within the United States, on a \npermanent military base, or at one of our embassies overseas, the \nauthority and responsibility to prosecute these crimes is clear. Yet \nbecause these crimes were committed abroad and the victims were \ncivilians, their stories never see the light of day. There is no jury, \nno public record and no transcript.\n  Additionally, in many cases the victims' employer has moved for such \ncases to be heard in private arbitration. At the hearing, Dawn Leamon \nstated that there was an arbitration clause in the employment agreement \nshe signed, and that KBR used that clause to prevent her from seeking \njustice in a court of law. These arbitration clauses, which have become \nall too common, protect the companies from accountability when a crime \noccurs.\n  In response to the hearing and testimony of these courageous women, I \noffered an amendment in mark-up of the 2009 National Defense \nAuthorization Act that later became law, Public Law 110-417. That \namendment required government contractors to report crimes committed by \nor against employees in Iraq or Afghanistan to the appropriate U.S. \ngovernment authorities. The law now requires contractors to have in \nplace resources to assist victims and witnesses of crimes, so that \nthere is a place to go for help. I also attempted to include a \nprovision that would prevent contractors from requiring employees to \nenter into mandatory arbitration contracts.\n  I am pleased that Senator Franken has taken an interest in this \nimportant issue, and I am cosponsoring the Franken amendment, Senate \namendment No. 2588, which denies funding to Department of Defense \ncontractors who continue to use mandatory arbitration clauses to force \nsexual assault victims into arbitration. If adopted, this important \namendment would close the legal loophole that prevents the victims of \nsexual assault from getting the justice they deserve. It is my hope \nthat justice for these women will encourage reform to the entire \nsystem.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in unanimously adopting this \namendment. It is my hope that such a showing of support will urge its \nadoption in the final conference bill. It is imperative that this \nprovision become law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first of all, with regard to this \nlawsuit, although it took some time, the court, the Fifth Circuit, has \nruled that this matter is not arbitrable and this lady is entitled to a \ncourt trial because it goes outside normal employment matters.\n  The Department of Defense let me know to oppose this amendment. There \nare a number of reasons: because it goes far beyond the issue raised by \nmy colleague from Minnesota. It eliminates arbitration for any claim \nunder title VII of the Civil Rights Act, any claim resulting from \nnegligent hiring, negligent supervision or retention of an employee--\nvirtually any employment dispute that is now resolvable under \narbitration, which the U.S. Supreme Court has said is good. Statistics \nshow that employees get final judgment and actually win more cases \nunder arbitration than they do going to the expense of a Federal court \ntrial.\n  I think we should listen to the Department of Defense and vote no on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2596 offered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the January report of the Governmental \nAccountability Office said the Air Force had a couple of major \nchallenges in sustaining the air sovereignty alert capabilities; that \nis, the air structure that keeps our homeland safe.\n  They say the Air Force has not developed plans because it is focused \non other priorities. Retiring these planes would result in a lack of \naircraft to meet the vital ASA mission. And 16 of the 18 sites across \nthe Nation are manned by Air National Guard.\n  Senator Leahy and I, as cochairs, have introduced this amendment, \nwhich is supported by the Guard, which says that we do not retire any \nmore\n\n[[Page S10151]]\n\nfourth-generation aircraft until the Secretary tells the Congress how \nit is going to ensure the capability of the ASA mission.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Bond to temporarily suspend the retirement of tactical \naircraft by the U.S. Air Force.\n  For months, Senator Bond and I as co-chairs of the Senate National \nGuard Caucus have repeatedly questioned Air Force and Department of \nDefense leadership about what it was doing to address a looming \nshortfall in available aircraft for Air National Guard Units. The Air \nForce acknowledges this issue and I know has spent a great deal of time \nstudying options on how to address the shortfall.\n  But, after numerous requests at hearings and briefings for a concrete \nplan, at the start of the fiscal year 2010 fiscal year today, we still \ndo not have a plan.\n  That is why Senator Bond and I have proposed an amendment that \ntemporarily suspends the retirement of tactical aircraft until the \nSecretary of the Air Force provides Congress with a roadmap that \nresolves the looming tactical aircraft shortfall.\n  I hope this amendment prompts the Air Force to conclude its \ndeliberations so that our National Guard and Reserves never get to \npoint where there are units that have the best trained pilots and \ntechnicians in the world but there are no aircraft on the tarmac.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2565 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a simple amendment. I am appreciative of the fact \nthat the National Guard and Army Reserve will get additional funds. All \nthe amendment says is, run that by the Defense Department. They don't \nget to approve it or disapprove it, but they ought to get to see it. \nAnd so should we. Every one of us has National Guard units. Many of us \nhave Army Reserve units. Why should we not have access to information \nas to how they will spend the money? It is about transparency. The \nAmerican people ought to see how they will spend the money. I want to \nsee how it will be spent in Oklahoma. All Senators should be able to \nsee how it is spent. The Secretary of Defense will not be able to stop \nit. It only says he is knowledgeable and responsible, when utilizing \nthose forces overseas, for their deployment and equipment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Coburn amendment, which would impose an \nadditional layer of bureaucracy to the National Guard and Reserve's \nspending decisions, is unnecessary and burdensome. This proposal \nmandates a new component of review and assessment in a process where a \nhigh level of accountability already exists.\n  As is already required by law, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nReserve Affairs sends reports to Congress, including the four \ncommittees which oversee defense spending.\n  These reports explain, in detail, how the various Reserve component \nchiefs have determined to spend the funds provided.\n  The Guard plays a unique role in our country; they defend us here at \nhome and, as has been the case all too often in recent years, they \nfight for us abroad. This special status directly effects the Guard's \nspending priorities, and in recent years they have focused on buying \n``dual use'' equipment that is good for both foreign war and for \ndomestic missions.\n  Based on this reality, it is important that Congress maintain the \nReserve component chief's level of influence so they can spend funds \nbased on their most urgent requirements and unique needs.\n  Finally, creating statutory requirement for an additional ``thorough \nreview,'' involving the Secretary of Defense and other officials, will \nlikely delay access to these funds. At a time when our Guard is called \nupon more frequently at home and is being relied upon so heavily in \nIraq and Afghanistan, to risk underresourcing them and not providing \nthe full support of Congress is irresponsible and negligent.\n  I call upon my colleagues to support the Guard and Reserves and \nreject this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I spoke earlier on this amendment and will \nyield my time to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a pretty simple amendment. It \nprohibits the spending of $165 million on earmarks. We would free up \n$165 million and return it to the general pool of operation and \nmaintenance funding. So it is very clear the administration, on the \noperation and maintenance account, says the bill cuts the O account, \nand this restores some of it.\n  I again would like to point out that operation and maintenance is one \nof the most critical aspects of our defense of this Nation. This \namendment simply prohibits expenditures on any earmarks in the \noperation and maintenance account.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma has proposed an \namendment to strip the Defense bill of the earmarks in the O \nappropriations. As I have said previously, the Defense Subcommittee \nreviews the entire budget and adjusts funds based on that review. Funds \nin the O budget are not reduced with the intent to fund earmarks.\n  Earmarks in O provide additional funds to repair facilities and \nenhance security on our military bases, augment maintenance efforts, \nand equip our military members with personal protection devices.\n  During this debate, the Senator from Oklahoma has spoken about his \nconcerns to provide adequate funding for the National Guard. I share \nthat concern. I would point out that if this amendment is adopted, it \nwould decrease funding in excess of $75 million provided by this \nsubcommittee to National Guard units in nearly 20 States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I hope my colleagues will vote against it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment is supported by Senators \nDorgan and Leahy, the National Guard Association, the U.S. Air Force \nAssociation, and the U.S. Army and Reserve Officers Association.\n  This is a simple amendment. Many of the men and women are coming home \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD and TBI. While the DOD and the \nVeterans' Administration have done a good job in providing services to \nthe men and women, not everybody is accessing the services.\n  This amendment provides $20 million for outreach efforts so that \nState by State we can send people out to talk to them and make sure \nthey understand the facilities that are there and available to them to \nhelp them with PTSD and TBI.\n  My understanding is that this amendment has been accepted. I thank \nthe chairman and the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, there is no opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2601) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Senator Baucus's 11,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can have the attention of the Senate, I \nhad a chance to go to Montana with Senator Baucus. I had never been \nthere. Nevada is a huge State area-wise, but Montana is twice as big as \nNevada. We are the seventh largest State and Montana is the fourth \nlargest. I can remember flying in that airplane and thinking it is \nunbelievable how big that State is. Well, that is kind of like Max \nBaucus. He always does things in the form of a marathon. As I have \nindicated, Montana is the fourth largest State in the Union. It is \ncalled Big Sky Country, and it is. It is such a beautiful State.\n  The first time Max ran statewide, he walked the State of Montana--820 \nmiles he walked. I was always very satisfied that I was a marathoner, \nbut I talked to Baucus, and, of course, he has run more of them than I \nhave and faster than I have. I dropped the subject quickly when I \nlearned he isn't satisfied with a marathon that is 26\\1/4\\ miles. He \nruns 50 miles. That shows the grit this man has. During one of his 50-\nmilers, at 8 miles he fell very hard. He hit his head. There was blood \nall over. But he got up and ran another 42 miles in that race. He had \nhurt himself. A few weeks later, he had to be hospitalized as a result \nof that injury he suffered falling down. So it is pretty easy to \nunderstand why this marathon he has been involved in with health care \nhas been fairly simple compared to some in which he has been involved.\n  I am here to congratulate Max Baucus on the next vote, which will be \nhis 11,000th vote in the Senate. He has had a distinguished career in \nthe House and in the Senate. He has been chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee and is now chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I have such great respect for Senator Baucus. There are a lot of \ncareer highlights, and I could list a lot of them. But for me, the most \nsignificant thing he did is not a bill you will see in the archives; it \nis his having stepped forward at a time when nobody thought it could be \ndone, and in the face such opposition, he helped stop the privatization \nof Social Security. That was done by a lot of people, but it could \nnever have been done without Max Baucus.\n\n[[Page S10153]]\n\n  The people of Montana love Max Baucus because they know he is a \nmarathoner, he is a man of strength and courage, and he understands the \nState of Montana.\n  It is hard for me to articulate the relationship I have with Senator \nBaucus. It is a relationship I prize. He is my friend and my confidant. \nHe has a very tough job running the Finance Committee. Every big issue \nthat comes before the Senate winds up in the Finance Committee because \nwe have to figure out a way to pay for it. He runs that committee with \nan iron hand. We all know how tough he can be on that committee, but we \nalso know how fair he can be. I learned that working on the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. That was a bipartisan piece of legislation. \nAs a result of the work he did on that committee, we have more than 14 \nmillion children now who are able to participate in that program who \nwould not have been able to do so otherwise. It was done on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I join with everybody here in congratulating Max Baucus, who is, to \nme, what a Senator should be. He understands the significance of being \na Senator, the significance of representing his State, and in the \nprocess he has become a great U.S. Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say congratulations from this side of \nthe aisle to the distinguished Senator from Montana on his 11,000th \nvote, which he is about to cast. The majority leader pointed out his \ngreat physical prowess in running these marathons. As he also \nindicated, presiding over the Finance Committee in the last few weeks \nhas certainly qualified him for another long run.\n  For over 30 years, Senator Baucus has represented Montana in the \nState legislature, in the U.S. House of Representatives, and in the \nU.S. Senate. He grew up on his great-grandfather's ranch, and he has \nalways fought hard for the people of the Big Sky State. He has had a \nsimple message: Montana comes first. He has fought to strengthen our \nNation's transportation infrastructure. As we have seen over the past \ncouple of weeks, he has a pretty strong work ethic, which should not \nsurprise any of us for a guy who, as the majority leader pointed out, \nwalked across the entire length of Montana.\n  Senator Baucus has given three decades of dedicated service and has \nkept his pledge to put Montana first. I join the majority leader in \ncongratulating him on his 11,000th vote.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to add a few comments to those of \nthe majority leader and the Republican leader.\n  I say to Max Baucus, congratulations on your 11,000th vote. You have \ndone such a great job over the many years you have served the people of \nthe great State of Montana--me being one of those.\n  I give Max a bad time, saying when he came to the Senate, I was just \na child. Well, when he came to the Senate, he was just a child too. I \nhave a lot of respect for this man.\n  Folks say Max is a lucky guy, and he is. But he creates that luck \nwith hard work. He works very hard not only for the people of Montana \nbut for this Nation.\n  I thank you, Max. Congratulations, and all the best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as the Member of the Senate who has \nworked closely with Senator Baucus over the last 10 years--either he \nhas been chairman of the committee or I have been--I congratulate him \non this 11,000th vote. But more important, I thank him for the close \nworking relationship we have had, which I think people back home in our \nrespective States probably don't observe, which is that there is a \ngreat deal of bipartisanship that goes on in Congress. I think Senator \nBaucus and I have established a close working relationship that refutes \nthat everything in Washington is political. I thank him for that close \nworking relationship and, more importantly, I thank him for putting up \nwith a lot of problems I have created for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very honored by all the comments of \nthe majority leader, who is a good friend; Senator McConnell; my good \nfriend Jon Tester; and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. I am also \nhonored to have served in this body.\n  Everyone here cares a lot about public service and about people. We \nare all here because we care. I very much appreciate working with all \nof you. There are a lot of characters here, different personalities. \nThe bottom line is that everybody is here for their State and the \nNation.\n  I feel as if I am the luckiest guy in the world. I think this is the \nbest job one could have. I have 900,000 of the world's greatest bosses, \nthe people of Montana. They are terrific and wonderful. I am just a \nhired hand working for them.\n  Combined with all of you and all the staff here, you are all people \nhere who care about our great country. I thank you very much. I could \nnot be more touched and appreciative. Thank you.\n  (Applause.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2580\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2580 to be offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment numbered \n2580.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike amounts available for procurement of C-17 aircraft \n in excess of the amount requested by the President in the budget for \n                           fiscal year 2010)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  The amount appropriated by title III under the \n     heading ``Aircraft Procurement, Air Force'' is hereby reduced \n     by $2,500,000,000, the amount equal to the amount by which \n     the amount available under that heading for the procurement \n     of C-17 aircraft exceeds the amount requested by the \n     President in the budget for the Department of Defense for \n     fiscal year 2010 for the procurement of such aircraft.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, President Eisenhower warned us about the \nmilitary-industrial complex. Well, we don't have to worry about the \nmilitary anymore; it is now just the industrial complex and the \nlobbyists.\n  This amendment strikes the $2.5 billion for 10 C-17 aircraft. Again, \nit used to be the military-industrial complex; now it is the industrial \ncomplex. The President, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, the Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Air Force, the \ncommander of U.S. Transportation Command, and the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees have all \nagreed with the Secretary of Defense, who says that the ``205 C-17s in \nthe force and on order, together with the existing fleet of C-5 \naircraft, are sufficient to meet the Department's future airlift \nneeds--even under the most stressing situations.''\n  Mr. President, the spending goes on, the beat goes on, and at some \ntime the American people are going to say ``enough.''\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it may feel like Ground Hog Day for some of \nus. We soundly defeated a similar amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Arizona last week, by a vote of 34-64. The reasons are clear, and \nhave remained unchanged.\n  The C-17 has proven its worth to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nto our taxpayers that foot the bill, and to the workers that labor day \nin and day out to provide our military with these critical planes. Our \nneed for these planes is not shrinking--in fact, it is growing. Since \nthe last formal assessment of our military's airlift requirements 4 \nyears ago, our forces have been expanded by 92,000 troops. Our overseas \ncommitments have dramatically increased, resulting in many C-17s flying \nnearly double the flight hours that were planned for. Why? Because the \nC-17 is the most versatile and capable airlift plane in our arsenal.\n  Despite these facts, the Senator from Arizona insists that we extend \nthe life\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\nof our 40-year-old C-5 fleet, at a high cost to our taxpayer. Over the \nadministration's objections, he coauthorized a bill recently that was \napproved by this body that actually prohibits the military from \nretiring C-5s. According to the Air Force, the C-5B has already reached \n147 percent of planned life expectancy. This is a fleet we must begin \nto replace.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating amendment No. 2580, for \nthe sake of our troops, our taxpayers, and America's workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment which \nseeks to eliminate funding on the C-17. I am certain the Senate is \naware that Vice Chairman Cochran and I proposed and the committee \nunanimously accepted our recommendation to reallocate $2.5 billion to \nprocure 10 additional C-17s.\n  Last week, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to defeat the Senator's \namendment which would have deleted funding for the C-17 program. I \nbelieve the sense of the Senate is very clear. Continuing with the C-17 \nprogram is a high priority. It is a critical national security enabler, \nproviding the airlift our forces need for today's fight and for years \nto come.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2580.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2623, to be offered by the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the McCain amendment rests on the \nassumption that congressional earmarks are for special treatment in \nawarding these contracts. But DOD's own inspector general concluded \nthat the Department conducts identical oversight on earmarks and items \nfunded in the President's budget. The McCain amendment also eliminates \nsmall business set-asides for earmarks. These set-asides benefit \nminority-owned, women-owned, disabled-veteran-owned businesses.\n  My amendment applies competitive contracting to earmarks for for-\nprofit entities on the same basis as items in the President's budget, \nand protects funding for small businesses. The items funded by Congress \nor the President ought to be awarded using the same rules of the road.\n  I urge Senators to support my amendment.\n  The amendment is No. 2623. I call that up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2623.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the side-by-side here is to basically \nneuter the intent of my amendment, which calls for competition for \nearmarks that are intended for for-profit companies. That is all it is, \npure and simple. It is very well known how jealously the appropriators \nguard their earmarking, pork-barreling projects. My amendment, which is \na side-by-side, would say we just put earmarks up for competition. The \namendment of Senator Inouye will gut that provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask for a voice vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to oppose amendment No. \n2560 offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  This amendment would require all congressionally directed spending \nitems to be competed but would allow items requested by the President \nto be executed with limited or no competition.\n  In practice, this amendment would create separate acquisition \ncriteria for items funded in the bill. It does not allow for \ntraditional exceptions to the competitive process for such programs as \nsmall business set-asides, socially and disadvantaged firms, or women-\nowned businesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the McCain amendment purports to save tax \ndollars by requiring competition for earmarks for all businesses. \nHowever, it should be noted that if this amendment passes, small \nbusinesses would have to be competed against the big companies; women \nbusinesses will have to be competed; business by small Indian \ncompanies, Native Americans, will have to be competed, and disabled \nveterans. We have a choice here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2560) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2583\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is amendment No. 2583 from \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2583.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2583\n\n   (Purpose: To strike funding for the MARIAH Hypersonic Wind Tunnel \n                          Development Program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) MARIAH Hypersonic Wind Tunnel Development \n     Program.--The amount appropriated by title IV under the \n     heading ``Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Army'' \n     is hereby reduced by $9,500,000, with the amount of the \n     reduction to be allocated to amounts available for the MARIAH \n     Hypersonic Wind Tunnel Development Program.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this would strike an unrequested $9.5 \nmillion earmark for a hypersonic wind tunnel research project called \nMARIAH. It is up to now some $90 million has been spent; nothing to \nshow for it.\n  It is an Army program and here is what the Army says:\n\n       There are no current operational requirements for a \n     hypersonic missile program within the Army. No Army missions \n     currently require flight technologies. The Army does not have \n     the need for a hypersonic wind tunnel.\n\n  It is hard to be more clear than that. So let's have the pork \nbarrelers vote for it again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, the Air Force Material Command said last \nyear that:\n\n       Hypersonic military and commercial flight vehicles, \n     including space asset vehicles, global research, and missile \n     defense systems, are envisioned future needs.\n\n  We are talking about the future, we are not talking about the past. \nThe United States lacks capability to adequately test hypersonic \npropulsion. The MARIAH Project will fix that gap in research and \ndevelopment.\n  Russia, China, and others are aggressively developing a new type of \nmissile that is believed to be too fast for the U.S. missile defense. \nIndia and Russia have a joint venture engaged in laboratory testing of \nsupersonic cruise missiles capable of speeds beyond Mach V.\n  The fact is, folks, we need to look at the future. We need to look at \nwhat is going to happen in the next 5 or 10 years. MARIAH is about \nseeing a potential threat to our national defense that is on the \nhorizon and finding a way to defeat it.\n  I would encourage you to vote against the McCain amendment. It is \nvital to our national security to defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL.

We will now proceed to 2 minutes equally \ndivided on the Lieberman amendment, No. 2616, as modified.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on behalf of my cosponsor, Senator \nSessions, I want to speak briefly on the amendment, and then we will \nwithdraw our request for a rollcall. The chairman and ranking member \nhave agreed to accept the amendment on a voice vote.\n  To put this as simplistically and briefly as I can, as we all know, \nthe administration has decided to terminate the ground-based midcourse \nballistic missile defense system that was to go in Poland and the Czech \nRepublic and substitute for it the so-called SM-3 system, an \nalternative system, to provide defense from missiles that are of short \nand medium range that would be fired from Iran, to protect our allies \nin Europe and the Middle East. Senator Sessions and I have been \nconcerned that in\n\n[[Page S10156]]\n\ndoing so, we have put ourselves in a position where we do not have the \nguarantee of an adequate defense for that day and the next decade when \nIran will have completed its development of a long-range missile, an \nintercontinental ballistic missile that it could fire at the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The time of the \nSenator has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, you were too happy telling me that. I \nask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Bottom line, we have developed a ground-based intercepter that was to \ngo in Poland. We have it. It is ready to be tested. The alternative the \nadministration is proposing to give the United States of America, our \nhomeland, protection from a missile fired from Iran is basically on \npaper. If it is fully developed, it will give us protection.\n  But Senator Sessions and I offer this amendment to make sure we set \nmoney aside so we continue to test the ground-based intercepter as a \nhedge against a failure of this alternative system, to be ready to \nprotect the United States of America. That is why we offer this \namendment, why I thank the leadership of the committee for being \nwilling to accept it, and why I hope it will remain in conference when \nthe bill returns to the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of Senator \nLieberman's and Senator Sessions' amendment No. 2616 which will provide \n$151 million for the research and development of the two-stage ground-\nbased interceptor missile.\n  I have always believed in having a plan B. Throughout my life I have \nlearned the colloquial wisdom found in the saying ``do not put all your \neggs in one basket'' has great merit.\n  In fact, in its most simplistic form, our Nation's strategic \ndeterrent has been based upon the principle that you always need a \nbackup plan. Specifically, for over 45 years our Nation's ultimate \nsecurity guarantee for ourselves and our allies has been our Nation's \nnuclear triad composed of intercontinental ballistic missiles, bombers \nand submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles. The idea \nwas simple: If one leg of our defense system was knocked out or somehow \nrendered inoperable, the two other legs would maintain a more then \ncredible deterrent.\n  Times have changed. But the continuing need for the triad was \nrecently reaffirmed by Dr. James Schlesinger who was one of the \nprincipal members of the recently published final report of the \nCongressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States.\n  However, the events of September 11 only underscored a new threat \nphenomena that is referred to in military circles as the asymmetric \nthreat. Simply put, an asymmetric threat is the tactics which are used \nby our new adversaries, such as terrorists and rogue regimes, to \ncounterbalance our Nation's traditional strengths in conventional \nwarfare. The example which is seared in the mind of each American was \nthe hijacking and crashing of civilian airliners on September 11.\n  Asymmetric threats are not just limited to terrorist activity and \nthose nations which support it. It is also found in those nations which \nare developing ever more sophisticated ballistic missiles and even the \nultimate weapon, the nuclear bomb.\n  But the asymmetric threat that I wish to discuss today is Iran's \nballistic missile program. Though the President argues the Iranians are \na decade away from deploying an intercontinental ballistic missile, \nthis was not what our military experts were telling us just a few \nmonths ago. Specifically, the Air Force's National Air and Space \nIntelligence Center published an unclassified version of its Ballistic \nand Cruise Missile Threat report in April 2009--just 5 months ago--that \n``Iran has an ambitious ballistic missile and space launch development \nprograms and, with sufficient foreign assistance, Iran could develop \nand test an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile capable of reaching the \nUnited States by 2015.''\n  The report goes on to say ``in late 2008 and early 2009 it launched \nthe Safir, a multi-stage space launch vehicle, that can serve as a test \nbed for long-range ballistic missile technologies. The [Iranian] 2009 \ntest successfully placed a satellite in orbit.''\n  These conclusions are supported by the testimony of General Craddock, \nwho while still Commander of U.S. European Command stated this March \nthat ``Iran already possesses ballistic missiles that can reach parts \nof Europe and is developing missiles that can reach most of Europe . . \n. By 2015 Iran may also deploy an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile \ncapable of reaching all of Europe and parts of the U.S.''\n  These are serious assessments and no doubt the President has good \nreason to believe the threat has changed and therefore made the \ndecision to drop plans to deploy our ground-based midcourse \ninterceptor, called GBI, to Europe. However, I am also mindful of the \npoint the distinguished Senator from Connecticut made when he \nintroduced his amendment. He astutely reminded the Senate that in 1998 \nthe North Koreans tested their long range Taepodong missile just 7 days \nafter our intelligence community concluded that North Korea was 3 years \naway from having that capability.\n  Which brings us back to the question: should we have a plan B?\n  We did until 2 weeks ago.\n  That plan B was to deploy a European-based GBI system to intercept \nintercontinental ballistic missiles fired from the Middle East at the \nUnited States and our European allies. According to the Bush \nadministration this system was scheduled to be completed by 2013--2 \nyears before our intelligence estimates, until recently, believed Iran \nwould have an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n  However, under the new strategy, which relies on the continued \ndevelopment of the SM-3 missile, we and our allies must wait until 2018 \nto have a similar capability as planned by the previous administration \nand offered by the GBI in 2013. We also must remember the 2018 SM-3 \ndeployment date can only be reached if everything goes according to \nplan--an all too rare occurrence in modern weapons development.\n  Not much of a plan B when one remembers that Iran has received \nextensive outside assistance in developing their ballistic missiles. \nFor example, the National Intelligence Center concluded the Iranian \nShahab-3, which has a range of 1,200 miles is based on the North Korean \nNo Dong missile. In addition, Anthony Cordesman and Martin Kleiber in \ntheir 2007 book titled ``Iran's Military Forces and Warfighting \nCapabilities'' wrote that as early as October 1997 ``Russia began \ntraining Iranian engineers on missile production for the Shahab-3.'' \nThe authors also pointed out that allegations have been made that \nvarious Chinese companies had assisted in Shahab-3s final development.\n  This, of course, begs the question what other outside assistance \ncould the Iranians receive which could speed their development of an \nintercontinental ballistic missile?\n  That is why Senator Lieberman and Senator Sessions' amendment is so \nimportant. It provides us with a plan B. It continues the deployment of \na two-stage GBI. This is not a pie-in-the-sky plan. Our Nation has \nalready deployed a three-stage GBI in Alaska and California and until \n10 months ago the Department of Defense believed the two-stage system \ncould be deployed by 2013.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the Lieberman-Sessions \namendment to provide funding for a plan B which could provide us with \ncapabilities to intercept Middle East ICBMs launched against our \ninterests and allies years before the President's plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  If all time is yielded back, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2616), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared by both \nsides. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2605) was agreed to.\n\n\n                             HMMWV Funding\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage my colleague, Senator \nInouye, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, in a colloquy.\n  I would first like to thank Senator Inouye and Senator Cochran for \ntheir hard work in developing the fiscal year 2010 Department of \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  As the chairman knows, the budget amendment submitted by the White \nHouse in August 2009 reduced the proposed spending for high mobility \nmultipurpose wheeled vehicle, HMMWV, from the initial request level by \n$375 million, leaving less than $1.2 billion in the program in fiscal \nyear 2010. This year's reduction is in addition to a $162 million \nreduction taken in the fiscal year 2009 supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  HMMWVs provide enhanced protection for our troops and are much more \nmobile and versatile than older models of the vehicle. There are still \nextensive requirements for HMMWVs throughout all the Services because \nthe vehicle operates as a platform for numerous systems that perform \nmultiple missions.\n  The National Guard still has a majority of the older HMMWVs that \ncannot meet current military, homeland security, or State disaster \nmissions. Recently, the Adjutants General reported that by fiscal year \n2011, 63 percent of their HMMWV fleet will be over 20 years old.\n  These critical military vehicles also provide high-paying \nmanufacturing jobs in the heart of the Midwest. The HMMWV supports over \n1,600 suppliers across 40 States--the majority of which are located in \nIllinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. These are skilled automotive \nworkers and suppliers that have faced serious job losses over the last \n2 years.\n  I am concerned that repeated funding reductions could erode the \nmanufacturing base for this critical military vehicle and adversely \naffect our country's manufacturing capacity.\n  I would encourage the chairman to closely consider this situation as \nwe move to a conference committee with the House.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I fully understand the Senator's concerns and support \nfunding to meet our Nation's requirements for the HMMWV fleet. The \nHMMWV has proven its value over the years deployed in combat, in \ntraining at home and in homeland defense missions. I can assure you \nthat we will carefully consider these factors as the fiscal year 2010 \nbill is completed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to address the growing \ninterest in the Army's recent contract award to the Oshkosh Corporation \nfor the family of medium tactical vehicles, which is currently being \nreviewed by the Government Accountability Office, GAO. A number of my \ncolleagues in Congress have expressed their concern about the contract. \nThey have registered their concern and desire for greater oversight on \nthe floor of the Senate, as well as with the Department of Defense and \nGAO.\n  I have long called for greater congressional oversight of the defense \nacquisitions process. Our acquisitions process is broken and costs are \nspiraling out of control. This has undermined our ability to provide \nthe equipment our troops need when they need it. We must have full and \nfair competition in order to contain costs and ensure proper \nperformance of defense contractors. To this end, I was a strong \nsupporter of enacting the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act \nearlier this year.\n  However, I am concerned about the manner and timing of my colleagues' \nstatements on this issue. The GAO is currently conducting an \nindependent review of the contract. Congress should not be doing \nanything to foreclose or prejudice the GAO process, which would both \nundermine the GAO's independence and set a bad precedent for future \nprotests. I am afraid that some of the public statements that have been \nmade during the ongoing review, as well as letters to the GAO, may \nexceed Congress' proper role and could have the effect of undermining \nGAO's independence.\n  I, for one, am delighted that a company in my home State with a \nstrong track record of providing vehicles to the military was awarded \nthe contract. Wisconsinites take justifiable pride in the high-quality \ntrucks and other products that Oshkosh Corporation designs and builds. \nI understand that some Members of Congress would have preferred a \ndifferent outcome, and I respect that. But we must all recognize that \nthe needs of the men and women of our armed services come first. The \nArmed Forces are best equipped to make decisions about their \nacquisition needs, as they have the expertise and experience needed to \nmake decisions about the equipment needs of our troops. We should not \ntry to substitute our judgments for those of experts in our military \nand at the GAO. I strongly urge my colleagues to refrain from passing \njudgment on the contract until we all have the opportunity to review \nthe GAO's expert analysis. There should not be any room for politics in \nthe acquisition process--our goal is to get the best product for the \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss a \nvery important amendment that was adopted by the Senate. This \namendment, which I was proud to cosponsor, expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the joint surveillance target attack radar system, known as \nJoint STARS, is one of the most effective and heavily tasked \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets in our Air Force. \nThese aircraft provide critical imagery of tens of thousands of square \nmiles to our troops every day, helping to protect the lives of our \ntroops who are protecting our country so bravely overseas.\n  The Joint STARS fleet, although only 17 aircraft in size, has \ndemonstrated immeasurable success in Iraq and Afghanistan. So far, they \nhave flown over 55,000 combat hours, tracking the location and movement \nof enemy troops and discovering hundreds of improvised explosive \ndevices. These aircraft consistently provide our troops on the ground \nwith critical intelligence that helps them prepare for their missions \nin enemy territory.\n  The Joint STARS fleet has been protecting our troops for decades, and \nwith that service has incurred expected wear and tear. With no aircraft \nbeing designed to replace them, it is absolutely critical that we \nprovide the military with the funds they need to keep up with their \nheavy deployment cycles. These aircraft are in dire need\n\n[[Page S10158]]\n\nof new engines, which are now more than 40 years old. Failure to do so \nwill cost the taxpayer billions of dollars in maintenance and operating \ncosts. According to Air Force estimates, however, replacing the engines \nwill pay for itself within 8 years. This is the only sensible solution.\n  Workers in Norwalk, CT, have been working on the radar for this \naircraft for years. This unique technology provides overall images of \nthe battle space, ensuring our troops receive the most complete and \naccurate intelligence possible, from camouflaged insurgent camps and \nenemy vehicles to incoming cruise missiles. It is an incredible product \nwhich lends itself to some of the most industrious and dedicated \nworkers in the field. There are hundreds of workers across the country \nlike those in Norwalk that labor day in and day out to ensure that the \nJoint STARS fleet is able to continue to protect our brave men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  Our troops cannot afford a lapse in the critical surveillance \ncapability provided by our Joint STARS fleet. Our warfighters depend on \nthis cutting edge technology every day, and we must ensure that we do \nnot deny our troops the intelligence they need to successfully and \nsafely execute their missions overseas.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of H.R. \n3326, the fiscal year 2010 Defense appropriations bill.\n  The legislation before us will fund critical priorities in the \nDepartment of Defense designed to protect our Nation from current \nthreats and develop cutting-edge warfighting technologies for the \nfuture. It will provide the essential resources, equipment, and support \nfor the nearly 200,000 military servicemembers now serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. And it will fund more than $89 million in projects to \ncreate jobs in Nevada and help support Nevada's role in keeping our \ncountry safe.\n  During the course of the Senate's debate on this bill, we considered \nan amendment relating to U.S. operations in Afghanistan. The Obama \nadministration is currently in the midst of an extremely important \nexamination of our strategy in Afghanistan.\n  Getting that strategy right is critical. To make sure we have the \nright strategy, the President has rightly undertaken consultation with \na wide range of military, civilian, and intelligence community \nofficials, as well as with Members of Congress.\n  The amendment we considered was an attempt to cut off those \ndiscussions, to force the President's hand. This amendment was the \nwrong approach at the wrong time.\n  Right now, there are hundreds of servicemembers and civilians from my \nhome State of Nevada serving courageously in Afghanistan. Many of these \ntroops have been serving in the military since the 9-11 terrorist \nattacks on our country.\n  These troops have, in many cases, been deployed overseas three, four, \nand sometimes even five times. That means 3, 4, or more years that they \nhave been taken away from their families and loved ones during the last \n8 years.\n  Many of them have missed the births of their children, or their \nbabies' first steps. Many have been pulled away from their civilian \njobs, and have taken significant pay cuts. And, unfortunately, many \ntroops in Nevada and throughout the Nation have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in service to our mission in Afghanistan.\n  We owe these troops a rigorous and deliberative debate on the proper \nstrategy in Afghanistan. We owe it to them to make sure we have \nexamined every possible option so that we give them the best chance to \nwin and to stay out of harm's way. To rush this process is to undercut \nthe President's effort to protect to accomplish these objectives.\n  Unfortunately, a number of Senators have sought to do just that. They \nhave called for military commanders to begin testifying about our \nstrategy in Afghanistan before that strategy is set by the Commander in \nChief. That approach is a blatant attempt to force the President's \nhand, to circumvent the rigorous, deliberative review that a decision \nof this magnitude demands. It would short-circuit the administration's \nreview of our Afghanistan strategy, and it would cut many important \nvoices out of the picture. Our troops and our national security cannot \nafford such a rash step.\n  Now, I agree that GEN Stanley McChrystal, Commander of U.S. Forces in \nAfghanistan, should testify to Congress about our strategy in \nAfghanistan. But, as his counterpart, GEN David Petraeus, did when this \nChamber was debating our strategy in Iraq, I think it is appropriate \nfor that testimony to occur after his Commander in Chief has arrived at \na decision.\n  In the last several days, I have had the opportunity to meet with \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates and GEN Jim Jones, the President's \nNational Security Adviser, to discuss the questions now facing us on \nAfghanistan. Today, I had the opportunity, along with several of my \ncolleagues, to have a similar discussion with the President.\n  All three of these officials have made it clear that they are in the \nmidst of a vigorous, healthy discussion in which military commanders, \nincluding General Petraeus and General McChrystal, have key seats at \nthe table. They are working through a disciplined and deliberate \nprocess in which they will determine a strategy that will best advance \nthe security interests of the United States and then determine the \nappropriate resources to allocate in implementing that strategy.\n  Talking about changes in troop levels or other resources before we \nhave worked out the right strategy simply puts the cart before the \nhorse. Now is not the time for such an irresponsible approach. Now is \nthe time for all the best minds on the administration's national \nsecurity team to take a hard look at our policy in Afghanistan, free \nfrom politics and other interference, and make sure we get it right.\n  As we move forward in this debate, my foremost priority will be to \nensure that, no matter what the strategy, the brave servicemembers from \nNevada and across America who are serving in Afghanistan have the \nsupport and resources they need to succeed in their mission. I am \nconfident that the bill before us today takes an important step toward \nthat goal, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to welcome home the Delaware \nArmy National Guard's 261st Tactical Signal Brigade from Iraq. Just \nover 1 year ago, on October 2, 2008, 110 brave citizen soldiers left \nbehind their families in the great State of Delaware to serve their \ncountry with honor in Iraq. Nearly 1 year later, on September 30, 2009, \nall 110 members of the 261st returned to Dover Air Force Base to be \nreunited with their families.\n  I am extremely grateful that each member of the 261st has returned \nsafely to Delaware, and I offer them my deep gratitude, respect, and \nadmiration for their service. I know I speak for all Delawareans when I \nsay just how proud I am of their contributions in Iraq.\n  Under the leadership of the Delaware National Guard Adjutant General, \nMAJ Frank Vavala, the 261st trained for 1 year to prepare for their \ndeployment. Under the command of BG Scott Chambers they served with \ndistinction at Camp Victory in Baghdad. I had the privilege of visiting \nthe 261st in April and then again in September during my two visits to \nIraq. I was enormously proud to see the tremendous work they were \ndoing, and I was honored to spend time with these inspiring men and \nwomen from Delaware during my trip.\n  While in Iraq, the 261st played a critical role as the first National \nGuard unit to maintain and administer the communications network. They \nalso ran the Baghdad Signal University which trained Iraqi nationals in \ncommunication skills. During each visit, I was impressed by the \nprofessionalism and the commitment of the members of the 261st. There \nis no question that their unique skill set and unwavering commitment \ngreatly contributed to the U.S. mission in Iraq.\n  As we see progress in infrastructure and security in Iraq, it is due \nin no small part to the efforts of the Delaware National Guard. The \n261st worked tirelessly to share their expertise and knowledge with \ntheir Iraqi counterparts, expanding the Iraqi capacity to manage their \nown communications networks and systems. The families of the Guard can \nrest assured knowing that despite their great sacrifice over the past \nyear and the difficulties they faced in being separated from their \nloved ones, the 261st left Iraq a better place because of their \nservice.\n  The volunteers of the 261st are part of a proud and historic Delaware \ntradition. For decades, the 261st has served its country with great \nhonor and distinction. Since 1924, it has deployed in times of need, \nfirst, as a part of the Delaware National Guard 261st Coast Artillery \nBattalion. The 261st was activated again on January 27, 1941, to \nparticipate in coastal defense operations during World War II. Since \nthen, the mission of the 261st has evolved from defending the homeland \nto a broader global mission, such as that in Iraq, where it played a \nvital role in building communication networks and engaging in \ninformation operations.\n  We are truly fortunate as a nation to have so many dedicated \nvolunteers willing to serve on the front lines defending our interests \nat home and abroad, and I am especially grateful to the 261st for their \ncourageous service.\n  As we welcome this unit home from Delaware, we also send our prayers \nfor the safe return of all of those serving our Nation in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10159-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nSouthgate Volunteer Fire Department for celebrating its centennial this \nOctober. Over the past century, the Southgate Volunteer Fire Department \nhas been comprised of numerous men and women who have dedicated their \nlives to serving their community.\n  The record of excellence at Southgate Volunteer Fire Department has \nmade all the difference in reaching this glorious milestone in its \nhistory. This year the department won its fourth State Fire Olympics; \nthe State Fire Olympics hosts five different events that test the \nskills of firefighters and explorer teams. The extensive 3,000 hours \nspent per year on training has no doubt aided in the achievements made \nby the department. The Southgate Volunteer Fire Department became one \nof the first in Campbell County to develop life squads, and it has also \nbeen recognized as one of the first in Kentucky to carry semiautomatic \nexternal defibrillators.\n  The strength and dedication of the department was tested at the \nBeverly Hills Supper Club Fire in May of 1977, surely the most \ndifficult day in its 100-year history. The Southgate Volunteer Fire \nDepartment was at the forefront of that firefighting effort and was \naided by another 500 firefighters from throughout Kentucky, Indiana, \nand Ohio. There were 3,800 people rescued from the fire that night, all \nbecause of the valor and dedication shown by these heroes.\n  The department's current chief, John Beatsch, manages 75 members of \nthe Southgate Volunteer Fire Department, and in 2004 and 2005 the \nSouthgate Volunteer Fire Department boasted the induction of two \nprevious chiefs into the Firefighters Hall of Fame. Early in 2000, with \naid from the State, the department received a new administration \noffice, sleeping quarters, new dress and work uniforms, and two new \nsemiautomatic external defibrillators.\n  The foundation of excellence that began 100 years ago still stands as \nthe volunteers of this brave department have dedicated their lives to \nprotecting their community. I am confident that tradition will continue \non for the next 100 years as the Southgate Volunteer Fire Department \ncontinues to keep the people of Kentucky safe. I know all of my \ncolleagues join me in congratulating the men and women of the Southgate \nVolunteer Fire Department for their service and their heroism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10159-5", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10159-S10160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Captain Benjamin Sklaver\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the memory of U.S. Army Reserve CAPT Benjamin Sklaver, who was \nkilled on October 2, when his patrol came under attack in Muscheh, \nAfghanistan. He was 32 years old.\n  Captain Sklaver personified the values and qualities of a U.S. Army \nofficer, and dedicated himself to improving his country and helping \nthose most in need, both in uniform and as a private citizen. As a U.S. \nArmy captain, Benjamin Sklaver distinguished himself as a capable and \ntalented leader; and as an employee of the CDC and\n\n[[Page S10160]]\n\nFEMA Captain Sklaver used his skills to help Americans prepare for and \nrecover from disaster.\n  Perhaps the most inspiring chapter of his life came after a 2007 \ndeployment to the Horn of Africa, where Captain Sklaver saw how hard it \nwas for rural Ugandan villagers to obtain clean drinking water. Upon \nhis return to the United States, Sklaver helped found the ClearWater \nInitiative to help bring access to clean water to war torn regions. In \njust 2 short years, Captain Sklaver's Initiative provided access to \nclean, potable water to over 6,500 people in Africa, where his charity \nwork earned him the nickname ``Moses Ben.''\n  Guided by a deep sense of patriotism and the Jewish principle of \nTikkun Olam, or fixing the world, Captain Sklaver touched the lives of \nthousands, and his contributions to his country and to those he helped \naround the world will not soon be forgotten.\n  All of us owe a deep debt of gratitude to Captain Sklaver and his \nfamily. I extend my deepest condolences to Captain Sklaver's parents \nGary and Laura, his brother Samuel, his sister Anna, his fiance Beth \nSegaloff, and to all those who knew and loved him.\n\n\n                       Specialist Justin Pellerin\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to express my sympathy over the \nloss of U.S. Army SPC Justin Pellerin, a 21-year-old resident of \nConcord, NH. Specialist Pellerin was killed while conducting combat \noperations in Wardak Province, Afghanistan, on August 20, 2009.\n  Specialist Pellerin was a 2006 graduate of Concord High School. It \nwas there that he met Chelsea, his high school sweetheart, whom he \nwould later marry. The two had just celebrated their 1-year anniversary \nand were looking forward to Justin returning home in December. His \nfamily and friends remember him for his sharp sense of humor, his \nselflessness, and his love of American muscle cars.\n  Justin joined the Army because he wanted to make a difference in the \nworld. For his distinguished service, he has been awarded the Bronze \nStar, the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal and the National Defense \nService Medal. He, and the thousands of brave men and women of the U.S. \nArmed Forces, represent the best in America's long tradition of duty, \nsacrifice, and service.\n  In addition to his wife Chelsea, Specialist Pellerin is survived by \nhis mother Melissa; stepfather Dale Farmer; and two younger sisters \nMolly and Hannah. He will be missed dearly by all those who knew him.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring the life \nof SPC Justin Pellerin.\n\n\n                        SERGEANT MICHAEL C. ROY\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. \nMarine SGT Michael C. Roy, a 25-year-old native of Manchester, NH. \nSergeant Roy was killed while conducting combat operations in Nimroz \nprovince, Afghanistan on July 8, 2009.\n  Sergeant Roy was born in Manchester and grew up in nearby Candia \nbefore moving with his family to Florida. He served two tours of duty \nin Iraq prior to his deployment to Afghanistan as a member of the 3rd \nMarine Special Operations Battalion based out of Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  According to his family, Sergeant Roy loved being a marine. He joined \nthe service at the age of 18 and often shared his stories of the Corps \nwith his siblings. He was also a devoted husband and the loving father \nof three young children.\n  No words can diminish the loss of this devoted husband and father, \nbut I hope Sergeant Roy's family will take solace in the deep gratitude \nand appreciation all Americans share in honoring his service to our \ncountry. He, and the thousands of brave men and women of the U.S. Armed \nForces serving today, deserve America's highest honor and recognition.\n  In addition to his wife Amy and their children Olivia, Michael, and \nLandon, Sergeant Roy is survived by his father Michael and his mother \nLisa Hickey.

Over those 50 years, this organization \nhas grown to be one of the most significant gateways between secondary \neducation and postsecondary education or the workplace. I would like to \ndescribe some of the work this institution has done that has made such \nan important contribution to American education.\n  ACT was founded in 1959 at a meeting in Iowa's old State capitol on \nthe campus of the University of Iowa. It was launched as the ``American \nCollege Testing Program'' by a University of Iowa professor of \neducation, the University of Iowa's registrar, and representatives of \n16 Midwestern States. Their goal was to help all students who wanted to \nattend college find a good match for their interests and abilities, and \nto help colleges and universities place students into appropriate \nfreshmen-level classes. On November 7, 1959, about 75,000 students took \nthe first ACT assessment. By comparison, in the high school graduating \nclass of 2009, nearly 1.5 million students, or 45 percent of all high \nschool graduates in the Nation, took the ACT.\n  ACT now conducts extensive research designed to help provide \nsolutions to the complex education problems facing the country. For \nexample, they have developed a college and career readiness system for \nstudents beginning in middle school and continuing through \npostsecondary education. This system helps students stay on target to \nbe ready to succeed in college or workforce training programs when they \ngraduate high school, without the need for remedial classes, and \nmonitors their success in postsecondary education once they leave high \nschool.\n  ACT is also involved in researching solutions to the Nation's \nworkforce challenges. For example, ACT developed the National Career \nReadiness Certificate to confirm that individuals have essential core \nemployability skills. ACT is one of several partners in a new \nmanufacturing skills certification system designed by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Nation's largest industrial trade \norganization.\n  Furthermore, ACT is helping build bridges between the United States \nand many other nations to help them improve their education and \nworkforce systems, and to help people in other nations learn the \nEnglish language. For example, through local partners, ACT conducts a \n9-month pre-university program in 13 countries, including China, Korea, \nIndonesia, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, and countries \nin South America. There are more than 30 teaching centers in China. \nThis program prepares students to study in English-language \nuniversities in the United States and elsewhere. This contributes to \nour country's standing in the world. As a nation, we benefit from \nforeign talent, as students from other nations come to study in U.S. \ncolleges and universities. Individuals who return to their home \ncountries in turn go back with a greater understanding of Americans and \nour way of life.\n  I offer my congratulations to the over 1,000 Iowa residents employed \nwith ACT, its directors, and other members of its State organizations \non their 50-year history of helping people achieve education and \nworkplace success. I look forward to following their accomplishments \nfor many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10160-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10160-S10161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO DRS.

Smith--two New \nJersey scientists who have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, an \nincredible honor for extraordinary ingenuity in their chosen field and \nfitting recognition for their outstanding achievement.\n  They have expanded the boundaries of science, inventing something \nmost of us do not understand, but which has made a difference in our \nlives. The invention of the charged-coupled device,\n\n[[Page S10161]]\n\nor CCD, now found in digital cameras used around the world and by NASA \non the ground-breaking Hubble Telescope, revolutionized how we take \nphotographs and manipulate and transfer images. It has given us insight \ninto the deepest reaches of space, allowed us to see remarkable images \nthat have made us better understand the vastness and magnificence of \nthe universe, and better appreciate the simple images in our family \nphotographs.\n  Dr. Boyle and Dr. Smith have done their work at Bell Laboratories in \nMurray Hill, NJ, and now have enriched our State's proud tradition of \nscientific breakthrough and innovation. We can add their names to those \nof Albert Einstein, who made Princeton his base, and Thomas Edison, who \nfrom his Garden State lab invented the incandescent light bulb that lit \nthe world. The names of Boyle and Smith will now loom large in the \nscientific history of our State. They have made New Jersey and the \nUnited States very proud.\n  Their contribution to science is in their remarkable discovery, but \ntheir legacy to mankind is in their pioneering spirit, their ingenuity, \nand their quest to look further, think harder, and discover what no one \nelse could.\n  I join with my colleagues and with every American in thanking them \nfor making our lives better and wish them the very best as they \ncontinue careers that brought them to this place, having earned a Nobel \nPrize almost 40 years to the day after they began their long scientific \njourney.\n  To Dr. Boyle and Dr. Smith, we offer the best wishes of a grateful \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10161-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. NAVAL WAR COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I recognize the 125th anniversary of \nthe U.S. Naval War College. The Naval War College was established on \nOctober 6, 1884, in Newport, RI, to provide an advanced course of \nprofessional study for both military officers and civilians. The \nmission has evolved over the years to include developing strategic and \noperational leaders, helping the Chief of Naval Operations define the \nfuture Navy, strengthening maritime security cooperation, and \nsupporting combat readiness.\n  The Naval War College serves as a center for research that develops \nadvanced strategic, warfighting, and campaign concepts for future \ndeployment of maritime, joint, and combined forces. The Naval War \nCollege works closely with the Navy Warfare Development Command and the \nChief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group in developing and \nanalyzing national security issues. Through the Naval Command College \nand the Naval Staff College, naval officers from around the world come \nto prepare for high command responsibilities, and to learn about the \nU.S. Navy's methods, practice, and doctrine. The Naval War College also \nsupports combat readiness among the U.S. Navy's commanders through \noperational planning, analysis, and war-gaming to respond to changing \noperational environments.\n  Some of our Nation's greatest military and civilian leaders have \nattended the Naval War College including FADM Chester Nimitz, the \nCommander of the Pacific Fleet during World War II; RADM Alan Shepard, \nthe first American in space; Ambassador Christopher Hill, the current \nU.S. Ambassador to Iraq; and Marine Corps GEN James Cartwright, the \ncurrent Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Indeed, even our \ntwo combatant commanders in Afghanistan and Iraq, GEN Stanley \nMcChrystal and GEN Raymond Odierno, are both graduates of the Naval War \nCollege.\n  I am proud of the talented men and women who have made the Naval War \nCollege the strong institution it is today, and I congratulate the \nentire Naval War College community on this important milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10161-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           RECOGNIZING THE SIMPSON COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to honor the Simpson County \nHistorical Society on their 50th anniversary. This is a momentous \noccasion for their organization and for the residents of South Central \nKentucky.\n  The society was founded in 1959 by 37 dedicated citizens who wished \nto preserve the historical treasures in the area. The society began by \nmeeting in a private home, and soon the group acquired a small \ncollection of books that were maintained at the local library.\n  As the society expanded, its leaders were able to persuade the \ngovernment of Simpson County to provide the old jail and jailer's house \nas the permanent facility of the society. This decision led to the \ncreation of the Simpson County Archives and Museum that now holds \nthousands of books, city and county records, and other historical \nmaterials of significant value. The society has also continued the \nupkeep of the old jail and jailer's house, which date from the early \n1800s.\n  However, the Simpson County Historical Society has not simply \ncollected and preserved documents. They have also been active in \nencouraging the study of local history and culture. The society has \nprovided scholarships for students wishing to pursue the study of \nhistory and maintained numerous historical markers in Simpson County. \nFinally, the group has positively impacted the economy by supporting \ntourist visits to historic sites throughout Kentucky.\n  I am very proud of the service the Simpson County Historical Society \nhas provided to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Their dedication through \nthese many years makes them one of the oldest historical societies in \nthe State, and I am confident that their impact will continue for many \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10161-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dr. Michael \nPosner, Professor Emeritus, Department of Psychology, Institute of \nCognitive and Decision Sciences at the University of Oregon. Dr. \nMichael Posner is one of nine scientists awarded the prestigious \nNational Medal of Science award this year by President Barack Obama.\n  Dr. Posner received both his bachelor's degree in physics and his \nmaster's degree in psychology from the University of Washington in \nSeattle. In 1962, he received his doctorate in psychology from the \nUniversity of Michigan. Dr. Posner joined the University of Oregon in \n1965 and ever since has inspired students and impressed colleagues.\n  Dr. Posner is a pioneer in the field of cognitive science and \nneuroscience and has won numerous awards. His groundbreaking research \non brain development and how the brain processes thought have been \nrecognized by numerous organizations such as the American Psychological \nAssociation and the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Dr. Posner has dedicated his career to researching how the brain \nfunctions and most recently, on attentional networks in children and \ninfants. He has made invaluable contributions to our medical, \neducational, and scientific communities. I am proud that Dr. Posner's \ngroundbreaking work at the University of Oregon is helping put our \nState at the forefront of developing innovative medical and scientific \nresearch.\n  I encourage my fellow Oregonians to join me in celebrating the \ninnovative spirit of Dr. Posner and the entire University of Oregon \nfaculty for their cutting-edge scientific research. Generations of \nAmericans are in debt to Dr. Posner for his breakthroughs that have \nimproved their lives. This recognition for his lifetime of achievement \nis well-earned. I hope that his example can inspire our State and our \nNation to renew our commitment to education and academic \nresearch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10161-4", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10161-5", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10161-S10162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S10162]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10162-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 2:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1687.

A bill to amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n1967 to clarify the appropriate standard of proof; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator Harkin \nand other Senators to introduce the Protecting Older Workers Against \nDiscrimination Act. This legislation overturns the Supreme Court's \nrecent decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, a divided case that \nthwarted congressional intent, overturned well-established precedent, \nand delivered a major blow to the ability of older workers to fight age \ndiscrimination. This bill restores the intent of Congress to fully \nempower older workers to seek redress in the courts, and to root out \ndiscrimination in the workplace.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for introducing this bill, and I commend him \nfor his commitment and dedication over the years to ensure that the \npromise of equal opportunity is real for all Americans. We worked hard \nlast year to enact into law the ADA Amendments Act, which clarified and \nexpanded protections for Americans with disabilities. I am proud to \nonce again join as an original cosponsor of legislation that will do \nthe same for older workers. I am also pleased that Congressman George \nMiller will introduce a companion bill in the House today as well.\n  This Nation was founded on the promise of equal rights and equal \nopportunity for all Americans. To fulfill this promise, Congress has \nenacted a full slate of civil rights laws to eliminate discrimination \nin society, including the workplace. In 1967, Congress passed the Age \nDiscrimination and Employment Act, ADEA, with the intent to extend \nprotections against workplace discrimination to older workers. We \nstrengthened those protections in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which \nthe Senate passed by a vote of 93 to 5.\n  Last month, Senators from both sides of the aisle joined together to \ncelebrate the life and accomplishments of Senator Ted Kennedy, whose \nlegacy includes authoring and shepherding these civil rights measures \ninto law. As Senator Kennedy said, ``It has long been clear that \neffective enforcement of civil rights and fair labor practices is \npossible only if individuals themselves are able to seek relief in \ncourt.''\n  However, contrary to the intent of Congress, the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Gross will make it more difficult for older workers \nvictimized by age discrimination to seek relief in court, and more \ndifficult for those victims who actually get their day in court to \nvindicate their rights.\n  In passing the ADEA, Congress aimed to eliminate all forms of age \ndiscrimination in the workplace. Consistent with this goal, courts have \nfor decades interpreted the ADEA to lessen the burdens on older workers \nvictimized by discrimination. Victims of age discrimination were only \nrequired to show that age was a ``motivating factor'' for an employer's \nadverse action, though other factors may have also motivated a \ncompany's firing or termination of an employee.\n  In Gross, however, the Supreme Court misinterpreted the intent of \nCongress and ignored the longstanding precedent in a way that resulted \nin weakening core civil rights protections for older workers. In a 5-4 \ndecision, a majority of the Court concluded that under the ADEA an \nemployee must now prove that age was the sole cause of an employer's \nadverse action. As a result, despite our intent to provide the same \nprotections for older workers in the ADEA as we provided for racial \nminorities in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, today older \nworkers now have less protection against workplace discrimination.\n  I am concerned that the Gross decision will allow employers to \ndiscriminate on the basis of age with impunity as long as it is paired \nwith other reasons. Older workers, who make up nearly 50 percent of the \nAmerican workforce, are particularly vulnerable to suffering \ndiscrimination during difficult economic times. In fact, age \ndiscrimination complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission jumped nearly 30 percent between 2007 and 2008. I fear that \nin the wake of Gross few, if any, of these victims will attain justice.\n  The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, which is \nmodeled on the Civil Rights Act of 1991, would reverse the Gross \ndecision, strengthen the safeguards of the ADEA, and restore \nfundamental fairness. The bill eliminates the high burden of proof that \nvictims of age discrimination must meet after Gross. It clarifies that \nthe standard for proving discrimination under the ADEA and other anti-\ndiscrimination and anti-retaliation laws is the same as the standard \nfor proving race discrimination under Title VII. The bill makes clear \nthat when a litigant shows that age was a motivating factor for an \nadverse employment action, the burden is on the employer to prove it \ncomplied with the law. This bill restores the law to what it was for \ndecades before the Court rewrote the rule.\n  The bill also ensures that all workers will be treated equally in the \nworkplace. Today, some lower courts have already applied Gross to \nweaken the protections in other anti-discrimination statutes. The \nlegislation clarifies that the ``motivating factor'' standard applies \nto all anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation laws, and reflects a \nbroader commitment to address the needs of all persons who suffer \ndiscrimination. It reaffirms that Americans' rights will be honored. It \nalso restores the faith of the public that our civil rights laws are \njust and fair. Those are timeless American values that we can all \nembrace.\n  We have drafted this measure after long and thoughtful consideration \nwith the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a broad coalition of \nhundreds of civil rights and workers' rights organizations. The bill \nalso has the support of AARP, the National Senior Citizens Law Center, \nthe National Women's Law Center and the National Employment Lawyers \nAssociation. Their support gives me confidence that this legislation \nwill improve the lives of all Americans.\n  Time has shown that the ADEA has been one of our Nation's most \neffective tools in combating discrimination. Its continued \neffectiveness is important to ensure that the great progress we have \nmade in widening the doors of opportunity for all Americans continues \nin the future. The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act \nwill restore vital protections that have long secured the promise of \nequal rights and equal opportunity for older workers. I hope all \nSenators will support passing this critical civil rights measure this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/06/senate-section/article/S10164-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10164-S10165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 303--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT OCTOBER \n  17, 1984, THE DATE OF THE RESTORATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF \n FEDERAL RECOGNITION TO THE CONFEDERATED TRIBES OF COOS, LOWER UMPQUA, \n              AND SIUSLAW INDIANS, SHOULD BE MEMORIALIZED\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 304, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 304) commemorating the canonization \n     of Father Damien de Veuster, SS.CC to sainthood.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of this \nresolution commemorating the canonization of Father Damien de Veuster, \nSS.CC, to sainthood.\n  Joseph De Veuster, was born in Tremolo, Belgium, on January 3, 1840. \nAt the age of 19, he entered the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of \nJesus and Mary and took the religious name of Damien.\n  After his brother fell ill, Damien obtained permission from the \nSuperior General to take his place for a mission in the Hawaiian \nIslands, although he was not yet an ordained priest. After a six-month \nboat ride, he arrived in Honolulu on March 19, 1864, and was ordained \nto the priesthood two months later.\n  During this time in Hawaii, an outbreak of Hansens' disease, also \nknown as leprosy, occurred. Patients were sent away to the small island \nof Molokai to prevent the disease from spreading. Several priests took \nturns coming to Molokai to offer spiritual aid for three months at a \ntime, but Damien chose to never leave, instead sacrificing his own life \nfor those with Hansen's disease.\n  He worked tirelessly and continuously to turn this remote island into \na colony of hope. He offered encouragement and spiritual guidance to \nthose who were less able to help themselves. He built houses, chapels \nand hospitals and even built coffins and dug graves for those who lost \nthe fight from Hansen's disease.\n  In 1884, Damien contracted Hansen's disease himself but continued \nworking until months before dying on April 15, 1889. His remains were \nbrought back to Belgium in 1936, and now rest in the crypt of the \nchurch of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts at Louvain, where he \nfirst entered religious life.\n\n[[Page S10167]]\n\n  On April 15, 1969, as a gift from Hawaii, a statue of Father Damien \nand a statue of King Kamehameha I, were unveiled at the Capitol \nRotunda.\n  He was declared Venerable by Pope Paul VI on July 9, 1977, the first \nof three steps that lead to sainthood. On June 4, 1995, Pope John Paul \nII declared him Blessed Damien, and his feast is on May 10, the day he \nentered Molokai.\n  In observance of Father Damien de Veuster, SS.CC., I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution recognizing his canonization to \nsainthood by Pope Benedict XVI on October 11, 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Daniel Akaka be \nadded as a cosponsor to this Resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Inouye in \nsubmitting a resolution commemorating the canonization of Father Joseph \nDamien de Veuster. Father Damien was born in Tremeloo, Belgium, on \nJanuary 3, 1840. He is best known for his tireless efforts to provide \nmaterial and spiritual comforts for leprosy patients at Kalaupapa, \nMolokai, during the latter half of the 19th century. Beloved by the \npeople of Hawaii and the country of his birth, his selfless service to \nmankind serves as a model for all of us.\n  Father Damien arrived in Hawaii in 1864 to join the Sacred Hearts \nMission in Honolulu. After several years of serving isolated \ncommunities on the island of Hawaii, Father Damien became concerned \nthat many of his parishioners that were afflicted by leprosy were \nforced to separate from their families and sent to Kalaupapa, Molokai \nand virtually imprisoned. In 1873, Father Damien's request to reside at \nMolokai and devote his life to serving the people of Kalaupapa was \ngranted.\n  Father Damien's selfless devotion to the patients was evident when in \n1876, he told a U.S. medical inspector, ``This is my work in the world. \nSooner or later I shall become a leper, but may it not be until I have \nexhausted my capabilities for good.'' For 16 years, he labored to bring \nmaterial and spiritual comfort to Kalaupapa's leprosy patients, \nbuilding chapels, water cisterns, and boys and girls homes.\n  On April 15, 1889, Father Damien died of leprosy, at the age of 49. \nWhile his death was a devastating loss, the spiritual foundation that \nhe established for the community of Kalaupapa would forever be \nremembered by the people of Hawaii.\n  Father Damien is a beloved figure in Hawaii's history, and so \nnoteworthy are his deeds that he is one of the two people from Hawaii \nwho are memorialized here in the Capitol, the other being King \nKamehameha, the man who united the Hawaiian Islands. The statue of \nFather Damien stands proudly, as a reminder of his stewardship and love \nfor Kalaupapa.\n  We must take every opportunity to educate our Nation on Father \nDamien's life and the history of Kalaupapa. Out of concern that Father \nDamien's legacy and Kalaupapa's rich history not be forgotten, the \nKalaupapa National Historical Park was established in 1980, with a \nprovision that former leprosy patients may remain as long as they wish.\n  The Holy See ruled in April 2008 that Father Joseph Damien de Veuster \nwas responsible for two miracles and The Congregation of the Causes of \nSaints at the Vatican voted to recommend raising Father Damien to \nsainthood. In February 2009, the Vatican announced that Father Damien \nwould be canonized on October 11, 2009 in ceremonies at the Vatican. It \nwill be my great honor to attend those ceremonies as part of President \nBarack Obama's official delegation. Through this recognition, Father \nDamien and the 8,000 leprosy patients will forever be remembered as a \nlegacy of human spirit and dignity.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
