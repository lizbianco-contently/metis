Madam President, I think everyone will acknowledge the \nlegislatively historic time in which we are now involved. We have tried \nto get to this point with health care legislation for almost 70 years. \nWe are there. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, so that \npeople in the future will not have to file bankruptcy because they get \nsick. That is what happens today. For example, 750,000 people filed \nbankruptcy last year, as I have said here on a number of occasions, and \nalmost 70 percent of those who filed bankruptcy did so because of \nmedical expenses. In addition, 62 percent of those who filed because of \nmedical expenses had insurance. That pretty well says it all.\n  There is not one of us who has gone home in recent months and hasn't \nhad someone come to us in a grocery store or some other public event \nand say: My daughter has diabetes. She is now 23 years old. She goes \noff our insurance. What are we going to do? She can't get insurance.\n  That is going to stop. There is nothing the people of America want \nmore than for us to do something about this. They want us to stop \ngreedy insurance companies from denying health care to the sick and \ntaking away your coverage at the exact time you need it the most. They \nwant us to make it illegal for multibillion-dollar companies to say: I \nam sorry, your high cholesterol is going to prevent us from giving you \nan insurance policy or you were in an accident and badly injured your \nleg a few years ago and we can't give you insurance now or you are too \nold or you have hay fever or you have asthma. We have all heard the \nstories. These insurance companies say: You are on your own. Why? \nBecause they are concerned more about their bottom line than they are \nabout taking care of the American people. I was here a couple days ago \ntalking about an insurance\n\n[[Page S12564]]\n\ncompany that made more than $1 billion in profits last year. Their \nchief executive officer made over $100 million in take-home pay. But \nthey are still out denying coverage to everybody. These companies are \nnot good for the American people.\n  What we want to do is make sure that before people get sick, they get \nthe tests they need before these diseases start. We want women to be \nable to afford screenings that will catch breast cancer.\n  There was an interesting piece, sad though it was, on public radio \nthis morning. African-American women get breast cancer at a much \nearlier age and it is a much more difficult type of breast cancer. That \nis why what Senator Mikulski did was so important. Women can now, no \nmatter their age, have a mammogram to find out if they have breast \ncancer. They need these tests. We need to make sure women are able to \nget Pap smears when they need them and other things that are so \nimportant. Men need to be able to check for prostate cancer, which is \nsomething that has now become fixed on men's minds. It wasn't in the \npast.\n  Seniors want to be able to afford prescription drugs. They want to \nknow their Medicare benefits will be protected.\n  The American people want us to make it possible for everyone to \nafford insurance. They know that until we do, those who do have it will \nkeep paying extra to cover those who don't. They want us to cut the \nwaste and fraud out of the health care system so that everyone can save \nmoney. They want us to make sure they can choose their own \ndoctors, their own hospitals, and a health plan that is right for them. \nThey want us to guarantee they will be able to afford health care even \nif they lose or change jobs.\n\n  That is why we have written a good bill, one that will make it \npossible for every single American to stay in a condition known as \nhealthy. It is a bill that will make health care more affordable and \nhealth insurance companies more accountable, and it will do all this \nwhile reducing the deficit.\n  Yet, while the American people want us to act, our Republican \ncolleagues in the Senate want nothing more than failure. They wanted us \nto do nothing. That is why Republicans have sounded a familiar cry: \nSlow down. Stop everything. Start over.\n  We have seen it again and again. They like to pretend America's \nhealth care crisis isn't a problem, that it can have some little minor \ntweaks here and there and everything will be fine. They choose to \nignore the fact that unfair and unchecked insurance companies are \nforcing the very people these Senators represent to lose their homes, \nfile for bankruptcy, and even die.\n  It amazes me that the Republican leader rejects the suggestion that \nwhat we are doing is truly historic. In fact, the day before yesterday \nhe said it is ``an act of total arrogance.'' That is a direct quote. I \nam confident history, ironically enough, will prove the Republican \nleader wrong. This is indeed historic, as I began my conversation \ntoday. I am not afraid to say it is. But instead of joining us on the \nright side of history, all Republicans can come up with is this: Slow \ndown. Stop everything. Let's start over.\n  If you think you have heard these same excuses before, you are right. \nWhen this country belatedly recognized the wrongs of slavery, there \nwere those who dug in their heels and said: Slow down. It is too early. \nLet's wait. Things aren't bad enough.\n  When women spoke up for the right to speak up, when they wanted the \nvote, some insisted they simply slow down. There will be a better day \nto do that. Today isn't quite right.\n  When this body was on the verge of guaranteeing equal civil rights to \neveryone regardless of the color of their skin, some Senators resorted \nto the same filibuster threats we hear today.\n  And more recently, when Chairman Chris Dodd of Connecticut, one of \nthe people who will go down in history as the chief champion of the \nbill before us, said that Americans should be able to take care of \ntheir families without fear of losing their jobs, we heard the same old \nexcuses. Through 7 years of fighting and more than one Presidential \nveto, it was slow down, stop everything, start over.\n  History is repeating itself before our eyes. There are now those who \ndon't think it is the right time to reform health care. If not now, \nwhen? But in reality for many who feel that way, there will be never a \ngood time to reform health care.\n  I know this country has never had a place for those who hope for \nfailure. So here is whom I would rather listen to: the men and women in \nNevada who write me every day. They are hardworking people, lots of \ndifferent letters, really sad letters, people who play by the rules and \ndon't understand why their health insurance system doesn't do the same. \nThey write from the heart. Here are a couple of stories I will talk \nabout.\n  A woman named Lisa lives in Gardnerville, NV, a beautiful place \nbeneath the Sierra Nevada mountains, with her two daughters, both of \nwhom are in elementary school. The youngest suffers seizures. Her \nteachers think she has a learning disability. Because of her family \nhistory, Lisa, the girl's mom, is at a high risk for cervical cancer. \nAlthough she is supposed to get an exam every 3 months, now she is not \nable to get one at all. When Lisa lost her job, she lost her health \ncoverage. Now both she and her daughter miss out on the tests and \npreventative medicine that could keep them healthy. Her long letter to \nme ended with a simple plea. It wasn't slow down, stop everything, \nstart over. It was:\n\n       We want to go to the doctor.\n\n  Another person named Braden lives in Sparks, NV. Sparks and Reno are \nside by side. Braden works a 55-hour week to support his family, but it \njust barely pays the bills. It is not enough for him to get health \ninsurance. He had to go to the emergency room--$12,000. It was the only \nplace he could go. He is a brave man, though, and in his letter he \ndoesn't dread the debt he carries, and he is going to try to pay it. He \ndoesn't grumble about how hard he works. But he does have one fear. It \nis not that the Senate is doing its job. His fear is, as he wrote:\n\n       If I was seriously sick or injured, I would lose it all.\n\n  That is the way many Americans feel.\n  Michelle is a 60-year-old woman who lives in Fallon, NV, about 60 \nmiles southeast of Reno. Like so many in my State, she moved to Nevada \nin the last 10 years. Like so many Americans who keep our economy \ngoing, she is self-employed and has to find her own health insurance. \nShe has two choices. One is a company that won't give her a policy \nbecause she takes three prescription medications. The insurance company \nonly allows you to have two. So Michelle is stuck buying insurance from \nthe other company, the only one that will sell her a plan. When \nMichelle moved to Nevada a few years ago, she picked the cheapest plan. \nNow, within 3 years, her plan costs three times as much. That doesn't \ninclude dental and vision insurance. It is very minimal, a bare-bones \npolicy. She is waiting. But she is not waiting for us to scrap \neverything we have done over the past year and start over. She wrote \nthat she is ``waiting to be old enough for Medicare to afford the \nsurgery my doctor says I need, as I know with my current policy it will \ncost more than I can afford.''\n  These are real stories about real people: Braden, Michelle, and Lisa. \nThey are not written with a political objective in mind. I do not know \nwhether they are Democrats or Republicans or Independents. They have no \naxe to grind, as far as any partisan view. They are written by people \nwho know that insurance companies discriminate against their \npolicyholders, and it is not based, I repeat, on party affiliation. \nThey are written by citizens who know this crisis is bigger than \npolitics, and too big to ignore. They are written by Americans who want \nto be able to live a healthy life without going broke.\n  My colleagues on the other side want us to slow down, stop \neverything, and start over. But the course of our country goes in a \ndifferent direction, only one direction. We move forward. We make \nprogress. And when history calls on its leaders to make life better for \nits citizens, we answer, and we act. And we are going to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/07/senate-section/article/S12564-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12564-S12565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3590, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3590) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to modify the first-time home buyers credit in the case \n     of members of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal \n     employees, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 2786, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Pryor amendment No. 2939 (to amendment No. 2786), to \n     require the Secretary to provide information regarding \n     enrollee satisfaction with qualified health plans offered \n     through an Exchange through the Internet portal.\n       Gregg amendment No. 2942 (to amendment No. 2786), to \n     prevent Medicare from being raided for new entitlements and \n     to use Medicare savings to save Medicare.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 2 hours of controlled debate, equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first \n30 minutes, and the majority controlling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, on our Republican time, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, will lead a colloquy and ask for permission \nto do that concerning Senator Gregg's amendment, which we will be \ntalking about this afternoon, making clear to the American people this \nDemocratic health care bill is being paid for by treating Medicare as a \npiggy bank. But before we do that, I want to say, briefly, something in \nresponse to the majority leader's comments.\n  He, the majority leader, said the Republican leader had said the \nDemocratic health care bill is arrogant. It is historic in its \narrogance. It is arrogant to think we are wise enough--we 100 Senators \nare wise enough--in a 2,000-page bill to completely turn upside down \nand change a comprehensive health care system that affects nearly 300 \nmillion Americans and 16 or 17 percent of our economy all at once.\n  It is arrogant for us to imagine the American people are not wise \nenough to see through the proposals in this bill, which are to transfer \nmillions more Americans into a Medicaid Program for low-income people \nthat none of us would want our families or members a part of.\n  It is arrogant for us, then, to send a significant bill for much of \nthat to State governments. We make the decision, we send them the bill, \nand do that in a way that in my State, at least, will cause devastating \ncuts in higher education or huge tax increases.\n  It is arrogant to say to the American people it is an $800 billion \nbill, which, as the Senator from New Hampshire has pointed out, when it \nis fully implemented it is a $2.5 trillion bill--half paid for by \nMedicare cuts.\n  It is arrogant to say we have balanced our budget when in fact--when \nin fact--we leave outside the budget what it costs to pay doctors to \nwork in the government-run program we have today.\n  So this legislation is historic. It is historic in its arrogance, and \nthe American people will see through it and will expect us to, instead, \nidentify a clear goal. That is the Republican proposal, which is, to \nreduce costs and go step by step in a direction toward those goals--\nwhether we are allowing small businesses to put together their plans so \nthey can serve more people at a lower cost, whether it is creating \ncompetition by allowing people to buy insurance across State lines, \nwhether it is reducing junk lawsuits against doctors. We have made all \nthese proposals.\n  We are ready not to roll a wheelbarrow of our own in here with a \ncomprehensive proposal. But day after day, we have said, instead of \nincreasing costs, raising taxes, allowing premiums to go up, shifting \ncosts to States, and dumping low-income Americans into Medicaid, let's \nreduce costs. We have a plan to do that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2942\n\n  I wish to recognize the Senator from Wyoming so we can have a \ndiscussion about Senator Gregg's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleagues to discuss the issues at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I have been looking at the bill, which, to me, is \ngoing to hurt the health care system of our country. I am a physician. \nI have taken care of families in Wyoming for 25 years, and I think if \nwe want to get costs under control, if we want to help families all \nacross America who are struggling with their health care needs, we need \nto focus on an amendment that is before us today, brought forward by \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I ask my friend and colleague from New Hampshire, is it not true that \nthe numbers we are looking at are underreported? It is going to be much \nmore expensive and the cuts are going to come from our seniors, those \nwho are vulnerable, those who depend on Medicare for their health care, \nand we need to make sure and promise the American people we will be \nprotecting those folks who depend on Medicare for their health care?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming, first as a doctor \nand second as a Senator, raises a very important point; that is, this \nis the largest expansion in government in the history of the \ngovernment.\n  Let's begin right there. This is a $2.5 trillion expansion in the \nsize of the government when fully implemented. It is a massive growth \nin the size of government. Most of that growth comes from the expansion \nof government in two areas: the expansion and creation of a brand new \nentitlement and the expansion of Medicaid, as was alluded to by the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  How is that paid for? How is this huge explosion in the size of \ngovernment paid for? Well, a large part of that is paid for by reducing \nthe amount of money in Medicare that is paid in Medicare, paid to \nMedicare providers, and available to Medicare recipients--$460 billion \nin the first 10 years, $1 trillion in the first 10 years when the \nprogram is fully implemented--that would start in about 5 years--\nand then $3 trillion, by our estimates, which are linear--I suspect it \nwill be more--over the first 20 years of this bill, a $3 trillion \nreduction in Medicare benefits.\n\n  We heard arguments from the other side of the aisle: Oh, that is not \ngoing to affect benefits. Well, that is not believable. We know that. \nYou cannot reduce Medicare provider payments and you cannot cut \nMedicare Advantage--with the total cuts of both, combined, by $460 \nbillion in the first 5 years, $1 trillion in the first 10 years of full \nimplementation, and $3 trillion over 20 years--and not affect benefits.\n  This is money that is going to have the most significant impact we \nhave ever had occur on our seniors in their Medicare system. This is a \nfundamental change in the way Medicare services are paid for and the \ninsurance that is available to seniors under Medicare, specifically, \nMedicare Advantage. We know for a fact that of the 11 million people on \nMedicare Advantage, approximately a fourth of them will lose it--simply \nlose their Medicare Advantage.\n  We also know hospital groups, provider groups, and doctors are all \ngoing to see significant reductions in their reimbursement rates, which \nmeans, of course, they are going to change the way in which they treat \nseniors. Seniors are going to find it harder to find a doctor. They are \ngoing to find it harder to get a procedure they need because the \nreimbursement rate for those procedures is going to have been cut so \nsignificantly under this bill.\n  Home health care will be dramatically impacted. The Senator from \nWyoming had a very interesting letter from his home health care groups \nin Wyoming which related to what percentage of home health care \nagencies would actually close. It was a very high percentage under this \nproposal.\n  There is no question but that Medicare is in dire straights. It is \nheaded toward insolvency. It goes into a negative cashflow in 2 years, \nand it has $35 trillion of obligations, which we have no idea how we \nare going to pay for. So Medicare reform is important. I have supported \nit. I proposed it. In fact, I proposed it a number of times and have \nalways been voted against by colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  But any reform to Medicare of this size--$464 billion in the first 10 \nyears,\n\n[[Page S12566]]\n\n$1 trillion in the first 10 years of implementation, $3 trillion over \n20 years--anything that is going to cut Medicare by those numbers, \nthose savings, if they are going to occur, those reductions, should go \nto benefit making Medicare more solvent.\n  But what happens under this bill? That is not what they are used for. \nThose dollars which come right out of the pockets of seniors and the \npeople who provide seniors care--and the ability of seniors to purchase \ninsurance under Medicare Advantage--those dollars go from the senior \nover to creating these new major programs, these new entitlements.\n  In fact, I was looking at the bill. It appears to me some of those \ndollars go to get votes around here. Isn't that incredible? They are \ngoing to take money away from seniors and use it for the purposes of \ngetting votes to pass this bill by sending money back to States of \nMembers who are maybe a little wavery on whether they want to vote for \nthis bill. That is where some of the money goes.\n  But most of the money goes to creating these new entitlements for \npeople who may be deserving--probably are deserving--but who are not \nseniors and who probably have not paid into the insurance fund that \nseniors have paid into for all their life and, thus, it is totally \ninappropriate to do that.\n  I have an amendment. It is very simple. It is an amendment that has \nreal teeth, and it is actually an amendment that follows up on a number \nof statements from the other side of the aisle and some sense of the \nSenate which were voted 100 to nothing around here, which says, simply: \nNo Medicare money can be used to fund other parts of this bill. To the \nextent Medicare savings occur under this bill as a result of cuts to \nhome health care, cuts to Medicare Advantage, cuts to provider groups, \nthose dollars will not be taken and used to fund new entitlements for \npeople who are not on Medicare, not seniors. They will not be taken to \nfund the purchase of votes around here to pass this bill.\n  This is a real amendment. A lot of stuff happening around here is \nsense of the Senate, where people stand up and say: Oh, I am for that. \nExactly, what I said--let's do a sense of the Senate to that effect.\n  But sense of the Senate has no impact at all. It is political cover. \nThis is not political cover. This amendment, as structured, will \nactually accomplish the goal of not allowing Medicare dollars--cuts in \nMedicare that are $464 billion over the first 10 years, $1 trillion \nover the fully implemented period, and $3 trillion over the 20-year \nperiod--it will not allow any of those dollars to be used to fund new \nprograms in this bill which do not benefit seniors.\n  That is all it says. It seems to me, if you are going to stand up for \nresponsible action in the area of Medicare, if you are going to live by \nthe sense of the Senate that have been voted for here, if you are going \nto stand behind your word, as the sense of the Senate have called for--\nthat Medicare money be used for Medicare, and that Medicare money not \nbe used to fund things that are extraneous to Medicare; Medicare cuts \nsavings--then you have to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. THUNE. It strikes me that the Senator's amendment is very \nstraightforward, very simple, and very clear; that is, any savings that \ncome out of the Medicare Program cannot be used to fund a new \nentitlement program.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is not related to seniors.\n  Mr. THUNE. Correct. And it seems to me, at least, that the amendment \ngets at what some on the other side have argued, with their amendments, \nthey are trying to accomplish.\n  Could the Senator from New Hampshire describe how the effect, the \nlegal effect, of his amendment differs from, say, for example, the \nvotes we have had, where it was a 100-to-0 vote the other day on a \nBennet amendment, what the impact the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire would be relative to some of the previous votes we have had, \nwhich it appears to me, at least, were completely meaningless, sort of \ncover votes, to try and give people on the other side the opportunity \nto say: We voted to protect Medicare, when, in fact, they did not?\n  How is the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire distinguished \nfrom those that have been voted on previously?\n  Mr. GREGG. My amendment has force of law behind it. Those amendments \nhave no force of law behind them. They have no effect at all. As the \nSenator said: a political statement, an editorial comment, a piece of \npaper written.\n  This amendment, if passed, will have the force of law behind it. It \nwill very simply be structured in a way that the money cannot be taken \nout of Medicare if it is going to be used for the purposes of funding \nthe new programs in this bill, whether they are the entitlement \nprograms for people who are not seniors--this expansion of \nentitlements--or whether they are for the purposes of getting votes to \npass the bill.\n  Mr. THUNE. So if a Senator on either side of the aisle, a Republican \non this side or a Democrat, was serious about protecting Medicare, \nensuring that Medicare's solvency is protected and that these funds are \nnot going to be reallocated to create some new entitlement program or \nspend money on some new, clearly, $2\\1/2\\ trillion expansion of \ngovernment, which we know is going to require enormous amounts of \nrevenue which seems to me has to come from somewhere--what the \nSenator's amendment would do is simply force the other side to put up \nor shut up with regard to this argument they have, which is that they \nare, in fact, supporting Medicare; the Senator's amendment would \nessentially say, very clearly, in a very straightforward way, that \nfunds that come in out of savings from Medicare have to be retained in \nthe Medicare account.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. This is the first and only vote Members \non this floor are going to have, to make it clear that Medicare dollars \nwill not be used for something other than Medicare.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Would the Senator yield for an additional question? \nThe language in the Bennet amendment that passed 100 to nothing the \nother day said, basically, that Medicare savings should benefit the \nMedicare Program and Medicare beneficiaries. That sounds pretty \nstraightforward, pretty simple. But let me ask the Senator--\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, if I might interject, anybody who voted for that \namendment would want to vote for mine.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That is exactly the question I am getting to. Is there \nanything in the Bennet amendment that removes the expenditure of almost \n$500 billion from Medicare in the base Reid bill that would require the \nrestoration of those cuts to benefit Medicare versus using it as a fund \nto pay for the underlying Reid bill?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, the Senator has made an excellent point. \nEssentially, the Bennet amendment has no teeth. It has no substance. It \nhas no substantive effect. It is just a statement of purpose. If the \nstatement of purpose is as recited by the Senator from Georgia, then \nyou would need to vote for this amendment, my amendment, if you voted \nfor the Bennet amendment, because my amendment has the teeth that backs \nup the language of the Bennet amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If I understand what the Senator is saying in his \namendment, he is requiring the Office of Management and Budget as well \nas CMS to certify to Congress, basically, that the savings that are \nreferred to in the Bennet amendment as well as in the Senator's \namendment are, in fact, being used to fund Medicare benefits versus \nbeing used to fund other benefits outside Medicare until such time as \nMedicare is fully funded.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is, essentially, what it says. It says that CMS and \nOMB must certify that no funds are being used to fund the additional \nactivity in this bill that does not relate to Medicare with Medicare \nfunds. It does not say that Medicare savings--it agrees to the Medicare \nsavings, but those Medicare savings would basically be used for the \npurposes of reducing the outyear fiscal imbalance of Medicare. So it \ndoesn't contest the Medicare savings as proposed in this bill, although \nthose amendments have--we have already voted on a number of those. We \nvoted on home health care, and we voted on Medicare Advantage, but to \nthe extent those savings go in, those\n\n[[Page S12567]]\n\ncuts in Medicare benefits go in, the revenues from those cuts cannot be \nused and spent to expand the size of government in someplace else which \nhas nothing to do with senior citizens.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. If I could follow up with a question for my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, because as I read the Sunday New York Times, it \nsaid the Bennet amendment was completely meaningless--the Bennet \namendment was meaningless. It also goes on to say, Senator McCain is \ntrying to keep that $500 billion in Medicare, but the Democrats are \ntrying to take that money out of Medicare and, as the article says, the \neditorial says: to finance coverage for uninsured Americans but not \npeople on Medicare.\n  So it does seem the New York Times, at least in this segment, got it \nright: that the Bennet amendment that our colleague from Georgia \nreferred to is meaningless, that the cuts are going to come out of \npeople who depend upon Medicare for their health care to pay for a \nwhole new government program and not to focus on Medicare.\n  Well, don't we owe it to these seniors who have paid into the program \nand who have been promised the program to save that program first?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, the Senator from Wyoming is absolutely right. I \nthink the New York Times got it right. It is a convergence of two \nunique forces of nature that the Republican minority in the Senate and \nthe New York Times should be on the exact same page on this issue and \nboth be right.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if the Senator from New Hampshire would \ncharacterize this discussion this way: As I am hearing it, in order to \nprotect Medicare, a Senator wouldn't want to say: I voted for the \nBennet amendment and then I voted against the Gregg amendment, when it \ncounted.\n  Mr. GREGG. It would be virtually impossible to make that argument \nwith a straight face.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I have a question for my Senate colleague from South \nDakota who is here. We heard the majority leader, Senator Reid, come to \nthe floor a few minutes ago and talk about how this bill is going to \nget premiums under control, keep the cost--for people who have \ninsurance, keep their premiums under control. I saw a chart from the \nSenator from South Dakota yesterday that said for 90 percent of \nAmericans, those who have insurance now, if we did nothing and did not \npass this bill, the premiums would be lower than if we do pass this \nbill; that passing this bill actually will raise premiums, in spite of \nthe fact the President of the United States promised, while \ncampaigning, that he would lower the cost of premiums for American \nfamilies by $2,500.\n  I would ask my colleague from South Dakota, isn't it true that if \nthis bill passes, Americans wanting--feeling they have been promised \nthat premiums would be reduced, are they not doomed to disappointment?\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Wyoming is correct. This is where the \nreal rub in this bill comes into play because what we were told and the \npromises that were made--of course, many promises were made throughout \nthe course of the campaign, many of which will never be realized with \nthis legislation. There was also a promise made that taxes wouldn't go \nup for people making less than $250,000 a year--not payroll taxes, not \nincome taxes, not any kind of taxes. In fact, we now know that 38 \npercent of the people who make under $200,000 a year are going to see \ntheir taxes go up under this legislation. So promises made during a \ncampaign season tend not to necessarily be adhered to when it comes \ntime to legislate and actually follow through, and I think that is \nclearly the case here.\n  With regard to the question of the Senator from Wyoming, the whole \npurpose of health care reform, at least as I understand it--and I \nthink, for the most part, as the people of South Dakota whom I \nrepresent understand it--is to lower cost. Because everybody \ncomplains--the thing you hear the most when you go home--and the \nSenator from Georgia is here. If you go to Georgia, Wyoming, South \nDakota, I think the sentiment you hear most frequently from people in \nour States is: Do something about the cost of health care. We have \nthese year-over-year, double-digit increases or increases that are \ntwice the rate of inflation, and we are dealing with this. Small \nbusinesses are dealing with it. More and more people--families are \nstruggling with the high cost of health care. Nobody argues that. We \nall, basically, accept the premise that health care costs have been \ngoing up and health care reform ought to be focused directly on trying \nto get those costs under control.\n\n  The irony in all this is, after cutting $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare \nin the first 10 years, and if you go into the fully implemented time \nperiod it is about $1 trillion, and $\\1/2\\ trillion in tax increases, \nwhat happens with premiums? Well, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, 90 percent of Americans would be the same or worse off. In \nother words, 90 percent of Americans would see no improvement in their \nhealth insurance premiums. In fact, if you buy in a small group market, \nif you buy in a large group market, your premiums go up by about 6 \npercent a year, year over year. In fact, a family of four--let's put it \nin a perspective that an American family can understand. If you are a \nfamily of four--this is according to the Congressional Budget Office--\nthat is paying $13,900 for insurance this year and you are getting your \ninsurance in a large group market because you work for a large \nemployer, in 2016, your insurance cost is going to be over $20,000 a \nyear. In other words, your insurance is going to go up about--a little \nunder $14,000 to over $20,000 a year in that time period.\n  So what American in their right mind is going to say that is reform? \nI think most Americans are going to say: What are you doing? You are \nspending $2.5 trillion, you are raising my taxes, and cutting my \nparents' or my grandparents' Medicare benefits, for what? So my \npremiums can stay the same or go up? If you buy your insurance in the \nindividual marketplace, your insurance premiums, according, again, to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, are going to go up anywhere from 10 to \n13 percent a year. So you get Medicare cuts, you get tax increases, and \nfor 90 percent of Americans, you stay the same or are worse off. In \nother words, your insurance premiums are now going to be impacted, you \nhave achieved the status quo or, worse yet, your insurance premiums are \ngoing to go up 10 to 13 percent if you are buying in the individual \nmarket. That is according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So I would say to my friend from Wyoming, the point he made is \nexactly right. In doing all this, the exercise ought to be about \nreducing costs. Clearly, that is not the case with this legislation.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Let me address a question to our friend from Wyoming \nwho is a medical doctor, in addition to being an outstanding Senator.\n  What we are being asked to believe from the folks on the other side \nand what the American people are struggling with and having a hard time \nbelieving is, they are saying that even though they are cutting \nMedicare by a total of $450 billion-plus over a 10-year period, \nactually the solvency of Medicare is going to be extended. They expect \nthe American people to believe that somehow.\n  The fact is, we know from the information we received this spring \nfrom the bipartisan Medicare Commission, unless something is done, \nMedicare is going to become insolvent in the year 2017, pure and \nsimple. What we are doing is not taking the savings they are \nproposing--and we don't agree with them, but irrespective of that--\nirrespective of the savings they are saying are going to be achieved, \ninstead of applying that back, we are going to use that to grow the \nsize of government, tie some reimbursement payments to physicians to \nthe Medicare Program, and now we are looking at about a 23-percent \nreduction in payments to physicians as reimbursement under Medicare if \nwe don't take some action next year. When you put all this together, \nthe American people are saying: You have to be kidding me. How in the \nworld are you going to extend the life of Medicare by cutting it by \nalmost $500 billion?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. As my colleague from Georgia knows, there is no way you \ncan save Medicare when you cut that kind of money out of it. How, when \nthey cut physicians' payments by 23 percent, are we going to have \nphysicians going to any of our small communities in South Dakota, in \nGeorgia, in Wyoming, where we have many people\n\n[[Page S12568]]\n\nwho depend on Medicare for their health care? I worry about access to \ncare.\n  Our colleague, Senator Isakson, yesterday talked about home health \ncare and how, for pennies on the dollar, you can help people. It \nprovides a lifeline for people who are homebound. It keeps them out of \nthe hospital, out of the nursing homes. Instead, this Senate, the \nDemocratically led Senate, yesterday voted to cut $42 billion out of \nhome health care, which people in our small communities and in the \nrural areas of our State depend upon. So there is no way this program \ncan stay solvent.\n  It is hard for me to fathom and, clearly, hard for the people of \nWyoming to fathom, how with all this budget trickery it is going to \nwork for people who need to go to see a doctor or to have a home health \ncare provider in many of our rural communities.\n  We all have townhall meetings, and when I go to townhall meetings, \npeople say: Don't cut my Medicare, don't raise my taxes, and don't make \nthings worse for me than they are now.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator will yield, the Senator, of course, is one \nof only two physicians in the Senate and has great experience and great \ndepth on this issue and knows what it is like to serve and provide \nhealth care services to people in rural areas, such Wyoming and South \nDakota and some areas of Georgia.\n  I think it is interesting too--and the Senator from Georgia was here, \nas was I; I don't think the Senator from Wyoming was here at the time. \nBut in 2005, we had a debate about Medicare, and the Senator from New \nHampshire proposed cutting $10 billion in Medicare, taking $10 billion \nover a 5-year period or about $2 billion a year, and paid for it by \nincome testing the Part D benefit that people got. In other words, the \npremiums that are paid, those who are in the higher income categories \nwould have to pay a higher premium for their Part B drug benefit than \nwould those in lower income categories. You would have thought that the \napocalyptic pronouncements and predictions around here about what that \nwas going to do for Medicare: $2 billion a year or $10 billion over 5 \nand you heard the other side describe it as immoral, it was cruel, it \nwas a disaster of monumental proportions. That was some of the \nterminology that was used around here at the time. That was for $10 \nbillion over 5 years, and that basically was to say to people who have \nhigher incomes, the Warren Buffetts of the world ought to pay a little \nbit more for their prescription drug benefit under Medicare than those \nin lower income categories, and people on the other side went nuts \nabout that.\n  Now here we are talking about cutting $465 billion over a 10-year \nperiod, $1 trillion over 10 years, when it is fully implemented, and it \nseems to me, I would say to my colleagues, the other side is going to \nhave a lot of explaining to do to the American people about why $10 \nbillion in reductions was immoral, cruel, and a disaster of monumental \nproportions, but cutting $\\1/2\\ trillion out of home health care and \nnursing homes and hospitals and everything else to pay for an entirely \nnew entitlement program, a $2.5 trillion expansion, somehow makes \nsense.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my \ncolleagues. I think we are hearing around the country that we do need \nhealth care reform. We need to get costs under control. We need to have \npatient-centered reform, not government-centered reform, not insurance-\ncentered reform. We need to not cut Medicare. We need to not raise \ntaxes. We need to not make things worse for the American people.\n  From what I have seen of this bill--and I worked my way all the way \nthrough it--it makes things worse for the American people, not better. \nThis is not the right prescription for health care in America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, I will \ntake a moment to lay out today's program. It has been 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nsince the majority leader moved to proceed to the health care reform \nlegislation. This is the eighth day of debate. The Senate has \nconsidered 16 amendments and motions and conducted 12 rollcall votes.\n  Today, we will debate an amendment by Senator Pryor and, at the same \ntime, an amendment by Senator Gregg to do with spending taking effect. \nThe first 2 hours will be equally divided. The Republicans will control \nthe first 30 minutes and the majority will control the next 30 minutes. \nThere may or may not be a side-by-side amendment to the Gregg \namendment. The Senate will conduct votes on or in relation to the Pryor \nand Gregg amendments this afternoon. We expect at least those votes to \nbegin sometime between 3:15 and 4 p.m. this afternoon.\n  I will take a few moments to discuss the amendment Senator Gregg \noffered yesterday. The Gregg amendment has been billed as protecting \nMedicare. That seems to be the new fashion on the other side of the \naisle--to say that the bill cuts Medicare. Frankly, that is a \nmisleading statement at best, and it is inaccurate, basically. In \nreality, the Gregg amendment is a killer amendment. It is designed to \nprevent health care reform from taking effect. That is the purpose of \nthe Gregg amendment. It is a killer amendment.\n  The amendment has more details to it, but you can get the flavor of \nit from a few excerpts. Let me quote from the amendment.\n  The first subsection of the amendment is entitled ``Ban on New \nSpending Taking Effect.'' You really don't have to go much further to \nget an idea of what the amendment is about. Just focus on that \nstatement in the amendment--a ban on new spending taking effect.\n  Let me quote further from the second subsection:\n\n       . . . the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services are prohibited from implementing \n     the provisions of, and amendments made by, sections 1401, \n     1402, 2001 and 2101. . . .\n\n  What are those sections? The Gregg amendment will stop this spending \nfrom taking effect.\n  Section 1401 is refundable tax credits providing premium assistance \nfor coverage. Those are the tax credits, the tax reductions that help \npeople buy health insurance. The Gregg amendment says we cannot help \npeople buy health insurance, that they can't have those tax credits.\n  The second section is 1402. What is that? It is to reduce cost \nsharing for individuals. That is the part that would make copays and \nother out-of-pocket expenses affordable. The Gregg amendment says: No, \nwe can't have reduced cost sharing for individuals. We have to keep \nthose copays in effect and out-of-pocket expenses high. It would help \npeople with copays and other out-of-pocket expenses.\n  The third section the Gregg amendment would stop is section 2001. It \nis a section that provides Medicaid coverage for the lowest income \npopulation. That is the one that provides expanded Medicaid coverage up \nto 133 percent of poverty. The Gregg amendment says: No, you can't help \npoor people with health care. The Secretary is prohibited from making \nthose payments to Medicaid if that amendment is adopted.\n  The fourth section the Gregg amendment would stop is section 2101. \nSection 2101 is a section that provides additional funding for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Can you believe that? A Senator \ngets up on the floor of the Senate and wants to stop funding to the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program? That is what that section \nprovides.\n  So if you don't like tax reductions to help people buy health \ninsurance, if you don't like making health insurance affordable, if you \ndon't like health care for the lowest income Americans, and if you \ndon't like health care for kids, then the Gregg amendment is for you.\n  The folks on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of time \nthis year talking about Medicare. That is about all I hear from them. \nThey make it sound as if they want to help Medicare. In effect, they \nare hurting it. A lot of folks say they want to help Medicare, and I \nsee the big crocodile tears they shed. I will take a few moments to set \nthe record straight about how the trust fund works. That might help \nthem understand, frankly, why the bill before us--the Reid bill--helps \nMedicare, contrary to protestations of those on the other side.\n  The Medicare trust fund provides hospital insurance for seniors and \nAmericans who are disabled. Working Americans pay into that trust fund \nwhen they pay their payroll taxes.\n\n[[Page S12569]]\n\nWhen a senior has to go to the hospital or a nursing home--there are \nlots of areas where seniors get help--the spending to help pay for that \nhospitalization comes out of the trust fund. The actual sum comes out \nof Medicaid, but some payments come out of the Medicare trust fund, \nsuch as for home health care, et cetera.\n  When payroll tax revenues are greater than the payments for \nhospitalizations, the assets in the Medicare trust fund grow. That is \ngood. On the other hand, when spending for hospital care is greater \nthan payroll tax revenues and interest payments on the trust fund \nassets, then assets in the Medicare trust fund diminish. That is not \ngood.\n  The Actuary for Medicare--the person charged with determining the \nhealth of the Medicare trust fund over at HHS--tells us that if we \ndon't do anything--if this legislation is not passed--then by about \n2017 the Medicare trust fund assets will be exhausted. That is clear. \nThat is definite. That is a fact, and I emphasize the word ``fact.'' I \nam just being honest, Mr. President. I have to be objective and honest \nabout this stuff. When I hear Senators talk about Medicare, they are \nnot looking at facts. It is one thing to say something and engage in \nall this rhetoric, but if it is not backed by facts, it is a bit \nirresponsible.\n  The fact is, the life of the Medicare trust fund will be extended for \n5 years under this legislation. I talked to a Senator on that side \nprivately. He said that the Medicare trust fund will not be extended--\nthe solvency--for 5 years. I asked him privately: How can that be true? \nDid you read the Actuary's report? By the way, it was not this Senator \nright here; it was another Senator, and that Senator said: I don't \nbelieve it. It is a fact. The Actuary says that will be the result of \nthe legislation before us; namely, that the solvency of the trust fund \nwill last 5 more years. That is a fact. That is what the Actuary's \nreport said.\n  So we can either raise more payroll taxes to continue the solvency of \nthe trust fund so that seniors get their benefits or we can reduce \nspending out of the trust fund. We can either increase the money or \ndecrease the money coming out.\n  I will say it again. The Medicare Actuary tells us that health care \nreform will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund by 5 years or, \nto put it another way, if we do not enact health care reform, we will \nhurt Medicare's long-term solvency.\n  Let me cite some examples on how that works.\n  Health care reform would discourage hospital readmissions, for \nexample. That is waste. See, here is what the other side doesn't quite \nunderstand. You don't hear them talking about it. The goal here is to \nextend the life of the trust fund, basically by cutting out waste--not \nhurting seniors but cutting out waste and cutting back on overpayments \nin some areas where some providers are overpaid, and where seniors are \nhelped, not hurt.\n  Again, here is an example: hospital readmissions. If you can \ndiscourage hospital readmissions, that is fewer dollars wasted out of \nthe trust fund, and it is better health care for seniors. The incentive \nis for hospitals to have more readmissions because that is how they \nmake money. Some hospitals, frankly, don't go out of their way to \nprevent readmissions because they can make more money that way, \nalthough it is not good care for seniors.\n  When a senior is discharged from a hospital, you want to make sure \nthere is a flow, a seamless effort of keeping health care for that \npatient, whether it is extended care or home health care in a nursing \nhome or whatnot, and there is a physician involved and nurses involved \nand so forth, making sure the patient is taking his or her medication, \nand it is just to make sure patients are getting better all the time.\n  We all know--I know because I have experienced it, and I have watched \nit firsthand, and I have heard many people talk about this--that too \noften, when a patient is discharged, the care for that patient is not \nas great, as the hospital is in longer involved, and sometimes the \nregular doctor is not involved because that doctor is not very much \ninvolved with the patient at the hospital. My own view is that it needs \nimprovement. It is not working too well.\n  Again, we are saving dollars in the Medicare trust fund by preventing \nexcessive readmissions. That is wasteful and doesn't help the patient. \nSo that is a way we are saving and extending the solvency of the trust \nfund. That is one way. There are others. I will cite a second.\n  Health care reform discourages hospital-acquired infections. I think \nin America, unfortunately--and I don't know the facts, but I have read \nthis somewhere, but I haven't confirmed it--the rate of infections in \nAmerican hospitals is greater than it is for other industrialized \ncountries. That is clearly a problem. People die from infections in \nhospitals, and it seems to me that the more we can encourage fewer \ninfections--one way is through health care reform. Maybe we can lower \npayments to hospitals that have too many infections. I know it is hard \nto do. It is a judgment call. You have to do the best you can. That, \ntoo, will help the solvency of the trust fund and help care for \npatients. That is another way we are extending solvency of the trust \nfund.\n  I see my good friend from Wyoming on the floor, Senator Barrasso, who \ntalks about home health care. I am sure he wants to eliminate fraud in \nhome health care. I am sure he does. We all want to. So we cut back on \nareas where there is fraud. Where is there fraud? In outliers. Too many \nhospitals bill too much for outlier payments, additional payments, \nbecause they say they have a special patient who is an outlier. One \ncounty in Florida billed for 60 percent of the outlier payments in \nAmerica even though they had 1 percent of seniors in America. There are \nother examples like that. The GAO came to us and said we have to do \nsomething about this. There is fraud in the home health care program. I \nam a big fan of home health care--a big, big fan. They do very good \nwork. But we want to take out the fraud--excessive payments that are \nfraudulent. Isn't that a good thing? Doesn't that extend the solvency \nof the trust fund? Isn't that helping patients instead of hurting them?\n  There are examples. The home health folks came to us and said: Make \nsome of these changes because it is more efficient and we can give \nbetter care. As a result, fewer dollars are going to home health care. \nWe also had a provision for rural health care. We add an extra bonus \nfor rural health care.\n  My point is simply that when Senators stand up on the floor and say \nwe are cutting Medicare--sometimes they use the words ``cutting \nbenefits'' or ``hurting beneficiaries''--that is patently false. It is \nnot true. It is true that in some cases we are taking some of the fraud \nout. It is also true that in some cases we are taking excessive \npayments--not by our judgment but by the judgment of MedPAC and other \norganizations and experts who study this. One Senator from Florida \nstood up and told me he agreed that payments to Medicare Advantage are \nexcessive. Doesn't it make sense to take out the excess, the waste, and \nthe fraud in order to extend the solvency of the trust fund? That is \nwhat this bill does.\n  It doesn't hurt seniors by ``cutting'' Medicare, leaving the \nimplication that we are cutting Medicare benefits. It is an old saying \nin life: If you say something loud enough, maybe people will start to \nbelieve it. That is what the other side is engaging in.\n  If you look at the actual facts, the actuary says it does extend the \nlife and solvency of the trust fund. The actual fact is we are cutting \nout waste. The actual fact is the industry has come to us and said: \nHelp us with this, help us with that so we can be more efficient, much \nof what is going on here.\n  I have countless examples. Let me give a third one. This legislation \nwould encourage hospitals and doctors to work together by bundling \npayments. If doctors and hospitals work together, guess what happens. \nThey are less likely to order duplicate tests. They are working \ntogether. Payments based on fee for service, payments based today on \nvolume, on quantity are, in some cases, wasteful. It is wasteful.\n  All of us who go to a hospital, a doctor's office, we kind of wonder: \nMy gosh, some things seem wasteful here. We have to get new tests, new \nthis; the doctor doesn't know what happened when I was here previously; \nwe have to start all over again; new x rays, new imaging, so forth. \nThey are waste. We\n\n[[Page S12570]]\n\nare trying to cut out a lot of this waste, and bundling payments is \ndefinitely going to help.\n  We have other techniques--accountable care organizations, medical \nhome concepts. These could take 1 year, 2, 3, or 4 to kick in. But if \nthey do work, it is the model of integrated care systems we all talked \nabout which cut out waste and improve quality at the same time, and \nthat is going to help Medicare. These integrated systems are going to \nalso help extend the solvency of the trust fund and improve quality of \ncare--not reduce it but improve it.\n  The main point I am making is these reforms will extend the life of \nthe trust fund. And guess what. They improve the quality of care, not \ndecrease the quality of care but improve it.\n  We also add some additional benefits for seniors that they will not \nreceive if this legislation does not go into effect.\n  I note we only have a half hour on our side. I probably used more \ntime than I should. The chairman of the HELP Committee is on the floor. \nMr. President, how much time remains on the majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes remains.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for his great leadership on this \nissue, on this bill, and Senator Dodd, who took the leadership of our \nHELP Committee, in putting our bill together. The two of them have done \nan admirable job of getting our bill this far along and, hopefully, we \nare going to see the light at the end of the tunnel pretty soon. One of \nthe best Christmas presents we can give the American people is to bring \nthis bill to a close, have our votes up or down and let's get this bill \npassed so the American people can look ahead to a brighter future in \nterms of their health care and its quality, affordability, and \naccessibility.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2939\n\n  I wish to take a little bit of time this morning to speak in strong \nsupport of Senator Pryor's amendment, which is before us, which would \nprovide information on the consumer satisfaction of health plans \noffered through the exchanges. The Pryor amendment develops an enrollee \nsatisfaction survey for these plans and requires exchanges to include \ninformation from this survey on an Internet Web site. This, too, will \nallow consumers, both individuals and small businesses, to easily \ncompare survey results and make well-informed choices.\n  Currently, OPM manages an enrollee satisfaction survey for the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the one we are all in and the \none our staffs are in, the one that postal workers are in and civil \nservants all over this country are in. Right now OPM, in managing that \nplan, has an enrollee satisfaction survey. The Pryor amendment would \nprovide a tool to all Americans that we as Members of Congress have \nwhen we select a plan.\n  The survey results could be used by GAO, the Government \nAccountability Office, and the committee I chair, the Senate HELP \nCommittee, to monitor the quality of exchange plans and fulfill our \noversight responsibilities over the exchanges.\n  As a little aside, I keep reminding people we will pass this bill, we \nwill get this health reform bill passed. It will be signed into law. \nBut that does not mean, like the Ten Commandments, it is written in \nstone, never to be changed. Laws are laws and laws change. They get \namended, and we change and adapt as times and conditions demand. As we \nmove ahead and as we look at how the exchanges work, what is happening \nout there, I have no doubt in my mind there will be some bumps in the \nroad and we will have to come back and revisit it and make some \nchanges. By having this Pryor amendment and what we have in the bill to \nprovide for this kind of survey to see how satisfied people are with \nthe plans, it gives us that kind of oversight ability, that oversight \nresponsibility to look ahead and plan on changes that we will probably \nbe making in the future.\n  But most important, the Pryor amendment will give consumers an \nimportant voice. It will keep the insurance companies honest because \nthey will know to maintain and grow their enrollment they must satisfy \ntheir customers.\n  This amendment truly complements and reinforces the purpose and \nfunction of the exchanges. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, our reform bill, creates exchanges as a place for one-stop \nshopping where consumers, the self-employed, and small businesses can \neasily compare plans. This amendment will increase competition and \nlower premiums as the exchanges will increase competition and lower \npremiums.\n  This past week, the Congressional Budget Office validated this \napproach, and the CBO said this about the exchanges:\n\n       The exchanges would enhance competition among insurers in \n     the nongroup market--\n\n  That is small businesses, individuals, self-employed--\n\n     by providing a centralized marketplace in which consumers \n     could compare the premiums of relatively standardized \n     insurance products. The additional competition would slightly \n     reduce average premiums in the exchanges by encouraging \n     consumers to enroll in lower-cost plans and by encouraging \n     plans to keep their premiums low in order to attract \n     enrollees.\n\n  What we have been hearing from the other side of the aisle all along \nis premiums are going to go up, everything is going to skyrocket. CBO \ndebunked this last week. CBO also said it will benefit small business:\n\n       Those small employers that purchase coverage through the \n     exchanges would see similar reductions in premiums because of \n     the increased competition among plans.\n\n  The Senate bill before us ensures consumers and small businesses have \nthe information they need to make informed choices.\n  One, our bill requires exchange plans to provide information on \nquality measures for health plan performance. This was a provision \noffered in our committee by Senator Jack Reed, and I commend him for \nit.\n  Second, our bill develops a rating system that will rate exchange \nplans based on quality and price--ratings, again, that will be \navailable on an Internet Web site.\n\n  Third, our bill requires exchanges to operate a toll-free hotline to \nrespond to requests for consumer assistance.\n  Fourth, our bill develops an online calculator so that consumers can \nfigure out how much they will have to pay, factoring in their tax \ncredits and cost-sharing reductions.\n  And fifth, and perhaps most important, I want to acknowledge a \ncontribution made by Senator Dodd in this area. He authored a key \nprovision in our bill to require all plans--all plans--not just \nexchange plans, all plans--to provide a uniform, easily understandable \nsummary of coverage to enrollees and applicants. In other words, no \nlonger will Americans have to read and try to comprehend the fine \nprint.\n  All of these provisions are currently in our bill to enhance consumer \nchoice, which is what this bill is about--enhancing and expanding \naffordable choices.\n  Some of them have been overlooked in a lot of the verbiage going on \nabout cutting Medicare and all that stuff, but these provisions will do \na great deal to change the way Americans shop for and buy health \ninsurance.\n  This amendment by Senator Pryor will add one more important tool to \nhelp our consumers. It is a consumer amendment to make sure consumers \nget the information they need and the input, a satisfaction survey so \nconsumers can have an input. That way we know here if we need to make \nchanges down the road.\n  I commend Senator Pryor for offering the amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No objection is heard. The Senator may speak \nfor up to 7 minutes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by Senator Pryor that calls for an enrollee \nsatisfaction survey for health care plans offered through the exchange. \nAs you know, the exchange\n\n[[Page S12571]]\n\nwill be a series of different policies from which people can choose. \nWhat I love about this idea is that for my small businesses and self-\nemployed who are paying 20 percent more than people who work for big \nbusinesses right now because they simply cannot leverage their numbers, \nit is hard for them to get good rates because they are out there on \ntheir own, this exchange, where they can choose a number of different \npolicies like Members of Congress can choose from, whether it is Blue \nCross or a number of the other choices, they can pick a policy on the \nexchange.\n  I serve with Senator Pryor on the Consumer Protection Subcommittee \nand know that he offers this amendment with the full intent of \nimproving resources for individuals who buy insurance. A satisfaction \nsurvey will be a tool to help consumers navigate through the \ncomplicated process of purchasing health insurance. The survey results \nwill allow individuals and small businesses to make well-informed \nhealth care decisions by comparing current enrollee satisfaction levels \namong the plans offered through the exchange.\n  This survey also provides, as Senator Harkin has pointed out, an \noversight tool for Congress so we can monitor the progress of the \nexchange and present information to patients in an open, transparent \nmanner.\n  As I have said many times, I come from Minnesota, often known as a \n``medical Mecca.'' We are home to the Mayo Clinic. We are home to the \nUniversity of Minnesota. Countless innovative businesses have \ncontributed groundbreaking medical research that is bettering the lives \nof patients.\n  The key to this Minnesota model, where we have some of the highest \nquality care in the country and some of the lowest costs, is by putting \nthe patient in the driver's seat. I have been at the Mayo Clinic. I \nhave seen what happens there. It is integrated care with one primary \ndoctor with a group of doctors that work with him, like a quarterback \non a football team. They also focus on the patients with satisfaction \nsurveys, keeping the team accountable for what they are doing.\n  I always say to my colleagues, it is counterintuitive. If you go to a \nhotel and pay more money, you often get the best room with a view. That \nis not true with health care in America. You can pay more money and get \nsome of the worst quality care in this country because there is no \naccountability. That is why these patient surveys, in allowing \nconsumers in this country to look at these different plans and figure \nout which one is better for them, is the way to go.\n  In my State, 92 percent are covered by some form of health insurance, \nand we have done that by learning the importance of transparency and \nproviding quality information to consumers.\n  In 2004, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit called Minnesota Community \nMeasurement developed a consumer resource called Developed \nHealthScores. HealthScores is based on information submitted by more \nthan 300 clinics statewide and is available to consumers on an easily \naccessible Web site.\n  HealthScores is also used by medical groups and clinics to improve \npatient care and by employers and patients to provide access to \ncritical information about the quality of health care services.\n  Researchers at the University of Oregon have studied public reporting \nefforts and found that public reporting motivates health care providers \nand insurers to work harder on improving care, largely because of a \nconcern about their reputation.\n  This is how the private market should work. You cannot just have \ninsurance policies that have a name and not understand what they mean \nfor the consumer. By having these surveys, we are going to be able to \nunderstand so a consumer can navigate through and figure out which \npolicy is good, what it offers, what is best for their family.\n  As we continue our debate on health care, we must remain focused on \nsolutions with outcomes. Public reporting works. Senator Pryor's \namendment ensures that customers are able to voice their approval or \ndisapproval of plans offered by insurance companies and that \ninformation will be available to small businesses and individuals to \nmake well-informed decisions about their health care.\n  How can they make a well-informed decision without knowing what plans \nare good, what plans are bad, what plans offer? That is why we need \nthis, if we want to make this private market solution work for \nconsumers.\n  As the experience in Minnesota has shown, public reporting also has \nthe ability to improve quality as well. HealthScores in Minnesota has \nforced health plans, medical groups, and employers to focus on a common \nset of goals. Through this process, patient outcomes have produced \ndramatic improvements for chronic conditions such as diabetes.\n  We know already that small businesses are paying too much--up to 18 \npercent more than large businesses--often forcing small businesses to \nlay off employees or cut back on their coverage. We all know, from the \nletters we have gotten in our offices, what the average American \nfamilies are facing right now with these skyrocketing premiums.\n  We must provide these patients and these consumers with tools to make \ninformed health care decisions. Not only will we put consumers in the \ndriver's seat so they can make the decision, we will also have an \neffect on the entire market. Because if insurance companies think no \none is watching them, that consumers can't figure it out--maybe \nsomething has a great name so they go buy it--they will never get the \nkind of accountability and cost reductions we want.\n  The lessons from Minnesota have shown that providing consumers with \ninformation about their health care has the ability to improve patient \nsatisfaction and drive our system to focus on quality results.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business, not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in this morning's Washington Post, we \nhave, once again, an outstanding article by Robert Samuelson, this one \nentitled: ``Health-care Nation: Medical spending threatens everything \nelse.'' Mr. Samuelson has been critical of Republicans--and he is in \nthis article--and he has been critical of Democrats--and he is in this \narticle--but he makes some points I think are worth bringing to our \nattention, the primary one being that we are not focusing on the right \nissue, which is making some kind of attempt to turn the cost curve \ndown--using the budgetary doublespeak--with respect to health care.\n  Let me quote a few comments from Mr. Samuelson's presentation. He \nsays, first:\n\n       The most obvious characteristic of health spending is that \n     government can't control it.\n\n  As demonstrated by our past history, that is a very true statement, \nwhich I will show in a moment. He goes on to say:\n\n       [The] consequence is a slow, steady, and largely invisible \n     degradation of other public and private goals. Historian \n     Niall Ferguson, writing recently in Newsweek, argued that the \n     huge Federal debt threatens America's global power by an \n     ``inexorable reduction in the resources'' for the military. \n     Ferguson got it half right. The real threat is not the debt \n     but burgeoning health spending that, even if the budget were \n     balanced, would press on everything else. ``Everything else'' \n     includes universities, roads, research, parks, courts, border \n     protection, and--because similar pressures operate on States \n     through Medicaid--schools, police, trash collection and \n     libraries. Higher health spending similarly weakens families' \n     ability to raise children, because it reduces households' \n     discretionary income either through steeper taxes or lower \n     take-home pay, as higher employee-paid premiums squeeze \n     salaries.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       . . . Obama talks hypocritically about restraining deficits \n     and controlling health costs while his program would increase \n     spending and worsen the budget outlook. Democrats \n     congratulate themselves on caring for the uninsured--who \n     already receive much care--while avoiding any major overhaul \n     of the delivery system. The resulting society discriminates \n     against the young and increasingly assigns economic resources \n     and political choice to an unrestrained medical-industrial \n     complex.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire article at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S12572]]\n\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. To demonstrate the accuracy of what Mr. Samuelson has to \nsay, I have some charts. This one shows the breakdown of Federal \nspending in 1966. Why do I pick 1966? Because that was the year for the \nbeginning of Medicare. At that time, 26 percent of the Federal budget \nwent for mandatory spending--overwhelmingly Social Security--7 percent \nwent to pay interest on the national debt, and 44 percent went for \ndefense, with 23 percent for nondefense.\n  Where are we now? In 2008, mandatory spending had more than doubled \nand had gone to 54 percent, interest costs remained about the same--8 \npercent--defense had shrunk to 21 percent, cut in half, and the \nnondefense discretionary, 17. The difference? Medicare and Medicaid \ntaking over the mandatory side.\n  What do we see as we look out to 2019. We can't break down the \ndifference between defense and nondefense because that would require an \nanalysis that is not available to us in that future year. But mandatory \nby that time will have grown to 61 percent. The size of the debt \nincreasing costs now, interest costs have grown to 10 percent and \ndefense and nondefense discretionary have shrunk to 29--a complete \nreversal. That is roughly what mandatory was when Medicare was started.\n  I am not saying we should not have Medicare, and I am not saying we \nshould not have Medicaid, but I am saying we should be focusing on how \nwe make people healthier, how we reward people for not using the \nsystem, how we do something to control the costs, instead of increasing \nthe status quo with respect to health care spending.\n  This chart was drawn up before we had the bill before us. I think it \nis very likely, if the bill before us passes, this mandatory will grow \neven further and we find ourselves in this situation with respect to \n2010. I watched the budget as it came down and it said, in 2010, \nFederal revenues were going to be $2.2 trillion and mandatory spending \nwas going to be $2.2 trillion, which means every dime of everything \nelse had to be borrowed.\n  I worked with Senator Wyden and a number of others on both sides of \nthe aisle to craft a health care plan that would turn the cost curve \nfor health care down. We didn't even get a vote in the Finance \nCommittee. We didn't even get anybody to consider what we had to say \nbecause everyone was focused entirely on the issue of let's cover the \nuninsured. The position is: Let's cover the uninsured by taking what we \nare doing now and spreading it even wider.\n  As Mr. Samuelson says, very clearly, in his column today: That \nsqueezes out the money for everything else. That is an uncontrolled \nexpenditure. We are not focusing on changing the system in a way that \ncan cause cost curves to come down, we are focusing on taking the \npresent system and spreading it wider.\n  The cost curve can come down. I have quoted this before. The \nDartmouth study talks about where the best health care is available in \nAmerica, and it is in three cities, according to Dartmouth: Seattle, \nWA, Rochester, MN, and Salt Lake City, UT. Then they go on to say, if \nevery American got his or her health care in Salt Lake City, UT, it \nwould be the best in the country and one-third cheaper than the \nnational average. It is one-third cheaper than the national average \nbecause the focus in that plan, as it is in Rochester, MN, at the Mayo \nClinic, and other places, is trying to make health care better and, \ntherefore, cheaper, instead of focusing on taking the present system \nand perpetuating it.\n  If we don't get into that mentality, if we just take the present \nsystem, which this bill does, and spread it over a wider number of \npeople, which this bill does, we will see the spending go up and we \nwill see everything else suffer as a result of it and the health care \nwill not get any better for the people who are involved.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 7, 2009]\n\n                           Health-Care Nation\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       President Obama's critics sometimes say that he is \n     engineering a government takeover of health care or even \n     introducing ``socialized medicine'' into America. These \n     allegations are wildly overblown. Government already \n     dominates health care, one-sixth of the economy. It pays \n     directly or indirectly for roughly half of all health costs. \n     Medicine is pervasively regulated, from drug approvals to \n     nursing-home rules. There is no ``free market'' in health \n     care.\n       What's happening is the reverse, which is more interesting \n     and alarming: Health care is taking over government. \n     Consider: In 1980, the federal government spent $65 billion \n     on health care; that was 11 percent of all its spending. By \n     2008, health outlays had grown to $752 billion--25 percent of \n     the total, one dollar in four.\n       Even without new legislation, the health share would grow, \n     as an aging population uses more Medicare (insurance for the \n     elderly) and Medicaid (the joint federal-state insurance for \n     the poor, including the very poor elderly). Obama would \n     magnify the trend by expanding Medicaid and providing new \n     subsidies for private insurance. Thirty million or more \n     Americans would receive coverage.\n       All this is transforming politics and society. The most \n     obvious characteristic of health spending is that government \n     can't control it. The reason is public opinion. We all want \n     the best health care for ourselves and loved ones; that's \n     natural and seems morally compelling. Unfortunately, what we \n     all want as individuals may harm us as a nation. Our concern \n     sanctions open-ended and ineffective health spending, because \n     everyone believes that cost controls are heartless and \n     illegitimate. The recent furor over proposals to reduce \n     mammogram screenings captures the popular feeling.\n       The consequence is a slow, steady and largely invisible \n     degradation of other public and private goals. Historian \n     Niall Ferguson, writing recently in Newsweek, argued that the \n     huge federal debt threatens America's global power by an \n     ``inexorable reduction in the resources'' for the military. \n     Ferguson got it half right. The real threat is not the debt \n     but burgeoning health spending that, even if the budget were \n     balanced, would press on everything else.\n       ``Everything else'' includes universities, roads, research, \n     parks, courts, border protection and--because similar \n     pressures operate on states through Medicaid--schools, \n     police, trash collection and libraries. Higher health \n     spending similarly weakens families' ability to raise \n     children, because it reduces households' discretionary income \n     either through steeper taxes or lower take-home pay, as \n     higher employer-paid premiums squeeze salaries.\n       A society that passively accepts constant increases in \n     health spending endorses some explicit, if poorly understood, \n     forms of income redistribution. The young transfer to the \n     elderly, because about half of all health spending goes for \n     those 55 and over. Unless taxes are increased \n     disproportionately for older Americans (and just the opposite \n     is true), they are subsidized by the young. More and more \n     resources also go to a small sliver of the population: In \n     2006, the sickest 5 percent of Americans accounted for 48 \n     percent of health spending.\n       Political power in this system shifts. It flows to groups \n     that promote and defend more health spending--AARP, the lobby \n     for Americans 50 and over, and also provider organizations \n     such as the American Medical Association (AMA), which \n     represents doctors. Predictably, AARP has been active in the \n     present debate. It claims to have participated in 649 town-\n     hall and other meetings and to have reached more than 50 \n     million people through ads this year. Not surprisingly, AARP \n     and the AMA recently conducted a joint TV ad campaign.\n       The rise of health-care nation has confounded America's \n     political and intellectual leaders, of both left and right. \n     No one wants to appear unfeeling by denying anyone treatment \n     that seems needed; no one wants to endorse openly meddling \n     with doctors' independence. It's easier to perpetuate and \n     enlarge the status quo than to undertake the difficult job of \n     restructuring the health-care system to provide better and \n     less costly care.\n       Obama's health-care proposals may be undesirable (they \n     are), but it's mindless to oppose them--as many Republicans \n     do--by screaming that they'll lead to ``rationing.'' Almost \n     everything in society is ``rationed,'' either by price (if \n     you can't afford it, you can't buy it) or explicit political \n     decisions (school boards have budgets). Health care is an \n     exception; it enjoys an open tab. The central political \n     problem of health-care nation is to find effective and \n     acceptable ways to limit medical spending.\n       Democrats are no better. Obama talks hypocritically about \n     restraining deficits and controlling health costs while his \n     program would increase spending and worsen the budget \n     outlook. Democrats congratulate themselves on caring for the \n     uninsured--who already receive much care--while avoiding any \n     major overhaul of the delivery system. The resulting society \n     discriminates against the young and increasingly assigns \n     economic resources and political choice to an unrestrained \n     medical-industrial complex.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Iowa wishes to ask \nme a question and I am happy to respond, but tell me how much time I \nhave remaining. Maybe some of it will have to come off his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In my 2 minutes remaining, unless it is a long question, \nI will be happy to respond to any question my friend may ask.\n\n[[Page S12573]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would say that a lot of what Senator \nBennett says I agree with. That is why, in this bill--and I keep \nreminding people because it is not talked about much--there are more \nprovisions in this bill to promote wellness and prevention than any \nhealth bill we have ever passed--ever--in the United States. There are \nhuge investments in this bill on prevention and wellness.\n  I happen to think that perhaps one of the reasons Salt Lake City is \nso good is because people don't smoke and don't drink and that goes a \nlong way toward providing for a healthier form of living. So I say to \nmy friend from Utah, people talk about bending the cost curve only in \nterms of the spending. I think--and I sincerely believe this--the only \nway we are going to bend that cost curve is by pushing more of this \nupstream, by keeping people healthy in the first place, starting with \nkids and adults, community-based, clinical-based, workplace-based \nwellness programs.\n  So I ask my friend from Utah to look at that part of the bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I can reclaim my 2 minutes to respond \nto the Senator from Iowa, I can give you data that indicates it is not \njust the fact there are a lot of people who don't smoke and don't drink \nin Utah that makes them healthier. I agree there are many things in \nthis bill that are for wellness, and I approve of that. But the fact \nis, the bill does not go anywhere near far enough in this direction to \nchange the paradigm that has created the situation we find ourselves \nin.\n  Every expert I have talked to, in the 3\\1/2\\ years I have immersed \nmyself in this issue, has repeated that. They have said the only way \nyou are going to deal with this is to do something dramatically \ndifferent, which is what Senator Wyden and I tried to do and we got the \ncold shoulder. All right, I understand, if you don't have the votes, \nyou can't get anywhere. But the fact remains, we are not going to be \nable to afford all the things we want to do in this country, militarily \nand otherwise, in this cost projection that we are on with respect to \nhealth care right now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is right; my time has gone. I will be happy to \nrespond to the Senator from Montana, if he wants to take the time to \nlet me.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If my colleagues will allow, I ask unanimous consent for \n3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Montana \nhas 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand what the Senator is saying, and like \neverything around here, there is a kernel of truth in almost \neverything. I read that Samuelson article, and what I took away from it \nis the guy is kind of pessimistic. There is not a lot you can do. \nPeople love health care, they want to get all the health care they \nwant, and that is going to drive up spending.\n  But the main point is this. You mentioned how Intermountain and the \nquality of care is so good at Intermountain and the costs are down.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I may, it is not just Intermountain. There are other \nagencies in Utah that do a good job.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I was going to say, it is Intermountain, and there are \nmany other great integrated systems. There is one in Billings, MT--the \nBillings Clinic. There are lots of integrated systems, and generally in \nthese areas, in these integrated systems--which I think work quite \nwell--a lot of the doctors are salaried, a lot of the incentives are \nthere to focus on health care of the patient, and it is coordinated \ncare in contrast with some other parts of the country.\n  In this bill, in addition to wellness and prevention, I would ask if \nthe Senator agrees the delivery system reforms will help move health \ncare, as it is in Intermountain and other integrated systems, to \nencourage coordinated care, encourage bundling, encourage these \naccountable care organizations and so forth. I was wondering if the \nSenator thinks that will help systems--clinics, doctors, hospitals, \nnursing homes and health care providers generally--to work better \ntogether, where there may be more salaried physicians than there are \ncurrently, but the salaried physicians I talked to at the Mayo Clinic, \nfor example, and Kaiser and other similar places, kind of like that \nbecause they get decent salaries and they can spend their time not on \npaperwork but can focus on the patients.\n  I am sure the Senator knows all the delivery reforms that are in this \nthat help move toward the Intermountain direction, and I would ask if \nhe thinks that will help.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Responding to the question of the Senator from Montana, \nI am delighted there is as much of that in the bill as there is, but I \nstill believe the basic structure of the bill is fatally flawed because \nit perpetuates the present system in ways that will guarantee the cost \ncurve will continue to go up. I disagree with him about the Samuelson \narticle. I do not think he is being overly pessimistic. I think he is \nbeing very realistic.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. One more moment, if I might, Mr. President.\n  I understand the bill that the Senator and Senator Wyden cosponsored \nis basically to move us away from the employer-based system. Currently, \nour tax law encourages employers providing tax free health insurance \nand so forth. I understand the theoretical and actual problems with the \ncurrent system. In fact, I earlier advocated moving in that direction, \nall the way to your legislation. But as you know, this town, this city, \nthis country, this White House was not moving there, and major business \nwas not moving in that direction. Therefore, we had to find something \nelse. My main point is, if we can't go in that direction--you might say \nkeep trying, but read the tea leaves. If we can't do that, at least \nnow, isn't it better to start moving toward the integrated delivery \nsystem reforms in this bill?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I certainly hope this legislation will \nsurprise me by producing----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I hope so, too.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The result the Senator from Montana is hoping for.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I like your answer, too. Thank you.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am not going to hold my breath, however.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am going to yield 10 minutes--this is a \njump ball, so why don't you go ahead. I yield to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, there are at least two major goals we \nhave to achieve in health care reform and that is we have to expand \naccess to everyone in America, and we have to control costs. We focus a \nlot on expanding insurance but expanding insurance is not expanding \naccess. There are people today in America who have insurance but they \ndo not have access. The fact is, we have 60 million people who do not \nhave access to a physician on a regular basis and many of those \npeople--according to recent studies, 45,000--may die because they do \nnot get to a doctor in a timely manner. By the time they walk into the \ndoctor's office their situation is terminal.\n  We need substantially improved access to health care. When we improve \naccess, we save money because people do not go to the emergency room, \nthey do not end up in the hospital, sicker than they otherwise would \nhave been. We need a revolution in primary health care in America. \nUnless we do something and do it now, our primary health care system \ninfrastructure is close to collapse.\n  We have an aging primary care workforce which is not being replaced. \nAt a Senate hearing I chaired earlier this year, it was noted that only \n2 percent of internal medicine residents were choosing primary care as \ntheir specialty. Happily, there are two Federal programs that can both \nassure access and control costs, and I refer to the Community Health \nCenter Program and the National Health Service Corps. Both are well-\nestablished programs that have garnered broad bipartisan support \nbecause of their proven cost effectiveness.\n  What a federally qualified community health center is about--and I \nbelieve they exist in all States in this country. They have widespread \nsupport from Members of the Senate and the House of both political \nparties. What they are about is saying that anyone in an underserved \narea can walk into that facility and get health care, either\n\n[[Page S12574]]\n\nMedicaid, Medicare, private insurance, or a sliding scale--if you don't \nhave enough money, you pay on a sliding scale basis--and low-cost \nprescription drugs.\n  This is a very successful program that now provides health care to \nover 20 million Americans and it is a 40-year-old program, again \nsupported widely in the House and the Senate.\n  I am pleased that in the Senate bill, it recognizes the importance of \nboth federally qualified community health centers and the National \nHealth Service Corps. The National Health Service Corps is a long-\nestablished Federal program which says to people in medical school: We \nare prepared to provide debt forgiveness to you--on average, I know in \nVermont, people are coming out $150,000 in debt--if you are prepared to \nwork in primary health care in an underserved area.\n  In the Senate bill we recognize the importance of the federally \nqualified community health centers and the National Health Service \nCorps. In fact, our bill calls for authorization levels that, if \nappropriated, would enable the Community Health Centers Program to \nexpand to every underserved area within 5 years, and would result in \nsupporting at least 40,000 more primary care professionals in the next \n10 years--doctors, nurses, dentists.\n  But we can and must improve the Senate bill. I favor very strongly \nthe language in the House bill which calls for a dedicated trust fund \nwith mandatory annual spending for community health centers and the \nNational Health Service Corps. In other words, in the Senate we have \nauthorized funding. The House has established a trust fund to actually \npay for it. The Senate bill contains authorization levels that would be \nsufficient to fund a community health center in every underserved area \nin America and thus provide primary health care to 60 million more \npeople by the year 2015. These are people who do not have to go into \nthe emergency room, they don't have to go into the hospital because \nthey are sicker than they should have been. They are going to get \ntimely, cost-effective health care at a community health center.\n  Therefore, let me be very clear: I favor the language in the House \nbill which includes community health centers in its Public Health \nInvestment Fund and guarantees mandatory funding for health centers \ntotaling $12 billion over the next 5 years. This is in addition to the \n$2.2 billion current annual appropriation for community health centers \nwhich, it is anticipated, would also continue to be appropriated in \neach of the next 5 years. While this House funding level will not \nachieve a community health center in every underserved area, it will \ntake us very far toward that goal, bringing primary care health \nservices to some 40 million citizens living in underserved areas. Also \nin the House bill there is appropriated money to greatly expand the \nNational Health Service Corps.\n  In the middle of all this discussion on health care, health \ninsurance, let us not forget a few basic points. Sixty million \nAmericans do not have access to a doctor. We need a revolution in \nprimary medical care. We need to make sure we have the physicians, \nnurses, and dentists who are going to get out in underserved areas. The \nSenate bill provides authorization. The House bill provides a trust \nfund for community health centers and for disease prevention in \ngeneral. My strong hope--and I am going to do everything I can to make \nsure it happens--is that the Senate adopts the House provisions.\n  If we are serious about providing health care to all Americans, we \nhave to expand community health centers, we have to make sure there are \nprimary health care doctors, dentists, nurses out there.\n  In addition, we need to focus on disease prevention. I know my \ncolleague from Iowa has worked very hard on that. So we have to support \nthe trust fund in that area.\n  I yield to my friend from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I thank my friend from Vermont. There is no one \nwho has been leading the charge longer and stronger and more fervently \nthan the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders. I thank him for that. \nObviously, we all have community health centers in our States. In Iowa \nthey have been a godsend for so many people in rural areas who did not \nhave access to these kinds of facilities.\n  I remember one time I was in Fort Dodge several years ago. They had a \nsmall free clinic there. It was in a church basement one night a week, \nso people could come in who didn't have insurance and couldn't get \naccess to a doctor. They had one old dental chair there. I think every \ncouple of weeks a dentist would come in for people. A woman had come in \nwho had an abscessed tooth. It was hurting her so much she took a \nhammer and screwdriver and tried to knock her tooth out. Of course she \ndamaged her gums. That is how desperate people get.\n  Because of that, I got the Fort Dodge community looking at a \ncommunity health center. They now have a wonderful community health \ncenter. They have doctors there, they have nurses there, and people \nhave access to that kind of dental care and health care.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me mention to my friend, in the State of Vermont, \nthe poorest region of our State borders on Canada. It is called the \nNortheast Kingdom, in the northeast part of the State. For 30 years we \nhave had a number of community health centers in that region. Do you \nknow what? Amidst all of the poverty, all of the unemployment, all of \nthe economic problems, we do not have a problem in terms of primary \nhealth care in the poorest area of the State of Vermont precisely \nbecause of these community health centers, which you indicate address \ndental care, which we often forget about, mental health counseling, we \nforget about, low-cost prescription drugs.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman of the HELP Committee and \nothers to make sure we fund the kind of revolution we need in disease \nprevention, in primary health care, which at the end of the day \nimproves people's health, keeps them out of the emergency room, keeps \nthem out of the hospital, saves us money.\n  Study after study: Saves us money.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator again. I can't help but every time we \ntalk about community health centers, I always have to add one thing. A \nlot of people think community health centers are just for poor people \nwho do not have anything. Nothing could be further from the truth. They \nwill take anyone who walks in the door. You can have health insurance, \nyou can be on Medicare, you can be on Medicaid, you can have no \ninsurance, you can have a great insurance plan--whoever walks in the \ndoor. They have a sliding scale based on income, based on resources, of \nwho they will take.\n  It has been my experience--I ask the Senator from Vermont what it has \nbeen in his area, but it has been my experience in our growing number \nof community health centers in my State of Iowa that more and more \npeople----\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Come to community health centers. Why? Because they get \nthe kind of hands-on care, they get many kinds of supportive services. \nA lot of times there are language barriers that are a problem. They get \npreventive care, they get all the things that make people feel better \nabout their own quality of health care. So more and more we are finding \npeople who actually have health insurance going to community health \ncenters.\n  I ask if that has been the experience in Vermont?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me concur. In the State of Vermont we have gone from \n2 to 8 with 40 satellites. Over 100,000 people in Vermont are now \naccessing community health centers for their primary health care.\n  The other point we don't often make about community health centers is \nthey are democratically run, they are run by the communities \nthemselves. My experience is exactly that of the Senator from Iowa. \nThey are community health centers.\n  In rural areas it is not rich or poor. By and large, most of the \npeople, regardless of income, go there. The doctors are there for a \nlong time. The dentists are there. It is, in fact, in the best sense of \nthe word, a community health center open and accessed by all people. \nPeople take responsibility for it because it is democratically run. It \nis a program--one of the bright shining stars of public health in \nAmerica. I hope to work with the chairman of the HELP Committee to make \nsure these\n\n[[Page S12575]]\n\nprograms are funded adequately in this bill and that we adopt the \nlanguage in the House, which goes a long way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I can assure my friend from Vermont that this Senator \nwill be in the forefront of fighting for the maximum possible support, \nmoney, and input for community health centers that we can possibly get \nout of this bill. I can assure him that.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator very much and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I might need \nout of the remaining time we have.\n  I, too, thank the Senator from Vermont for his passionate comments on \ncommunity health centers. In Wyoming we have community health centers \nand they serve a great role. For underserved areas across the Nation, \nthey are absolutely critical. I wish there were more that we were doing \nin the area of community health centers. I think it provides some \nbetter solutions than some of the other things we are doing in this \nbill.\n  Wyoming is considered to be underserved. The whole State is \nunderserved. Even our biggest cities are considered underserved. We are \nmissing every single kind of medical provider, including veterinarians.\n  Usually when I make that comment, people say: People don't use \nveterinarians. But as far as our distances are, some people are happy \nto get to a veterinarian in an emergency situation.\n  We do have situations across the country that need to be taken care \nof. One of my concerns is that we are doing this huge Medicaid \nexpansion. And when we do the Medicaid expansion, we already have it \npriced for doctors so that 60 percent of the doctors won't take a \nMedicaid patient. If you can't see a doctor, you don't have insurance, \nperiod. I don't think we are doing enough to take care of that \ndifficulty prior to expanding this population. So we are going to shove \nmore and more people out of getting any health care.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2942\n\n  But the main thing I wanted to do today is rise in support of the \nGregg amendment which would prevent Medicare cuts in the Reid bill from \nbeing used to create new entitlement programs to cover the uninsured. \nYes, I want to have the uninsured covered. I don't oppose covering the \nuninsured, nor do I oppose reforming the Medicare Program. We need to \ndo those things. We absolutely need to do those. But we shouldn't do it \non a system that is going broke. We should not take the money from a \nsystem that is going broke to do new entitlement programs.\n  I know the Senator from Montana admitted that if the Gregg amendment \nwere to pass, it would limit some of these entitlements, that they \nwouldn't be able to do them. Again, we are not opposed to doing those \nnew entitlements. We are opposed to paying for them with Medicare money \nbecause Medicare is going broke.\n  They do say that if we put these extra burdens on Medicare, we will \nextend the life of it. And you can believe that or not. But we could \nexpand it even more and we could solve some problems in Medicare if we \ntook the money and we used it for Medicare. Medicare needs changes. \nMedicare needs to have money that we are now going to move away and put \ninto other programs. But don't worry about it because we are going to \nform a Medicare Commission. Every year, that Commission is going to \ntell us what we ought to do to make more cuts. Before we start doing \nmore cuts, maybe we ought to make sure the cuts we are doing go to what \nwe anticipated needed the most help.\n  I am not opposed to covering the uninsured. I don't oppose reforming \nthe Medicare Program. We should do those things. What I oppose is the \nReid bill. This is the wrong approach to solve the problems.\n  The Gregg amendment would go quite a ways to solving some of my \ndiscontent with the bill. The amendment offered by my friend from New \nHampshire highlights the main problems of the Reid bill and suggests a \nbetter approach. His amendment would protect the savings from the \nMedicare Program and prevent them from being used to create a new \nentitlement. This would mean this new program would not have to rely on \ncuts to Medicare to fund its operation. It would also reserve all money \ntaken from Medicare so that it could be used to fix the problems in the \nMedicare system.\n  Earlier, we had an amendment that said that the money for Medicare \nwould go to Medicare. Every single program that we allocate money to, \nwe have inspectors general who are supposed to make sure the money for \nthat program goes to that program. But this is a different situation. \nWhat we are saying here is that we want the money from Medicare to go \nto Medicare, not the money for Medicare to go to Medicare. The money \nfor Medicare has to go to Medicare. But we are going to take money from \nMedicare. I say, if we have that money we can take from Medicare, we \nought to put it to Medicare and only to Medicare until we have the \nMedicare problem solved. Our seniors are relying on that. Don't be \ncaught up by the little words in do-nothing amendments that say the \nmoney for Medicare is going to go to Medicare. What we want to say is \nthat the money from Medicare goes only to Medicare.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am on my time here.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Do we have any time remaining on our side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes remaining on the majority \nside and 14 minutes remaining on the Republican side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will take 2 minutes from our side to ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Wyoming wish to yield \ntime?\n  Mr. ENZI. It is my understanding that the Senator from Montana is \nwilling to take his time for the question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I ask the Senator from Wyoming a question? To, from, \nfor--isn't the result the same? If we take a program--let's take home \nhealth care. We are all for home health care. But if there is fraud, if \nthe GAO says there is fraud in home health--maybe others too--doesn't \nthe Senator think it is a good idea that we eliminate some of the fraud \nthat might exist in the Medicare Program? Does the Senator agree with \nthat?\n  Mr. ENZI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator also agree that when that happens, that \nmeans that program--say, home health care, for example--is spending \nfewer dollars not on less care but fewer dollars because it is not \nmaking fraudulent payments?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator further agree that would extend the life \nof the trust fund because that program--in this case, home health--\nwould be spending fewer dollars even though the quality of health care \nis not diminished? Doesn't that have the effect of extending the \nquality of health care, and isn't that reduction for Medicare, for \nseniors, not to take it away but to give it to seniors because it \nextends the life of the trust fund?\n  Mr. ENZI. That is where the Senator runs into a dead end. If you take \nthe money that would be from home health care and you put it into an \nentitlement that has nothing to do with home health care, nothing to do \nwith Medicare, then you did not extend the life of Medicare.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, no, no. There is less spending; therefore, by \ndefinition, the solvency of the trust fund is extended, so there are \nmore dollars for seniors in future years. That is the basic point here. \nThat is not a dead end. That is a big wide avenue to help extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  Mr. ENZI. Reclaiming my time, I am the accountant in the Senate. If \nyou take money from a program and you give it to something else, you \nhave less money in that program. We admit that Medicare does have \nproblems in the long term. Seven or eight years out there, it is going \nbroke, and maybe we can extend it a year or two. If we took that money, \nthat fraud and abuse--and I will say some more things about fraud and \nabuse here in just a minute--if we took that money and put it into the \nMedicare Program to extend the life of the program, we could give some \nassurance to seniors that we are doing something for them. That is \nwhere a lot of the concern comes from.\n  On fraud and abuse, if there is all this fraud and abuse out there, \nhow\n\n[[Page S12576]]\n\ncome we haven't been getting at that in the past and putting it to some \nkind of good use? All of a sudden, we are saying there is all this \nfraud and abuse and we are going to take this extra fraud and abuse and \nwe are going to put it in there. I notice we have increased the amount \nof fraud and abuse we are capturing, but we did that by changing the \ndefinition. We just claimed more fraud and abuse. We didn't capture \nmore money. That is one of the problems with having a government \nbureaucracy do things they really have no value in doing. If the \ngovernment agency finds the money, it doesn't come back to their \nprogram, so they are not very excited about doing it. We keep passing \nfraud and abuse things around here, and the fraud and abuse never gets \nfound to any extent. And the money can't be used if it can't be found.\n  As an accountant, what I have always suggested is, we have a separate \nfund set up, and when we find this fraud and abuse, we put it in that \nfund. We would only be able to use the money from that fund in these \nareas where we say we are going to fund it with fraud and abuse money. \nBecause we have no incentive in government to go out and collect the \nmoney. It is a huge problem around here.\n\n  Some Democrats have argued that we are not creating a new entitlement \nprogram. They are simply wrong with that too. Just like Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, this bill will commit the Federal \nTreasury to paying for these new subsidies for the uninsured forever.\n  When we start a program around here, we don't put an end date on it. \nAs soon as we have passed it, the people say: Wow, thanks, that is \nreally great. Now what are you going to do for us? We look around and \nwe say: Maybe we can do like Medicare Part D. Then we pass that and \nthey say: Yes, you gave us Medicare Part D, but you still have the \ndoughnut hole. So we take care of that. Anytime we do an entitlement, \nwe keep adding to the entitlement regardless of where the money is \ncoming from. And that is how Medicare has gotten in trouble. Once \nsubsidies are given, they are never taken back. They are only expanded. \nThere is no appreciation for what has been done. Medicare Part D; now \nthey want the doughnut hole closed.\n  We are going to do kind of a phony thing to close that doughnut hole. \nPhRMA said they would give $50 billion that can be used as a subsidy as \npeople go through the doughnut hole, but they said: You can only use \nthe subsidy if we can pay it directly to the customer. That way, they \nkeep in contact with the customer. And you can only use it if they stay \nwith our brand name. OK, so they get through the doughnut hole. Then \nthe taxpayer picks up the money, and they are stuck with the brand \nname. That is why the pharmaceutical companies can make so much money. \nIf they can get them to not switch to that generic and make good \neconomic decisions as they go through the doughnut hole, they can make \na lot more money, once it is on the taxpayer outside of the doughnut \nhole. I am really upset with the pharmaceutical industry for doing \nthat. That is the reason they are putting all the money into promoting \nthis.\n  That means that as Federal spending continues to grow, new programs \ncontinue to grow. It will crowd out other Federal spending priorities \nsuch as education or national defense. States will tell you it is \nalready crowding out education. When we put these new Medicaid \nrequirements in there and they have to pay for them, they have a \nlimited budget too. What they have done is take money away from \ncolleges, so colleges have had to increase tuition dramatically in \norder to cover the money they had to give to Medicaid. So when we do \nsome of these things, we are affecting a whole lot of things, other \nspending priorities such as education and national defense.\n  Any future attempts to modify or restrain this growth will be met by \ncries of indignation, arguing that cuts would devastate access to \nhealth care. If anyone has any doubt, they should look at the \ntranscripts from our debate on the Deficit Reduction Act.\n  In 2005, Congress tried to reduce Medicare spending by about $20 \nbillion and enact modest reforms to the Medicare Program. These reforms \nwould have strengthened the long-term solvency of these programs which \nwe are talking about now and helped reduce the Federal deficit. In \nresponse, Senator Reid called that bill an ``immoral document,'' and \nthe junior Senator from California said she strongly opposed the cuts \nin the bill because they would ``cut Medicare and Medicaid by $27 \nbillion.''\n  There are thousands of media quotes. The media quotes the majority \nmore often, and here in DC the volume of quotes is equated with being \nright. Yet today these same Members and the rest of my Democratic \ncolleagues want to create a new entitlement program that will spend \nhundreds of billions of dollars, and they would pay for it by cutting \n$464 billion from the Medicare Program. That is enough money to run the \nState of Wyoming for 320 years.\n  We don't understand how much money we are talking about here. You \ncan't take that kind of money from a program, give it to other \nprograms, and expect the program to work. We recognize that. That is \nwhy we put this Medicare Commission in there that annually is supposed \nto suggest extra cuts.\n  Let's see. We made a deal with the hospitals that we weren't going to \ncut them. We made a deal with the pharmaceuticals that we wouldn't cut \nthem any more. We made a deal with doctors that we wouldn't cut them \nany more, although we never followed through on the doctor stuff \nbecause their deal--and these were all hidden deals--was supposed to be \nthat they would either get a 1-year fix on the doc fix and medical \nmalpractice or they would get a 10-year fix on the doc fix. That isn't \nin either of the bills. I don't know if they are going to stick with \nthe hidden deal they made. I don't know what other hidden deals there \nwere in this.\n  I believe these facts highlight why we need to adopt the Gregg \namendment.\n  We should be very careful creating a new entitlement program which \nwill permanently obligate our children and grandchildren to pay its \ncosts. In fact, with the way we have maxed out our credit cards, we are \nnow talking about the seniors actually having to pay for these other \nnew entitlements. So grandpa and grandma will be paying for that, too, \nnot just our grandkids and children. If my colleagues insist on doing \nit, however, at a minimum we need to guarantee that any new program has \na stable and reliable source of funding. The Medicare cuts in this bill \nare neither stable nor reliable.\n  My Democratic colleagues have spoken at length about how the Medicare \nprovisions in this bill will bend the growth of health care spending. \nThat, unfortunately, is far from accurate. If you don't believe me, \nlisten to what the other nationally recognized experts have to say.\n  According to the New York Times, the CEO of the world-renowned Mayo \nClinic, which we use around here all the time, dismissed the reforms in \nthe bill. Dennis Cortese said the Reid bill only took baby steps toward \nrevamping the current fee-for-service system. The dean of the Harvard \nMedical School, Jeffrey Flier, said the bills being considered in \nCongress would accelerate national health care spending.\n  I wish there were more actual reforms in this bill. I applaud some of \nthe efforts Senator Baucus included that will create incentives for \ncoordinated care and rewarding providers who provide higher quality. I \nbelieve those are exactly the types of things we should do to improve \nthe Medicare Program. Unfortunately, the savings from these actual \nreforms are a few pennies compared to the dollars of the arbitrary \npayment cuts included in the bill.\n\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, all of the savings from \nthe various policies to link Medicare payments to quality and encourage \nbetter coordination of care in the Reid bill provide less than $20 \nbillion in total savings.\n  In contrast, the Reid bill includes over $220 billion in arbitrary \npayment cuts to health care providers, including hospitals, nursing \nhomes, home health agencies, and hospice providers. We have made a \npoint of how much those are and what the effect is going to be, and it \nis going to take away service that people have come to expect.\n  The Reid bill also includes an additional $120 billion in cuts to \nMedicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage is--we talked about \nwanting to provide catastrophic care for everybody. That\n\n[[Page S12577]]\n\nwas one of the goals. Well, Medicare people do not have catastrophic \ncare. They can buy catastrophic care through Medicare Advantage. But we \nare talking about making some substantial cuts to that which are either \ngoing to decrease benefits or, in some cases, make the whole service go \naway.\n  Those are not reforms. Instead, they represent the best efforts of \nfolks in Washington to guess how much it actually costs real doctors \nand nurses to provide health care services to Medicare beneficiaries. \nWe are not experts in the health care field, but we are going to guess \nat how much extra revenue they are getting. I want to emphasize that \nword ``revenue'' because, again, as an accountant, there is a \ndifference between profit and revenue. We are going to cut \nsubstantially into the revenues, which is going to eliminate profits, \nwhich is the point at which people say: Why am I doing this?\n  So doctors and nurses are going to--people who are looking at being \ndoctors and nurses are going to say: Why would I want to do that? Well, \nthere is going to be a huge demand because the baby boomers are coming \nup, and they are going to need services.\n  So cuts like the ones to doctors and nurses and home health, and all \nof those, are an excellent example of how government price controls do \nnot work.\n  Medicare does not negotiate payment rates with providers like private \ninsurers do. Medicare uses price controls to set payment rates.\n  When I first went into the shoe business, President Nixon suggested \nwe should have price controls; that the cost of goods was going out of \nsight. At that time, one could buy a pair of men's dress shoes for $10. \nThey put in price controls--like this--but they could not put the price \ncontrols in immediately because it takes a while to pass a bill. So \nwhat did everybody who was manufacturing shoes do? They raised their \nprices, which forced us at the retail end to have to raise our prices \ntoo. By the time that went into effect, that $10 pair of shoes was $20. \nSo price controls do not work. I have experienced it. It was dramatic, \nand it was terrible for the customer. We are talking about customers \nagain.\n  Medicare uses price controls to set payment rates. Experts in \nWashington then look at various reported costs, revenues, and profits \nof health care providers, and then decide how much we should pay health \ncare providers.\n  I have often said everyone thinks they know everything about a \nbusiness until they actually have to run it. Unfortunately, we have \nbeen taking over a lot of businesses, and our expertise is showing. I \nam kind of fascinated by the Cash for Clunkers. That was a little \nbusiness we decided we would set up on behalf of the government, and we \nsaid it would last for 4 months. It went broke in 4 days.\n  So as to any of the numbers anybody around here is considering, you \nought to take a look at it because as a former small business owner, I \nwant to assure them, it is actually a lot harder to run a business than \nit looks. For the simplest business you can think of out there, if you \nscratch the surface just a little bit you will find out those people \nare making dramatic decisions on a daily basis just to keep in \nbusiness, which means, hopefully, paying themselves, but definitely \npaying their employees because that is not an option. If it was as easy \nas we think around here to do a business, everybody would be going into \nbusiness.\n  The Medicare cuts in this bill are based on the efforts of folks in \nWashington to decide how much it costs to run a nursing home in \nCheyenne or a home health agency in Gillette or any of these businesses \nin much smaller communities than that. Based on the past track record \nof Washington, I do not have much confidence in their abilities, and I \ndo not think America does. I think that is showing up in the polls. I \nthink that is showing up in the town meetings.\n  In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. It contained \nMedicare payment cuts. Lots of smart folks in Washington made arguments \nsimilar to those we are hearing today about how those cuts would not \nharm the providers or beneficiaries. That was historic.\n  Well, let me show you the historic arrogance of that time. What \nhappened after these cuts went into effect? Within 2 years, these cuts \nhad driven four of the largest nursing home chains in the Nation into \nbankruptcy. Vencor, Sun Healthcare, Integrated Health Services, and \nMariner Post-Acute Network all filed for bankruptcy. Between them, they \noperated 1,400 nursing homes that provided care for hundreds of \nthousands of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Similarly, the bill also included cuts in payments to Medicare+Choice \nplans. After these cuts went into effect, one out of every four plans \npulled out of the Medicare program. Millions of beneficiaries lost the \nextra benefits these plans had provided.\n  Given this track record, I have grave concerns about what the \nMedicare cuts in the Reid bill would do to Medicare beneficiaries and \nthe doctors, hospitals, and other providers who treat them. I have even \ngreater concerns about using any estimated savings from these cuts to \nfund this new entitlement program for the uninsured.\n  That is why we should pass the Gregg amendment. Rather than relying \non cuts that could devastate the Medicare Program, let's find a stable \nand reliable funding source that we could use to pay for health care \nreform. The Gregg amendment says that savings from any Medicare cuts \nshould be reserved for the Medicare Program. That way, if the \nWashington experts again got it wrong, we will not have already spent \nall the savings on another program.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 1 p.m. today be under the same conditions and limitations as \npreviously ordered; further, that the prohibition on amendments and \nmotions also be extended until 1 p.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 25 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman and I \nthank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  I come to the floor to respond to some of the things I have heard \nover the last several days with respect to the legislation before us \nand to try to give--in some cases--the other side of this story because \nI am increasingly concerned, as I listen to this debate, that people \nhave started to create their own facts, and that is never useful in a \ndebate.\n  Let me start with an ad that is running--a full-page ad--back in my \nhome State of North Dakota, with the headline:\n\n       Isn't Senator Conrad Supposed to be a ``Deficit Hawk?''\n\n  It starts by saying some nice things about me. It says:\n\n       Senator Kent Conrad has a long, admirable record as a \n     deficit hawk. For years, he has advocated for fiscal sanity \n     and smaller deficits, and he has served North Dakota well.\n\n  I wish they would have just ended the ad there. That would have been \na very good ad. But they go on to say:\n\n       Now, federal spending is totally out of control:\n\n  And they give some examples. Then they say:\n\n       On top of all this, Congress is considering a new $900 \n     billion health care entitlement, with some estimates saying \n     it could actually cost more than $2 trillion!\n\n  Well, the $2 trillion number is a number that somebody has concocted. \nThat is not the 10-year cost of this bill. The 10-year cost of this \nbill is between $800 billion and $900 billion, as the ad says. Then \nthey go on to conclude:\n\n       America can't afford it. And North Dakotans can't afford \n     it.\n\n  Of course, this ad is not paid for by North Dakotans. But they are \nclear that: ``North Dakotans can't afford it.''\n\n       Senator Conrad: how can you even consider this?\n\n  ``How can you even consider this?'' Well, because I have read the \nbill, and this bill does not increase the deficit; this bill reduces \nthe deficit. That is not my opinion as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. That is what the Congressional Budget Office--which is \nnonpartisan, which is the objective scorekeeper--they are the ones we \nlook to\n\n[[Page S12578]]\n\nfor analysis of legislation before Congress. Objective analysis--not \nmade up analysis. Here is their conclusion.\n  This is the Congressional Budget Office estimate of the Senate health \nplan, the legislation that is before us now. It reduces the deficit \nover the budget period by $130 billion. It does not increase the \ndeficit, despite all the speeches that have been given. It reduces the \ndeficit by $130 billion.\n  Our colleagues get different numbers because they come out here and \nsay: Well, if this part of the bill were not included, it would \nincrease the deficit. But that is not the bill. The bill before us has \nbeen analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, and they say the bill \nbefore us--the one we will be voting on--reduces the deficit by $130 \nbillion in the first budget window.\n  In the second budget window--the second 10 years--the Congressional \nBudget Office says:\n\n       CBO expects that the bill, if enacted, would reduce federal \n     budget deficits over the ensuing decade [beyond 2019] \n     relative to those projected under current law--with a total \n     effect during that decade that is in a broad range around \n     one-quarter percent of [gross domestic product].\n\n  What is one-quarter of 1 percent of gross domestic product in the \nsecond decade? It is $650 billion. If you take, then, in total what the \nCongressional Budget Office is telling us to 2019--the first 10 years--\nit reduces the deficit by $130 billion. In the second 10 years, it \nreduces the deficit by one-quarter of 1 percent of GDP, which is equal \nto $650 billion.\n  So to my friends who ran this ad in every newspaper in my State, \nwondering why a deficit hawk might support this legislation, it is \nbecause this legislation reduces the deficit, both in the first 10 \nyears and in the second 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. That record should be clear.\n  Do we have a problem long term? Absolutely, we do. As this chart \nshows, Medicare and Medicaid combined are going from 2 percent of GDP, \nback in 1980, to 12.7 percent of GDP on the current trend line by 2050, \nand that is an unsustainable course. I think we all understand that. \nMedicare and Medicaid are increasing very dramatically as a share of \nour gross domestic product, and they are a key reason we are seeing the \ngross Federal deficit expand, and expand dramatically.\n  We now project the gross Federal debt to be 114 percent of the gross \ndomestic product in 2019. That is almost as high as it was after World \nWar II, which is the previous record in this country. Already we are \napproaching 100 percent of GDP with the economic downturn and with all \nthe pressures that exist with two wars and a very sharp reduction in \nrevenue in this country.\n  The reality is, for those who say we do not have to do anything, \nMedicare is going broke. It is already cash negative; that is, more \nmoney is going out from Medicare than is coming in under the revenue \nsources of Medicare. The trustees tell us it will be insolvent by \n2017--2 years earlier than forecast just last year.\n  So those who say we do not have to do anything--just steady as she \ngoes, the status quo is fine--are detached from any financial reality. \nThe bill before us has significant Medicare savings: provisions that \nlower cost growth without harming beneficiaries.\n  Let me give some examples. In the legislation before us, we reduce \noverpayments to private Medicare Advantage plans. We reform the health \ncare delivery system. By the way, this is the provision that most \nexperts say is the single most important component of this legislation, \nand it has gotten almost no attention in this debate. It has gotten \nalmost no attention in the media--reforming the delivery system so \ninstead of paying for procedures, we pay for quality outcomes.\n  We incentivize those integrated systems such as the Mayo Clinic, such \nas the Cleveland Clinic, such as Geisinger in Pennsylvania and \nIntermountain Healthcare out in Utah that have much lower cost and the \nhighest quality outcomes. We are going to, for the first time, provide \nmajor incentives for other systems to adopt their good practices. This \nis what health care reformers say are really the most important parts \nof the legislation.\n  We also improve payment accuracy, crack down on fraud and waste, \nwhich we all know is significant in Medicare, perhaps as much as $70 \nbillion a year. We are going to beef up very substantially the moves to \ngo after those who are committing fraud in this system. It also slows \nthe growth in reimbursements to providers, many of whom will benefit \nfrom over 30 million newly insured people.\n  So people ask: How is this bill paid for? One of the biggest ways of \npaying for it is to go to the providers and say: Your future increases \nwill not be as large as previously indicated. You are not going to have \ngrowth as much as you had previously thought in your level of \nreimbursements. These groups have, by and large, agreed to that \nprospect. Why? Because, No. 1, they know there are savings to be \naccrued. No. 2, they know that with over 30 million more people being \ncovered, they will have a big increase in business, and they will have \na sharp reduction in uncompensated care.\n  So that is why the hospitals have agreed to more than $150 billion in \nsavings over ten years and that is why nursing homes and home health \ncare have agreed to significant savings and why the pharmaceutical \nindustry has as well. Let me say, before we are done, I believe that \nwhat is in the bill for nursing homes will be further modified so it is \nnot as much of a reduction in their increases as was anticipated. \nBecause if you look at who has put up how much, there is rough \nagreement from these providers to take these reductions in their \nincreases. They are not cuts in the sense of getting less next year \nthan they got the year before, it is getting less of an increase.\n  Interestingly enough, an argument made by Republicans when they were \nadvocating reductions and savings out of Medicare were far higher, far \nbigger than anything that is in this bill. This is an amusing point for \nthose who have been listening to this debate. Our Republican colleagues \nare now decrying savings out of Medicare which just a year ago they \nthemselves were advocating. They had their President come forward with \na proposal with much bigger savings than those in this bill. We will \nget to that in a minute.\n  Here is what some of my colleagues have been saying on deficit and \ndebt because the rhetoric coming from our colleagues on the other side \nhas been interesting, and the difference between their rhetoric and \ntheir amendments is striking. Here is what they have said. This is \nSenator McConnell, the Republican leader:\n\n       We're heading down a dangerous road. It's long past time \n     for the administration and its allies in Congress to face the \n     hard choices that Americans have had to face over the past \n     several months. No more spending money we don't have on \n     things we don't need. No more debt.\n\n  That is Leader McConnell.\n  Senator Kyl, again, a member of the Republican leadership:\n\n       We have got to reduce deficit spending to manageable levels \n     and ultimately learn to live within our means, and the sooner \n     the better.\n\n  Senator McCain, who offered the first Republican amendment:\n\n       This staggering deficit threatens our children's and \n     grandchildren's future and simply cannot be sustained. I call \n     on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to chart a \n     different course toward real change and fiscal \n     responsibility.\n\n  Well, that is what they have said in their speeches. What have they \ndone with their amendments with respect to debt? This is curious. Every \nmajor amendment they have offered was to increase the debt, to increase \ndeficits. After all the brave speeches about how important it was to be \nfiscally responsible, what amendments have they offered? Well, Senator \nMcCain offered the first one to eliminate the Medicare savings. That \nwould increase the deficit and increase the debt by $441 billion. So \nmuch for the brave speeches.\n  The Hatch amendment was to continue overpayments to Medicare \nAdvantage plans, increasing the deficit and debt by $120 billion. So \nmuch for the brave speeches.\n  The Johanns amendment to eliminate the home health care savings would \nincrease the deficit and debt by $42 billion.\n  So far our Republican colleagues, who have given such strong speeches \nabout the need to reduce deficits and debt, every single major \namendment they have offered have been to increase deficits and debt and \nso far the running\n\n[[Page S12579]]\n\ntotal is over $440 billion that our colleagues on the other side would \nincrease the deficit and debt by, if their amendments had been adopted.\n  The good thing is, there are other people watching, other people who \nare listening to the speeches and comparing the speeches to the \namendments and comparing the speeches to the policy prescriptions of \nour colleagues on the other side. Here is what the American Association \nof Retired Persons said on November 20:\n\n       Opponents of health care reform won't rest. They are using \n     myths and misinformation to distort the truth and wrongly \n     suggesting that Medicare will be harmed. After a lifetime of \n     hard work, don't seniors deserve better?\n\n  On November 18, the American Association of Retired Persons said \nthis:\n\n       The new Senate bill--\n\n  Talking about the bill before us--\n\n     makes improvements to the Medicare program by creating a new \n     annual wellness benefit, providing free preventive benefits, \n     and--most notably for AARP members--reducing drug costs for \n     seniors who fall into the dreaded Medicare doughnut hole, a \n     costly gap in prescription drug coverage.\n\n  The Federation of American Hospitals, on November 20, said:\n\n       Hospitals always will stand by senior citizens.\n\n  The American Medical Association said, on that same day:\n\n       We are working to put the scare tactics to bed once and for \n     all and inform patients about the benefits of health reform.\n\n  On November 16, the Catholic Health Association of the United States \nsaid:\n\n       The possibility that hospitals might pull out of Medicare \n     is very, very unfounded. Catholic hospitals would never give \n     up on Medicare patients.\n\n  Again, from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare on November 19:\n\n       We are . . . very well aware of the positive impact health \n     reform can have on the future of the Medicare program and its \n     beneficiaries.\n\n  One of the things that is most striking to me in listening to our \nfriends on the other side is they are trying to scare people into \nthinking that the savings in Medicare are going to disadvantage \nMedicare beneficiaries. What is most remarkable is, the last time our \nfriends on the other side offered a budget, it was offered in the Bush \nadministration. Their savings out of Medicare in that budget were $481 \nbillion over 10 years, far larger than the savings in this bill. \nInterestingly enough, I never heard a single Republican colleague say \none peep about those savings out of Medicare. There was no suggestion \nit threatened grandma. There was no suggestion this was going to ruin \nMedicare. There was no suggestion these savings out of Medicare were \ngoing to undermine Medicare beneficiaries. That was their budget. That \nwas their President's budget, to save $481 billion out of Medicare.\n  Let's compare it to the savings in Medicare in this bill. The Bush \nadministration, the last budget they offered, had $481 billion in 10-\nyear savings out of Medicare. The net reduction in this bill is $380 \nbillion. I would ask my colleagues on the side opposite: What is the \nbigger number? Is $481 billion bigger or is $380 billion bigger? They \ndidn't say one word in opposition to Medicare savings from the previous \nadministration, their administration, when it was $481 billion, but now \nthis administration has savings of $380 billion on a net basis, all of \na sudden the sky is falling and it is the end of the world. I would say \nthe hypocrisy meter is on tilt when I listen to these speeches from the \nopposite side.\n  Medicare Advantage plans. I have heard so many speeches here about \nMedicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage was originally put in place to \nsave money for Medicare. In fact, it was capped at 97 percent of \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare. What has happened? Is it saving \nmoney? No. On average, it is costing 114 percent of traditional fee-\nfor-service Medicare. In fact, there are plans in Medicare Advantage \nthat are costing 150 percent of traditional fee-for-service Medicare. \nWe have a runaway train. We have a program in Medicare Advantage--at \nleast some elements of it, to be fair, because some of them are working \nfine--some elements of it are a runaway deficit train, costing 150 \npercent of traditional fee-for-service Medicare. These are the hard \nrealities Medicare Advantage is contributing to Medicare's fiscal \nproblem.\n  This is the MedPAC report from March of 2009:\n\n       In 2009, payments to Medicare Advantage plans continue to \n     exceed what Medicare would spend for similar beneficiaries in \n     traditional fee-for-service. Medicare Advantage payments per \n     enrollee are projected to be 114 percent of comparable fee-\n     for-service spending for 2009. . . . This added cost \n     contributes to the worsening long-range financial \n     sustainability of the Medicare program.\n\n  In plain English, it is contributing to Medicare heading for \ninsolvency, and this bill does something about it. It moves Medicare \nAdvantage to a more sound and sustainable course.\n  By the way, interestingly enough, the estimates by the Congressional \nBudget Office are, there will be more people in Medicare Advantage \nafter this bill passes. After this bill passes, there will still be \nmore people in Medicare Advantage than have been in the past. So \nMedicare Advantage will go forward, but the abuses will be run out of \nthe system, the overpayments will be reduced, and that will help extend \nthe solvency of Medicare.\n  Question: Does this bill that is before us extend the solvency of \nMedicare or does it reduce the years of solvency of Medicare? What is \nthe right answer? The correct answer is, this legislation extends the \nsolvency of Medicare by at least 4 years and perhaps 5. We know the \nHouse bill has been scored. It extends Medicare solvency, according to \nthe CMS actuaries, 5 years. The bill that came out of the Finance \nCommittee extended solvency of Medicare by at least 4 years, and most \nestimates are, the bill before us does somewhat better.\n  Back on the question of Medicare Advantage:\n\n       Taxpayers pay 50 percent more for beneficiaries enrolled in \n     Medicare Advantage plans in some areas.\n\n  I asked CBO last year: Is Medicare Advantage saving money which was \nits original intention? They came back and said not only is it not \nsaving money:\n\n       It is on average costing 14 percent more, or 114 percent of \n     traditional fee-for-service Medicare and, in some places, the \n     Medicare Advantage pricing benchmarks currently range from \n     100 percent to over 150 percent of local per capita spending \n     in the fee-for-service traditional Medicare sector.\n\n  Facts are stubborn things. The fact is, this bill reduces the deficit \nby $130 billion over the first 10 years and by as much as $650 billion \nover the second 10 years. Those are facts, according to CBO, not facts \nmade up by colleagues on the floor, for one purpose or another.\n  This bill extends the solvency of Medicare by at least 4 years and \nperhaps as long as 5 years. That is not all that needs to be done, but \nit is a beginning. Those who want to oppose it and vote against it will \nhave to explain why they don't want to extend the solvency of Medicare, \nwhy they don't want to achieve savings, why they don't want to go after \nthe fraud and abuse that exists in the system.\n  Let me say with respect to the Gregg amendment, I have enormous \nrespect for Senator Gregg, but his amendment is designed to kill this \nbill.\n  Let's just be clear. That is the purpose of the amendment. If you \nwant to kill the bill that reduces the deficit, the bill that will \nreduce premiums for a significant majority of the American people; if \nyou want to kill the bill that begins the critically important process \nof reform, then you ought to vote for the Gregg amendment. If you want \nthis bill to be able to advise and deliver on the promises made to the \nAmerican people about what must be done to solve Medicare--not to solve \nit but to extend its solvency; if you want to have legislation that \nbegins the critically important process of reform, then reject the \nGregg amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wasn't going to take any part of this 30 \nminutes, but I can't help it. I will allocate myself 5 minutes.\n  I keep running into this comment that the Republicans were willing to \ncut $481 billion from Medicare. Would somebody show me where we cut \n$481 billion from Medicare? We didn't do it, and this bill won't cut \n$464 billion. Seniors won't let you do that. We didn't even propose it; \nthe President proposed that. We knew it wasn't going to happen. You \ncannot cut Medicare without\n\n[[Page S12580]]\n\nhaving the seniors all upset because they understand their program is \ngoing broke--going broke.\n  That is why we have had this series of amendments. We have tried to \ncome up with one that would actually solve the problem. We have been \nemphasizing the problem. The Gregg amendment takes care of the problem. \nThat is why we brought up the Gregg amendment and why we should pass \nit. Rather than relying on cuts that can devastate the Medicare \nProgram, we can find a stable and reliable funding source to pay for \nhealth care reform.\n  The Gregg amendment says that savings from any Medicare cuts should \nbe reserved for the Medicare Program. That is saying that if these \nthings are all possible that we are talking about as being possible and \nas being cost savers, if they really work, put it into Medicare. If you \nreally want to extend Medicare, don't just say you are going to extend \nMedicare and then overlook a few things.\n  I have a little chart I haven't had a chance to use yet.\n  It was reiterated here that this bill is ``deficit neutral.'' Yes, \naccording to CBO, it is--if you assume that Medicare physician payments \nwill be cut 20 percent in 2011 and that they will be cut 40 percent \nover the next 10 years. We hold the physicians hostage every year, 1 \nyear at a time, to get something out of them, and then we keep the cuts \nfrom happening. These cuts aren't going to happen. If they did happen, \nit would not be deficit neutral.\n  The bill makes no provision for paying this 20 percent that will be \ncut in 2011 or for the 40 percent over the next 10 years. There is no \nprovision. So that part is going to be false as to having a deficit-\nneutral bill.\n  A massive new tax will be imposed on employer health benefits, \nhitting 31 percent of American family plans by 2019, if that does not \nhappen--and I think people will notice the tax in a whole bunch of \ndifferent ways--then this assumption is wrong and it is not deficit \nneutral.\n  Also, it relies on us cutting $464 million from Medicare. The Actuary \nsaid this level of cuts would bankrupt hospitals and threaten patient \ncare.\n  I have a typo on the chart. It is supposed to be $464 billion, not \nmillion. I am still having trouble with that.\n  That amount would fund the State of Wyoming for 320 years. It is a \nbig number. We are talking about cutting it by that much. If we don't \ncut this and we use this to pay for the other entitlement, the bill is \nnot deficit neutral. CBO says that.\n  Everybody is entitled to their own opinions, but the facts are there. \nThe facts say that if, if, if. We are not going to do those ``ifs.'' I \nwill not go into that point, even though I am a little upset.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a quick question?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I know the Senator from Idaho wants to speak, but if I can \nask the ranking member a quick question.\n  Mr. CRAPO. That is fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. I heard the Senator from Montana and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota say the amendment I have pending would make it impossible \nfor them, under this bill, to create their entitlement programs because \nthe Medicare money that will be taken from Medicare would not be \navailable. My amendment says they cannot do that. It says Medicare \ncannot be used to create new entitlements, but it doesn't say those \nentitlement programs cannot be created if they want to pay for them \nsome other way. So really what they are saying is they don't have the \nidea, the courage, or the will to pay for them in a way other than by \nstealing from Medicare. Isn't that what they are saying?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator from New Hampshire is absolutely correct. I am \nglad he came here to make that point on the amendment we are going to \nvote on this afternoon. It is critical. If you want to save Medicare, \nthis amendment will save Medicare. It doesn't prohibit their programs \nfrom happening. They can still do the entitlements, but they have to be \nsure they are paid for. That is one of the problems. To say they are \ngoing to take the $464 billion from Medicare and put it into these \nother entitlements, that is not fair.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I am here to speak in support of the \nGregg amendment. I rise in support of my colleague's amendment because \nit would prohibit using Medicare cuts in the Democratic health care \nbill to pay for new government spending.\n  It is interesting, as you listen to the debate--in fact, I was \ninterested to hear my colleague from North Dakota say the Republican \namendments would increase the deficit. They would only do that if you \nassume all of the spending in the bill, which is also opposed by the \nRepublicans.\n  One of the key parts of the debate that I think needs to be \nemphasized here is, among all of the other things this bill does, when \nyou have the first full 10 years of real implementation of the bill, it \nis a $2.5 trillion increase in Federal spending, paid for with hundreds \nof billions--in fact, trillions in new taxes and cuts in Medicare.\n  The purpose of the Gregg amendment is to require that when we do \nachieve savings in Medicare, instead of it being used to just transfer \ninto a new government entitlement program, making Medicare less \nsolvent, we use the savings for Medicare itself.\n  In the first 10 years of their bill, we will see cuts in Medicare by \n$465 billion, every dollar of which will simply be transferred over to \na massive new Federal entitlement program. If you actually take the \nfirst 10 full years of the implementation of the bill--and recall that \nthere are some budget gimmicks being played to say it is not generating \na deficit, and it is not really implemented fully until about 4 years \ninto the bill--if you take the first 10 years of implementation, the \ncuts to Medicare are not $465 billion but $1 trillion, and $3 trillion \nover a longer period of time as we evaluate the bill moving into the \nfuture.\n\n  In Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund, annual outlays already \nexceed the annual income, so the fund is drawing down its holdings to \npay full benefits--but not for long. By 2017, the HI trust fund will be \ninsolvent and will no longer able to pay full benefits for seniors. \nThese cuts will make it worse.\n  This amendment provides that the major provisions in the underlying \nbill, including the subsidies and Medicaid expansion, cannot go into \neffect unless the Director of OMB and the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services certify that all of the projected spending in the \nbill is offset with savings, but that savings shall exclude any changes \nto Medicare or Social Security. In other words, we require that \nMedicare savings be used for Medicare and Social Security savings be \nused for Social Security. This will ensure that the savings generated \nfrom the Medicare cuts in the bill don't go toward the creation of a \nnew entitlement program at the expense of our seniors. If the non-\nMedicare savings don't offset the new costs, then the Secretary of the \nTreasury and the Secretary of HHS are prohibited from implementing new \nspending or revenue-reduction provisions in the bill.\n  Republicans have opposed the Reid bill's harmful cuts to Medicare \nthrough three votes. Should those cuts remain, the Gregg amendment \nmakes sure Medicare savings go to making the program more solvent, not \nto offsetting the new entitlement programs.\n  Congress should not raid Medicare--a program that has $38 trillion in \nunfunded liabilities--and use it as a piggy bank to pay for a new \nhealth care entitlement. The government already has $70 trillion in \nunfunded obligations over the next 75 years, and we should not add to \nit with these dangerous provisions. The $70 trillion in unfunded \nobligations represents a burden of $600,000 per American household. The \nReid bill carries an estimated cost of $2.5 trillion over the first 10 \nyears that it is fully implemented. It is fully loaded with budget \ngimmicks.\n  Earlier in the debate, we voted 100 to 0 for the Bennet amendment--a \nrule of construction--which stated that nothing in the bill ``shall \nresult in the reduction of guaranteed'' Medicare benefits. In contrast \nwith the Bennet amendment, the Gregg amendment actually guarantees \nthere will be Medicare for future generations, while guarding against \nthe creation of a new unfunded entitlement this country cannot afford.\n\n[[Page S12581]]\n\n  I wish to respond a little bit to some of the arguments my colleague \nfrom North Dakota just made.\n  I mentioned we have had three votes already to try to take these \nMedicare cuts out of the bill. All of those votes have failed. The \nSenator from North Dakota indicated those votes would have reduced the \ndeficit or would have caused a huge deficit problem. That is only true \nif you assume the $2.5 trillion of spending in the bill will continue.\n  But those who claim there is a reduction in the deficit in this bill \ncan do so only if they assume three things--one, if they assume the \nbudget gimmicks are implemented. They have not included the SGR \npayments for physicians--a $245 billion cost over the next 10 years. It \nis just not in the bill because it cannot be accounted for.\n  Second, they have delayed the cost implementation portions of the \nbill by 4 years now, so that they have 10 years of revenue and 4 years \nof spending, so they can claim it balances. Even then, they cannot \nclaim this bill helps the deficit unless they assume the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of new taxes and the hundreds of billions of \ndollars of cuts in Medicare. If any one of those items was taken out--\nthe Medicare cuts, the tax increases, or the budget gimmicks--this bill \nwould be shown to be what it is: a huge expansion of the Federal \nGovernment that is going to necessitate increased tax burdens and \nreductions in spending, as well as budget gimmicks to hide what cannot \nbe hidden in order to claim it doesn't generate a deficit. I think most \nAmericans understand that those kinds of gimmicks are the things we see \nall the time in Congress when we are trying to make it look as if we \nare not engaging in debt spending and increasing the national debt.\n  The bottom line here is that there is a significant amount of reform \nthat can be achieved, that can reduce the cost of health care, that can \nreduce the cost of health insurance premiums, that we could agree to on \na bipartisan basis if we were not stuck in this debate on the \ninsistence that we create a massive new intrusion of the Federal \nGovernment into the operation and control of the health care economy \nand the development of another massive new Federal entitlement program \nat the expense of some of the current entitlement programs.\n  I haven't even talked about what is being done in Medicaid yet. I am \nsure others will talk about that.\n  This bill, as I said, will increase spending and the size of the \ngovernment by $2.5 trillion. It will cut Medicare benefits over that \nsame true full period by $1 trillion. It will increase taxes by \nhundreds of billions of dollars, and over that true full 10-year period \nof implementation, over $1 trillion. It will force the neediest of our \nuninsured in this country not into the opportunity to gain insurance \ncoverage but into another failing entitlement program, which is \nMedicaid. It will drive a massive, unfunded mandate onto our States, \nwhich are already trying to figure out how they are going to deal with \ntheir fiscal problems. It will cause the cost of health insurance to go \nup for 30 percent of all Americans immediately and for the 70 percent \nwho are in the large groups and get insurance from large companies, and \nthey will basically see no significant savings and ultimately more \ntaxes.\n  The bottom line is, we are not going to see an increase in the \nability to control or handle the cost of health care. We are going to \nsee an increase in government, an increase in government controls, an \nincrease in taxes, and a reduction in the stability of our Medicare \nprograms. That is not the way we should approach reform.\n  The Gregg amendment simply says let's create a lockbox, if you will, \nfor Medicare, the same kind of lockbox we need for Social Security to \nkeep the Congress from continuing to raid Social Security. Let's put it \ninto place to ensure that all these great statements we hear on the \nfloor about how we want to protect and preserve Medicare are enforced.\n  It simply creates by power of law, by force of law, the necessary \nmechanism to help all of us be sure that what we are talking about on \nthe floor actually happens; namely, that we protect Medicare from being \nraided for the establishment of yet again another massive Federal \nentitlement program.\n  Madam President, I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, may I inquire as to the time arrangement?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority has 5\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe majority has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, before we continue, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be extended for debate only until 2 p.m., with \nthe limitations of the previous order remaining in effect.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I usually don't say much at these debates, \nbut today I am going to make that an exception. I allocate the rest of \nour time to me. There have been a lot of comments here and they need to \nbe clarified.\n  I do want to pass a bill that decreases health insurance premiums. I \nhave traveled thousands of miles across the State of Wyoming, and every \ntime I talk with somebody about health care, they ask me to do \nsomething to lower their health care costs--to lower their health care \ncosts. That is what most people in America want.\n  American families cannot afford to pay ever increasing health \ninsurance premiums. Small businesses cannot afford premiums that \nincrease twice as fast as inflation.\n  Earlier this week, CBO issued--actually, it was last week--its long \nawaited report on the impact the Reid bill would have on insurance \npremiums. CBO said the premiums for individuals and families purchasing \ntheir health insurance will increase by 10 to 13 percent.\n  That means if the Reid bill is enacted, these folks will pay 10 to 13 \npercent more--more--for their health insurance. The legislation that \nits sponsors say is intended to lower health care costs will actually \nincrease insurance premiums.\n  We should not be surprised by this finding. Several well-known \nactuarial business consulting firms have already issued reports that \nsaid the exact same thing: The bill increases health insurance \npremiums.\n  What is surprising is that some of my Democratic colleagues have \nargued that this CBO report provides support for enacting health \nreform. The New York Times even described this as ``Good News on \nPremiums.''\n  These statements defy logic and common sense. The bill attempts to \ncompletely restructure the nonemployer insurance market and impose \nmassive new government mandates. Is anybody surprised that as a result \nthe costs will go up?\n  Yet some of my Democratic colleagues have attempted to cherry-pick \ndata and use selective quotes to try to mask what CBO said. For \ninstance, some of them have pointed out how CBO said the Reid bill \nwould lower premiums by 7 to 10 percent because of changes in the rules \ngoverning the insurance market.\n  As the Senate's only accountant, I take offense to these kinds of \nmisrepresentations. Giving my Democratic colleagues the benefit of the \ndoubt, I will assume they do not understand the differences between \ngross and net numbers.\n  I am not going to try to do a lot of numbers here. I did that once in \ncommittee and my staff watching back at the office--I got to ask the \naccountants at the SEC important questions at the time Enron was \nfailing. You could see this little wedge of people seated behind the \npeople testifying, and they were all asleep. I want to use this chart \ninstead.\n  CBO did say the premiums would go down 7 to 10 percent due to \ninsurance market changes. They also said premiums would go down another \n7 to 10 percent because healthier people would sign up for insurance. \nWhat my colleagues forgot to mention or do not want to mention is that \nCBO also said that premiums would go up by 27 to 30 percent because the \nbill has so many mandates and requires most Americans to purchase more \nexpensive coverage.\n  Yes, the Federal Government is going to tell you what you need for \ninsurance, and then they are going to fine you if you do not get it. \nMaybe this chart helps to explain it.\n  We can see the net impact. Here is the 27 percent in increases \nbecause of\n\n[[Page S12582]]\n\nthe mandates and the requirement to purchase more expensive coverage. \nThis is the decrease that I mentioned. But you cannot just talk about \nthis decrease and you cannot just talk about this decrease. You can \ntalk about the net, and the net is a 13-percent increase in premiums.\n  I urge anyone who questions what I am saying to read the CBO letter. \nIt is on the CBO Web site. Page 4 of the letter clearly states premiums \nwill increase by 10 to 13 percent. That amounts to $2,100 for families \npurchasing coverage on their own. That does not meet the requirement \nthat people in Wyoming think they are going to get. And the younger \nthey are, the more surprised they are going to be because we get rid of \nthe ratings, and young people will be paying considerably more. They \nare already paying into Medicare for seniors without getting any \npromise that will last until the time they become seniors, unless we \npass something like the Judd Gregg amendment.\n  We have to protect that Medicare money to make sure it goes to \nMedicare and only Medicare if we are going to make sure Medicare stays \nsolvent. We have to make that as a promise to the kids paying into the \nsystem now. They and their employers, and the amount the employers pay \nin, is the amount they could have in their own pocket if the employer \ndid not have to pay it. But they are paying that so seniors can have \nthe Medicare benefits, and we want them to have those benefits. We \nshould not at this point take money from Medicare and build new \nentitlements and expect those same young people to pay an increased \namount on while they pay an increase in their insurance premiums. Their \ninsurance increase is going to be a lot more than 27 percent. In \nWyoming, it was estimated to be around 300 percent. I think they will \nnotice. I think they will be upset. If this bill passes, there will be \na revolution in this country when people realize what has been thrust \non them in this bill.\n  I yield the floor and keep the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think everybody who is interested in \nthe subject ought to read the CBO letter. Different people make \ndifferent claims about the CBO letter, but I think it is only fair to \nread the entire letter, refer to the entire letter, not bits and pieces \nand parts of the CBO letter.\n  For example, it has been stated that CBO claims the average \npremiums--we are talking about the nongroup market. That is the \nindividual market now. In fact, that is page 6 of their letter which \nsaid average premiums would be 27 percent to 30 percent higher because \nof greater coverage. That is the statement we just heard.\n  The CBO letter does say that. But I think it is also important to say \nthat those people would be getting much higher quality insurance \nbecause of all the insurance market reforms we provide for in this \nlegislation.\n  Even more important, CBO goes on to say on that same page in that \nsame letter:\n\n       The majority of these enrollees, about 57 percent, would \n     receive subsidies via the new insurance exchanges, and those \n     subsidies on average would cover two-thirds of the total \n     premium.\n\n  It is true that some in the so-called nongroup market in the year \n2016 would find their premiums go up without subsidies. I think that \nfigure nets out to about 7 percent. But they are getting better \ninsurance, much better insurance than they currently have because the \ninsurance they buy in the exchange--we are talking about 2016-- will be \nmuch better insurance than they now have.\n\n  According to everybody else, a fair reading of the CBO letter leads \none to conclude that premiums will basically go down by a little bit--\nnot a lot, a little bit--or be about the same. For example, I have \nheard on this floor the assertion, but no reference, no authority for \nthis assertion--I heard this morning the assertion that for employees \nwho work for larger companies, their premiums would go up. The fact is \nthe CBO letter said just the opposite.\n  One can make the assertion premiums go up, but I think it is unfair \nto the American people to make rhetorical claims that are not backed up \nwith authority. The CBO letter is probably the best authority we have \nfor us to work with, and that letter says flatly that premiums for \nthose persons--that is about five-sixths of Americans--would go down, \nnot up, as has been asserted without the authority on the floor.\n  I am making the opposite assertion they will go down by about 3 \npercent. Not a lot but 3 percent. But my authority is the Congressional \nBudget Office. That is what they say.\n  Basically, 93 percent of premiums will either go down or be about the \nsame. I mentioned a 3-percent reduction for the employees. Five-sixths \nof persons work for big companies and in the so-called small group \nmarket, CBO says--this is all the year 2016--premiums will be up 1 \npercent or down by 2 percentage points. It depends on who gets the \ncredit. Some will, some will not.\n  Let's not forget small business gets credit under this legislation, \ntoo. I am not sure whether CBO calculated that in. A fair reading is \nthe small group market, that is about 13 percent of Americans, it is, \nsay, a net minus 1 because some go up 1 percent and some down by 2 \npercent.\n  Basically, if we compare apples to apples, that is what insurance \nwill be in 2016--premiums will go down for those in the nongroup \nmarket, down by 14 or 20 percent. Because those with better benefits \nwill find their premiums might go up by 10 to 13 percent and add in the \ntax credits which one has to do because that is the legislation, on a \nnet basis, for two-thirds of those folks, their premiums will be lower \nby a large amount. By ``large,'' I mean by about 56 to 59 percent.\n  Who knows what is going to happen in 2016. CBO is giving their best \nshot based on this legislation. That is what their letter says. I have \nthe letter right in front of me.\n  I might also say that CBO says--I don't know if it is in this letter \nor another letter--the bill is deficit neutral, and basically over 10 \nyears--I think a 20-year period--the net effect is not much more \ngovernment or less government, it is about the same as today. There are \nwild assertions: Oh, it is bigger government. CBO said government's \ninvolvement in people's lives will be basically no more or less than \ntoday, and that is partly because of a lot more choice people will \nhave. They will have a lot more choice in the exchanges, a lot of \nchoice under the exchanges. It is that choice which will encourage \ngreater competition, and greater competition will encourage lower \nprices. At least that is the theory. Most of us tend to think \ncompetition lowers prices, and that is what the legislation does.\n  Unless the Senator from Wyoming wishes to speak, Senator Kerry, on \nour side, wishes to speak for at least 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I might pick up, if I may, on this issue \nof premiums. First, let me say it is astonishing to me how we are \ncontinuing here to have a debate about mythology and not reality. We \nkeep trying to bring it back to reality. Our friends on the other side \nof the aisle, for better or worse, seem to be content to continue to \ntry to scare America's seniors and to try to frighten people about this \nlegislation overall.\n  I was listening to the debate about premiums, whether premiums are \ngoing to go up or premiums are going to go down. Let me share with \npeople who are listening, particularly seniors, who I hope will not be \nscared by the false assertions that have been made; let me tell you \nabout the experience in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where we \npassed landmark health care reform 3 years ago.\n  Since implementing this plan in which we require--we require--every \nsingle citizen in the State to buy insurance, and employers are \npenalized if they do not provide insurance, the fact is that today in \nMassachusetts, the plan is working. The companies like it and the \ncitizens like it because they have the coverage. In fact, coverage by \ncompanies, corporations, has gone up since we put it in place. There \nare more companies that now participate and find that it works for them \nthan before. But most important, 432,000 people now have gained \nquality, affordable health care coverage where they didn't have it \nbefore.\n\n[[Page S12583]]\n\n  We have the lowest uninsured numbers in the United States of America \nand we are proud of that. In Massachusetts, 97.3 percent of our \ncitizens--more than we are attempting to cover under the legislation we \nwant to pass here--97.3 percent of our citizens are covered and have \nhealth insurance. Equally important, the newly insured have enrolled in \nall types of private and public coverage. There are 18 percent who are \nin the State's Medicaid; 40 percent are in something called \nCommonwealth Care, which is administered by the Commonwealth, the new \nsubsidized plan; 33 percent are in employer-based coverage; and 9 \npercent are in a nongroup purchase plan.\n  Let me say to the Senate, health reform has improved access in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. There are fewer insured individuals who \nreport cost as a barrier to being able to get care. In the last year, \nmost Massachusetts residents--88 percent--had at least one visit to a \ndoctor and 78 percent had a preventive care visit. A recent State \nsurvey found that 92 percent of individuals reported having a primary \ncare provider in our State. As coverage has increased, the number of \nuninsured individuals going to hospitals for free care has declined. So \nwe have reduced the number of people who sort of unfairly require \neverybody else to pay for their coverage when they go to a hospital and \nthe hospital covers them, and it is paid for unevenly by the people who \nhave coverage and by the corporations that have to make up the \ndifference. That has gone down now. Now the free care has gone down \nbecause the people have a program, they have a plan, and they can go in \nand get the care that is afforded to them.\n  Here is what is important--and I say this to my friend who is \nmanaging for the Republicans right now--the average premiums in the \nindividual market fell dramatically in Massachusetts--falling from \n$8,537 at the end of 2006 to $5,143 in mid-2009. In other words, \npremiums, which we have been arguing about, in the individual market, \nfell by 40 percent, while the rest of the Nation saw a 14-percent \nincrease. Which would you rather have, a program where you spread the \nrisk more fairly, where you lower the premiums and you provide quality \ncare for people who don't have coverage today or continue the status \nquo, where you get thrown off your insurance by a company that just \nwants to take the profit and doesn't care about the fact that you got \nsick; that cuts you off after you have paid your premiums because they \nfind a little catchphrase in the clauses of the contract and they tell \nyou: Sorry, you are not covered when you are sick, or you can't even \nget covered because you have a preexisting condition when you walk in \nand you try to get the coverage.\n  I think the case is so clear it is almost unbelievable to me that we \nare here arguing about this at this point. But even more ridiculous is \nthe following: The very same people who are coming to the floor right \nnow and telling us not to slow the growth of Medicare, which is all \nthat we are doing. We are not cutting any benefits. I hope every senior \nin America hears this. It is time to end these scare tactics. There is \nno cut in benefits. Every benefit currently under the law will continue \nto be given to the seniors of this country, and that is an obligation \nwe have. But listen to what the people who are coming to tell you that \nthere are cuts in your benefits used to say. I say used to say because \nit was when they had a Republican President and they were running the \nSenate.\n  The fact is, back in June 2009, because of a report on the long-term \nbudget outlook, we know, point-blank, that if we don't cut, if we don't \ndo something to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare, by 2080, the \nFederal Government is going to spend almost as much a share of the \neconomy on just its two major health programs as it spent on all its \nprograms in every branch of government in recent years. The Medicare \nprovisions in this bill take the necessary steps to try to reform the \ndelivery system through value-based purchasing initiatives, through \nbundled payments. A bundled payment is when you give a hospital or a \ndelivery provider a sort of global budget, if you will. You give them a \nbig amount of money and you say: This is what we are giving you, and \nyou have to manage with that amount of money, instead of paying them \nfor every single time somebody comes in to do something. When you give \nthem that global budget, that so-called bundled budget, it encourages \nthe executives to do what they haven't done today, which is find the \nways to deliver the same quality of care but to deliver it more \neffectively and more efficiently.\n  We provide the creation of an innovation center to test new payments, \nto have comparative effectiveness research. Doesn't that make sense? We \nwant to know if what they are doing in Wyoming or what they are doing \nin Colorado or some other part of the country makes as much sense as \nwhat they are doing in Kentucky or Massachusetts or West Virginia \nsomewhere. By looking at the comparative effectiveness, we will all \nlearn and become more effective and more efficient at delivering \nservices. Thanks to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, we \ncreate an independent Medicare advisory board, which will have a \nprofound impact on forcing the Congress to make decisions we have \navoided for far too long.\n  Our colleagues who are here today saying: Don't do this. Don't be \nsmart about Medicare. That is effectively what they are saying because \nthat is what we are doing. We are trying to be smart about Medicare. We \nare not cutting any benefits. But they are coming here and telling you \nwe are cutting benefits, even though in June of 1995, June 28, Senator \nGrassley from Iowa came to the floor and said:\n\n       We propose slower growth of Medicare. Medicare would \n     otherwise be bankrupt.\n\n  On June 29, 1995 Senator John Kyl said:\n\n       We do heed the warning of the Medicare board of trustees \n     and limit growth to more sustainable levels to prevent \n     Medicare from going bankrupt in 2002.\n\n  Medicare, we think, is not going to go bankrupt until 2017. Thanks to \nwhat is in this bill, we actually extend the life of Medicare another \n4, definitely, and hopefully 5 years. But here is what Senator Kyl \nsaid:\n\n       Preventing Medicare from going bankrupt is what is \n     necessary to make sure seniors do not lose their benefits \n     altogether as a result of bankruptcy in 7 years.\n\n  On June 29, 1995, Senator Hatch said:\n\n       It is important to start the structural reforms which are \n     necessary to make Medicare solvent in the long term.\n\n  That is exactly what we are doing. That is precisely what we are \ndoing, and we should have the support of Senator Kyl and Senator \nGrassley and Senator Hatch.\n  On October 17, 1995, Senator Kyl said:\n\n       We also know that it is necessary to prevent the Medicare \n     program from going broke. The Republican budget will slow the \n     growth in Medicare because the Medicare trustees have warned \n     us that without doing so the system will go broke. I think \n     that it is totally irresponsible for any organization in \n     America to be scaring America's senior citizens.\n\n  I am quoting Senator John Kyl: ``. . . irresponsible for any \norganization . . . to be scaring America's seniors.'' Yet here is the \nRepublican Party scaring America's seniors.\n  I wish to talk about what this legislation does and doesn't do \nbecause every claim that is being made is simply without foundation. \nThis amendment is basically an amendment designed to try to gut this \nbill and what it does is condition any spending increases or tax \nreductions in the bill on certification that all costs in the bill are \noffset, without counting changes in Medicare or Social Security. That \nis a gimmick. It is a game. It is calculated to prevent us from taking \nthe positive changes we make and using those positive changes in an \neffective way to do even more that is positive.\n  I wish to be very specific about more that is positive, but I want \nto, first, go through each of the claims made by the other side. First \nof all, they claim the Medicare payroll taxes are used in this bill to \npay for non-Medicare benefits. They say this bill raises the Medicare \npayroll tax so we pay for non-Medicare benefits. Well, it is not true. \nIt is true the payroll tax goes up for an individual with an income \nover $200,000 and for a married couple with an income over $250,000. \nBut let's set the record straight. By law--and nothing in this bill \nchanges that law--all Medicare payroll taxes are used to improve the \nsolvency of the Medicare Program. This bill does not change that \npractice, notwithstanding anything they try to say, and it certainly \ndoesn't divert\n\n[[Page S12584]]\n\nMedicare payroll taxes to another program.\n  Even the CMS actuary has certified that because of the Medicare \nprovisions contained in this bill, the solvency of the Medicare Part A \nhospital insurance trust fund will be improved by 5 years. So what they \nare saying with respect to that is simply not true.\n  They also claim Medicare cuts are used to pay for coverage expansion. \nThis statement actually ignores the benefits seniors receive from this \nbill.\n  I think it also is important to remind people how the Medicare \nfinancing system works. I just talked about the Medicare solvency in \nthe Part A Program. The Part A Program is paid through payroll tax. The \nPart B Program and the prescription drug program is paid through a \ncombination of general revenue contributions and enrollee premiums. \nAbout 25 percent of the total program cost is paid through the premium, \nand 75 percent is paid by the general revenues. Part D financing works \nexactly the same way.\n  This bill reduces Medicare spending by a total of $463 billion. It \ndoesn't reduce the benefits, but it reduces the spending over the next \n10 years. Do you know what that does? That lowers the out-of-pocket \npremiums beneficiaries pay for Medicare physician services and \nprescription drug coverages. In effect--and this has already been \ncertified by CBO--we lower the premiums for seniors. That is the \nbenefit.\n  The opponents claim the Medicare cuts to providers are going to \nresult in decreased access. Well, it is interesting that the very same \npeople who brought us the so-called death panels, which never existed, \nare at it again with respect to access. They want to scare you. They \nwant to say you are not going to get access to a doctor or access to \nyour medical care, and they claim Medicare benefits could be harmed by \nthe bill. Yet, even as they say that, AARP, the people who represent 40 \nmillion retired Americans, says: No, no, no, that is not true. Our \npeople are protected. The American Medical Association says: No, no, \nno, that is not true. The folks we care about are protected.\n  This bill fully protects guaranteed Medicare benefits for seniors. It \nwill keep Medicare from going broke in 7 years, it extends the life of \nthe Medicare trust fund, it reduces prescription drug costs for \nseniors, it ensures seniors can keep their own doctors next year by \nblocking a 21-percent pay cut for physicians, it creates new prevention \nand wellness benefits in Medicare, and it keeps seniors in their own \nhomes and not in nursing homes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield an additional 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished leader and the Chair.\n  So the opponents of health care reform are simply not telling you \nthat the program is about to be insolvent because private insurance \ncompanies and some of the providers are, in fact, using the money \nbasically to get rich off the Medicare dollar.\n  We ought to be clear about the impact of these policies. Even with \nthe Medicare changes we have made--I hope Medicare beneficiaries hear \nthis--even with the Medicare changes in the bill, overall provider \npayments are still going to go up. They are not cut. They are going up. \nWe are simply slowing the rate of growth, and that is something \neverybody on the other side has said they want to do.\n  Wall Street analysts also have suggested that many providers, \nincluding hospitals, are going to be ``net winners.'' That is a quote, \n``net winners.'' Under our bill, they estimate hospital profitability \nwill increase with reform because more and more hospital patients will \nhave private insurance that they do not have today and the hospitals \ntoday are out of pocket because they take care of these people but they \ndo not have the insurance. Just as in Massachusetts, where the premiums \nwent down and where the expenses for free care went down, that is \nprecisely what the impact will be here.\n  We have a choice. We can do nothing, which is basically what our \ncolleagues have proposed. The status quo means Medicare is going to be \nbroke in approximately 7 years. It means seniors are going to pay \nhigher and higher premiums and cost sharing due to wasteful \noverpayments to providers. It means that each year billions of Medicare \ndollars are going to continue to be wasted, lining the pockets of the \nprivate insurance companies that kick people off indiscriminately or \ntell them they don't have the coverage when they finally get sick and \nneed the coverage. The status quo means seniors are going to continue \nto pay for their prescription drugs.\n  The fact is, this is the time for responsible action. This bill \nstrengthens the Medicare Program, it reduces premium costs for seniors, \nit restores Medicare's financial integrity, and it fortifies Medicare \nand protects Medicare benefits for America's seniors.\n  Let me point to another thing they keep saying. They keep saying this \nbill cuts billions of dollars from the Medicare Advantage Program, \nhurting the 11 million seniors who are enrolled in those programs \ntoday. I know that is exactly what they have said--this bill cuts \nMedicare Advantage and hurts those millions of seniors. Wrong, not \ntrue, scare tactic, same old procedure, trying to distort and provide \nfear. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill cuts down on \noverpayments, not benefits. What taxpayer in America should knowingly \nbe paying an additional amount for a service, more than the service is \nworth and more than we pay in the regular program?\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to finish the thought. If we can yield on your time \nat the end, I will be happy to do that, but I want to make the points.\n  It is the overpayments to insurers that actually threaten Medicare's \nfuture. That is what increases the costs for seniors.\n  In 2009, MedPAC, the independent commission that advises us on issues \naffecting Medicare, estimates that Medicare is going to pay \napproximately $12 billion more for beneficiaries enrolled in private \nMedicare Advantage plans than if they were in the traditional Medicare. \nThese are overpayments, according to MedPAC and according to folks in \nthe medical profession. They exist because private insurers, under \nMedicare Advantage, are overpaid by about 14 percent, on average.\n  I might add, coincidentally, in 2008, when the Senator from Arizona \nwas the nominee for President, one of his top aides, Mr. Douglas Holtz-\nEakin, said--I think it was in an article in USA TODAY--that Medicare \nAdvantage plans should ``compete on a level playing field'' with \ntraditional Medicare. The changes in this bill will help to reduce \nthese overpayments, and they bring us closer to that level playing \nfield that was suggested last year.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle also say that reducing the \ngovernment subsidies to private medical plans is going to increase the \ncosts for seniors. Again, this statement is fiction. The overpayments \nprivate insurance companies receive under the current law to deliver \nMedicare benefits have increased the costs for seniors today. They, in \nfact, result in a $90 increase in premiums to every married couple \nenrolled in Medicare.\n  As we go forward, I hope it is the truth and facts that will prevail \nhere, not the fiction we keep hearing to scare seniors.\n  Americans ought to take note that the Minority do not come to the \nfloor of the Senate and show us how we could fix Medicare's problems \nmore effectively. The minority does not support changes that serve \nseniors better. Instead, they just embrace the status quo. Everyone in \nAmerica knows the status quo is unacceptable. We cannot afford it. \nMedicare will go bankrupt within the next 10 years. I ask my \ncolleagues, then where are we going to be?\n  This is the time for responsible action, and every step we have \noffered offers that kind of responsible action without reducing care. \nOpponents of health reform won't rest. They are using myths and \nmisinformation to distort the truth and wrongly suggest that Medicare \nwill be harmed. After a lifetime of hard work, don't seniors deserve \nbetter?\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act clearly strengthens \nthe Medicare program. The bill reduces premium costs for seniors, \nimproves\n\n[[Page S12585]]\n\nMedicare's financial integrity and delivers immediate benefits for \nseniors like lower prescription drug costs and free preventive \nservices. In short, health care reform will fortify Medicare and \nprotect Medicare benefits for America's seniors.I would like to take \nthe next few minutes to separate the facts from the fiction.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle say that health reform will \ncut Medicare benefits for seniors. And once again, this statement is \nfalse. Health reform will increase the number of Medicare benefits that \nseniors are entitled to under law. Nothing in this bill will take away \nor reduce guaranteed Medicare benefits. In fact, the legislation \nincreases coverage of preventive services at no additional costs to \nseniors. That means, when seniors visit a doctor for a colonoscopy, \nmammography, or other preventive screen, they won't pay the co-pay \nrequired under current law. Encouraging more preventive care is one of \nthe best ways we can save lives and lower health care costs. That's \nwhy, under this bill, seniors will receive even better preventive \nbenefits than they receive today.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle say that under health \nreform, government bureaucrats will dictate personal health care \ndecisions. This statement is completely false. Health care decisions \nabout providers and treatments are some of the most personal decisions \nmany people make. Under current law, doctors and patients decide which \ntreatments Medicare patients need. The same is true under this bill. \nHealth reform will keep these decisions between health care providers \nand patients. And with improved payment policies, this bill also \nensures Medicare providers get the resources they need to continue \nproviding quality care to their patients.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that reducing fraud, \nwaste and abuse in Medicare will not save a significant amount of \nmoney. To the contrary, waste, fraud and abuse cost the health care \nsystem billions of dollars every year. Improving Medicare's financial \nintegrity is one of the first steps we can take to save the program. \nAccording to independent analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, \nunder this bill, enhanced oversight, like requiring background checks \nand screening for providers, will save Medicare dollars. Targeting \nwaste, fraud and abuse in Medicare will protect American taxpayers and \nhelp extend the life of the program.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle claim that health care \nreform will not lower costs for seniors but drive costs higher. The \ntruth is that seniors will see immediate savings in prescription drug \ncosts under health care reform. This legislation will save seniors \nmoney in the Medicare prescription drug coverage program by providing \nmore coverage and lowering the costs of brand-name prescription drugs. \nIn 2010, seniors will receive an additional $500 of coverage before \nthey have to begin paying out of their own pocket in the coverage gap \nor ``doughnut hole'' in the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. Also \nbeginning in 2010, the price of brand-name drugs and biologics will be \ncut in half for the seniors who have to pay for prescriptions out of \ntheir own pocket when they hit the ``doughnut hole'' between initial \nand catastrophic coverage.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle say that we are not doing enough \nto protect home health care. The fact is that this bill includes \nprovisions I introduced to make home and community-based services more \nwidely available in Medicaid. Despite advancements in home and \ncommunity-based services, seniors have few affordable and accessible \noptions in choosing a health care setting today. Seniors deserve more \noptions, rather than just nursing homes. For seniors eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid and who prefer home or community-based services, \nthis bill provides valuable support.\n  We have heard repeatedly from my friends on the other side of the \naisle that leading advocacy groups do not support the Senate health \ncare bill. Nothing could be further from the truth. The country's \nleading advocacy groups for seniors rights are helping stop the scare \ntactics and clear up the facts. Voices like AARP and the American \nMedical Association support the responsible Medicare reform in this \nbill.\n  On November 18th, AARP said:\n\n       The new Senate bill makes improvements to the Medicare \n     program by creating a new annual wellness benefit, providing \n     free preventive benefits, and--most notably for AARP--members \n     reducing drug costs for seniors who fall into the dreaded \n     Medicare doughnut hole, a costly gap in prescription drug \n     coverage.\n\n  On November 20th, the American Medical Association said:\n\n       [We are] working to put the scare tactics to bed once and \n     for all and inform patients about the benefits of health \n     reform.\n\n  On November 16th, the Federation of American Hospitals said\n\n       Hospitals always will stand by senior citizens.\n\n  And on November 16th, the Catholic Health Association of the United \nStates said:\n\n       The possibility that hospitals might pull out of Medicare \n     [is] very, very unfounded. Catholic hospitals would never \n     give up on Medicare patients.\n\n  The minority today is arguing the exact opposite of what they have \nsaid previously. In the late 1990s, Republicans and Democrats joined \ntogether to fight for America's seniors, advocating Congress take the \nadvice of experts who said the solvency of Medicare was in trouble. \nToday, some are using scare tactics, falsely claiming that the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act will impose ``cuts to Medicare'' \nthat hurt seniors. In truth, this bill protects the guaranteed Medicare \nbenefits our seniors deserve. I urge my colleagues to stop spreading \nthe misinformation and false claims about this bill that are intended \nonly to scare seniors. Instead, I urge you to work with us on this \nlegislation which delivers health care to an additional 31 million \nAmericans and strengthens and preserves Medicare for the 45 million \nbeneficiaries who rely on the program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockfeller). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ncomments of the Senator from Massachusetts, an article be printed in \nthe Record called ``The Coming Deficit Disaster'' by Douglas Holtz-\nEakin, the same Congressional Budget Office Director to whom he was \nreferring. That goes into a number of these points I probably will do \nlater, but I want it at this moment because I want to relinquish such \ntime as the Senator from Oklahoma might want.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Coming Deficit Disaster\n\n       The president says he understands the urgency of our fiscal \n     crisis, but his policies are the equivalent of steering the \n     economy toward an iceberg. By Douglas Holtz-Eakin (Mr. Holtz-\n     Eakin is former director of the Congressional Budget Office \n     and a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. This is adapted from \n     testimony he gave before the Senate Committee on the Budget \n     on Nov. 10.)\n       President Barack Obama took office promising to lead from \n     the center and solve big problems. He has exerted enormous \n     political energy attempting to reform the nation's health-\n     care system. But the biggest economic problem facing the \n     nation is not health care. It's the deficit.\n       Recently, the White House signaled that it will get serious \n     about reducing the deficit next year--after it locks into \n     place massive new health-care entitlements. This is a recipe \n     for disaster, as it will create a new appetite for increased \n     spending and yet another powerful interest group to oppose \n     deficit-\n     reduction measures.\n       Our fiscal situation has deteriorated rapidly in just the \n     past few years. The federal government ran a 2009 deficit of \n     $1.4 trillion--the highest since World War II--as spending \n     reached nearly 25% of GDP and total revenues fell below 15% \n     of GDP. Shortfalls like these have not been seen in more than \n     50 years. Going forward, there is no relief in sight, as \n     spending far outpaces revenues and the federal budget is \n     projected to be in enormous deficit every year. Our national \n     debt is projected to stand at $17.1 trillion 10 years from \n     now, or over $50,000 per American. By 2019, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of the \n     president's budget, the budget deficit will still be roughly \n     $1 trillion, even though the economic situation will have \n     improved and revenues will be above historical norms.\n       The planned deficits will have destructive consequences for \n     both fairness and economic growth. They will force upon our \n     children and grandchildren the bill for our over-\n     consumption. Federal deficits will crowd out domestic \n     investment in physical capital, human capital, and \n     technologies that increase potential GDP and the standard of \n     living. Financing deficits could crowd out exports and harm \n     our international competitiveness, as we can already see \n     happening\n\n[[Page S12586]]\n\n     with the large borrowing we are doing from competitors like \n     China.\n       At what point, some financial analysts ask, do rating \n     agencies downgrade the United States? When do lenders price \n     additional risk to federal borrowing, leading to a damaging \n     spike in interest rates? How quickly will international \n     investors flee the dollar for a new reserve currency? And how \n     will the resulting higher interest rates, diminished dollar, \n     higher inflation, and economic distress manifest itself? \n     Given the president's recent reception in China--friendly but \n     fruitless--these answers may come sooner than any of us would \n     like.\n       Mr. Obama and his advisers say they understand these \n     concerns, but the administration's policy choices are the \n     equivalent of steering the economy toward an iceberg. Perhaps \n     the most vivid example of sending the wrong message to \n     international capital markets are the health-care reform \n     bills--one that passed the House earlier this month and \n     another under consideration in the Senate. Whatever their \n     good intentions, they have too many flaws to be defensible.\n       First and foremost, neither bends the health-cost curve \n     downward. The CBO found that the House bill fails to reduce \n     the pace of health-care spending growth. An audit of the bill \n     by Richard Foster, chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare \n     and Medicaid Services, found that the pace of national \n     health-care spending will increase by 2.1% over 10 years, or \n     by about $750 billion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's \n     bill grows just as fast as the House version. In this way, \n     the bills betray the basic promise of health-care reform: \n     providing quality care at lower cost.\n       Second, each bill sets up a new entitlement program that \n     grows at 8% annually as far as the eye can see--faster than \n     the economy will grow, faster than tax revenues will grow, \n     and just as fast as the already-broken Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs. They also create a second new entitlement program, \n     a federally run, long-term-care insurance plan.\n       Finally, the bills are fiscally dishonest, using every \n     budget gimmick and trick in the book: Leave out inconvenient \n     spending, back-load spending to disguise the true scale, \n     front-load tax revenues, let inflation push up tax revenues, \n     promise spending cuts to doctors and hospitals that have no \n     record of materializing, and so on. If there really are \n     savings to be found in Medicare, those savings should be \n     directed toward deficit reduction and preserving Medicare, \n     not to financing huge new entitlement programs. Getting long-\n     term budgets under control is hard enough today. The job will \n     be nearly impossible with a slew of new entitlements in \n     place. In short, any combination of what is moving through \n     Congress is economically dangerous and invites the rapid \n     acceleration of a debt crisis.\n       It is a dramatic statement to financial markets that the \n     federal government does not understand that it must get its \n     fiscal house in order. The time to worry about the deficit is \n     not next year, but now. There is no time to waste.\n       Again, Mr. Holtz-Eakin is former director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office and a fellow at the Manhattan \n     Institute. This is adapted from testimony he gave before the \n     Senate Committee on the Budget on Nov. 10.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the question I was going to ask the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts is, how many Medicare \nAdvantage patients has he ever cared for? How many Medicare Advantage--\nhow many Medicare patients has he ever cared for? How many times has he \nbeen in the trough, experiencing the heavy hand of government as we try \nto care for people on Medicare? The answer to that question is zero \nbecause he is not a physician. He relies on the American Medical \nAssociation--the American Medical Association that today represents \nless than 10 percent of the active practicing doctors in this country. \nHe relies on AARP, which has 40 million in membership but is the fifth \nlargest revenue receiver from supplemental policies. That is whom he \nrelies on. The fact is, he does not have the experience of being in the \ntrough, caring for patients.\n  Let me tell you what is going to happen to Medicare Advantage \npatients.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield----\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator would not yield to me. I have no intention to \nyield to him.\n  Mr. KERRY. I was ready to yield on your time.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator would not yield. I will continue my talk.\n  For Medicare Advantage patients--there is no question, I have agreed \nwith the chairman of the Finance Committee--the competitive bidding \nneeds to happen. But there is one little thing that happened on the way \nto the bank. It is that there is going to be a decrease in benefits--\nnot only a decrease in what we pay for, but there is going to be a \ndecrease in benefits. Where will that impact be most importantly felt? \nNot in the urban areas. It is not going to be felt in the urban areas. \nIt is going to be felt in rural areas throughout this country. That is \nwhere it is going to be felt. It is going to be felt out there where \nthere is a marginal rural hospital that is using the other benefits to \nhelp maintain the flow to that hospital.\n  So there is no question that, if you are one of the 11 million--with \nthe exception of those who got deals cut in this bill--that, for sure, \nthe 90,000 Oklahomans are going to feel an impact from this cut.\n  Nobody says Medicare Advantage is perfect. It is not. It is far from \nit. But there is another aspect of Medicare Advantage that really helps \nthose on the lower rung of the economic ladder. It is that with \nMedicare Advantage, they did not have to buy a supplemental policy \nbecause all the things they need are covered.\n  Ninety-four percent of Americans on Medicare who are not on Medicare \nAdvantage purchase a supplemental policy. Why do they do that? Why do \nthey spend $300 or $400 a month to buy a supplemental policy? Because \nbasic Medicare that we have proudly said will not be cut does not cover \nthe basic needs of a senior and their health care. Consequently, they \npay into Medicare Part A, HI trust fund their whole life, they buy \nMedicare Part B, and then they buy a supplemental policy. It just so \nhappens that one of the largest sellers of those policies happens to be \nsomebody who is endorsing this bill. If that is not a conflict of \ninterest, I don't know what is.\n  I heard the Senator talk about Massachusetts. I refer to an article \nfrom the Chicago Tribune--they have broadened care. I am proud of them \nfor doing that. But at what cost? At a 10-percent increase in cost of \npremiums for the people in the middle.\n  When we go back to what the President said about what his goals are, \nthere is no question that this bill does not keep those promises.\n  I now ask unanimous consent to turn to another area which we have \ndiscussed and ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \narticle from the North County Times/The Californian, dated December 5, \n2009, at 9:35 p.m.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is so ordered--the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. KERRY. I reserve the right to object. I want to find out if we \ncan have a moment to have a discussion, I ask my colleague.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will offer you the same courtesy you offered me. When I \nfinish my remarks, on your time, you are more than welcome to refute \nwhat I said.\n  I ask unanimous-consent that be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator's unanimous-consent request is granted as it was before.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the North County Times, Dec. 5, 2009]\n\n     State Ends Subsidy for Mammograms to Low-Income Women Under 50\n\n                         (By Bradley J. Fikes)\n\n       The eligibility age for state-subsidized breast cancer \n     screening has been raised from 40 to 50 by the California \n     Health and Human Services Agency, which will also temporarily \n     stop enrollment in the breast cancer screening program.\n       Advocates for low-income women, whose health care the \n     department helps pay for, say the cuts put a two-tier system \n     in place that is based on money rather than medical \n     standards.\n       The cuts will greatly harm the clinic's mammogram program, \n     said Natasha Riley, manager of Vista Community Clinic's \n     Breast Health Outreach and Education Program.\n       The clinic and others like it in San Diego County provide \n     reduced-cost care, mostly to low-income people, with money \n     from the state and some private donations.\n       ``More than 50 percent of the women we give breast exams \n     and mammograms to are in their 40s,'' Riley said. ``The \n     majority of our current breast cancer survivors are women in \n     their 40s.''\n       The state's decision, announced Dec. 1 and effective Jan. \n     1, follows a controversial federal recommendation last month \n     that mammograms before the age of 50 are generally not \n     needed.\n       However, the public health department also linked the \n     change to California's budget woes.\n       The federal recommendation, made Nov. 16 by the U.S. \n     Preventive Services Task Force, has encountered strong \n     opposition.\n       The task force later retreated a bit, adjusting its \n     recommendation to state that mammograms for women ages 40 to \n     49 should be\n\n[[Page S12587]]\n\n     considered by their doctors on an individual basis.\n       Moreover, private health care systems such as Scripps \n     Health have rejected the federal task force's recommendation, \n     choosing instead to keep the existing standard, which calls \n     for a mammogram at age 40, with annual mammograms thereafter.\n       That means doctors will be using two medical practice \n     guidelines, distinguished not by knowledge but by the \n     pocketbook, said Dr. Jack Klausen, a gynecologist and \n     obstetrician who practices at Vista Community Clinic.\n       ``If we are in a situation where we don't screen, but the \n     private-practice doctor can screen, then we are actually not \n     practicing to the standard of care,'' Klausen said.\n       In its announcement, the state said the cuts were needed \n     because of a projected budget shortfall for the California \n     Department of Public Health, and from declining revenue from \n     tobacco taxes.\n       However, it did not say how much money it expected to save.\n       Calls to the department were not returned Friday.\n       The policy puts lives at risk, said Barbara Mannino, CEO of \n     Vista Community Clinic.\n       ``I bet you everybody knows a woman who was diagnosed in \n     her 40s, and her life was saved by a mammogram, or lost \n     because it was too late,'' Mannino said, just before leaving \n     for her own mammogram.\n       And she said that little money would be saved, because all \n     the equipment and staff to provide mammograms is already in \n     place.\n       There is a difference of opinion in the medical community \n     about when mammograms, an X-ray of the breast, should be \n     used.\n       Mammograms sometimes give false alarms, with the incidence \n     of false positives especially high for women in their 40s.\n       Estimates are that 10 percent to 15 percent of mammograms \n     give false positives, experts say.\n       False negatives, in which the cancer is present but the \n     mammogram seems normal, occurs 20 percent of the time, \n     according to the National Cancer Institute.\n       However, false negatives become less frequent with age.\n       But the benefits in finding cancers when they are more \n     easily treatable outweigh the drawbacks, Mannino and Klausen \n     said.\n       And Scripps' breast cancer task force said that because 28 \n     percent of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer are \n     younger than 50, the number of lives saved outweighs the \n     additional cost.\n       Klausen said the federal panel was trying to ``create a \n     best-practices (standard) from a monetary point of view,'' to \n     provide the most health care for all, out of a limited \n     budget.\n       Women who get false positives on mammograms not only \n     undergo stress, but they must go through other tests, only to \n     find out there's nothing wrong.\n       That adds costs to the system without providing any better \n     health care, according to the federal panel's reasoning.\n       However, Klausen said the state has taken that reasoning \n     too far, putting too much emphasis on saving money.\n       ``What makes me really worried is that the California \n     Department of Public Health wants to save money by taking \n     away a cancer-detection program,'' Klausen said. ``That \n     discriminates against a gender, and also discriminates \n     against an income level. And it also discriminates against \n     how community clinics can practice medicine.''\n\n  Mr. COBURN. In this bill, what we are debating are three terrible \nthings for care but great things for cost: the U.S. Preventive Task \nForce on Prevention Services, the Medicare Advisory Commission, and the \nreferences to the Cost Comparative Effectiveness Panel.\n  When the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force came out with their \nrecommendation, as far as costs--I am talking about breast cancer \nscreening for 40- to 49-year-olds--as far as costs, they were \nabsolutely right, as far as cost-effectiveness. But as far as clinical \neffectiveness, they were absolutely wrong. What did we do? We accepted \na Vitter amendment to hold off, so that recommendation, that mandate \nfrom that panel will not apply to women in this country under these \nprograms--except the women in California on Medi-Cal because, you see, \nthis week California embraced the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. \nSo if you are a Medicaid patient--which we are going to put 15 million \nmore people into--you cannot have a mammogram in California if you are \nunder 50. You cannot have it because, from a cost standpoint, they are \nright. From a clinical standpoint, they are wrong.\n  What we have done is, every time one of these three organizations \ncreates a ruling, that the American people rise up and say: That is \nwrong, we are going to come in here and correct it? But throughout this \nbill, strung throughout are multiple references to what these three \npanels are going to ration--I did not miss that word--ration the care \nto American people in this country.\n  If you are a senior, you have two real reasons to be worried. One is, \nwe are cutting Medicare. And if we are not, then vote for the Gregg \namendment and you will make sure we don't. It is an insurance policy. \nBut more important, within that, we are going to see the care to \nseniors rationed based not on what is in their own best interests or \ntheir health's best interests but what is in the cost's best interests. \nThere is no question about it. We are going to do that.\n  It would be different if we created a comparative effectiveness \npanel, a clinical comparative panel. But they are already out there. We \nknew that.\n  When I study to take my recertification exams, I have to know what \nthe clinical comparative effectiveness guidelines are or I will not \npass as a practicing physician. But we didn't do that. We said: Cost is \nmost important. So how are we going to cut? We are going to say where \nsomething is cost-effective though not clinically effective, we are \ngoing to cut that care.\n  So if you are a senior, especially if you are on Medicare Advantage, \nyou don't have to just worry about the fact that we are going to \ndecrease the revenue stream that will supply those benefits that cause \nyou not to have to buy a supplemental policy, and we are going to \ndecrease some of the things that are available to you as a Medicare \nAdvantage patient, but you also have to worry about the next ruling \nthat is going to come from the U.S. Preventative Health Services Task \nForce. You have to worry about what is going to come from the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission because it is going to be looking at costs \ntoo.\n  Then you have to worry about what is going to come from the cost \ncomparative effectiveness panel. I could spend up to 8 hours talking \nabout tragedies from England and Canada on care denied based on things \nAmericans have today that that very panel is going to deny to Americans \nin the future because they are not cost-effective. That is one of the \nreasons our result in terms of cancer treatments is one-third better \nthan anywhere else in the world. It is because we don't have mother \nnanny bureaucracy saying what you can and cannot have.\n  It would be totally different if we created incentives for lowering \nthe cost, but we don't. We create mandates. We drive down the cost of \nhealth care in specific areas through these three separate panels.\n  There is one thing that is even worse than the two things I just \ntalked about for Medicare patients. Here is what it is. When you have \nthese three panels, you have just taken away the loyalty of your \nphysician to you. You have just decided, with these three panels, that \nthe physicians have to keep their eyes on the government. They have to \ndo what the government says is in your best health interest rather than \nwhat that provider knows is in your best interest. Remember, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, the cost comparative \neffectiveness panel, and the Preventative Services Task Force doesn't \nknow your family history, doesn't know your clinical history, has never \ndone an exam on you, do not know the idiosyncrasies of your health \ncare. But we are going to apply that all to you; we are going to \ndepersonalize health care.\n  I readily admit, for 80 percent of the people, it is going to be just \nfine. They will not see any untoward result. But I will predict, as a \npracticing physician for over 25 years, for that remaining 20 percent \nit is going to be a disaster as far as their personal health is \nconcerned. It will destroy the patient-doctor relationship. It will \ngive us worse outcomes, and it will not save us any money because the \nconsequences of those decisions will create a complication which will \nrequire more dollars expended.\n  When we think the government can practice medicine--and that is what \nthis bill does; this bill sets up the government to practice medicine--\nwe might as well hang it up and just be ready because 20 percent are \ngoing to get substandard care compared to what a Medicare patient \nreceives today. We are going to get sicker. The life expectancy of \npeople under this health care bill will decline. The quality of care \nwill decline. The innovation of new advancements in health care will \ndecline because we have chosen the government to decide what everybody \nwill get. It is a disaster as far as the individual patient is \nconcerned.\n\n[[Page S12588]]\n\n  That is not the motivation of my colleagues on the other side. I know \nthat. I am not accusing them of that. But what they don't see, sitting \nin Washington, is what I see in a clinic office practice in medicine. \nMedicine is intensely personal. It ought to be about your choice, about \nwhat is best for you and your family and your children, not what the \ngovernment says makes the best economic sense to the budget picture in \nWashington any particular year. When we lose that quality in American \nmedicine, we are going to lose the best of what we have in the name of \nfixing what is wrong.\n  I agree with my colleagues the insurance industry has a lot of stink \nto it. But there are a lot of ways to fix it other than the way we have \ndone. I agree with my colleagues that my profession is not pure at \nevery turn of the corner. I agree with my colleagues we can do better. \nBut when we write a bill that is absent any absolute clinical judgment \nleft to the practice of medicine by those who know the patients best, \nwho have 100 percent of that patient's best interests at heart, we are \ngoing to hurt the quality of care. We are going to hurt it \nsignificantly. Your motivations are good. The answers are wrong on a \nclinical basis.\n  Now to the Gregg amendment. The Gregg amendment does what you all say \nyou want to do. I remind my colleagues the Medicare trustees are highly \nsuspicious of the Medicare cuts in this bill. What they say is, they \nhighly doubt it will ever happen because it has never happened before \nbecause there is not the political will to decrease the dollars in \nMedicare. More importantly, the dollars are going to come out of care \ninstead of out of fraud. There is only $2 billion, say, out of at least \n$100 billion a year, in fraud. Only 2 percent of it per year is coming \nout. That is the problem. We could have had a Medicare bill and we \ncould have cut $60 or $70 billion of fraud together out of this bill. \nWe can come together on that. We could have cut $720 billion out of \nMedicare just based on fraud alone without ever touching Medicare \nAdvantage, without ever giving sweetheart deals to the people in \nFlorida because their Senator wanted it, without ever touching FMAP \nadjustments in other States.\n  We could have done that, but we chose not to. We chose what we know \nup here rather than what we know in the hinterland, those of us who are \npracticing medicine. What do we know? We know there are some rip-offs \nin home health care. We know there are significant rip-offs in durable \nmedical equipment. We know there are some rip-offs in hospice. We know \nthere are drug company rip-offs. We could agree to some of those. We \nactually even know in large hospitals that there are some problems \nthere as well. But there are very few problems in our rural hospitals \nbecause they are struggling just to keep the doors open. We could have \ndone that, but we chose not to. So we have this divide, and we are \ngoing to fix it one way. The biggest pot of honey in Medicare is fraud. \nEverybody knows that. But we are not going to fix it.\n  If, in fact, what my colleagues claim is true, that these are \nMedicare cuts that nobody will ever feel any consequence from, in spite \nof my own years of practice and knowing the difference, that that isn't \ntrue, but let's give you that, why would we not put it all back in \nMedicare so we don't steal from our children and our grandchildren? Why \nwould we not do that? We have chosen not to do that. We have chosen to \nmix it. And it is honorable to try to create a system to get more \npeople insured. Yet we will still have 24 million people not insured. \nOut of this bill, we will still have 24 million people not insured, \nwhen it is all said and done, if everything goes as planned.\n  Yesterday I introduced into the Record the analysis by the State \ninsurance commission in the State of Oklahoma. Kim Holland is of your \nparty, the majority party. But she sees what is getting ready to happen \nwith this bill. What does she say? What she says is, insurance premiums \nare going to significantly rise in Oklahoma. More people will be \nuninsured than there are today. The State Medicaid fund is going to be \ntremendously stressed with at least $67 million a year having to go \ninto that, again, based on the mandates in this bill that we don't have \nmoney to do; that, in fact, it is not the way to solve what Oklahoma is \nfacing in terms of health care.\n  I didn't call her and say: Give me something bad to say about this \nbill. She volunteered this information out of her legitimate concern \nfor the consequences, of what is going to happen with this bill. Why \nwould she do that? Because she knows one heck-of-a-lot more about \ninsurance than I do and anybody else in this body. She knows it in our \nState. And the other insurance commissioners around here, some through \ntheir association, have endorsed this bill. Most, when they look at \ntheir State, especially the poorer States, especially West Virginia, it \nis going to hurt.\n  How are we going to cover that? We are going to shift 15 million \npeople to Medicaid. What do we know about Medicaid? I have delivered \nthousands of babies and over half of them have been Medicaid. I have \ncared for thousands of Medicaid children, thousands of Medicaid adults \nand thousands of Medicaid patients. What do we know? Medicaid is a \nsubstandard program. Compared to everybody else, it is substandard, \nexcept when compared to the Indian Health Service, and that is a \ndisaster. So our answer is to put a mandate on the States that they \ncannot afford and shove another 15 million people into a system that \nhas poorer outcomes, higher complication rates, higher infant mortality \nrates, later presentation, and a system that has 11 million people \neligible for it today who are not signed up.\n  We have the system out there, but they are not signed up. So they are \nnot getting any preventative care. They are not interacting with a \nprimary care physician.\n  And that is our answer? Move 15 million more Americans into Medicaid. \nBy the way, keep a discriminatory stamp on their forehead, rather than \ngive them an insurance program; put a stamp on their forehead that says \n40 percent of the doctors can't see you, 65 percent of the specialists \nwill not see you because your reimbursement rate is so low they can't \nafford to have you walk into their office and cover the cost of seeing \nyou. That is what we are going to do.\n  That is not reform to health care. That is banishing people to a \nsubstandard system as compared to what the rest of the system is and \nthen feeling good about it. That is not reform. That is discrimination \nbecause here is what really happens to a Medicaid mom and her children.\n  If she has a sick kid, she can't get in. She has this 6-year-old with \na fever, not eating, dehydrated, and she can't get in to see a primary \ncare physician, which could keep that child out of the hospital. So \nwhat happens? She keeps trying to get in. What does she do? She \naccesses the emergency room, the most expensive place. She accesses it \nlate--not early, late.\n  So we have a sicker child, with higher costs, because we have a \nsystem that will not reimburse its costs. And you all have actually \ntalked about the cost shift on that, from Medicare and Medicaid, to the \nprivate sector. We would be much better off paying the same rates in \nMedicaid so we do not get that cost shift, so we do not discriminate \nagainst people on Medicaid for access to care. But we have chosen not \nto do that because it fits with the numbers. It fits with the \nWashington, government-centered management of health care.\n  I will tell you as a physician, we would be better off--single-payer \nrationing and all--than what you are doing to so many of these patients \nin this bill. We would be better off with the government just running \nit all, rationing it, and saying: Tough, you get to 75 years of age, \nyou can't get your hip fixed; you get cancer, we are not going to give \nyou the latest drugs. We would be better off because now we are going \nto get the worst of both worlds. We are going to get the rationing \nthrough these three panels I talked about. They are going to tell \ndoctors what they can and cannot do. They are going to practice \nmedicine--the very people who have never touched, never had an \nencounter, never visited with that patient and do not know anything \nabout them--they are going to make a decision.\n  Mr. President, I would inquire, I think I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. What is the request of my ranking member?\n\n[[Page S12589]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Senator Sessions?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will just respond by saying to Senator \nCoburn, I think he should use the remainder of the time, and then I \nwill be able to work with the Democrats to get time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think I will finish up in seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to the Senator, take the remainder of the time, \nif you would like it. I will get my opportunity in a few minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Every person in this country should be able to have \naccess. I agree. Nobody should lose their home. Nobody should have to \nfile for bankruptcy because of health care. I agree. That premise we \nagree on. How we get there is in two totally different ways.\n  The No. 1 impediment to access is cost. Costs are not going to go \ndown. We know that by all the studies. The health care costs are not \ngoing to go down. They are not going to go down per individual and they \nare not going to go down in total. So we will not have fixed the big \nproblem with health care, which is cost.\n  We will have worked on access through a government program, but we \nwill not have fixed the real problems. What are the real problems? \nFraud is at least 6 percent of the cost of health care. Tort extortion \nby the trial bar is at least 6 percent of the cost of health care when \nyou count defensive medicine. There is 12 percent where you could lower \nit tomorrow--12 percent where you could lower the cost of health care \ntomorrow if, in fact, we would fix the real problems.\n  No. 3, transparency with insurance companies and transparency with \ndoctors so you know what the cost is, you know what the outcomes are, \nyou know what their track record is, so you can truly make a decision \nabout your care. There is no incentive for that, the incentivization \nfor prevention and management of chronic disease.\n  I have said this on the floor before, but it bears repeating: The \nreason we have a primary care doctor shortage in this country today is \nbecause of Medicare. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services sets \nthe rates of reimbursement for primary care encounters in Medicare, and \neverybody else follows it. So you have a disruption, a differential of \n300 percent from a family practice doctor and an obstetrician like me \nto a super-subspecialist. And what do you think the doctors in medical \nschools are doing? Last year, only 1 in 50 went into primary care. Only \n1 in 50 went into primary care.\n  So let's say we get everybody covered. Who are they going to see? Oh, \nI know what the answer is. We are going to use physician extenders. So \nnot only are we going to say you are covered, now we are not going to \ngive you an experienced, gray-haired, reasoned, long-term educated \nphysician with 25 or 30 years of experience; we are going to hand you \noff to somebody who is a nurse or a PA who is good at limited things \nbut does not practice the art of medicine.\n  So I will wind up with this. I so want to fix health care. I am so \nsick of the way it is. But I am not near as sick of the way it is as \nthe way it is getting ready to be under this bill. I know my patients \nare going to get hurt under this bill. My Medicaid patients are going \nto get hurt under this bill. My Medicare patients are going to get hurt \nunder this bill. And those who are in between--whether it is with \ninsurance with their employer or insurance they are buying on their own \nor they are paying cash--are going to pay more for their health care \nbecause of this bill. That is what I believe is going to be the outcome \nof this bill. And all you have to do is go look at the history. Talk to \nAlice Rivlin, the first CBO Director, about the accuracy of CBO in \nestimating anything when it comes to health care. They have missed it \nevery way. They have only gotten one ``wrong,'' by saying it was going \nto cost more. For every other one, they said it was going to cost less \nthan it did. So every patient--every patient--in some way or another is \ngoing to suffer under this bill. That is what we should be worried \nabout. We should not worry about whether the President wins or we win.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Presiding Officer for the accommodation of \nthe time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining in this hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I have spoken with Senator Sessions. He is \nvery kindly and very graciously agreeing that Senator Shaheen from New \nHampshire will be able to speak next after Senator Kerry. So Senator \nKerry for 3 minutes, and then the remaining 5\\1/2\\ minutes will be for \nSenator Shaheen.\n  I also unanimous consent that we be able to proceed until 3 o'clock \nunder the usual form; that is, under the conditions of the last \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. It is also my understanding that the Republican leader \nmay come down at some point after Senator Shaheen speaks and use leader \ntime. That is my understanding--or after Senator Kerry speaks. Whenever \nhe comes, he comes. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, thank you very much, and I thank Senator \nBaucus for the time.\n  My friend from Oklahoma asked how many patients I take care of in \nterms of Medicare. I must say that is not the essential ingredient of \nbeing able to exercise common sense and to make some judgments about \nthis issue. I could turn to him and ask, how many buses has he driven, \nbut he votes on transportation policy; how many wars has he fought in, \nbut he sends people to Afghanistan; how many courtrooms has he \npracticed in and tried a case in, but he is willing to limit attorney's \nfees. That is not the measure here. The measure is, what does the \npolicy do?\n\n  Let me be very clear. The Medicare Advantage Program was put in \nplace. It is a private plan that is run by the insurance companies. We \nput them in place, and they grew, in 2003, and gained the name \n``Medicare Advantage'' because they were going to be run more \nefficiently and at lower cost. Originally, we were paying about 95 \npercent to the repayment, but that has angled up now to the point where \nMedPAC itself--not AARP. This is not AARP. This is MedPAC. Here is the \nMedPAC report. MedPAC says:\n\n       Currently, Medicare pays Medicare Advantage plans 14 \n     percent more than it would spend for similar beneficiaries in \n     [the Medicare program], pays a subsidy of $3.26 for each \n     dollar of enhanced benefits. . . .\n\n  So the Medicare folks are subsidizing additional payments to a \nprogram that is paying more than is regularly paid, and it goes \nstraight to the insurance company. It does not make sense for tax \ndollars to be spent that way.\n  Finally, let me just say, the Senator referenced Massachusetts. Let \nme read a quote from the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. It is the \nmost conservative--it is constantly protecting the expenditure of tax \ndollars. Everyone in the State looks to it on issues of tax policy, \nexpenditures. Here is what it says about our plan in Massachusetts:\n\n       [T]he cost to taxpayers of achieving near universal \n     coverage has been relatively modest and well within initial \n     projections of how much the state would have to spend to \n     implement reform, in part because many of the newly insured \n     have enrolled in employer-sponsored plans at no public \n     expense.\n\n  That is what happens.\n  The final comment I make to him: We are blessed to have five \nphysicians in my immediate family--my daughter, my son-in-law, her \nfather-in-law, and two nieces--and every single one of them would \noverwhelmingly disagree with the comments made by the Senator from \nOklahoma. They hope we will pass this legislation, as do millions of \nother doctors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, for the past several months, my office \nhas responded to thousands of letters and phone calls about health \ncare. I have traveled all across New Hampshire talking to small \nbusiness owners and families who are desperate for help. I have talked \nto health care providers that are frustrated with the current system. \nThe underlying message is very clear: Health care reform cannot wait \nany longer.\n\n[[Page S12590]]\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to offer \namendments that would take this bill off the floor of the Senate, \narguing we need to go back to the beginning and start all over or, \nworse, do nothing at all. But, Mr. President, you and I both know we \nneed to act and we need to act as soon as possible. We need to continue \nto move forward. We need to move forward on behalf of thousands in New \nHampshire and millions across this country who need health care reform.\n  I have listened to these families, these individuals, and I want to \ntake a few minutes this afternoon to share two of their stories.\n  Judith Pietroniro from Francestown, NH, was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in 2005 after her doctor found a lump during a routine \nmammogram. After undergoing multiple surgeries and radiation treatment, \nI am very pleased to report that Judith is now in her fourth year of \nbeing cancer free. However, at a time in her life when she should be \ncelebrating her good health, Judith is facing a new challenge--finding \naffordable health insurance--because, you see, when Judith was in \ntreatment, she was fortunate to be covered on her husbands's insurance \nplan. They paid $82 a week for a family plan. Unfortunately, her \nhusband lost his job last year. But the family has been able to take \nadvantage of COBRA. However, when her COBRA option runs out, which is \ngoing to be at the end of this year, she will be unable to buy an \ninsurance plan from her current carrier. That is because breast cancer \nis considered a preexisting condition until the patient is cancer free \nfor 5 years under her plan. But the rub is, once she is cancer free for \n5 years and able to qualify for insurance under her current plan, she \nwill face a monthly premium of over $2,000 for a plan that has a huge \ndeductible. Health care for Judith will simply be out of reach.\n  Now, Mr. President, you and I both know cancer does not discriminate. \nThis could happen to any of us.\n  I also recently heard from Colleen Conners, a woman who lives in my \nhometown of Madbury, NH. Like so many others, she has struggled with \nour ailing health care system. She was born with a hip condition, and \nshe has suffered from several other medical problems, including lupus \nand scoliosis. As a result, she has also been denied coverage because \nof her preexisting conditions.\n  I heard my colleague from Oklahoma talking about the people who he \nsaid were being denied care in other health care systems. But let me \nread what Colleen, my neighbor in Madbury, says about her situation \nunder our health care system. She writes:\n\n       It's very difficult to be in this position. As a part-time \n     lecturer at a college, I'm not eligible to buy health \n     insurance through the system.\n\n  She says:\n\n       I was born with a serious congenital hip deformity and have \n     incurred some 30, mostly related, surgical procedures to make \n     it possible for me to walk and function with relative \n     normalcy. It has given--\n\n  She names her insurer; I will not report that--\n\n     all the reason, it seems, to legally deny me the coverage I \n     so desperately need. All other venues I have attempted to \n     engage to secure affordable, sustainable, and efficacious \n     coverage have similarly been denied me. I cannot tell you how \n     hurtful this has been. The trickle down economics of my \n     currently uninsured state has had a terrible impact on my \n     daughter also, who just earlier today asked me, ``Mom, how \n     long ago is it since your last mammogram?'' I told her, \n     ``Five years, I think,'' to which she replied, ``Well, I've \n     already lost one parent. I don't want to lose two.''\n\n  What is happening to people in New Hampshire and throughout this \ncountry is devastating to people like Colleen and Judith. But despite \nColleen's struggles and the difficulties life has placed in her path, \nshe has remained optimistic and hopeful that things will get better. I, \ntoo, am optimistic. I am optimistic we can pass comprehensive health \nreform that changes the way the insurance market works so my neighbors \nColleen and Judith from New Hampshire and Americans in communities all \nacross this country no longer face this discrimination.\n\n  The reality is we can't always control whether we get sick, and when \nwe are at our most vulnerable moments, we shouldn't have to worry about \nwhether we are going to be kicked off our insurance or whether our \ncoverage is going to run out. Health care reform will offer this peace \nof mind to millions of Americans. Health care reform will touch the \nlives of all Americans.\n  We have the opportunity to improve our health care system for \neveryone in New Hampshire and across the country, and we must act now \non this opportunity and pass meaningful, comprehensive health care \nreform.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 20 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments that have been \nmade about preexisting illnesses, and I do think we can do something \nwith this legislation to fix that. We just have to be careful. If you \nhave two people both making the same salary, they have both worked for \n20 years, one individual saved and paid his health care insurance for \nthose 20 years and got sick and is covered by it, and another one chose \nnot to, it is not insurance if a person then walks in and wants \nsomebody else to pay for it. But we can do that. I think we can work \nthrough those difficulties, and I would definitely support moving in \nthat direction.\n  My colleagues earlier mentioned about Medicare Advantage, that this \nis a program some are critical of, and they think we can deliver health \ncare better without the Medicare Advantage part of the Medicare \nProgram. I would say Medicare Advantage can and probably should be \nreformed, but we shouldn't address the problems in Medicare Advantage \nby directly cutting its seniors' benefits.\n  With regard to the physicians, in my hometown of Mobile, the medical \nassociation ran a poll of their members and 94 percent of them opposed \na government option which is in this bill, a part of this legislation. \nThey opposed the bill in general in large numbers. A similar poll in \nMontgomery, AL, showed the same thing.\n  What I wish to talk about today is the Gregg amendment. The purpose \nof his amendment is to prevent Medicare from being raided for new \nentitlements and to use those Medicare savings, any that we can \nachieve, to save Medicare. I note for the record Senator Gregg, the \nformer chairman of our Budget Committee and the ranking member on the \nBudget Committee today, is probably the most knowledgeable person in \nthe Senate--not probably, I am pretty certain he is the most \nknowledgeable person in the Senate on the financial instability of \nMedicare. He has worked hard over the years to try to identify some way \nto fix it. A number of years ago he proposed an amendment, an idea that \nwould have saved, over 5 years, $10 billion through cost effectiveness \nand smart actions within Medicare, and that $10 billion would have \nenabled the Medicare Program to extend its life. Because all the \nactuaries tell us--and there is no dispute about this--that by 2017 \nMedicare will be in default. Less money will be coming in than going \nout. So Senator Gregg saw that coming and he attempted to fix it. He \nwas attacked by my colleagues on the other side for this $10 billion \nefficiency idea that would have strengthened Medicare, not spent it on \nsomething else, but he would spend it to strengthen Medicare. I do not \nthink a single Member of the Democratic Party voted for it and several \nRepublicans didn't. It was a tie vote. The Vice President had to break \nthe vote.\n  The idea now that we are going to find $465 billion in Medicare \nsavings without damaging the care and take that money not to strengthen \nMedicare and put it on a self-sustaining basis, as we should be trying \nto do, but to take it and create an entirely new entitlement program, \nis something I cannot support. Actually, I understand my colleagues in \ntheir speeches say they don't support it. They say they don't. They \nvoted for the Bennet amendment which sort of seemed to say that. But we \nknew, those of us who read it carefully, that the amendment of the \nSenator from Colorado wouldn't do anything. Even the New York Times \nwhich supports this bill said it was a meaningless amendment.\n  So let's talk about where we are. The Gregg amendment, unlike the \nBennet amendment, means what it says. This is a serious vote. It simply \nsays if you\n\n[[Page S12591]]\n\ntake money from Medicare, it ought to be used to strengthen Medicare, \nnot to create a new program with it. It is pretty clear about it. It \nhas teeth. It means what it says. It is not a joke. It is not a \nflimflam. It is a serious amendment. So we will now be, I think, \nascertaining how people in this body actually believe with reference to \nMedicare and whether we ought to be taking money from it.\n  The amendment says if non-Medicare savings--which are very few, if \nyou want to know the truth--if the non-Medicare savings in this \nproposal do not offset the new cost of this new bill, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and the Secretary of HHS are prohibited from implementing \nnew spending or revenue reduction provisions in the bill. The reality \nis there are not going to be any--or very few say non-Medicare savings. \nThat is where the savings are, frankly.\n  The amendment prevents Medicare cuts from being used to create new \nand expanded entitlement programs and to fuel massive government growth \non the backs of Medicare beneficiaries. I recall for my colleagues that \npeople who pay into Medicare have paid into it all their lives and they \nare now at a point in their life where they are drawing from it. The \nsocial contract we had with them was that they would pay into this \nprogram, and when they got to be 65, they would get the benefits from \nit. They didn't get the benefits of it when they were 30. They didn't \nget the benefits when they were 40. They didn't get the benefits when \nthey were 50, yet they were paying in all these years, and now when the \ntime comes to benefit from it, we have a massive plan to raid that \nprogram that clearly is the most unstable, actuarially unsound program \nwe have in our country. It is heading into default. When it goes into \ndefault, it is not going to gradually go beyond the break-even line; it \nis going to drop below it dramatically. It accelerates. One study from \nthe Heritage Foundation, I believe, said as much as $80 trillion over \nthe lifetime of instability in this program. So I don't think anybody \ndisputes the numbers and the problems that Medicare faces.\n  The bill says we are going to have a budget-neutral piece of \nlegislation here, and don't worry, it is not going to add to the debt. \nIn fact, we are told by the President that not one dime will be added \nto the debt. We have Members of this body who say the bill on the floor \nwill create a $130 billion surplus over 10 years. Well, that would be \ngood if it were true. How do you do that? Well, there are a number of \nthings, but one of them is you have a $494 billion tax increase, and an \n$848 billion fund achieved largely from Medicare. That is where the \n$465 billion comes from: Medicare. But the truth is that is not an \naccurate number, because the tax increases start immediately and the \nbenefits don't start until 2014, 5 years down the road, the fifth year. \nWhen you add that up and you take the first 10 years of the real \nimplementation of the legislation that is on the floor, it is going to \ncost $2.5 trillion. That is a big amount of money.\n\n  Also, it does not fix the doctors payments that everybody assumed and \nthought and we were told would be part of health care reform. That is \nnot done. Why is it not done? Because the bill wouldn't balance. You \nwouldn't be able to tell the American people that it brings in revenue \nwhen it doesn't. That is $250 billion to fix an essential payment to \nour doctors that we cannot cut. We need to put that on a sound \nfinancial basis. It should be a part of this reform. But since they \ncouldn't--they figured they had raised enough taxes and they couldn't \nclaim to cut anymore from Medicare, they put it out here on the side \nsomewhere and we will do as has been done in the past, unfortunately: \nPay the doctors their payments by increasing the debt. Every penny of \nthe money that goes to make up the shortfall in doctor payments \nincreases the debt and it is going to continue and it should end.\n  The bill is not balanced in any fair analysis. It is a shell game. It \nmoves the $250 billion shortfall for doctors out of the bill. They say \nwe don't have a problem, our bill balances. But there is a $250 billion \nhole sitting over here; we just moved it across the room here. That is \nnot good and sound policy.\n  The Gregg amendment prohibits the using of the $465 billion in \nMedicare cuts to pay for the new government spending in this \nlegislation. It would keep the Medicare expansions--Medicaid expansions \nfrom going into effect without--by having or saving cuts in Medicare or \nSocial Security. Unlike the Bennet amendment, which had no meaning \nwhatsoever, it has some teeth to it. So we will know something \nsignificant about how people feel about Medicare and the financial \nresponsibility when this vote comes up.\n  Senator Bennet has said:\n\n       With my amendment, the bill strengthens Medicare and \n     preserves seniors' benefits.\n\n  Well, I think that is not an accurate statement. Once and for all, \nwith this amendment, we will be able to show American seniors who have \npaid into their health care--Medicare--all their lives, that we mean it \nwhen we say we don't want to weaken their program.\n  One asks, how can you have such a disagreement, Senator Sessions? \nLook, you might ask me, they say the money is there; you say you are \ncutting Medicare; they say it is not cutting Medicare, $465 billion. \nSomebody ought to be able to get it straight here. How can you possibly \nhave this kind of disagreement? I say to you the general fund budget \nfor the State of Alabama--we are about one-fiftieth of the Nation's \npopulation, 4 million people, it is about $2 billion. So how can we \nlose $465 billion? Well, this is what they are saying. If you listen to \nmuch of the comments carefully, they are saying: We are not cutting \nguaranteed benefits to seniors. They are not saying they are cutting \nMedicare, if you listen to most of the people who are careful about \nwhat they say. They say, We are not cutting guaranteed benefits.\n  I see. What are we doing?\n  We are cutting home health care agencies; we are cutting hospice \nprograms; we are cutting hospitals; we are cutting the disproportionate \nshare hospitals for poor people; we are cutting program after program \nafter program. So they are cutting the providers and telling everybody \nwe are not cutting Medicare. But if we are going to cut providers, why \nhaven't we already done it and put Medicare on a sound footing? You \ncan't cut providers this much. You cannot do so. They will collapse. \nDoctors already are refusing to take Medicare patients and they are \nworried about that. I think in the future, if we go through with this \nlegislation, we will see far more will quit seeing those patients.\n\n  Well, the Gregg amendment makes sure Medicare savings go to making \nthe program more solvent and not to offset the creation of an entirely \nnew entitlement program. There are many things we can do in this \nlegislation to improve health care in America. I know many on our side \nhave offered many things, some of which are in the bill, many of which \nare not, but we can do a lot of things together that we could agree on \nthat would strengthen and make health care better in this country.\n  This legislation is unsound. We will be raiding Medicare. We will \nhave a massive, new tax increase. If we were going to raise taxes, let \nme ask, might that money be best spent to make Medicare solvent instead \nof creating a new program, when we know Medicare is going to be \ninsolvent in just a few years? We will be raising taxes and creating \nbogus, phantom cuts in Medicare, and they claim that will make this \nbill balance. They are adjusting the numbers in the bill so the \nbenefits don't start for 5 years, to make the first 10 years look like \nit is a sound program--looks like it is going to cost $848 billion for \nthe first full 10 years of implementation, and it costs $2.5 trillion.\n  There is not nearly enough money to pay for that. We are just going \nto be increasing the debt. That is why the American people have \nnoticed. They have been out there at tea parties and meetings and \nrallies, pleading with us to be responsible, to quit throwing away \nmoney, quit acting like there can be something for nothing. There can't \nbe something for nothing. Somebody has to provide care if we say care \nwill be provided. If they provide it, it has to be paid for. That is \nsimple.\n  We are creating a mindset that has resulted in a budget from the \nPresident that will double the entire national debt in 5 years and \ntriple the national debt in 10 years. The national debt--$5.7 trillion \nlast year--will go to $11 trillion-plus in 5 years and $17 trillion in \n10 years. That is unacceptable. It is irresponsible. We need to listen \nto our constituents and respond to their commonsense pleas that we act \nwith more\n\n[[Page S12592]]\n\nresponsibility in the Senate. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am here to speak on my amendment, which \nis a simple and straightforward amendment to create an enrollee \nsatisfaction survey for the qualified health plans offered through the \nexchange established in the Senate health care reform bill. Let me show \nyou how this will work. This is taken from the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program Web page that is administered by the Office of \nPersonnel Management, OPM. They lay out on the Web page how the survey \nworks.\n  The first question is:\n\n       How would you rate your overall experience with your health \n     plan?\n\n  Other questions are:\n\n       When you needed care right away, how often did you get care \n     as soon as you thought you needed it?\n       How often did your personal doctor listen carefully to you, \n     show respect for what you had to say, and spend enough time \n     with you?\n\n  This is all collected and put into a form and used when people make \nhealth care decisions on what plan to choose. One of the real measures \nof the quality of a health care plan is how satisfied people are with \nthat plan. It is a little bit hard to measure. We send out these \nsurveys to Federal employees. They come back and the information is \navailable to the public. People can click on this and know, when they \nare about to sign up for a plan, how the plan rates in satisfaction.\n  This is not a new idea. It has been around for a long time. It helps \npeople make good health care decisions. It allows them to compare one \ncompany to another. It allows them to look at what the people who have \nthat health care plan right now, how they perceive the performance of \nthe plan. It is a win-win for the whole system.\n  The idea is to make this part of the new law, and if you are on the \nexchange, you would have access to filling out one of these surveys; \nbut, more importantly, you would also have access to reading the \nsurveys and knowing, when you are making your health care choice, how \nyour company rates. Here are a few examples.\n  Again, this is from the Web page right now under the Federal health \ncare plan. The first question was about overall plan satisfaction. The \nFEHBP national average is 80 percent. People are 80 percent satisfied \nwith that. There is one insurance company that only has 54.5 percent. \nAnother one has 88.7 percent. So you can understand the range. Again, \nthat is not to say nobody is happy with that one at 54.5 percent, but \nit allows the people who are purchasing the health care to make an \ninformed decision before they enter into a contract with the company.\n  One of these categories is ``getting care quickly.'' The average is \n91.6 percent. It is not a big spread, but one company is at 88 percent, \na little below average. The highest company is at 93.5 percent, a \nlittle above average. That is not a very big spread, but if getting \ncare quickly is your most important thing, you may want to go to the \none where the people who use that insurance company right now say you \nget care the quickest.\n  Another issue is the claims processing. That is one of the questions \nhere: How does a company do in processing your claims? In our office, \nwe have hundreds of complaints from people around Arkansas who have had \nproblems with insurance companies processing their claims. Again, the \naverage here is 92 percent. That is what the FEHBP average is. There is \na company that has a 77-percent rating as a result of the survey. \nThere, again, that is not saying people would not choose that company; \nthey may choose it for other reasons. But if the claims processing part \nof their business is important, they may not choose that company, or at \nleast they know what they are getting into. The highest one I saw in \nthe claims processing was 96.8 percent.\n  You understand this is something that already exists, something I \ncannot imagine anybody having a problem with because it puts the tool \nin the hands of the people making decisions on the health care provider \nthat they are going to choose. It puts the tool in their hands, before \nthey choose them, to know what they are getting into.\n  Lastly, basically, this doesn't cost any money--and if it does, it is \njust a tiny amount. This is a very consumer-friendly tool. It \nsimplifies the process for people. It takes a lot of anxiety out of the \nprocess for people. It is also a very good commonsense, grassroots way \nto hold insurance companies accountable. If they don't do well in these \ncustomer surveys, chances are they will not get a lot of business in \nthe coming year. It puts a quality control there--a satisfaction-based \nquality control there. I think it is a great tool for keeping people \nhappy. I can guarantee you that, when they look at the survey from this \ncompany that only had 55 percent respond in a positive way, they are \ngoing to talk to their folks and say: We have to get that number up. \nWhat is going on in this company?\n  Again, this is something people talk about. I have heard many people \nin Arkansas and around the country say they want the same deal we have \nin Congress. This isn't all the same deal, but this is part of it. What \nwe are able to do is, when we make health care choices, we are able to \nhave this knowledge before we make a decision. Accountability and \nperformance go hand in hand. This is a great example of how we can do \nthat and have a very inexpensive way and a way that is meaningful to \nthe people making the decision. This is there at the point of decision.\n  I ask that all my colleagues join in this amendment. We will vote on \nthis, I understand, around 4 o'clock.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be charged equally between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I allocate the balance of our time to the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before the Senator speaks, I ask unanimous \nconsent to follow the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, how much time is there on the minority \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I may not take 12 minutes, I tell the \nSenator from Illinois so he may plan his time.\n  I am here to speak regarding the Gregg amendment. This health care \ndebate, in many ways, has been going on the better part of this entire \nyear. There are obviously differences in this body over philosophical \nissues and how health care needs to be delivered.\n  One of the things I hope has come across is that all of us would like \nto see health care reform. I campaigned on health care reform. I used \nto be commissioner of finance for the State of Tennessee. In that \nparticular role, I oversaw the Medicaid Program, which is called \nTennCare. I saw, firsthand, the tremendous plight of people not having \nappropriate health care and what they deal with on a daily basis. When \nI ran for the Senate--and I have been here 3 years now--I ran on the \nwhole notion of health care reform.\n  I have put forth numerous ideas during my first Congress, authored \nwith others bills that I feel would have delivered health care in an \nappropriate way to citizens across this country. The other part of the \ndebate, though, is not just philosophically how that is done--and we \nhave had a lot of give and take on that--but it has been the issue of \npaying for something such as this.\n\n[[Page S12593]]\n\n  Early on, I sat down with the chairman of the Finance Committee. I \nhave met ad nauseam with people on both sides regarding health care \ninsurance and sent to the majority leader of the Senate a letter, \nsigned by 36 Senators, to this effect: We all want to see health care \nreform.\n  But we also want to ensure that the entitlements that are in place, \nand in particular in this case Medicare, are on a sound footing. We \nwant to make sure those commitments we have made to seniors and future \nseniors will remain in place. And we want to make sure our country's \nfiscal condition is on solid footing.\n  I could go into discussions about how we are perceived around the \nworld as relates to our financial situation. I could talk about the \nvalue of the dollar. But I am going to speak about the one issue the \nGregg amendment addresses, and that is keeping integrity in the \nMedicare Program.\n  I believe the Senator from Illinois, who is going to speak in a \nmoment, and myself would be much closer in this debate had we not begun \nwith a fundamental building block of this bill using $464 billion in \nMedicare ``savings,'' to leverage an entirely new entitlement. For me \nthat was an absolute nonstarter. I know for Senator Enzi from Wyoming \nit was an absolute nonstarter.\n  We have a number of differences, but the fact that we would raid a \nprogram we all know is insolvent, that has $38.6 trillion of unfunded \nliabilities, that we know is going to end up creating havoc for our \ncountry if we do not deal with it, the fact that we would take savings \nfrom that program, which is insolvent, and use it to leverage a new \nentitlement, in my State and I think most States around the country, \ndoes not pass the commonsense test.\n  People have lined up on both sides. My friends on the left certainly \nsee this possibility, and certainly I am in no way implying any agenda \nissue, but this has become a political issue. The President obviously \nwas over here yesterday advocating that everybody stick together and \npass this bill. This one amendment we are getting ready to vote on this \nafternoon to me defines much of this debate; that is, are we truly as a \ncountry going to take $464 billion in savings from an insolvent program \nthat everyone knows is insolvent and use that to leverage a new \nentitlement, that even when it begins is insolvent also? If you look at \n10-year costs versus 10-year revenue, we know that over time, this new \nentitlement that might be created by this bill is also going to have \ntremendous fiscal implications to our country.\n  One of the most offensive pieces of this legislation is not only will \nwe be taking this $464 billion--and I realize the Senator from Illinois \nmentioned yesterday on the floor the fact that some of the things that \nare in this bill will lengthen the life of Medicare. I understand how \nthe math works on that. I do. I understand that. But I think the fact \nthat we would take, again, savings from a program that is an \nentitlement that people count on, that seniors count on and that future \ngenerations--these young people sitting before us on the steps, these \nwonderful people who have come here to help us--are going to ultimately \nbe stuck paying for, taking that money to create a new entitlement, to \nme, does not make sense.\n  The offensive part I was going to allude to is not even dealing with \nthe SGR, the doc fix. This pays for the doc fix, or SGR, for 1 year. \nFor those who are listening and don't know what that means, it means \nthat physicians who deal with Medicare recipients for 1 year will not \nreceive a 21-percent cut in reimbursements. But the very next year, \nthere is going to be a 23-percent cut to physicians who serve Medicare \nrecipients.\n  This bill, instead of taking those savings and dealing with that--and \nover a 10-year period that would cost $250 billion, I might add--\ninstead of dealing with that, we are going to throw that off to the \nside and use the $464 billion to create a new entitlement. I do not \nknow how anyone in this body can talk to their constituents or talk to \nany of us with a straight face and say that is a sensible thing to do.\n  All of us know we have huge deficits, and even though we disagree \nabout much of that, the stimulus, and other issues that are happening, \nthe thing that we agree on is our country has some long-term issues \nthat need to be dealt with. It seems to me we would show people around \nthis world who loan us money and certainly show our citizens back home \nthat we have the courage to deal with those entitlements.\n  I am hoping we are going to have an opportunity to vote on a task \nforce, a commission that will have a binding ability to cause us to \ndeal with Medicare and Social Security in a defined amount of time very \nsoon. But it seems to me the first huge step for all of us is to vote \nfor the Gregg amendment today.\n  I realize that if the Gregg amendment is adopted, the construct under \nwhich this entire health care reform bill is based would dissipate. I \nrealize that. I realize we are creating a health care bill from \nsomething that is insolvent, taking money from it to create something \nthat, again, will be insolvent.\n  What I say to my friends on the left is I stand ready to talk about \nsolutions. I have proposed solutions. I don't know how anybody in this \nbody can with a straight face say we are being responsible as it \nrelates to Medicare as an entitlement if, in fact, Members of this body \ndo not support the Gregg amendment which would keep this savings from \nbeing used for a new entitlement and instead would lock it away in a \nmanner to make Medicare more solvent for generations to come.\n  I thank my colleagues for the time. I do believe it is the initial \nbuilding blocks, the fundamentals of this bill that have kept us apart. \nI realize there are some emotional issues that separate Members of this \nbody, and my guess is that Senator Reid, in his managers' amendment, in \nworking with Senator Durbin and others, will figure out a way to \nresolve this issue. I know there is the issue of the public option. My \nguess is that will be figured out in some form or fashion on the other \nside of the aisle. There are other issues that I know are emotional \nthat divide us. But the fundamental building blocks of this bill are \nflawed. They are flawed. It is this very issue, plus a couple of \nothers, that has kept this body from being able to work together and \nhas made this debate a very partisan debate. I regret that.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will over the next \nfew days realize this is not something of common sense, this is not \nsensible. I hope they will reconvene and I hope that we together can \nfocus on something that will stand the test of time instead of kicking \nthe can down the road, knowing full well this is incredibly \nirresponsible.\n  My guess is--and I would love to hear the Senator from Illinois \ndispute this--if this bill were to pass in its present form, that \nwithin a week or two, the majority will take up the issue of paying for \nthe doc fix or not paying for it, but actually passing legislation to \nbasically throw debt on these young men and women sitting in front of \nus.\n  My guess is if this bill passes, the majority party will say: Oh, we \nhave to deal with the doc fix; we have to deal with SGR. By the way, \nthat is a $250 billion tab. My guess is the majority party is going to \nbring legislation forward in the next 2 or 3 weeks to deal with that--\nor maybe not in the next 2 or 3 weeks. I guess since we have a 1-year--\nwithin the next year the majority party will bring something forth to \ndeal with this issue and point back to this moment of disingenuous \nactivity on this floor. I hope that is not the case.\n  I thank all involved. I know this has been a very vigorous debate \nwhich I hope will carry on until we get it right. But I am very \ndisappointed that the fundamental building blocks of this bill have \nseparated us. I hope this body will stop what it is doing in regard to \nMedicare, come together, and do something that stands the test of time.\n  I realize my time is about up. I do not want to cause the Presiding \nOfficer to tell me that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. \nAlthough we disagree on this issue, I respect him very much. I am \nhoping--maybe it is a false hope--before the end of the day,\n\n[[Page S12594]]\n\nhe will join us and make this a truly bipartisan effort. We have tried, \nwe have reached out to the other side of the aisle for almost one \ncalendar year with lengthy hearings in the HELP Committee, in the \nFinance Committee, inviting Republican Senators to come join us.\n  There were times when there was kind of a tease that was going on \nwhere they would come in and offer amendments and the amendments would \nbe adopted in the HELP Committee. I think over 100 Republican \namendments were adopted. We felt they were coming our way, that we were \ngoing to have a bipartisan bill. Then the roll was called and not a \nsingle Republican Senator would vote for it.\n  As I stand here today, after 1 year of effort, despite three \ncommittees in the House going through markup, two committees in the \nSenate, despite the vote on the Senate floor, the official tally is \nthis: Only two Republicans have voted for health care reform. One \nCongressman from New Orleans, LA, a Republican Congressman, voted for \nthe House bill. One Republican Senator, Senator Snowe of Maine, voted \nfor the Finance Committee bill to be brought from the committee. We \nhave made a good-faith effort. We will continue to.\n  I salute the Senator from Wyoming who is on the floor who is the \nranking member of the HELP Committee. I know he spent long, arduous \nallocations of time meeting and trying to find a bipartisan solution \nwithout success. But thank you for trying.\n  I say to the Senator from Tennessee, we would like to have your \nsupport. We would like to have your help in passing this bill and truly \nmaking it bipartisan. That is our goal, and I hope it happens.\n  The Senator from Tennessee questioned the fundamental building blocks \nof this bill. I cannot resist the opportunity to say I think this is a \ngood bill, and I believe the effort that went into it by Senator Dodd, \nwho has now joined us, and the HELP Committee and Senator Baucus and \nthe Finance Committee gives us a bill that has many positive things.\n  This is our bill, 2,074 pages. It is the Democratic reform bill. You \nwill see the desks on the other side of the aisle are empty because \nthey do not have a bill. The Republicans have not produced a health \ncare reform bill. In 1 year of speeches and press releases and charts \nand appearances on television talking about health care reform, they \nhave not produced a comprehensive health care reform bill. I know why. \nIt is hard. It is very difficult to tackle one-sixth of our economy. We \ndid it, and it took a lot of effort, as I mentioned earlier.\n  Second, there are some in the Senate--not on this side of the aisle--\nsome in the Senate who do not believe we need to change. Some accept \nthe current system. I think if they accept it, then they have to answer \na few fundamental questions about the building blocks of this \namendment. If the Republican Senators who oppose our bill accept the \ncurrent system, what do they have to say about the affordability of \nhealth care premiums?\n  We know what has happened. Health care premiums have risen \ndramatically. Ten years ago, a health insurance plan for a family of \nfour was $6,000 on average. Today it is $12,000. We project in 8 years \nit will be $24,000. If we do not stop this, fewer and fewer Americans \nwill have health insurance, and what they have may not be any good.\n  We have in this bill efforts to reduce the increase in costs in \nhealth insurance premiums. Don't take my word for it. The Congressional \nBudget Office, which is the official umpire, has said, yes, the vast \nmajority of Americans will see their health insurance premiums either \ngo down in cost or not go up as they would have. So we address, No. 1, \nthe affordability of health care for businesses and families across \nAmerica. There is no Republican bill that does this.\n\n  Secondly, the provisions in this bill will extend protection of \nhealth insurance so that 94 percent of Americans will have the peace of \nmind of knowing they have health insurance. Thirty million more \nAmericans uninsured today will have health insurance. Of the lowest \nincome categories, some will qualify for Medicaid, the government \nprogram for the poor and disabled, and in other instances some will \nqualify for the health insurance program, but they will have \nprotection--30 million more Americans. There is no Republican bill or \namendment that extends coverage of health insurance to 30 million more \nAmericans. There is none.\n  There is a third issue, too. We have built into the front end of this \nbill what we call the health care bill of rights. It is about time \nsomebody stood up for families and individuals across America who have \nbeen treated very poorly by health insurance companies. These extremely \nprofitable companies make a lot of money by saying no--saying no to \nyour doctor's recommendation for surgery, saying no to your doctor's \nrecommendation for the appropriate medication. They have people who \njust say no. But here is what our bill does. Our bill says that in \nAmerica you will have the right to buy insurance if you have a \npreexisting condition.\n  What that basically means is the No. 1 reason that health insurance \ncompanies deny coverage today is going to come to an end. We are \ncreating new risk pools where preexisting conditions cannot exclude \nyou. I know everyone is concerned about that critical moment in time \nwhen there is a frightening diagnosis or a terrible accident that they \nwill turn to their health insurance they have paid into for a lifetime \nand the company will say: No. We checked your application and you \nfailed to disclose something about your past medical history--such as \nacne. Incidentally, that was one of the reasons used to refuse \ncoverage. So the first thing we do is make sure that Americans have the \nright to buy insurance and won't be excluded for preexisting \nconditions.\n  We also make sure you will be able to keep your insurance if you \nbecome sick or injured. Too many times when you get sick, your \ninsurance fails you. Two out of three people filing for bankruptcy in \nAmerica today file because of medical bills they can't pay--two out of \nthree. And 74 percent of them had health insurance. They thought they \nhad protection--they paid the premiums--but when they needed it, it \nwasn't there. So the No. 2 element in our health care bill of rights in \nthis bill is that you can keep your insurance if you become sick or \ninjured, that your insurance won't face lifetime limits on coverage, \nand that you will have affordable insurance if you lose or change your \njob. That is a large portion of the uninsured people in America.\n  Here is one that parents will appreciate. Remember when you first \nlearned when your family policy wouldn't cover your son or daughter, \nright as they were coming out of college? And you thought: Uh-oh, they \nare loaded with student debt, they are looking for a job, and now they \ndon't have health insurance. I can't tell you how many times I called \nmy daughter and said: Jennifer, have you got health insurance yet? Oh, \nyeah, dad, I will get to that soon. I didn't like to hear that. Parents \ndon't like to hear that. Well, we extend them from age 24, and we say \nthey can stay on their parents' insurance policy until they are 27. \nThat is an addition of several years of protection--peace of mind--\nwhile a young person goes about finding a job, starting a career, and \nstarting a family.\n  We also provide preventive care without extra cost, and we also begin \nto eliminate the discrimination in health insurance premiums. Health \ninsurance companies--insurance companies in general and health \ninsurance companies--are the only business, save American baseball, \nthat is exempt from antitrust laws, which means they can literally come \ntogether--the executives of the insurance companies--and decide how \nmuch to charge in premiums for women, the elderly, people who are \nmembers of a minority group, and they can make those distinctions and \ndo it legally. We put an end to that. We say you have a right to fair \ninsurance premiums without discrimination based on gender, health \nhistory, family history, or occupation.\n  There has not been a single Republican bill offered that offers this \npatients bill of rights to make sure we have this kind of protection \nwhen it comes to health insurance. It is one of the fundamental \nbuilding blocks when it comes to health care reform in America.\n\n[[Page S12595]]\n\n  The Senator from Tennessee and others have raised the question about \ndeficits and have said: Well, isn't this bill, for all that it seeks to \ndo, going to add more expense to our deficit? That was a legitimate \nquestion, asked by President Obama when he told us: If you want to do \nhealth care reform, don't do it at the expense of adding to our debt as \na nation.\n  When we passed the prescription drug bill under Medicare--when there \nwas a different party in charge in the Senate and in the White House--\nthey added $400 billion to the deficit and didn't blink--$400 billion \nin debt added to America with impunity. It meant more subsidies for \npharmaceutical companies--which do quite well--and more subsidies for \nhealth insurance companies--which are very profitable--at the expense \nof our deficit.\n  Now when it comes to this bill, that same party has returned to its \nrole as the deficit hawk. Well, they should look very carefully at this \nbill, because the Congressional Budget Office tells us this legislation \nwill reduce the deficit of the United States by $130 billion over the \nnext 10 years, and in the following 10 years there will be $650 billion \nin reduced deficit. That is almost $1 trillion in deficit savings over \n20 years.\n  There is no bill that has ever been introduced that makes this kind \nof deficit savings, according to the Congressional Budget Office. And \nunfortunately for their argument, there is not a single bill before us \non the Republican side of the aisle which would even come close to \nreducing the deficit in that regard. In fact, all the major amendments \nthat have been offered so far on the Republican side of the aisle add \nto our deficit. They want to continue the subsidy for private health \ninsurance companies under a program called Medicare Advantage.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has said repeatedly--and I hope he will \nsay again soon--that Medicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an \nadvantage. It is a subsidy from taxpayers to profitable health \ninsurance companies, which the Republican side of the aisle has labored \nday after day to protect--a private subsidy to health insurance \ncompanies. The health insurance companies can't stand this bill because \nit upsets their apple cart and maybe their profit and loss statement, \nand they can't stand the thought of having Medicare Advantage policies \nheld to accountability or losing the subsidy they currently have. But \nwe believe that if we are honest with Medicare and its future, we have \nto do that.\n  I want to address one issue that comes up every time my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle stand to speak, and it is the issue of the \nfuture of Medicare. They fail to recall that Senator Corker, from \nTennessee, Senator Dodd, myself, and the Presiding Officer all voted in \nfavor of the amendment offered by Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado. \nThe amendment that he offered--which is the most bipartisan amendment \nwe have had on this otherwise partisan bill--said nothing we do here in \nthis bill will in any way reduce or endanger guaranteed benefits under \nMedicare, No. 1. And, No. 2, any savings that we get from this bill \nunder the Medicare Program have to go back into putting Medicare on \nsolid financial footing, to extend the benefits available to seniors, \nand to reduce the cost to seniors.\n  We all voted for that. It is now a part of the law we want to pass. \nSo to come to the floor and argue the opposite is to ignore their own \nvotes on the issue. Senator Bennet of Colorado has passed a watershed \namendment that every senior and the families of seniors should respect \nas important to their future. So although you may disagree with the \nfundamental building blocks of this amendment, I think they are sound, \nI think they are responsible from a fiscal viewpoint, and they are \nresponsible when it comes to the future of Medicare.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield, and I will be \nglad to yield the floor, if the Senator from Connecticut wants to \nspeak.\n  Mr. DODD. No, no, but I certainly like these moments where we engage \na little bit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is perilously close to debate here in the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. Be careful about that. The last thing you want to have is a \ndebate here. We used to have them. It doesn't happen often enough these \ndays.\n  A couple of points you made can't be reinforced enough. One of the \ngreat worries, obviously, is the cost issue. I think everyone agrees \nthis is the great nightmare we have, the growing problem of cost--the \npremium costs. Again, we either love or hate CBO depending on what \nnumbers they come back to us with. I have been on both sides of those \nemotions when dealing with CBO, but we have come to recognize and \naccept the fact--I think collectively here--that we rely on them. This \nis not Mount Olympus, not to say they are 100 percent right on every \noccasion. But I was going over the numbers, and I wondered if my \ncolleague from Illinois--I know he is aware of these, but I may be \nwrong on some of this.\n  If you take the individual market in the country, there are 32 \nmillion people under CBO's analysis that are in the individual market. \nThey would pay, according to CBO, 14 to 20 percent less in premiums of \nan equivalent plan than under the status quo. In the small group \nmarket, there are 25 million people, according to CBO, who fall into \nthe small business market--the small group market, and the ones who are \neligible for tax credits would pay 8 to 11 percent less in premiums \nthan for an equivalent plan under the status quo. If you work for small \nbusiness and don't qualify for the tax credit, your premiums would be \nabout 2 or 3 percent lower. So you go from 8 to 11 percent to 2 or 3. \nAnd, lastly, where most people are--where five out of every six people \nwork, in the large group market--people who work for large employers--\nroughly 134 million people, according to CBO--would see lower premiums \nup to 3 percent than what they pay under the status quo.\n  That, to me, goes to the heart of this. Obviously, getting down and \nreducing our budget deficit by $130 billion, $150 billion the second \ndecade, is terribly important. But if I am sitting out there as a \nconsumer and I want to know one thing more than anything else--how is \nthis going to affect me; am I going to be paying more or less--as the \nSenator points out, we are now looking at the year 2000 in Connecticut \nwhere a family of four paid between $6,000 and $7,000 for health care \nand they are now paying $12,000, the same family, and in the next 7 \nyears they will go to 24,000, and some predict within 10 years going to \n35,000. Those are staggering increases.\n  Compare that, if you will, with what we are being told, even if these \nnumbers are off a little bit, and they may well be one way or the \nother. But assume for the sake of debate they are not off quite that \nmuch; they may almost be flat, the cost; not actually a reduction in \npremiums. I can't understand why people wouldn't embrace this in a \nwholehearted fashion and say this is a great achievement. No one has \nbeen able to improve these numbers.\n  Am I wrong about some of these numbers, or are those your \ncalculations as well?\n  Mr. DURBIN. As a matter of fact, the Senator from Connecticut, I \nwould say through the Chair, is quoting a study from the Congressional \nBudget Office requested by Senator Bayh of Indiana, who asked the \nstraight-up question of the Congressional Budget Office: If this is \npassed and becomes law, what will happen to premiums to people across \nAmerica? As the Senator from Connecticut correctly reports, the \npremiums are either going to stay the same or go down for the vast \nmajority of people; otherwise, they are going up dramatically.\n  There is one other element, which I know the Senator is aware of. If \nyou happen to be one of those callous, styptic-hearted individuals who \ncould care less about people who are uninsured, believing the poor will \nalways be with us, you ought to stop and reflect upon the fact that \nmany of the poor people with no health insurance receive medical care \nthrough charity, compassionate care from hospitals and doctors, and \ntheir costs are passed along. We estimate that current premiums reflect \nabout $1,000 to $1,200 a year that each of us pays--in addition to what \nwe need to cover our families--to cover those uninsured who receive the \nbenefits and the treatment they seek at hospitals.\n  So in addition to reducing the premiums, as the Senator from \nConnecticut said, as more and more people\n\n[[Page S12596]]\n\ncome into coverage with their own health insurance, there is less of a \npull on our benefit packages to subsidize the uninsured.\n  Mr. DODD. One other statistic that again jumps off the page at you, \nand I went back to my staff and said: Are you sure these numbers are \nright? I am told they are correct. For people who receive tax credits--\nand many do under our proposal here--the premium savings, on average, \nare 56 to 59 percent lower relative to the current individual market \npremiums--56 to 59 percent lower.\n  That is an incredible achievement in a piece of legislation designed \nto deal with cost--how do you get costs down? And of course the added \nelements of this--which again CBO doesn't calculate in showing \nreductions in premiums--include catastrophic options available to young \nadults, reinsurance provisions, which would reduce premiums even \nfurther. None of those calculations were actually calibrated by CBO in \narriving at their conclusion. So, actually, I think these numbers turn \nout to be far better than the ones we have just talked about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Connecticut, this affordability \nelement is the No. 1 reason why we need health care reform, and I think \nthe one reason why our critics on the other side of the aisle come to \nthis debate emptyhanded. They don't have anything to offer to reduce \nthe costs. We are looking for a comprehensive bill from the Republican \nside.\n  This is ours, and it has been on the Internet for over 2 weeks. Every \nword can be read by every person in America. That kind of transparency \nand disclosure is what we need in the course of this debate. I am sorry \nthe other side doesn't offer an alternative but does offer, \nunfortunately, amendments which don't enhance this bill's goals.\n  Mr. DODD. If I could get a last minute on the floor, Mr. President, I \ncommend Senator Mark Pryor, our colleague from Arkansas, whose \namendment we will vote on shortly. I commend him for his work. This is \na very worthwhile amendment he is offering, and gives individuals and \nsmall businesses better and more consistent information about insurance \nplans that would be sold in the exchange. All of us in this Chamber, \nand every Federal employee, gets one of these. This is a little \nbooklet. What it says is: ``Guide to Federal Benefits.'' I think I get \nsome 15 or 20 options this year. I get options--take a look. I can open \nthis book to various pages, and there is a comparative analysis of \nconsumer reactions to the various plans over the last year or so, what \nthey thought of them, how well they worked. There is nothing similar to \nthis. We put language in our bill out of the HELP Committee to try to \nput this in common language people can understand, getting away from \nthe small print, telling people what exactly will be the benefits under \ntheir plan, or the disadvantages, to some degree. The Pryor amendment \nincludes this kind of provision in the bill and strengthens it \ntremendously. I commend Senator Pryor of Arkansas for including a \nprovision in this bill that will provide greater clarity and greater \nunderstanding, the same kind of clarity we get under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits package that allows us to make that very \nsimple. You don't have to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand this. \nYou can go right through and they list it quickly, if it is only \nyourself, yourself and your family, what it is like in Delaware, the \nDistrict of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, every State. It is a very \nsimple, very clear understanding of how this works.\n\n  One of the complaints all of us get all the time, this is \ncomplicated. No matter how sophisticated you may think you are, trying \nto sort out what is the best plan for you--and I say this candidly, the \ninsurance industry isn't always as forthcoming in letting you know what \nthe disadvantages are as they are marketing their various plans to \npeople. So the Pryor amendment, I think, will go a long way toward \nproviding that kind of clarity and understanding that all Americans \nwant. I urge my colleagues to support the Pryor amendment when that \nissue comes up for a vote.\n  I see the time is 3. I inquire and see I have gone over a little bit \npast 3 o'clock. I apologize to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the next half hour, between \nnow and 3:30, be evenly divided as the time has been before and the \nfirst person recognized on the Democratic side in that slot be the \nSenator from Washington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And that the same other conditions will apply as the \nprevious unanimous consent.\n  Mr. CORKER. I wonder if the Senator from Illinois will yield for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Relative to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. CORKER. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have pending a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield and ask our time be evenly \ndivided, but I wish to give the Senator from Washington a chance to \nspeak for a few moments too.\n  Mr. ENZI. I think we are in alternating modes, so I could yield some \ntime to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I listened to the Senator from Illinois talking about \nMedicare, and I assume, based on his comments, there is a chance we may \nget a 100-to-zip vote on the Gregg amendment, which truly ensures that \nall Medicare savings are used to make sure Medicare is more solvent.\n  The Bennet amendment, as I think the Senator knows, was parodied in \nthe New York Times over the weekend, talking about it as toothless. It \nwas a cover vote to give people the opportunity to be able to say they \nvoted for something that saved Medicare, but actually the Gregg \namendment does that. It puts the money away in such a fashion that all \nsavings that are derived from Medicare are used to make Medicare more \nsolvent. I am assuming that, since the Senator from Illinois is so \nsupportive of ensuring that occurs, that he will be supporting this \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Tennessee is propounding a question, \nI will be opposing the Gregg amendment. I think the Bennet amendment \nachieves what we wanted to achieve. I think my friend from New \nHampshire in his amendment goes too far and, basically, we understand \nwhat he wants to do. He doesn't want to see us create tax credits to \nhelp families pay for health insurance premiums. He believes it is an \nentitlement. I think your side referred to it as such. I think it is \nimportant to help businesses and individuals who are struggling to pay \nhealth insurance premiums receive some assistance in doing so.\n  Mr. CORKER. So what the Senator from Illinois just said is the answer \nis no; that they are willing to use Medicare savings to create a new \nentitlement and they are not willing to do something that absolutely \nlocks away those savings so they can only be used to make Medicare more \nsolvent. I think all of us know the Bennet amendment was a cover vote. \nNothing around here that has any meaning passes with 100 votes, with 58 \nDemocrats, 40 Republicans, 2 Independents. The fact is, the whip on the \nother side of the aisle, whom I respect and who is very eloquent, has \njust said that, yes, we are willing to raid Medicare and to take the \nsavings from that, an insolvent program, to create a new entitlement or \na new program--whatever you want to call it; I don't want to be \npejorative--that is also going to be insolvent the day it starts, but, \nyes, we will take Medicare dollars directly. We will not do what \nSenator Gregg wants to do; that is, to be responsible, to try to make \nit solvent. We are going to lever it for a new entitlement--or a new \nprogram, whatever you want to call it--and I think, by virtue of this \nvote, we will see who in this body is serious about truly wanting to \nsave Medicare for seniors and making sure young people are not hocked \nto the hilt in the future.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time for the \nSenator from New Hampshire, but I will allow the Senator to speak now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon, \nalthough I know this is an extremely important issue we are debating, \nhealth care, but I wish to speak on a different topic.\n\n[[Page S12597]]\n\n  (The further remarks of Mrs. MURRAY are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 13\\1/2\\ minutes; the majority \nhas 1 minute 8 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 11 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, opponents of the Gregg amendment claim \nthe Reid bill doesn't technically change the law on guaranteed benefits \nfor beneficiaries. But they are ignoring the fact that while those \nbenefits may be ``technically guaranteed,'' if the cuts put health care \nproviders out of business, then those guarantees will be nothing more \nthan useless words in the Medicare Act. Guaranteed benefits are not \nworth much without health care providers that can treat patients, \nprovide home health services, and run hospitals and hospice agencies. \nThese claims are not good enough to assure seniors who have paid into \nthe Medicare Program for all these years. It is not good enough for \nprotecting access to health care services and the benefits that our \nseniors have been promised.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire in his amendment would back up those \nclaims with very real enforceable mechanisms to ensure that Medicare \nsavings are not being used to fund a whole new program at a time when \nthe trust fund is just about broke. The Gregg amendment is needed to \nprotect the Medicare Program. After all, if you knew the Medicare \nProgram already had $37 trillion in unfunded obligations, would you be \nassured without an enforcement mechanism to back up those promises? No \nguarantee is worth the paper it is written on without an enforcement \nmechanism to back it up. That is what the Gregg amendment is all about; \notherwise, it is just a meaningless guarantee that our friends on the \nother side of the aisle are talking about. It is not real without an \nenforcement mechanism.\n  Let me say for a third time, the Gregg amendment provides that \nenforcement mechanism. It makes guarantees real. It then goes much \nfurther than just the words we get from the other side of the aisle to \nmake sure that what seniors have they will actually get when needed.\n  Opposition to the Gregg amendment shines light on this issue. If the \nGregg amendment is not approved, it should be clear to everyone \nwatching that all the guarantees that are made from the other side of \nthe aisle that Medicare is protected in the Reid bill are worthless. As \na result, I hope everyone will be watching carefully how the other side \nvotes on the Gregg amendment. The Gregg amendment is essential for \nprotecting the Medicare Program. It is essential for making guarantees \nreal.\n  The way the Gregg amendment works to enforce those guarantees is \nquite simple. The Gregg amendment would make sure the Medicare Program \nis not used as a piggy bank to spend for other purposes. It would make \nsure the Medicare Program is not being raided to fund this new program, \nas the other side claims. Under this important amendment, the Director \nof the White House Office of Management and Budget and Medicare's Chief \nActuary would both be required to add up non-Medicare savings in the \nbill and compare that total to the total of new spending and revenues \nin this bill. The Gregg amendment works then that if the non-Medicare \nsavings don't offset all the new costs, then the Treasury Secretary and \nthe Health and Human Services Secretary would be prohibited from \nimplementing the new spending or revenue provisions in the bill. By \ndoing so, the Gregg amendment would ensure that non-Medicare savings \nare, in fact, paying for the new spending in this bill. It would ensure \nat the same time that Medicare itself is not being used to pay for new \nspending in the bill.\n  It is very simple, very straightforward. It brings common sense to \nthis whole argument that has been full of a lot of nonsense before now. \nThe amendment, therefore, would prevent massive government expansion at \nthe expense of Medicare beneficiaries. Massive expansion of government \nis one thing, if it is paid for, but it is quite another thing if you \ntake the money out of a trust fund that is on its way to being broke \nand use it to set up a brandnew entitlement program to the tune of $464 \nbillion.\n  As opposed to the mere nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolution the \nother side has offered to pretend to protect Medicare, this Gregg \namendment requires action, action that has to be taken to protect the \nMedicare Program. The Gregg amendment is the enforcement mechanism for \nthe guarantees the other side says they are making to protect Medicare. \nSlashing Medicare payments to start up another new and, in fact, \nunsustainable government entitlement program is not the way to address \nbig and unsustainable budgets.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2939\n\n  I would like to take a little bit of time to discuss the Pryor \namendment. I have always been a strong supporter of transparency. In \norder to have a successful free market, consumers need to have \ninformation. I can't think of any reason, besides my strong objection \nto the underlying 2,074-page bill, to oppose the Pryor amendment. It is \npretty straightforward. It requires that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services have a rating system for private health plans. That \nsounds OK to me. An informed consumer makes better decisions. So I \ndon't object to the Pryor amendment. But I do object to the fact that \nthe Pryor amendment is more proof that this bill is not being crafted \nout in the open on the Senate floor.\n  The Associated Press has confirmed, based on an e-mail circulated by \nDemocratic staff, that the Bennet amendment of last week to protect \nMedicare was simply ``a message amendment.''\n  The New York Times went on to call the Bennet amendment \n``meaningless.'' Now we have a Pryor amendment that requires a level of \ntransparency that, in fact, is already required by the bill. If you \nlook at page 134, the bill already describes a rating system developed \nby the Secretary that consumers can use to choose the right health \ninsurance plan. So if the underlying bill is already doing this, I can \nonly assume this amendment by my friend from Arkansas is specifically \ndesigned to buy time so the White House and Democratic leadership can \ncut deals and twist arms behind closed doors.\n  That is right. The American people need to know this bill is not \nbeing written on the Senate floor. In fact, we have a 2,074-page bill \nbefore us that took since October 2, until we took it up, for one \nSenator, the majority leader, to put together. Somehow the other 99 \nSenators shouldn't have 3 weeks to look at a bill that took well over a \nmonth to put together.\n  Then we had the President here yesterday speaking to his caucus. That \nkind of obviates any efforts to get bipartisan support for this bill. I \nthink it gives further proof that it is not only partisan but that what \nthis final 2,074-page bill is, we don't know yet. They are trying to \nput together some sort of a group that can get 60 votes to get a bill \npassed.\n  Do we really know what sort of a Christmas present we are giving to \nthe American people with this health reform bill? I don't think so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes for the Republicans \nand 1 minute 9 seconds for Democrats.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2942\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not sure when the vote is going to \noccur. I hope sooner rather than later.\n  First, I congratulate the Senator from Iowa who has been involved in \nMedicare and the issue of how we manage Medicare for many years, both \nas chairman of the Finance Committee and as ranking member. His \nanalysis of this situation relative to my amendment was absolutely dead \non and accurate, as he always is. It was a breath of fresh air, common \nsense and plain speak in this institution, which often gets convoluted, \ngets tied around its own axle. In this case, it didn't. The Senator \nfrom Iowa was very precise, a Senator who used to be chairman of the \nFinance Committee and is now ranking.\n  My amendment is simple. It says the cuts in Medicare in this bill, \nwhich are\n\n[[Page S12598]]\n\nsubstantial--$460 billion over the first 10 years, $1 trillion over the \n10 years when fully implemented, $3 trillion over 20 years, that is how \nmuch Medicare is cut--the cuts come out of primarily Medicare Advantage \nand provider payments, all of which will translate into a lesser \nquality of care for senior citizens, that those Medicare cuts cannot be \nused for the purpose of financing new programs which have nothing to do \nwith seniors. The new entitlements in this bill are significant, they \nare expensive, and they benefit a number of people. But they don't \nbenefit seniors. In fact, they benefit very few people who have even \npaid into the hospital insurance fund from which the Medicare trust \nfund is funded. It is totally inappropriate to take Medicare money and \nuse it to fund a brandnew entitlement, a series of new initiatives, the \nbiggest of which is a brandnew entitlement and the expansion of \nMedicaid.\n\n  The other side of the aisle--and 100 participated in the vote--\nsponsored an amendment, agreed to 100 to nothing, which said that \nwouldn't happen; that Medicare money would not be used for the purpose \nof funding new programs that had nothing to do with Medicare, the \nBennet amendment. But that was a political vote. Everybody knew that \nwas a statement. It was called a sense of the Senate. It didn't even \nraise to the standard of being an amendment. It is something around \nhere that is a unique vehicle, the purpose of which is to make a \npolitical statement; not worth much more than the paper it is printed \non.\n  This is different. This amendment, as the Senator from Iowa pointed \nout, is real. It has a hardened enforcement mechanism which requires \nthat moneys which are saved by cutting senior citizen benefits and by \ncutting Medicare will not be used for the purposes of creating new \nprograms at the Federal level.\n  I have heard from the other side of the aisle that this is an \namendment that destroys the bill because all these new benefits they \nhave plowed in here--there are benefits for a lot of new folks in here; \nthere are benefits for Senators whose votes they need, and that has \nbeen publicly reported; all funded in large part by Medicare reductions \nor significantly by Medicare reductions--I have heard the other side of \nthe aisle say that is going to destroy these new programs. No, it is \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As long as we get an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. These programs are not going to be terminated by this \nbill. The programs will still be in the law. They will still go \nforward. They just have to be paid for with something other than \nseniors' money, with something other than Medicare. That representation \nfrom the other side of the aisle is a straw dog.\n  What is not a straw dog is that my amendment enforces the language \nwhich this Congress, this Senate has already voted on 100 to nothing in \nthe Bennet amendment. It says Medicare money will not be used to fund \nnew programs that are not Medicare related. In the end, that means \nMedicare money will be used, hopefully, to the extent that these cuts \ngo into place and these changes and benefits go into place, for \nseniors, to make the Medicare system more solvent because it is already \nheaded toward insolvency.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, do I have 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague from Iowa \nearlier talking about the ``meaningless amendments'' and that \namendments that do not have any teeth are just meaningless, stuff like \nthat. I listened to that.\n  I want to make it very clear that the Gregg amendment is not a \nmeaningless amendment. It has a lot of meaning because what it does is \nit kills health reform. Oh, yes, this is a meaningful amendment, make \nno mistake about it. It goes right to heart of what the health reform \nis all about: making sure people at the low-income end of the scale \nhave a little bit better coverage; that is, people on Medicaid--that is \nsection 2001--the tax credits and the copays that are in there, again, \nto help moderate-income people and families be able to afford better \ncoverage for themselves and their families--he guts that too--and, of \ncourse, the expansion of SCHIP.\n  So really, yes, I say to my friend from Iowa, this is a meaningful \namendment--if you want to kill the bill, if you want to kill it. I \nsuppose since most of my friends on that side of the aisle would like \nto kill the bill, they will probably vote for the Gregg amendment. But \nit completely guts it--completely guts it. Why? To help protect the \nwasteful subsidies to the insurance companies at the expense of \nfamilies who are struggling to afford insurance and seniors who rely on \nMedicare.\n  This bill lowers premiums for American families, businesses, and the \ncountry as a whole. The Congressional Budget Office just said that this \nweek. It strengthens Medicare, it improves benefits, and it adds years \nof life to the Medicare trust fund.\n  Let's be clear. Not one dime of the Medicare trust fund is used to \npay for this reform, and no guaranteed Medicare benefits will be cut. \nIf anyone can prove otherwise, please come forward. We have had a lot \nof rhetoric about it, but prove that this statement is not true: Not \none dime of the Medicare trust fund is used to pay for reform and no \nguaranteed Medicare benefits will be cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to vote in relation to the Pryor amendment No. 2939; and \nthat upon disposition of that amendment, there be 2 minutes of debate \nprior to a vote in relation to the Gregg amendment No. 2942; that no \namendments be in order to either amendment, and that the second vote in \nthis sequence be 10 minutes in duration; that each of the above-\nreferenced amendments be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold, \nand if the amendment achieves that threshold, then it be agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that if the amendment \ndoes not achieve that threshold, then it be withdrawn; that upon \ndisposition of the above amendments, Senator Nelson of Nebraska be \nrecognized to call up his amendment No. 2962; that once the amendment \nhas been reported by number, it be set aside, and the Republican \nleader's designee be recognized to call up his motion to commit with \ninstructions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I believe I \nstill have 15 seconds left on my time. But independent of that, I would \nask that this unanimous consent request be amended and that we agree to \nthe Pryor amendment by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, will the \nSenator please repeat what he just asked?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I requested that we amend the unanimous \nconsent request and agree to the Pryor amendment by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will have to object to that. I have no \ninstructions from Senator Pryor. I believe he wants a vote on his \namendment. So I would have to object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard for the modification.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to modify my request, that the 2 \nminutes I asked for for debate prior to the vote be evenly divided \nbetween the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's \nmodification?\n  Mr. GREGG. I reserve the right to object because I would like to \nreserve my 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator's time will be \nreserved, his 15 seconds will be reserved.\n  Is there objection to the original request of the Senator from Iowa?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has 15 seconds.\n\n[[Page S12599]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I reserved the 15 seconds because it is \neasy to respond to the Senator from Iowa and it only takes 15 seconds.\n  Taking money out of the Medicare fund to fund other parts of this \nbill is a mistake and it is not appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator still has 3 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield my 3 seconds. \nActually, I yield it to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2939\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to speak on my amendment for \njust 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues to look at this \namendment very closely. It is a good consumer-oriented amendment that \nwill allow people to make smart decisions on their health insurance. We \nneed more of this type of information to allow the premium payers to \nmake good decisions for themselves, for their families, and for their \nbusinesses. So I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nconsider voting for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2939.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on \nthe amendment No. 2942, offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Gregg amendment is a killer \namendment. It would kill the tax cuts in the bill, kill assistance for \ncopays, kill the Medicaid expansion for the lowest income Americans, \nkill additional funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Proponents advertise this amendment as protecting Medicare. That is \nfalse advertising. The Gregg amendment would kill health care reform. \nHealth care reform would extend the life of the Medicare trust fund by \n4 to 5 years. Health care reform would result in commonsense changes, \nsuch as decreasing hospital readmissions, decreasing hospital-acquired \ninfections, and paying doctors and hospitals to work together. Health \ncare reform will not reduce guaranteed Medicare benefits. Health care \nreform would extend the life of the Medicare trust fund.\n  The choice is clear. If you want to vote against tax cuts, Medicaid, \nand the Children's Health Insurance Program, vote for the Gregg \namendment. If you want to extend the life of Medicare, vote against it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate--although it was with a bit \nof hyperbole--that the Senator from Montana has made my case.\n  The Medicare trust fund and its recipients will be cut by almost $\\1/\n2\\ billion in the first 10 years. That money will be taken to fund \ninitiatives that have nothing to do with senior citizens, and it will \nnot benefit them.\n  In the end, it is going to mean the Medicare trust fund is less \nsolvent and less capable of sustaining the benefits seniors deserve. \nThis is the only amendment we will get to vote on that absolutely \nguarantees the Medicare funds will not be used to fund a new \nentitlement or the purchase of votes for the purpose of passing this \nbill or to fund anything else in this bill that isn't tied to the \nsenior citizens' benefits.\n  You can either vote with seniors and protect the Medicare funds for \nthem or you can vote to raid the Medicare fund and spend it on \nsomething else.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I call up amendment No. \n2962.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the use of Federal funds for abortions)\n\n       Beginning on page 116, strike line 15 and all that follows \n     through line 15 on page 123, and insert the following:\n       (a) Special Rules Relating to Coverage of Abortion \n     Services.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), nothing in this \n     Act (or any amendment made by this Act) shall be construed to \n     require any health plan to provide coverage of abortion \n     services or to allow the Secretary or any other person or \n     entity implementing this Act (or amendment) to require \n     coverage of such services.\n       (2) Community health insurance option.--The Secretary may \n     not provide coverage of abortion services in the community \n     health insurance option established under section 1323, \n     except in the case where use of funds authorized or \n     appropriated by this Act is permitted for such services under \n     subsection (b)(1).\n       (3) No discrimination on the basis of provision of \n     abortion.--No Exchange participating health benefits plan may \n     discriminate against any individual health care provider or \n     health care facility because of its unwillingness to provide, \n     pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.\n       (b) Limitation on Abortion Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--No funds authorized or appropriated by \n     this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) may be used to \n     pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any \n     health plan that includes coverage of abortion, except in the \n     case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical \n     injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a \n     physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an \n     abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical \n     condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, or \n     unless the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or \n     incest.\n       (2) Option to purchase separate supplemental coverage or \n     plan.--Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as \n     prohibiting any non-Federal entity (including an individual \n     or a State or local government) from purchasing separate \n     supplemental coverage for abortions for which funding is \n     prohibited under this subsection, or a plan that includes \n     such abortions, so long as--\n       (A) such coverage or plan is paid for entirely using only \n     funds not authorized or appropriated by this Act; and\n       (B) such coverage or plan is not purchased using--\n       (i) individual premium payments required for a qualified \n     health plan offered through the Exchange towards which a \n     credit is applied under section 36B of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986; or\n       (ii) other non-Federal funds required to receive a Federal \n     payment, including a State's or locality's contribution of \n     Medicaid matching funds.\n       (3) Option to offer supplemental coverage or plan.--Nothing \n     in this subsection shall restrict any non-Federal health \n     insurance issuer offering a qualified health plan from \n     offering separate supplemental coverage for abortions for \n     which funding is prohibited under this subsection, or a plan \n     that includes such abortions, so long as--\n       (A) premiums for such separate supplemental coverage or \n     plan are paid for entirely with funds not authorized or \n     appropriated by this Act;\n       (B) administrative costs and all services offered through \n     such supplemental coverage or plan are paid for using only \n     premiums collected for such coverage or plan; and\n       (C) any such non-Federal health insurance issuer that \n     offers a qualified health plan through the Exchange that \n     includes coverage for abortions for which funding is \n     prohibited under this subsection also offers a qualified \n     health plan through the Exchange that is identical in every \n     respect except that it does not cover abortions for which \n     funding is prohibited under this subsection.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, would my friend yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we are trying to get the times locked in \nso that Senators who have come over here get their time. So I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Nelson speak for 10 minutes, Boxer for \n5, Mikulski for 10, Grassley for 10, Cornyn for 10, Gillibrand for 10, \nand then Senator McCain wishes to comment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, my lead cosponsor, Senator \nHatch, will appear sometime later and speak in favor of amendment 2962. \nHe is unable to be here at the moment.\n  Before the Thanksgiving break, I voted with a number--and the \nmajority, actually--of my colleagues in favor of beginning this debate. \nDebate is essential in our democracy. It keeps our country resilient \nand strong through changing times.\n  Before that vote, some argued here on the Senate floor that we \nshouldn't hold this open and full debate. They seemed to suggest that \nobstruction was better than action. Some also argued here on the floor \nthat the November 21 vote was about abortion. They were wrong. That \nvote was whether to begin a debate on an issue that has consumed the \nAmerican public. Now is the time to start debating the issue of \nabortion, as we are addressing many other issues in health care reform.\n  I wish to discuss the amendment that I propose, along with a \nbipartisan group of colleagues, which includes Senators Hatch, Casey, \nBrownback, Thune, Coburn, Johanns, Vitter, and Barrasso. The amendment \nwe offer today mirrors the Stupak language added to the House health \ncare bill.\n  For more than three decades, taxpayer money has not been used for \nelective abortions, and it shouldn't under any new health reform \nlegislation either. Some suggest that the Stupak language imposes new \nrestrictions on abortion. I disagree. We are seeking to justify the \nsame standards on abortion to the Senate health care bill that already \nexist for Federal health programs. They include those covering \nveterans, all Federal employees, Native Americans, active-duty \nservicemembers, and others.\n  I note that the Senate health care bill, if enacted, would indeed \nchart new ground--it covers abortion. The language in the bill goes \naround the Federal standard disallowing public funding of abortion. A \nclear majority of Americans, including my constituents in Nebraska, \nsupport this prohibition against using public money to cover abortion. \nOur amendment formally extends that standard to this health reform \nbill.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has held that government may regulate abortion \nand may disallow public funds being used for elective abortions. \nBeginning in 1976, with the Hyde amendment, Congress has prohibited \npublic funding for elective abortion in all significant health-related \nbills. Exceptions have been preserved for when the life of the mother \nis in danger or in cases of rape or incest. And except for those \nexceptions, public funds may not be used for any health care benefits \npackage that covers abortion.\n  Some have now cited the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program--\nFEHBP--as a possible model for health care reform. The FEHBP helps pay \npremiums for many different private health insurance plans. That way, \nFederal employees may choose the insurance plan that best suits their \nbudget and personal needs. It is important to note that none of the \nbenefits packages offered to Federal employees provide health insurance \ncoverage for abortion. I repeat: None of the benefits packages offered \nto Federal employees provide coverage for abortion, nor do benefits \npackages that are offered to individuals in other Federal programs, \nsuch as the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, Medicaid, \nIndian Health Services, veterans health, and military health care \nprograms.\n  Some have argued that the Stupak language imposes tougher \nrestrictions than in current law. That is not the case. Our amendment \nmerely aims to extend the current standard to this new legislation.\n  On another point, under Federal law, States are allowed to set their \nown policies concerning abortion. Many States oppose the use of public \nfunds for abortion. Many States also have passed laws that regulate \nabortion by requiring informed consent and waiting periods, requiring \nparental involvement in cases where minors seek abortions and \nprotecting the rights of health care providers who refuse, as a\n\n[[Page S12601]]\n\nmatter of conscience, to assist in abortions. And perhaps most \nimportantly, there is no Federal law, nor is there any State law, that \nrequires a private health plan include abortion coverage.\n  I believe the current health care reform we are debating should not \nbe used to open a new avenue for public funding of abortion. We should \npreserve the current policies prohibiting the use of taxpayer money for \nabortion that have existed for more than three decades.\n  A number of polls this year have again shown that most Americans do \nnot support using taxpayer money for abortion. The Senate bill, as \nproposed, goes against that majority public opinion. The bill says the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services may allow elective abortion \ncoverage in the Community Health Insurance Option--the public option--\nif the Secretary believes there is sufficient segregation of funds to \nensure Federal tax credits are not used to purchase that portion of the \ncoverage.\n  The bill would also require that at least one insurance plan cover \nabortion and one that does not cover abortion be offered on every State \ninsurance exchange. Federal legislation establishing a public option \nthat provides abortion coverage and Federal legislation allowing States \nto opt out of the public option that provides abortion coverage eases \nthe restrictions established by the Hyde amendment.\n  Our amendment would prohibit Federal funds from being used for \nelective abortion services in the public option and also prohibit \nindividuals who receive tax credits from purchasing a plan that \nprovides elective abortions.\n  I have always been pro-life and I have a strong record opposing \nabortion. As Governor of Nebraska in the 1990s, I signed into law the \nparental notification law and the ban against partial birth abortion. \nIn the Senate, I cosponsored and voted for legislation that prohibits \ntaking minors across State lines to avoid parental notification laws \nand voted for legislation creating a separate offense for harming or \nkilling an unborn child in utero during the commission of specified \nviolent crimes.\n  Aside from my personal views, however, I think most Americans would \nprefer that the health care reform we are working on remain neutral on \nabortion. Public polls suggest so. So does the fact that over the last \n30-plus years Congress has passed new Federal laws that have not \nprovided public funding for abortions.\n  So the question has been settled: Most Americans, even some who \nsupport abortion, do not want taxpayer money to be used for abortions. \nWe should not break with precedent on this bill.\n  And, finally, as President Obama has said, this is a health care \nreform bill. It is not an abortion bill. It is time to simply extend \nthe standard disallowing public funding of abortion, which has stood \nthe test of time, to new proposed Federal legislation.\n  I look forward to debating this and other issues in the health reform \nbill as we work to address solutions to our troubled health care \nsystem. Today it costs too much and delivers too little to the people \nof my State and to most Americans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this last Thursday was one of those days \nin Washington where the left hand of government didn't know what the \nright hand was doing. On one end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the President \nwas hosting a jobs summit. But here on the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, we continued debate on a health care bill which will, for \nreasons I will explain, be a job killer and will discourage small and \nlarge businesses from hiring new people, even though unemployment \nexceeds double digits.\n  The November jobs number shows the economy is still hurting. Not only \nis the unemployment rate at 10 percent, 11,000 more families have lost \na breadwinner. More than 15 million Americans remain unemployed, and \nmore than 3 million Americans have lost their jobs since Congress \npassed the stimulus bill in February, which failed in its essential \npurpose--to keep unemployment under 8 percent.\n  According to an article by Mort Zuckerman in U.S. News and World \nReport, 21 percent of all families have an immediate family member who \nhas lost a job. My family is one of those. My daughter has lost a job. \nAnd, according to the article, 33 percent--a third--of U.S. families \nhave an immediate family member or a close friend who has lost a job. \nBut the President, during the jobs summit, seemed to be completely \nunaware of the impact that policies here in Washington have on the \ndesire and willingness of job creators to actually re-hire laid-off \nAmerican workers. He seemed to be oblivious to the role of the private \nsector in creating those jobs.\n  If you look at the States that have been most successful in creating \njobs, it is clear that jobs-friendly policies can actually lead to \nbetter results. I don't want to brag, but Texas has been one of the \nbest economies we have had, even during this tough recession. Many \nanalysts have wondered why that is--from the Wall Street Journal to The \nEconomist. But it is clear to me that the Texas economy has been doing \nbetter than other States because our laboratory of democracy has \nembraced better policies--things such as growing jobs in the private \nsector over government, lower taxes, fiscal discipline, right-to-work \nlegislation, and commonsense civil justice reforms, to mention a few.\n  But my State isn't the only State that has been successful in \nembracing these sound job-creating policies. Other States have adopted \nsimilar policies and they have seen similar results. That is why it is \nso frustrating to many of us to see the White House ignore these \nresults and focus on policies that will actually kill jobs, not \nencourage job creation.\n  For example, cap and trade. In Texas alone, according to the State \ncomptroller, more than 300,000 jobs would be lost in the State of Texas \nif we embrace the ill-considered and misguided cap-and-trade \nlegislation that has passed the House and which we will consider \nlater--perhaps next year. Here is a quote from economist Anne Layne-\nFarrar regarding card check--eliminating the secret ballot:\n\n       For every 3 percentage points gained in union membership \n     through card checks and mandatory arbitration, the following \n     year's unemployment rate is predicted to increase by 1 \n     percentage point--and job creation predicted to fall by about \n     1.5 million jobs.\n\n  So cap and trade is a job killer and card check is a job killer. Then \nthere are higher taxes. Small businesses, which are America's best job \ncreators, may soon face the highest marginal tax rate in a quarter of a \ncentury. And still the White House wants to raise taxes higher on \nenergy producers right here at home as well as companies that sell \nAmerican products in foreign markets. The biggest job killer of all, of \ncourse, is the bill that is presently on the Senate floor. This is a \n$2.5 trillion expansion of government, and it will cost Americans jobs \nin a number of ways.\n\n  We will recall the President's pledge on September 12, 2008. He said:\n\n       I make a firm pledge under my plan, no family making less \n     than $250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes.\n\n  But yesterday the Joint Tax Committee came out with a new score or \nanalysis of what the impact would be of the Reid health care bill. They \nsaid the Reid health care bill increases taxes for 25 percent of \ntaxpayers earning less than $200,000. That is even after the subsidies \nthat are provided for in this bill are applied. Without those subsidies \nabout 42 percent of taxpayers would see an increase in their taxes.\n  There are nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion of higher taxes in this bill, \nincluding things such as $149 billion in excise taxes on Americans who \nhave certain types of health plans, a $15.2 billion tax on all \ntaxpayers with catastrophic medical costs, and $14.6 billion of \nadditional taxes on workers who use FSAs.\n  There are also taxes that allegedly target only the rich. But you \nknow what. These taxes hit thousands of small businesses. That is \nright; the very job creators we are trying to encourage to create new \njobs and retain new jobs, particularly those who file as sole \nproprietors or partnerships or subchapter S corporations that pay \nflowthrough income on individual tax returns at individual rates.\n  For example, a $54 billion increase in the Medicare payroll tax would \nbe used not to pay for Medicare but to pay for yet a new entitlement \nspending program. The Reid bill also adds $100 billion in new taxes and \nfees on the health\n\n[[Page S12602]]\n\ncare industry which will, of course, be passed down to consumers, which \nis one reason insurance premiums are calculated to go up under this \nbill, not down.\n  The Reid bill would create new punitive taxes on businesses that do \nnot offer a Washington-approved health care plan.\n  Then there is the employer mandate. The employer mandate will kill \njobs because the additional cost of insurance will be passed along to \nworkers in the form of lower wages or result in reduced hours or \nlayoffs. Harvard Professor Kate Baicker said this:\n\n       Workers who would lose their jobs are disproportionately \n     likely to be high school dropouts, minority and female. . . . \n     Thus, among the uninsured, those with the least education \n     face the highest risk of losing jobs under employer mandates.\n\n  I mentioned the Reid bill would raise premiums for small businesses. \nUnder one study those premiums in the group market would rise by 20 \npercent. I thought the purpose of health care reform was to lower and \nmake more affordable health care, not to make it more expensive. But \nthe Reid bill does the opposite of reform and makes it worse, not \nbetter.\n  Then, of course, the Reid bill would kill jobs by increasing the cost \nshifting due to low Medicaid reimbursements. Of course, cost shifting \noccurs because Medicaid pays a fraction of what private insurance pays. \nMedicare pays about 80 percent, and so in order to make up the \ndifference, those with private health insurance have to pay an \nadditional cost in the form of cost shifting. Fifteen million more \nAmericans on Medicaid would make this worse, not better.\n  The Reid bill would kill jobs by raising State and local taxes \nbecause of unfunded mandates. Because of the expansion of Medicaid, \nwhich is not paid for by the Federal Government, over 10 years the \nState of Texas alone would see $20 billion more in Medicaid spending \nbecause of this unfunded mandate--$20 billion. We are a big State, but \nwe can't afford $20 billion more in an unfunded mandate because of the \nMedicare expansion under this bill.\n  It should not be any surprise that the Reid bill and these other job-\nkilling policies are the reasons the private sector is not hiring. \nAgain, according to Mort Zuckerman of U.S. News and World Report, \nbusinesses ``are holding back in hiring because of anxiety over the \nadministration's policies on such matters as increased health care \ncosts . . . higher taxes . . . more corporate regulations . . . and \ndisaffecting labor policies.''\n  These policies are causing the greatest anxiety among small business \nowners. Firms with fewer than 20 workers employ a quarter of the \nworkforce. In the last economic expansion they accounted for 4 out of \n10 new jobs.\n  I hear this from my constituents in Texas, people such as Richard \nBelden who owns a small retail grocery business that has been in the \nfamily for 54 years and employs 75 people. He files as a subchapter S \ncorporation, so he pays taxes according to the highest marginal tax \nbracket. He is going to get hit by these taxes.\n  Do you think that is going to make it easier for him to hire more \npeople and keep the people he has or make it harder? I think the answer \nis self-evident.\n  This is from Nathan Avard, who owns and operates five Burger King \nrestaurants in northeast Texas and employs more than 100 people. He \nsaid the employer mandate included in this bill will make it harder, \nnot easier, for him to keep the employees he has. He believes the \nemployer mandate would cost him thousands of dollars per restaurant, \neffectively eliminating much of his profit and making it exceedingly \ndifficult for him to operate and improve his business in this economy.\n  I have heard the same story from the Chamber of Commerce in Lubbock, \nTX, that represents more than 2,100 businesses that employ more than \n57,000 workers. But it is not just the Lubbock, TX, Chamber, but the \nGreater Irving-Los Colinas Chamber, the Greater Austin Chamber, the \nRosenberg-Richmond Area Chamber, the Harlingen Area Chamber, the \nLiberty-Dayton area Chamber, the Tyler Area Chamber, the Bryan/College \nStation's Chamber, the Port Aransas Chamber, the Northwest Houston \nChamber, the Odessa Chamber, the Deer Park Chamber, the Henderson Area \nChamber, the West I-10 Chamber, the Crowley Area Chamber, Marble Falls/\nLake LBJ Chamber, Granbury Chamber, McAllen Area Chamber, and the \nWashington County Chamber. You get the idea. These are job-killing \npolicies, and this bill is perhaps the biggest of them all.\n  Of course, a few enterprises will get bigger under the Reid bill; \nnamely, the Internal Revenue Service. According to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, the IRS will need a budget nearly twice \nits current size to enforce the Reid bill. The IRS will need more \nagents and more bureaucrats to collect the new taxes, enforce all of \nthe new mandates, and apply all the additional redtape.\n  I think we should be about facilitating the creation of new jobs not \nkilling jobs through ill-considered policies such as this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is an honor to be here in the Senate \nat a time when we are working on one of the major issues of our time. \nWe know that generations of leaders in both parties have tried to solve \nthe health care crisis, and they have done it bit by bit. We read \nhistory. We know that leaders struggled with Social Security. The \nDemocrats were in the forefront. Republicans fought us every step of \nthe way. Franklin Roosevelt took the lead on that, and we had John \nKennedy and Lyndon Johnson take the lead on Medicare. The Republicans \nfought us every inch of the way. We had some cooperation from certain \nSenators and certain Members of Congress, but overall it was very \ndifficult.\n  This fight is very difficult to make sure that we turn things around. \nWe live in a society where, if we do not step into the breach--we are \ntold by nonpartisan surveys that if we do nothing--and this is \nimportant--average premiums for our families in California will be 41 \npercent of income. In States such as Pennsylvania it will be 50 percent \nof income. We know what that means. People will not have health \ninsurance. So we can pull the covers over our heads and say it is too \nhard; it is too tough. We can turn our backs on the fact that 62 \npercent of bankruptcies are related to a health care crisis. We could \nturn our backs on that. We could turn our backs on the fact that the \ninfant mortality rate in America is 29th out of 30 nations--that is \nwhere we come out.\n  This is America, the greatest country in the world. Something is \nwrong when so many people do not have access to insurance; and even if \nthey do, when they need it most it is gone.\n\n  How proud am I to be here at this time? Very proud. How grateful am I \nto the people of my State for sending me back here three times, so I \ncan stand here and be a voice for them? I can't tell you how proud I \nam.\n  When we started this health care debate we knew it was important to \nthe people we represent and we knew it was important to the economy of \nthis country. Senator Cornyn has gotten up and said this bill is \nterrible for the economy. Let me tell you, there are $27 billion of tax \ncuts in this bill. Let me repeat that--$27 billion of tax cuts for \nsmall business.\n  There are billions of dollars of tax breaks for individuals. For \npeople to stand up and say this is not good for our economy, I don't \nthink they understand or get it. If we continue with the status quo, \nthat is when we are in trouble.\n  The women of the Senate have been very involved, the Democratic \nwomen. We have worked together to make sure this bill meets the needs \nof all of our families, including the women of this country. Senator \nMikulski, who is on the floor, took the lead and made sure that we \ncorrected a problem that was in the bill, a problem which basically was \nunclear as to who was going to set the benefits. We wanted to make sure \nthat women could get mammograms after 40 every year. Senator Mikulski \nfixed it by making sure the head of Health and Human Services is going \nto be the one to decide what is covered.\n  Women's prevention has now gone way up to the top of the list because \nof Senator Mikulski and the women who worked with her. We are very \nproud of that.\n  There is one thing that was taken care of in the Reid bill that we \ndidn't\n\n[[Page S12603]]\n\nthink we would have an argument about; that is, we thought we had an \nunderstanding that we were not going to bring up the issue of abortion; \nthat it was not necessary to do it because we were not doing anything \nin the bill--Senator Reid doesn't do anything in the bill that changes \nthe current agreement.\n  Let me say, because I started in the House in the 1980s, I was part \nof that agreement. I offered the amendment that said, yes; it is true \nno Federal funds could be used unless the life of the woman was at \nstake, for abortion. Through my amendment we added rape and incest. \nThose are the only three exceptions. No Federal funds could be used for \nabortion except to save the life of the woman or if she is a victim of \nrape or incest. That agreement has held for three decades.\n  It is fair to say neither side is thrilled with it, but the fact is, \nthe agreement has held. The fact is, Senator Reid has crafted a bill, \nwhich is the underlying bill, that preserves that three-decades-long \nagreement.\n  But over on the House side they passed the radical Stupak amendment \nwhich strikes at the heart of this delicate compromise by preventing \nwomen from using their own private funds for their legal reproductive \nhealth care. That is a big shock because women have been able to \nutilize their own private funds in order to get a legal procedure--\nlegal procedure--and never has anyone, to my knowledge, on either side \nof the aisle said she could not get access to insurance to cover the \nwhole range of legal reproductive health care if she uses her own \nfunds. This amendment takes us way back.\n  Here is what is interesting. The people who bring us this--mostly it \nis going to be the men who speak on this, I think. We will see if that \nis right or wrong, but I predict that.\n  The men who have brought us this do not single out a procedure that \nis used by a man, or a drug that is used by a man, that involves his \nreproductive health care and say they have to get a special rider. \nThere is nothing in this amendment that says if a man someday wants to \nbuy Viagra, for example, that his pharmaceutical coverage cannot cover \nit; that he has to buy a rider. I would not support that. And they \nshould not support going after a woman, using her own private funds, \nfor her reproductive health care.\n  Is it fair to say to a man: You are going to have to buy a rider to \nbuy Viagra--and this is public information. It could be accessed. No, I \ndon't support that. I support a man's privacy just as I support a \nwoman's privacy.\n  So it is very clear to me that this amendment would be the biggest \nrollback of a woman's right to choose in decades.\n  We didn't ask for this fight. We didn't plan for this fight. We don't \nwant this fight. We simply want to ensure that this three-decades-long \nagreement is kept in place. And that is what Senator Reid does in the \nunderlying bill. It is very clear that in the underlying bill, there is \na firewall between Federal funds and private funds. All we are saying \nis, please leave it alone. We believe it is discriminatory to single \nout a procedure only women can utilize and say to the women of this \nNation: Yes, this is a legal procedure, but you can't use your own \nprivate funds. Senator Reid is very clear. He puts a firewall in place \nbetween the Federal funds and the private funds.\n  Roe v. Wade is still the law of the land. I know a lot of my \ncolleagues would like to see it overturned. They would like to make \nabortion illegal at the earliest stages. They would like to criminalize \nit. They would like to put women and doctors in jail. The fact is, Roe \nv. Wade is the law of the land. At the early stages of a pregnancy, a \nwoman has a right to choose. That is the law. Later on, she can't do \nit. There are restrictions for her, hurdles for her. That is what Roe \ndoes.\n  There are many people, particularly on the other side of the aisle--\nmore than on our side, for sure--who want to overturn Roe. They know \nthey can't do it because the vast majority of the people support a \nwoman's right to choose at the early stages of a pregnancy. So what can \nthey do? They can make it impossible for her to access a doctor for \nthis procedure. In this bill, they go after her insurance. It is \nsurprising to me that such an amendment could pass the House, but it \ndid.\n  I am asking my colleagues, women and men, both sides of the aisle, to \nplease stand up for equality. Please don't single out women. What have \nwomen done to deserve this? They are our mothers, our daughters, our \ngrandmas. They serve in the military with dignity. Why punish them this \nway? Why have such a lack of respect for them that they can't even get \nreproductive health care with their own private funds? It is, to me, \nsuch a rollback of women's rights.\n  I believe we will defeat this in the Senate. I believe Senator Reid \ndeserves a lot of credit because what he did in the underlying bill is \npreserve the status quo--no Federal funds for abortion, not a dollar, \nbut a woman can use her own private funds to buy health insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, the motion I am offering would simply \ncommit the bill back to the Finance Committee for a short period to \napply the same grandfathering provision in this legislation to all \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries, the provision in the bill as it is \nspecifically drafted, to prevent the drastic Medicare Advantage cuts \nfrom impacting some seniors in Florida, which compare to the cuts \nfacing Medicare Advantage enrollees in the rest of Florida and the rest \nof America, including the 330,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees in my \nState.\n  Basically, this motion says that the same benefits that have been \ngranted in the legislation to citizens in Florida would also apply to \ncitizens who are enrollees in the Medicare Advantage Program all over \nAmerica. It is pretty simple.\n  Specifically, starting in 2012, this motion would accomplish a fix \nthat allows all Medicare Advantage enrollees to maintain the current \nlevels of benefits on the date of enactment. That would be in keeping \nwith the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that was agreed to by the \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet, that called for all Americans to be \nable to keep the same level of benefits as they presently have today \nunder Medicare and Medicaid.\n  During the Finance Committee markup, the senior Senator from Florida \nadvocated in favor of treating certain Medicare Advantage enrollees in \nFlorida better than the rest of America's seniors under Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Let me read from two articles written at the time of the Senate \nFinance Committee's deliberation. From the New York Times, ``Senator \nTries to Allay Fears on Health Overhaul,'' September 24, 2009:\n\n       But Mr. Nelson, a Democrat, has a big problem. The bill \n     taken up this week by the committee would cut Medicare \n     payments to insurance companies that care for more than 10 \n     million older Americans, including nearly one million in \n     Florida. The program, known as Medicare Advantage, is popular \n     because it offers extra benefits, including vision and dental \n     care and even, in some cases, membership in health clubs or \n     fitness centers.\n       ``It would be intolerable to ask senior citizens to give up \n     substantial health benefits they are enjoying under \n     Medicare,'' said Mr. Nelson, who has been deluged with calls \n     and complaints from constituents. ``I am offering an \n     amendment to shield seniors from those benefit cuts.''\n\n  Pretty simple. The Senator from Florida believes there would be cuts \nto the Medicare Advantage Program, and he was able to get into this \nbill an exemption for some 950,000 enrollees in Medicare Advantage in \nFlorida. Admirably, the Senator from Florida was able to insert in this \nbill protection for 800-some or 900-some thousand constituents of his \nwho are Medicare enrollees. There are 330,000 of them in my State who \nare seniors, who have paid into Medicare, who have the Medicare \nAdvantage Program which, under the legislation, with the exception of \nthe carve-out for the citizens in Florida by Mr. Nelson, would also \nthen lose their benefits.\n\n       Similar concerns exploded into public view on Wednesday as \n     members of the Finance Committee slogged through a mammoth \n     health care overhaul bill for a second day.\n       Senator Nelson said Republicans were waging a ``scare \n     campaign,'' but he shares some of their concerns. His \n     predicament highlights the political risks for Democrats \n     eager to reassure older Americans who vote in large numbers.\n       There are risks for President Obama as well. He cannot \n     afford to lose Mr. Nelson's vote. White House officials have \n     offered to work with him to address his concerns. Mr. Obama \n     has said repeatedly that ``if you like your health care plan, \n     you will be able to keep it.''\n\n  That is one of the remarkable statements that is obviously \ncontradicted by anybody who reads this bill. Any one of 11 million \nAmericans, with the exception of Senator Nelson's constituents, who are \nunder Medicare Advantage will see cuts in Medicare Advantage. That is a \nfact. If those 11 million Americans like their health care plan, they \nwill not be able to keep it.\n\n       The cost of Mr. Nelson's proposed fix--to preserve benefits \n     for many people enrolled in the private Medicare plans--could \n     total $40 billion over 10 years, and that could also be a \n     problem for the White House. Mr. Obama has promised not to \n     sign a health bill that increases the deficit, and so far Mr. \n     Nelson has not said precisely how he would pay for his \n     amendment.\n       Approval of the amendment could invite other Democrats to \n     ask for similar deals that might make the bill more palatable \n     to their constituents, but more costly as well.\n\n  Well, since that September article, obviously other Senators have \nasked for the same shielding of their constituents who are enrolled in \nMedicare Advantage.\n  An October 20, 2009, Bloomberg story, ``Reid Leads Democrats into \nCarving Out Favors for States on Health.''\n\n       Democrats such as Senator Bill Nelson of Florida and Ron \n     Wyden of Oregon secured provisions setting aside $5 billion \n     to shore up benefits for constituents who participate in \n     Medicare Advantage. That program allows private insurers to \n     contract with the government to provide Medicare benefits. \n     Nelson said the aid isn't directed solely at Florida. ``It \n     affects several States, including New York,'' he said. \n     ``We're trying to grandfather in seniors so they don't lose \n     the benefits they have.''\n\n  Well, I am trying to carry out Senator Nelson's ambition. Senator \nNelson said that, in effect, several States, including New York, are \ntrying to grandfather in seniors so they don't lose the benefits they \nhave. That is exactly what this motion is all about.\n  I assume I can expect Senator Nelson's affirmative vote, along with \nall others listed in the motion of the 11 million people who are under \nMedicare Advantage in their States.\n  And the deal-making continues. We have now learned about the special \nprovisions in the 2,000-page legislation designed for certain \nSenators--I might add, at the expense of Medicare Advantage members in \nother States and the American taxpayer. We have had to read about such \ndeals because they have been cut in secret closed meetings without the \nbenefit of the C-SPAN cameras, as promised. Just the other day, it came \nto light that this legislation has special provisions for Oregon, New \nYork, and a special one in Florida. I have had a conversation with \nSenator Wyden of Oregon, and he says that is not the case. I will \ncertainly take Senator Wyden's word for it.\n  I want the same protections extended to all seniors. That is all this \nmotion is about--the same protection for all seniors, no special deals \nfor any constituents related to the State in which they reside or the \ninfluence of their elected representatives. That is not the way we \nshould treat seniors who have paid into Medicare Advantage.\n  The special carve-out for some Florida seniors is quite interesting. \nDespite beneficiaries in Florida hearing the President's promises about \nbeing able to keep what you have, it appears the 950,000 Medicare \nAdvantage enrollees in Florida aren't satisfied with the Democrats' \npromises to protect so-called guaranteed benefits. Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries in Florida thought\n\n[[Page S12605]]\n\nthey would be able to keep the Medicare Advantage benefits that provide \nprotection from high cost sharing in traditional Medicare, wellness \nprograms, and vision, hearing, and dental benefits upon which they have \ncome to rely.\n  However, when Florida beneficiaries learned they were not going to be \nable to keep what they have--in fact, they were going to see a 64-\npercent cut in benefits--a deal benefiting some at the expense of other \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries and taxpayers was added in exchange \nfor support to move forward on the cuts.\n  Let me point out, despite attempting to protect hundreds of thousands \nof Florida seniors from benefit cuts, Senator Nelson's deal still \nleaves approximately 150,000 Florida seniors and seniors across the \ncountry unprotected. So even in the proposed deal that was cut, Senator \nNelson was willing to leave 150,000 beneficiaries subject to Medicare \nAdvantage cuts.\n  The Medicare Advantage Program is a program that had bipartisan \nsupport and the support of 11 million seniors who are enrolled in the \nprogram.\n  Just a few short years ago, when Congress enacted the Medicare \nModernization Act, new funding was intentionally provided to stabilize \nthe Medicare health plan program. This was one of the few issues on \nwhich there was strong bipartisan agreement during the 2003 Medicare \ndebate. It was done to ensure seniors all across America had access to \nan option in the Medicare Program, an option for additional, better \nbenefits than are available under the traditional Medicare Program.\n  In June 2003, several of our colleagues, including Senator Schumer \nand Senator Kerry, offered a bipartisan amendment on the Senate floor \nto provide additional funding for benefits under the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. So I find it a little interesting that Members on the other \nside want to cut benefits to seniors now. Even though they supported \nthe funding before, they now want to cut them.\n  Later in 2003, as the Medicare conference committee was completing \nits deliberations, a bipartisan group of 18 Senators signed a letter \nurging the conferees to provide a meaningful increase in Medicare \nAdvantage funding. This letter was signed by a diverse group of our \ncolleagues, including Democratic Senators such as Dianne Feinstein, \nChristopher Dodd, Ron Wyden, Frank Lautenberg, Patty Murray, Arlen \nSpecter, Mary Landrieu, and Maria Cantwell.\n  Here is a letter dated September 30, 2003. It says ``United States \nSenate,'' and it is signed by a number of Senators, including my \ncolleague, Senator Kerry. It says:\n\n       Dear Medicare conferee:\n       We are writing to ask you, as a member of the Medicare \n     conference committee, to ensure that the final Medicare bill \n     includes a meaningful increase in Medicare+Choice funding in \n     fiscal years 2004 and 2005.\n\n  So I guess my friend and colleague, Senator Kerry, was against cuts \nin funding before he was for them. He was against them before he was \nfor them. So anyway it goes on to say:\n\n       We strongly support additional Medicare+Choice funding for \n     two very important reasons: (1) to protect the health care \n     choices and benefits of the nearly 5 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries who are currently enrolled in private sector \n     health plans; and (2) to strengthen the foundation for future \n     health plan choices.\n       We believe that the Medicare+Choice funding provisions . . \n     . are critically important to preserving choice and quality \n     for America's seniors. We urge you to include these \n     provisions in the final bill reported out of the Medicare \n     conference committee.\n\n  Since then the Medicare Advantage Program has been popular enough so \nthat 11 million of our senior citizens have joined the program. I think \nthat is a pretty impressive number of people who have decided to join \nthe program. So I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion, just to \ngive equal access to a very popular program to all citizens rather than \njust give it to several hundred thousand who happen to live in a \ncertain part of the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will the Senator yield for just a brief \nquestion on time, I say to Senator McCain?\n  I just wondered how much longer the Senator was going to go because \nwe have people waiting on both sides to speak up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am not sure.\n  So, Madam President, recently there was an article in the North \nCounty Times from San Diego, dated Saturday, December 5, 2009.\n  I would say to the Senator from California, in response to her \nquestion, this is a very important issue, as the Senator from \nCalifornia just pointed out. I have a lot to say on it, and I have \nwaited my turn to speak. In keeping with the procedures that are in \nkeeping with the agreement between the two leaders, I do not expect to \nbe too much longer, but I do not expect to curtail my remarks on this \nvery important issue at 5:20 p.m. in the afternoon.\n  So here is an article from the North County Times from San Diego, \ndated December 5, 2009: ``REGION: State ends subsidy for mammograms to \nlow-income women under 50.'' I repeat: ``State ends subsidy for \nmammograms to low-income women under 50.'' It goes on to say:\n\n       The eligibility age for state-subsidized breast cancer \n     screening has been raised from 40 to 50 by the California \n     Health and Human Services Agency, which will also temporarily \n     stop enrollment in the breast cancer screening program.\n       Advocates for low-income women, whose health care the \n     department helps pay for, say the cuts put a two-tier system \n     in place that is based on money rather than medical \n     standards.\n       The cuts will greatly harm the clinic's mammogram program, \n     said Natasha Riley, manager of Vista Community Clinic's \n     Breast Health Outreach and Education Program.\n       The clinic and others like it in San Diego County provide \n     reduced-cost care, mostly to low-income people, with money \n     from the state and some private donations.\n       ``More than 50 percent of the women we give breast exams \n     and mammograms to are in their 40s,'' Riley said. ``The \n     majority of our current breast cancer survivors are women in \n     their 40s.''\n       The state's decision, announced Dec. 1 and effective Jan. \n     1, follows a controversial federal recommendation last month \n     that mammograms before the age of 50 are generally not \n     needed.\n\n  So now we see the Federal recommendation that was made last month--\nthat mammograms before the age of 50 are generally not needed--is now \nbeing implemented in the State of California.\n\n       Moreover, private health care systems such as Scripps \n     Health have rejected the federal task force's recommendation, \n     choosing instead to keep the existing standard, which calls \n     for a mammogram at age 40, with annual mammograms thereafter.\n       That means doctors will be using two medical practice \n     guidelines, distinguished not by knowledge but by the \n     pocketbook, said Dr. Jack Klausen, a gynecologist and \n     obstetrician who practices at Vista Community Clinic.\n       ``If we are in a situation where we don't screen, but the \n     private-practice doctor can screen, then we are actually not \n     practicing to the standard of care,'' Klausen said.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this entire article be \nprinted in the Record. I certainly hope that a decision like this would \nnot be implemented in discrimination against low-income women in the \nState of California.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the North County Times, Dec. 7, 2009]\n\n Region: State Ends Subsidy for Mammograms to Low-Income Women Under 50\n\n                         (By Bradley J. Fikes)\n\n       The eligibility age for state-subsidized breast cancer \n     screening has been raised from 40 to 50 by the California \n     Health and Human Services Agency, which will also temporarily \n     stop enrollment in the breast cancer screening program.\n       Advocates for low-income women, whose health care the \n     department helps pay for, say the cuts put a two-tier system \n     in place that is based on money rather than medical \n     standards.\n       The cuts will greatly harm the clinic's mammogram program, \n     said Natasha Riley, manager of Vista Community Clinic's \n     Breast Health Outreach and Education Program.\n       The clinic and others like it in San Diego County provide \n     reduced-cost care, mostly to low-income people, with money \n     from the state and some private donations.\n       ``More than 50 percent of the women we give breast exams \n     and mammograms to are in their 40s,'' Riley said. ``The \n     majority of our current breast cancer survivors are women in \n     their 40s.''\n       The state's decision, announced Dec. 1 and effective Jan. \n     1, follows a controversial federal recommendation last month \n     that mammograms before the age of 50 are generally not \n     needed.\n       However, the public health department also linked the \n     change to California's budget woes.\n       The federal recommendation, made Nov. 16 by the U.S. \n     Preventive Services Task Force, has encountered strong \n     opposition.\n       The task force later retreated a bit, adjusting its \n     recommendation to state that mammograms for women ages 40 to \n     49 should be\n\n[[Page S12606]]\n\n     considered by their doctors on an individual basis.\n       Moreover, private health care systems such as Scripps \n     Health have rejected the federal task force's recommendation, \n     choosing instead to keep the existing standard, which calls \n     for a mammogram at age 40, with annual mammograms thereafter.\n       That means doctors will be using two medical practice \n     guidelines, distinguished not by knowledge but by the \n     pocketbook, said Dr. Jack Klausen, a gynecologist and \n     obstetrician who practices at Vista Community Clinic.\n       ``If we are in a situation where we don't screen, but the \n     private-practice doctor can screen, then we are actually not \n     practicing to the standard of care,'' Klausen said.\n       In its announcement, the state said the cuts were needed \n     because of a projected budget shortfall for the California \n     Department of Public Health, and from declining revenue from \n     tobacco taxes.\n       However, it did not say how much money it expected to save.\n       Calls to the department were not returned Friday.\n       The policy puts lives at risk, said Barbara Mannino, CEO of \n     Vista Community Clinic.\n       ``I bet you everybody knows a woman who was diagnosed in \n     her 40s, and her life was saved by a mammogram, or lost \n     because it was too late,'' Mannino said, just before leaving \n     for her own mammogram.\n       And she said that little money would be saved, because all \n     the equipment and staff to provide mammograms is already in \n     place.\n       There is a difference of opinion in the medical community \n     about when mammograms, an X-ray of the breast, should be \n     used.\n       Mammograms sometimes give false alarms, with the incidence \n     of false positives especially high for women in their 40s.\n       Estimates are that 10 percent to 15 percent of mammograms \n     give false positives, experts say.\n       False negatives, in which the cancer is present but the \n     mammogram seems normal, occurs 20 percent of the time, \n     according to the National Cancer Institute.\n       However, false negatives become less frequent with age.\n       But the benefits in finding cancers when they are more \n     easily treatable outweigh the drawbacks, Mannino and Klausen \n     said.\n       And Scripps' breast cancer task force said that because 28 \n     percent of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer are \n     younger than 50, the number of lives saved outweighs the \n     additional cost.\n       Klausen said the federal panel was trying to ``create a \n     best-practices (standard) from a monetary point of view,'' to \n     provide the most health care for all, out of a limited \n     budget.\n       Women who get false positives on mammograms not only \n     undergo stress, but they must go through other tests, only to \n     find out there's nothing wrong.\n       That adds costs to the system without providing any better \n     health care, according to the federal panel's reasoning.\n       However, Klausen said the state has taken that reasoning \n     too far, putting too much emphasis on saving money.\n       ``What makes me really worried is that the California \n     Department of Public Health wants to save money by taking \n     away a cancer-detection program,'' Klausen said. ``That \n     discriminates against a gender, and also discriminates \n     against an income level. And it also discriminates against \n     how community clinics can practice medicine.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have found that the debate on the \nfloor has been invigorating. I have found it to be educational not only \nto the Members of this body, and this Senator in particular, but I \nthink to all Americans. Believe it or not, a lot of the deliberations \nand the debate and discussion we have had on the Senate floor have been \nvigorous. They have been sometimes passionate because this is such an \nimportant issue--issues such as the one I just discussed--and they have \nbeen sometimes tough.\n  But I must say, I have always tried to be respectful of the views of \nmy colleagues, even though we have had some--especially the Senator \nfrom Illinois, the distinguished whip of the Democratic Party, whom I \nhave engaged vigorously--but they have always been respectful debates. \nI intend to maintain that respect, as I have throughout my career. But \nI do not mean that means I will not be passionate.\n  So I was astonished--I was astonished--and taken aback to see a \nfoxnews.com article that just crossed my desk titled: ``Reid Compares \nOpponents of Health Care Reform to Supporters of Slavery.''\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took his GOP-blasting \n     rhetoric--\n\n  I am quoting from the article--\n\n     to a new level Monday, comparing Republicans who oppose \n     health care reform to lawmakers who clung to the institution \n     of slavery more than a century ago.\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took his GOP-blasting \n     rhetoric to a new level Monday, comparing Republicans who \n     oppose health care reform to lawmakers who clung to the \n     institution of slavery more than a century ago.\n       The Nevada Democrat, in a sweeping set of accusations on \n     the Senate floor, also compared health care foes to those who \n     opposed women's suffrage and the civil rights movement--even \n     though it was Sen. Strom Thurmond, then a Democrat, who \n     unsuccessfully tried to filibuster the Civil Rights Act of \n     1957 and it was Republicans who led the charge against \n     slavery.\n\n  So not only was Senator Reid wrong in his accusations, Senator Reid \nwas also incorrect in who opposed slavery and who supported the Civil \nRights Act. But that is not the important point. The important point, \nas the article goes on to say:\n\n       But Reid argued that Republicans are using the same \n     stalling tactics employed in the pre-Civil War era.\n\n  And I quote from the article that is quoting Senator Reid:\n\n       ``Instead of joining us on the right side of history, all \n     the Republicans can come up with is, `slow down, stop \n     everything, let's start over.' If you think you've heard \n     these same excuses before, you're right,'' Reid said Monday. \n     ``When this country belatedly recognized the wrongs of \n     slavery, there were those who dug in their heels and said \n     `slow down, it's too early, things aren't bad enough.' ''\n       He continued: ``When women spoke up for the right to speak \n     up, they wanted to vote, some insisted they simply, slow \n     down, there will be a better day to do that, today isn't \n     quite right.''\n       ``When this body was on the verge of guaranteeing equal \n     civil rights to everyone regardless of the color of their \n     skin, some senators resorted to the same filibuster threats \n     that we hear today.''\n       That seemed to be a reference to Thurmond's famous 1957 \n     filibuster--the late Senator switched parties several years \n     later.\n       Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Reid's remarks were over the \n     top.\n       ``That is extremely offensive,'' he told Fox News. ``It's \n     language that should never be used, never be used. . . . \n     Those days are not here now.''\n       Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., suggested Reid was starting to \n     ``crack'' under the pressure of the health care reform \n     debate.\n       ``I think it's beneath the dignity of the majority \n     leader,'' Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okl., said. ``I personally am \n     insulted.''\n\n  So this is a debate which has been spirited. This has been a debate \nwhich has been passionate. This has been a debate that I think has been \nvery helpful to the American people. Some of the back and forth that I \nhave seen I think has been excellent. It has been excellent debate and \ndiscussion. I enjoyed it when the Senator from Montana and I had a \ndiscussion about various endorsements. I appreciated the fact that \nSenator Durbin brought my record to light and questioned it. But, most \nimportantly, most of the conversation has been about the components of \nthis bill and its impact on the future of America.\n  So to somehow compare--as this article says--we who believe firmly in \nthe principles that are being violated by this 2,000-page legislation \nto people who supported slavery, I would very much appreciate it if \nSenator Reid would come to the floor and, if not apologize certainly \nclarify his remarks that he was not referring to those of us who \nbelieve we are carrying out and performing our constitutional duties; \nthat is, acting in the best interests of our constituents on an issue \nthat will impact the future of the United States of America for years \nand years and years.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the foxnews.com article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Reid Compares Opponents of Health Care Reform to Supporters of Slavery\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took his GOP-blasting \n     rhetoric to a new level Monday, comparing Republicans who \n     oppose health care reform to lawmakers who clung to the \n     institution of slavery more than a century ago.\n       The Nevada Democrat, in a sweeping set of accusations on \n     the Senate floor, also compared health care foes to those who \n     opposed women's suffrage and the civil rights movement--even \n     though it was Sen.

Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said. ``I personally am \n     insulted.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. So if I could return to my amendment. My amendment would \nmake sure every beneficiary is protected and receives equal treatment. \nI would expect strong bipartisan support, since I think we would all \nlike to see the same protections guaranteed for our own constituents. I \nknow the Senator from Pennsylvania will appreciate this amendment, \nsince he filed his own amendment to spend $2.5 billion in taxpayers' \ndollars to protect Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Pennsylvania. I \nguess the 864,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Pennsylvania \nweren't satisfied with the promise to protect so-called guaranteed \nbenefits either.\n  This motion to commit is straightforward and will help the President \nkeep his promise that if you like your health insurance you have today, \nthe policy you have today, you can keep it, and will protect 10.6 \nmillion Medicare Advantage beneficiaries from at least a 64-percent cut \nin benefits.\n  May I say, again, I think it has been an important debate we have \nengaged in. I do not and will not impugn the motives or the integrity \nof those who are sponsors of this legislation. Yes, I will argue we \ndidn't keep the President's promise and commitment over a year ago \nduring the Presidential campaign when he said he would have the C-SPAN \ncameras in, that there would be bipartisan negotiations with the C-SPAN \ncameras in, with Republicans and Democrats sitting down together so, in \nhis words, the American people could see who is on the side of the \nhealth insurance companies and the special interests and who is on the \nside of the American people. I think that is a legitimate statement and \na legitimate questioning as to the process that is taking place today, \nwhere there have been no negotiations with the Members on this side and \nthere has been no C-SPAN camera included where these negotiations are \ntaking place. So I hope there will be. I hope this legislation is \ndefeated. I hope we can go back and sit down together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, and agree on medical malpractice reform, on crossing State \nlines to be able to get the best insurance policy for every citizen and \ntheir family, to emphasize wellness and fitness and reward it, and to \nenact outcome-based treatment for our patients. I hope we can produce a \nlot of measures and take a lot of significant steps that would truly \nreduce the cost of health care in America, not enact a $2.5 trillion \nnew entitlement program that is a scam. It is a scam because of the way \nthe budgetary process has been set up. Right now, today, I can go out \nand buy an automobile, and I don't have to make a payment for a year. \nUnder this proposal, you start making the payments and 4 years later \nyou get the benefits. That is Enron accounting.\n  I hope my colleagues will allow us to continue this spirited debate \nand discussion. I say, with the greatest respect, these are tough \nissues and there are strong differences of opinion. But I think, \noverall, this debate and discussion is good for the American people \nand, hopefully, the outcome will be one where we will be better \ninformed and can better address the issue of the skyrocketing costs of \nhealth care in America and our ability to provide them with affordable \nand available health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no \nfurther amendments be in order during today's session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield the floor now to Senator Mikulski for 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the bill as well as \nin opposition to the Nelson of Nebraska amendment on the subject of \nabortion.\n  First of all, I truly believe health care reform is the most \nimportant social justice vote we will cast in this decade. Why? Because \nwe are talking about providing universal access to health care, which I \nbelieve is a basic human right and should be a fundamental American \nright. That is why health care reform is so important: To provide \nuniversal access to health care and, in this bill, ending the punitive \npractices of insurance companies against women, particularly in the \narea of gender discrimination, where we pay more and get less in our \nbenefit package, as well as where simply being a woman is often treated \nas a preexisting condition.\n  Eight States consider domestic violence a preexisting condition and \nyou can't get insurance. One woman who had a medically mandated C-\nsection was told she couldn't get insurance again unless she had a \nsterilization--coerced sterilization in the United States of America. I \nthought that is what they did in Nazi Germany or in old Communist \nChina.\n  The other thing this bill does is strengthen and stabilize Medicare \nto make sure seniors have access to health care at all ages and all \nstages.\n  I consider these principles to be pro-life. I think the health care \nbill we are debating is as pro-life as can be because what other thing \nhelps maintain, protect, save, or deal with impaired life better than \nproviding universal access to health care? A famous pastor by the name \nof Rick Warren, who has written the great book that has inspired so \nmany, ``The Purpose Driven Life,'' talks not about pro-life but whole-\nlife principles. I think being able to see a doctor or an appropriate \nhealth care professional saves lives, and I view this vote on health \ncare reform as the most important pro-life or whole-life vote anyone \ncan cast.\n  I agree with Pastor Rick Warren when he uses that principle. I \nbelieve in seeing a doctor when you need one, in saving a life, or in \ngetting the health care you need so you don't lose an eye from \ndiabetes, you don't lose your kidney, you don't lose your foot or, if \nyou are pregnant and diabetic, you don't lose your child. We want to \nmake sure women have access to mammograms, that the men we love and who \nlove us have access if they have high blood pressure--and sometimes \nthey have it because they don't have health care for their family--or \nprostate cancer. I believe that is what whole life is.\n  So with this bill, I believe supporting screening for diabetes is \npro-life, cervical cancer screening is pro-life, but, most of all, if \nyou want people to have healthy pregnancies, healthy childbirth, \nhealthy babies, they need access to health care. So that is why I say \nvoting for universal access to health care is as pro-life as you can \nbe.\n  Making this debate about abortion, I believe, is misguided and wrong. \nFirst of all, in the bill, we already deal with this topic. In the \ninterest of passing health care reform, I believe we deal with this \nsensitive topic in a sensitive way. We rejected shrill and strident \namendments on both sides. For example, we did not seek to change the \nsettled language regarding abortion that is the Hyde amendment.\n  There were those in the exuberance of last year's election who said: \nOh, let's get rid of Hyde. Many of us took that position, trying to \nfind that sensible center. We are principled and whole-life people as \nwell. We said: Let's keep the Hyde amendment. It is settled language. I \ndon't use the term ``settled law'' because that is a precise legal \nterm, and I know my colleague from Pennsylvania and others can argue \nthat, but Hyde is settled language.\n  What does the Hyde amendment that has been around for almost 30 years \ndo? It prohibits any Federal funds to be\n\n[[Page S12608]]\n\nused directly for abortions, except in the case of rape, incest, or \nwhen the life of the mother is at risk. It has additional provisions \nthat provide a conscious clause to protect providers who do not want to \nprovide abortions. This bill does not seek to change the underlying \npremise of the Hyde amendment which, as I said, I regard as settled \nlanguage of 30 years ago.\n  The pending Senate bill goes even further than Hyde. It was \nlegislation that came out of the Finance Committee, and I salute them \nfor, once again, trying to find a sensible center, engaging in civil \nand rational dialogue. I wish to compliment them on their efforts. \nHowever, the other side keeps changing the midpoint. By seeking a \ngreater good, many of us agreed to what was in the Finance bill. Quite \nfrankly, it went further than I would have liked if I were writing the \nbill, but, again, in the interest of comity we would keep this debate \non the issue of providing health care and not turn it into an abortion \ndebate.\n\n  What does what came out of the Finance Committee and what is in the \nmerged bill do? It says loudly, clearly, and consistently: No Federal \nfunds can be used to pay for the coverage of abortion, and it does it \nby separating out funds so no public money from Federal credits or \nsubsidies would be used for abortions. What more can we ask anyone to \ndo? Under the pending bill, health care plans cannot be required to \ncover abortion. Health care plans can choose to cover or not cover it, \nand State laws regarding abortion are not preempted. It, again, \nincludes the longstanding practice of a strong conscience clause for \neither individual providers or institutions--for example, Catholic \nhospitals--from performing abortions if it is against their conscience.\n  I believe what we have done is found the sensible center, and it \nleaves the decision in the hands of patients and doctors, not \npoliticians or insurance executives. So the question is not what is \ndecided but who decides. I believe it should be in the hands of \npatients and doctors, not politicians or insurance executives.\n  Let's go to Nelson, which is a Senate version of Stupak. I reject the \nBen Nelson amendment. I believe it is unnecessary. I believe it is \nunneeded. I believe it is uncalled for. It goes further than Hyde \nbecause it prohibits the public option from covering abortions and it \nprohibits individuals receiving Federal insurance subsidies from \npurchasing a plan that covers abortion and, even if you use your own \nmoney, it cannot be used for abortion.\n  It also allows women to purchase an abortion rider. Oh, boy. Is this \nsupposed to be a big deal? Is this supposed to be the kind of thing \nthat is supposed to make us happy? What an insulting, humiliating thing \nto say: If you want an abortion, go buy a rider. I think it demonizes \nwomen. Why don't you go into the workplace and paint a scarlet letter \non your head. Hawthorne still lives in the Nelson amendment. Lets paint \nthe ``A word'' on your forehead. Can you believe this? I don't know of \nany individual woman or any woman in consultation with the man she \nloves and who loves her saying: Yes, you know, we might have an \nabortion. Why don't we buy that rider. Nobody plans to have an \nabortion. It is not the subject of intimate conversations that families \ntalk about as they plan their lives together. Do you realize the \nintense discrimination a woman would face? How about: Why don't we have \nmen buy an abortion rider for the women they get pregnant? Let them buy \nthe abortion rider. Maybe we can even give them a discount.\n  We are hot about this, and we are cranky about it because there is no \nneed to do it like this. We have tried, at every step of the way, to \nhandle this topic with great respect because there are people with \nprinciples. We are all people of principle. Some use the term ``pro-\nlife.'' I use the term ``whole life.'' What are the rest of us? Do you \nthink I am anti-life?\n  All my life as a social worker, I have fought for social justice. I \nfought for access to health care. And to say I am going to support a \nbill that denies access to services for most women in the exchange--\nanyway, I think this thing goes further than Hyde, and we should be \ndebating health care, not abortion. This legislation on the Senate \nfloor should be about women's health, like the debate we had last week \nabout prenatal health care, how to improve delivery systems for greater \nsurvival and how to minimize birth defects. That is what it should be.\n  Women's health care decisions should be made by the women, in \nconsultation with their doctor. The Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act is what we believe is a wonderful compromise, and it rejects \nthese strident viewpoints. The most pro-life thing we can do is pass \nuniversal access to health care. The most pro-life thing we can do is \nstabilize Medicare so people have health care at all ages and all \nstages.\n  So reject the Nelson amendment, and if you are pro-life, vote for the \nSenate merged bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues \nwaiting to speak, I don't think I will speak much more than 10 minutes. \nBefore I speak on my purpose for coming to the floor to support Senator \nMcCain's amendment, I want to take a couple of minutes to go over a \nsource of information that is no longer credible, which has been used \nin debate on the floor several times, used throughout the year--\ninformation that has been in letters to the editor of Iowa newspapers.\n  The most recent hearing of this was when the Senator from California \nrose to talk about the quality of our health care and the reference to \nthe fact that the United States is 37th out of all of the nations of \nthe world in quality of health care.\n  I don't deny we have to do a lot to improve the quality of health \ncare in America. I even admit that in this legislation, though I oppose \nthe bulk of this 2,074-page bill, there is a lot in the bill that has \nto do with the enhancing of the quality of care.\n  We keep hearing about the United States being 37th in quality. That \ncomes from a World Health Organization analysis that was made back in \nthe year 2000, ranking the United States among all the other nations. \nIt is a 10-year-old report that was flawed in its analysis at the very \noutset. Yet it is repeated as if gospel truth by almost anybody who \nwants to denigrate America's health care system and build a case for \nthis monstrosity of a bill we have before us. When I call it a \nmonstrosity, I will say it has some very good provisions in it that \nwould enhance the quality of care. The World Health Organization no \nlonger produces such a ranking table because of the complexities of the \ntask. The rankings were flawed because they judged health care systems \nfor problems--cultural, behavioral, and economic--that are not \ncontrolled by health care. There is no differentiation between the \nquality of medical systems and other factors, such as diet, exercise, \nand violent crime rates, which ought to be taken into consideration \nwhen considering a nation's delivering quality of health care.\n  The editor in chief of this 2000 report of the World Health \nOrganization, Philip Musgrove, called the figures `` . . . many made-up \nnumbers,'' and the result a ``nonsense ranking.'' Dr. Musgrove, an \neconomist who is now deputy editor of the journal Health Affairs, said \nhe was hired to edit the report's text but didn't fully understand the \nmethodology until after the report was released. Once he left the World \nHealth Organization, he wrote an article in 2003 for the medical \njournal Lancet criticizing the rankings as ``meaningless.''\n  The U.S. health system spends more than any other country per capita \nand was ranked 37th out of 191 due to that spending alone. Prior to \nconsidering how much we spend, the United States was ranked 15th, not \n37th.\n  The Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Morocco ranked 42nd, 45th, \nand 94th before adjusting for spending levels. After the adjustment for \nspending levels, can you believe it? They ranked above the United \nStates--35th, 36th, and 29th, respectively.\n  The United States ranked first in responsiveness. That means respect \nfor persons and prompt attention. Americans understand and appreciate \nthis quality care. This will be lost in this massive health care reform \nbill when the government takes more control.\n  Experts in the field of health, such as Mark Pearson, head of health \nfor the\n\n[[Page S12609]]\n\nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, was quoted \nas saying:\n\n       It's a very notorious ranking. Health analysts don't like \n     to talk about it in polite company. It's one of those things \n     that we wish would go away.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will take that into consideration when they \nbring up the rationale for this bill, that it is because of that World \nHealth Organization study, which I think what I said and a lot of other \nthings you can say about it ought to put it into proper perspective.\n  For my support of the McCain motion to bring equalization among the \n50 States for the Medicare Advantage portions of this bill, I have \nspent the past 28 years in Congress working to make sure that rural \nIowans have access to the same quality of health care as people living \nin more urban areas.\n  Medicare, since 1965, has been a national program. Well, it is a \nnational program with traditional Medicare. But before we brought \nequity to Medicare Advantage, it wasn't a national program. It was a \nprogram for California, Arizona, Texas, New York, Florida, Chicago, or \nnear the Midwest, maybe Omaha. Since Medicare Advantage was not a \nnational program, and since Medicare since 1965 has been a national \nprogram, I set out in the Medicare Modernization Act to bring equity to \nrural America just as we have in urban America. I fought to make sure \nthat seniors living in rural areas would have the same choices as \nseniors living in Miami, New York City, or Los Angeles.\n  That is simply saying that wherever you live in the United States, \nyou have Medicare--traditional Medicare. Before then, wherever you \nlived in the United States, in most rural areas you didn't have \nMedicare Advantage. Since Medicare is a national program, people living \nin rural America ought to have the same choice as those in urban \nAmerica.\n  Today that is the case. Seniors in every county in Iowa have a choice \nbetween traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. That is a big \nimprovement, since prior to the Medicare Modernization Act not all \nIowans had that choice. I can narrow it down to 1 out of 99 counties--\nPottawattamie County, across from Omaha, had Medicare Advantage. The \nother 98 counties didn't have it. I want to tell you, there are still \ninequities, because Iowa providers offer high-quality care that leads \nto less utilization. Iowans get approximately $1,500 less per year in \nMedicare Advantage benefits than seniors living in Florida. Under this \nbill, Iowans will see even less in Medicare Advantage benefits. It \nlooks like that won't be the case for some lucky Floridians.\n  In another one of those backroom deals--a backroom deal that seemed \nto be needed to get 60 votes, backroom deals that are still being \nattempted to get 60 votes--the Senator from Florida, in one of these \nbackroom deals, was able to secure a provision in the Finance Committee \nbill that would make sure that seniors in certain Florida counties are \nable to maintain their current benefits. I am not talking about the so-\ncalled guaranteed benefits that Democrats say they are protecting. The \nprovision secured by the Senator from Florida will also protect \nadditional and extra benefits for Floridians. In pushing for this \namendment, the senior Senator from Florida said:\n\n       It would be intolerable to ask senior citizens to give up \n     substantial health benefits they are enjoying under Medicare.\n\n  I guess Floridians weren't satisfied with the promise that has been \nmade throughout the last 2 weeks of debate on this bill to protect the \nso-called guaranteed benefits. Seniors in Florida still wanted the \nlower cost sharing, wellness programs and vision, hearing and dental \nbenefits they have come to rely on. Now we have the Senator from \nPennsylvania filing an amendment to help Medicare beneficiaries in \nPennsylvania protect their extra benefits, to get these extra benefits \nthat people on Medicare Advantage have.\n  I am guessing that seniors in Pennsylvania must have also picked up \non the Democrats' hollow promises to protect guaranteed benefits but \nnot worry about other benefits. In fact, the presence of these special \ndeals is proof that this bill is cutting Medicare benefits.\n  It is even proof that some Senators are worried about going back to \ntheir constituents and trying to explain the difference between cutting \nguaranteed and additional benefits, and explaining why they voted to \ncut Medicare Advantage benefits by 64 percent. Why else would these \nspecial deals be necessary?\n  I am here to ask my colleagues, why should seniors in Florida or \nPennsylvania get to keep their extra benefits, while more than 9 \nmillion seniors in other parts of the country see an average cut of 64 \npercent? To quote the Senator from Florida, isn't this also \nintolerable?\n  My colleagues on the other side talk about efficiency and fairness, \nbut they are supporting a bill that maintains the highest Medicare \nAdvantage payments in the country, while slashing benefits in higher \nquality rural areas. One of those higher quality rural areas is the \nState of Iowa, where we are fifth in quality but near the bottom of 50 \nStates in reimbursement on Medicare, whereas other States are fiftieth \nin quality and No. 1 in reimbursement on health care.\n  All of this doesn't sound very efficient or fair to me. Senator \nMcCain's motion is pretty straightforward. It goes State by State. I am \nnot going to read all 50 States, but it says here that 1 million--it is \ngoing to benefit the 70,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees in Arkansas. \nIt is going to benefit the 198,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees in \nColorado. In Iowa, it is probably something in the neighborhood of \n63,902. It will make sure that seniors in every other State in the \ncountry--red States and blue States--get the same deal Senator Nelson \ngot for Florida.\n  A vote for the McCain amendment is simply a vote for equity. But a \nvote against the amendment is a vote to favor backroom deals that put \nthe interest of a handful of Floridians above 10 million seniors across \nthe country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support all seniors and vote for the McCain \nmotion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2962\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nan amendment that has been offered by my distinguished colleague from \nNebraska.\n  There has been a lot of misinformation about what the health care \nbill we are debating would mean for women and for reproductive rights. \nSo let me please set the record straight.\n  The underlying legislation before us maintains a historic compromise \nwe have had in this country by barring the use of Federal funds for the \nfull range of reproductive services, except in cases of rape, incest, \nand to save a woman's life. That is the current law of the land, and \nthe Senate bill goes to great lengths to maintain current Federal law.\n  The legislation would segregate private funds from public funds, so \nonly a person's private money will contribute to their reproductive \ncoverage. This is not an accounting gimmick, as some critics have \nfalsely charged. In fact, this kind of arrangement is often used when \npublic funds are given to parochial schools or other religious \ninstitutions to maintain a separation of church and state.\n  The Senate version would also require that at least one plan within \nthe health insurance exchange offer a plan that covers reproductive \nservices and one that does not. It would authorize the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to audit any and all plans to make absolutely \ncertain abortion is not being paid for with Federal dollars. This \narrangement is squarely in line with the historic compromise we have \nhad in this country for 30 years that keeps Federal funds from being \nused to pay for abortions.\n  As we debate the solution to the deepening health care crisis that \nhas affected every citizen, business, and community in the country, \nthis is not the time nor the place to instigate a new battle over \nreproductive rights and reproductive freedoms. Families and businesses \nthat are getting buried under the weight of the current cost of health \ncare deserve much better.\n  Proponents of the Stupak-Pitts amendment claim this is a continuation \nof current Federal law, but that is simply false. This proposal goes \nfar beyond Federal law and will, in fact, bring about significant \nchange and dramatic new limitations on reproductive access in this \ncountry. It establishes\n\n[[Page S12610]]\n\nfor the very first time restrictions on people who pay for their own \nprivate health insurance. This is not partisan spin; this is fact. A \nnew study by George Washington University School of Public Health and \nHealth Services concluded:\n\n       The treatment exclusions required under the Stupak/Pitts \n     amendment will have an industry-wide effect, eliminating \n     coverage of medically indicated abortions over time for all \n     women, not only those whose coverage is derived through a \n     health insurance exchange.\n\n  This is government invading the personal lives of Americans, and it \nputs the health of women and young girls at grave risk.\n  In fact, this amendment would represent the only place in the entire \nhealth care bill where opponents are actually correct. This would truly \nlimit access to medical care by giving the government the power to make \nmedical decisions, not the patient or the doctor.\n  We all agree it is important to reduce abortions in this country, and \nI will continue to work in many ways to reduce unintended pregnancies \nand to promote adoption. However, the Stupak amendment prohibits the \npublic plan as well as the private plans offered through the exchange, \nif they accept any subsidized customers, from covering any abortion \nservices. This effectively bans full reproductive coverage in all \nhealth insurance plans in the new system, whether they are public or \nprivate.\n  Creating a system in which women are forced to purchase a separate \nabortion rider is not only discriminatory, it is ridiculous. It would \nrequire women to essentially plan for an event that occurs in the most \nunplanned of circumstances and often in critical emergency situations.\n  There are currently five States that require a separate rider for \nabortion coverage. In these five States, it is nearly impossible to \nfind such a private insurance policy that covers full reproductive \ncare. In one State, one insurance company holds 91 percent of the \nState's health insurance market and refuses to even offer such a rider.\n  There is no doubt that a lack of access to full reproductive health \ncare puts the lives of women and girls at grave risk. The Stupak \nmeasure poses greater restriction on low-income women and those who are \nmore likely to receive some kind of subsidy and less likely to be able \nto afford a supplemental insurance policy.\n  Denying low-income women reproductive coverage in this way is not \nonly discriminatory, it is dangerous. Without proper coverage, women \nwill be forced to postpone care while attempting to find the money to \npay for it. Such a delay can lead to increased costs and graver health \nrisks, particularly for these younger girls or these women will be \nforced to return to dangerous back-alley providers. Women and girls in \nAmerica deserve better.\n  I am optimistic we can defeat this radical change to Federal law, \npass a health care bill in the Senate that respects current law, and \nstrip the dangerous Stupak measure during the conference process. As I \nsaid before, I think there has been a lot of misinformation about what \nthe Stupak measure does and the level of danger this kind of sweeping \nchange could pose to women and girls.\n  This health care package must move us forward toward quality, \naffordable health care for every single American.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the Nelson amendment and any similar \nmeasure. I ask that we work together to preserve current law and \nrespect the private choices made between a woman and her doctor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to join \nSenator Boxer, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Gillibrand in opposing the \nStupak amendment.\n  The controversy set forth on this issue has been debated in this body \nand in the House since the Hyde amendment was enacted in 1977. What is \nattempted by the pending amendment in the Senate and the Stupak \namendment in the House is to alter that to the disadvantage of a \nwoman's right to choose.\n  The decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973 was admittedly and obviously \nviewed as a landmark decision which recognizes the constitutional right \nof a woman to choose. There have been some limitations drafted as we \nhave moved through the process. We have had many debates on this floor \non the Mexico City policy, and many aspects have been subject to \nchallenge. But the provision which is in the bill presented by the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, the pending bill, \nmaintains careful delineation which has been worked out up until this \ntime; that is, there would not be any Federal funds used for abortion, \nbut there would be no limitation on the ability of a woman to have \nabortion coverage if she chooses to so long as she paid for it herself.\n  The provisions in the statute are very plain. Section 1302(2)(a) \nprovides for the prohibition on the use of Federal funds. I am \ninserting the meaning of the language where it has references to many \nsubsections. But the prohibition on the use of Federal funds states, in \neffect, that if a qualified health plan provides coverage of services \nfor abortion, the issuer of the plan shall not use any of the Federal \nfunds for abortion. Then there is a provision on segregation of funds, \nsection 1303(2)(b), which provides, in effect, in the case of a plan \nwhich covers abortions, the issuer of the plan shall segregate an \namount equal to the cost of services for medical services other than \nabortion from the cost of medical services for abortions. That sets it \nout about as plainly as you can.\n  The precedent on Medicaid coverage, which involves Federal funding, \nwhere some 23 States have chosen to add abortion coverage where the \nStates are putting up their own money, so that there are no Federal \nfunds involved but the Medicaid services do cover abortions, but they \nare with funds other than Federal funds--State funds--it is just the \nsame analogy as no Federal funds under this bill but with moneys \nprovided by the woman who wants the coverage for herself. The precedent \nfrom Medicaid, it seems to me, is totally dispositive of the matters of \npublic policy.\n\n  Also, it ought to be noted that there is some 87 percent of insurance \nin the private market which covers abortions. Insurance in the private \nmarket provided by employers has the feature of deductibility. So while \nthere is not a direct payment by the Federal Government on policies \nwhich do cover abortions, there is an indirect factor here because \nthere is a tax break. The Federal Government does not get taxes on \nitems which the employer deducts on the cost of the insurance coverage.\n  There is also a consideration on an underlying issue of \ndiscriminatory practices as to women on the limitation of what is \nreasonable medical coverage. There is an analogy--none of the analogies \nare really compelling, but the argument has been made that where you \nhave a pharmaceutical coverage on Viagra, for example, which deals with \nreproductive capacity, nobody would think of saying the pharmaceutical \ncoverage ought to be limited. Similarly, where there is the right to an \nabortion, if a woman wants to have it, which she pays for herself, it \nhas all of the ring of discrimination.\n  A principal concern which I have is that if this issue results in a \nstalemate, the entire bill will be defeated because of this issue.\n  There are two remaining matters to be resolved which have some \nsignificant import which could lead to the defeat of the bill. One is \non the issue of the public option. It is my argument, contention that \nwe still ought to have a robust public option. There is a vast \nmisunderstanding that the public option does not mean that the Federal \nGovernment is taking over on insurance coverage. That is single payer. \nThat is not the public option, which is what it says, an option, one \nalternative. There are efforts being made to find an accommodation. I \nhope we stick with a robust public option.\n  The other issue which could lead to defeat of this bill, bring it \ndown, is this controversy on abortion. It is still unclear how the \nStupak amendment emerged in the House bill. There are lots of \nobjections to it. Why the dichotomy of Hyde with no Federal funds being \nused and people could pay for their own was not followed in the House \nbill I do not know. I do not ascribe any inappropriate motives to any\n\n[[Page S12611]]\n\nof my colleagues. I would not do that. But I think a consequence of \nthis controversy--and I think there may be some who do want to kill the \nbill. Certainly, the delaying tactics on the other side of the aisle \nmake it plain that there are those who would use whatever procedures \nare available, whatever arguments are available to defeat the bill. \nThat would be very regrettable in terms of the long struggle. We have \ndiscussed this on the floor again and again, what has happened since \nTheodore Roosevelt, FDR, and the efforts made to have coverage of \nhealth care for the uninsured.\n  If we stalemate on this issue, that could be the consequence. There \nis no reason to stalemate when there is such a clear-cut path. The bill \nexplicitly provides that no Federal funds may be used for abortion, \nthat any Federal funds would be segregated. That is the precise \nprecedent of Medicaid. So I urge my colleagues to defeat the pending \namendment so we can proceed to move for final enactment of this \nimportant legislation.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nNelson-Hatch amendment, which replaces the compromise language in the \ncurrent bill with unprecedented restrictions on women's access to safe \nand legal abortion services.\n  I think we can all agree that women's health is fundamental to our \nNation's health. We all know that when women are healthier, families, \ncommunities, and countries are healthier. But I also know the issue of \nabortion is difficult, no matter where you stand on it, and I truly \nrespect the fact that we have a range of opinions among us. Women have \nabortions for different reasons. Some of these reasons may not seem \nright to some of us. But even if we disagree, it is better that each \nwoman be able to make her own decision with her doctor.\n  In a perfect world, no woman should have to face the decisions we are \ndiscussing today. But the reason we have insurance coverage is to help \nus deal with the unexpected. No woman expects to have an unplanned \npregnancy. No woman expects to end a wanted pregnancy because of fetal \nanomalies or risks to her own health. If we limit options in private \nhealth insurance coverage, we take away a woman's right to make a \ndecision that may be best for her and for her family in their \ncircumstances.\n  But unplanned pregnancies do occur, and we have a responsibility to \nprovide women with the full range of choices regarding their health. \nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled on this issue and made it clear \nthat women have a constitutional right to access abortion. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure abortions are safe, legal, and rare.\n  Supporting a woman's right to make decisions about her health means \nmore than keeping abortion services legal; it means supporting a \nwoman's decision to terminate a pregnancy safely and with dignity. It \nalso means teaching honest, realistic sex education. It means the right \nto choose contraception. It means standing with women who choose to \ncontinue their pregnancies--with the hope and expectation that a \ncompassionate society will support them in their responsibilities \nraising a child. It is about respecting women's personal decisions and \nthe challenges they face, especially at times when they are the most \nvulnerable.\n  I strongly oppose the Nelson-Hatch amendment because it undermines \nthe status quo and breaks new ground by restricting women's fundamental \nrights. The amendment stipulates that health plans cannot cover \nabortion services if they accept even one subsidized customer, even if \nthe abortion coverage would be paid with the private premiums health \nplans receive directly from individuals. If adopted, this would mark \nthe first time in Federal law that we would restrict how individuals \ncan use their own dollars in the private health insurance marketplace.\n  I also oppose the amendment because we have a workable solution. The \nexisting compromise in our bill represents genuine concessions by both \npro-choice and pro-life Members of Congress. The current bill prohibits \nFederal funding of abortion but also allows women to pay for abortion \ncoverage with their own private funds. It makes clear abortion can't be \nmandated or prohibited and stipulates that Federal funds cannot be used \nfor abortion.\n  Let me be clear. The compromise within the current bill is as far as \nwe can go. We have negotiated to get to this point. We cannot negotiate \nfurther without literally undermining the compromise we have made on \nbehalf of women's health in this country.\n  We are on the verge of passing a historic health reform law that will \ndo more to improve the health of women and families than any \nlegislation in recent history. We will end discrimination based on \nhealth history, on gender, or history of domestic violence. We will \nprovide access to preventive health services so women can get annual \nexams and mammograms at no cost. It is our responsibility to guarantee \nwomen are not worse off--under the health reform we are going to pass--\nthan they are today.\n  As my friend Paul Wellstone used to say: ``If we don't fight hard \nenough for the things that we stand for, at some point we have to \nrecognize that we don't really stand for them.'' I urge my colleagues \nto stand with me today to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I am troubled by what I have seen in the \nChamber of the Senate in the last week. Actually, I am troubled by what \nI have seen in the Senate Chamber for the last several weeks, as I have \nwatched this slow walk that so many of my colleagues who oppose health \ncare reform are doing--anything to stall, anything to slow things down, \nanything to distract the public.\n  It began last summer, when some negotiations were going on. It was \npretty clear there was no interest in any kind of real compromise, in \nany kind of constructive input into these negotiations. I can say that \nbecause I remember what happened in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee in July. In June and July, we wrote the original--\nthe first health care bill that passed a Senate committee, the HELP \nCommittee.\n  We processed hundreds of amendments. The markup--which is the \ndiscussion inside the committee--took 11 days, the longest markup in \nanybody's memory. Everybody got a chance, everybody--all 23 Members of \nthe committee, 13 Democrats, 10 Republicans--to offer amendments. Most \nof those amendments were voted on or agreed to. Nobody filibustered.\n  There was certainly lots of discussion. Sometimes we are a little \nlong-winded around here, more so than we should be, but 160 Republican \namendments were passed--either agreed to or actually voted on and \npassed in the committee. I voted for most of those amendments--I would \nsay probably all but 10 of them--something like that. But the point is, \nthere was a lot of bipartisanship in this legislation.\n  On the bigger questions, the differences are more ideological, more \nfundamental. For instance, Democrats support a strong Medicare. \nRepublicans, who originally opposed Medicare in the 1960s--and not for \npartisan reasons but for ideological reasons--do not think government \nshould run Medicare. That was pretty clear.\n  In the 1990s, when I was a Member of the House, Speaker Gingrich and \nthe Republicans--they had a majority in the House and Senate--tried to \nprivatize Medicare. President Clinton mostly blocked it, although he \nwent along with some of it. When the Republicans, for the first time, \nhad the House, the Senate, and the White House, in 2003, they \ndramatically privatized Medicare, shoveling all kinds of moneys into \nthe insurance companies and giving huge subsidies to the drug \ncompanies. Look what we got. We got more difficult problems with \nMedicare, more budget problems. We went from a budget surplus to a \nbudget deficit, partly because of that bill and because of the war.\n\n[[Page S12612]]\n\n  My point is, this bill was bipartisan in many ways, but on the big \nfundamental questions--should government be involved in things such as \nMedicare; what should we do on worker safety issues; what to do on \nconsumer protections--the Democrats want to see strong consumer \nprotections, with no more cutting people off their coverage because of \npreexisting conditions, no more discrimination against women.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, through her work in New Hampshire, \nshe has seen too many of her female constituents paying higher prices \nthan male constituents. What is fair about that? So the Republicans \nhave generally sided with the insurance companies and the Democrats \ngenerally side with consumers. On those fundamental questions, they \naren't really partisan as much as they are ideological.\n  Saturday night, a couple weeks ago, when we actually began the \ndebate--where no Republican voted to allow the bill to even be \ndebated--that was the ultimate stall tactic, to keep it off the floor. \nThe Democrats voted to put it on the floor. But what bothers me about \nthis stalling is not just that they are stopping us from doing what we \nneed to do in this country, it is that in my State alone, there are 400 \npeople every single day--from Toledo to Athens, from Bryan to St. \nClairsville, from Conneaut to Middletown--400 Ohioans every day lose \ntheir insurance, 400 Ohioans every day. Across the country, 45,000 \npeople die every year, according to studies, and 1,000 people a week \ndie because they don't have insurance.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, because of her work on women's health \ncare, a woman with breast cancer, without insurance, is 40 percent more \nlikely to die than a woman who has breast cancer with insurance.\n  Think about that. If you have breast cancer, as anxious as you are, \nas fearful as you are, as sick as you are, if you have insurance you at \nleast do not have to worry about that; you can go get decent medical \ncare and many times your life is saved, particularly if you caught it \nearly enough. But if you don't have insurance, you can't go to the \nemergency room. They are not going to take care of you every day. They \nmight take care of you at the end of your life, right at the end; if \nyou are dying you might get emergency care. But people like that are \njust left out of the system. That is why a woman with breast cancer \nwithout insurance is 40 percent more likely to die. That is why these \ndelays from my friends over there, they write memos on the best way to \ndelay the bills. They try every motion they can think of. For 3 days we \ncouldn't even get a vote when we wanted to vote on one of their \namendments, Senator McCain's amendment on Medicare. We literally could \nnot get a vote because the Republicans blocked the vote. We finally \ndid.\n  It is just these delay tactics. Again, 400 people in Findlay and \nMansfield and Zanesville and Springfield and Xenia and Columbus--400 \npeople every day lose their insurance in my State alone. Forty-five \nthousand people die a year because they do not have insurance.\n  Let me read a couple of letters. I come to the floor most days and \nread letters from people from my State. Many of these letters--not \nevery one, but many of them--come from people who, if you asked them a \nyear ago, would have said they had pretty good insurance. Then they \nhave a child born with a preexisting condition, and they lose their \ninsurance or then maybe they got sick and their hospital bills were so \nhigh the insurance company cut them off. Maybe they lost their job and \nthey lost their insurance.\n  So many of those letters, as I said, were from people who thought \nthey had good insurance and found out when they really needed the \ninsurance, it was not such good insurance.\n  Let me just read from a couple of letters. This comes from Amy from \nFranklin County. Franklin County is in the middle of the State, the \nState capital located in Franklin County.\n\n       I recently had two minor surgeries. But in the last six \n     months alone, I've had to spend about $4,000 to cover 15 \n     percent of my income. Thank you for taking a strong stance on \n     health reform.\n\n  What Amy writes about, when you are spending one-sixth of your gross \nincome on health care--then this is somebody who is working, she is \nplaying by the rules, she is doing everything she can, and she got \nreally sick--there was not the safety net for her that there should be.\n  Our bill will take care of that. Our bill says if you have health \ninsurance and you like it, you can keep it, but in addition you are \ngoing to get good consumer protections, no more preexisting condition, \nno denial of care that way.\n  A second thing: If you are a small business you are going to get \nassistance--some tax incentives, some tax incentives, some tax \ncredits--to insure your employees. Most small business people I know in \nBucyrus, OH, in Galion, in Crestline, in Shelby, and all over my part \nof the State, like that. Most of them want to cover their employees, \nbut if you have 20 employees and one of them gets sick, your insurance \nrates will go so high you can no longer afford it sometimes or you will \nget cancelled.\n  The third thing our bill does is it helps people, those who do not \nhave insurance, by giving them assistance so they can afford insurance, \nso people like Amy can get a better insurance policy rather than \nspending that much money out of pocket.\n  The other letter I would like to share is from Amber from Morrow \nCounty, an area of the State sort of north-central, north of Columbus, \nMount Gilead, that part of the State, Cardington. She says, at age 19--\nthis is more a story about her than an actual letter--at age 19 Amber \nwas discontinued on her stepfather's insurance plan because of a \npreexisting condition. Needing constant medication and treatment for \nher diabetes, she tried to obtain her own health insurance plan. She \nwas unable to afford any of her treatments or medications because she \ncouldn't get insurance. As a result of an inability to treat her \ncondition, she suffered two heart attacks and lost most of her vision.\n  She is 22 years old now. Now legally blind, she has lost feeling in \nher hand and feet, missing many of her teeth, and has kidney and \nintestinal problems. She feels lucky now to qualify for government \ndisability benefits.\n  I don't know Amber. I know what her family members sent to us about \nher. But because she could not get insurance, because she was taken off \nher stepfather's insurance because of a preexisting condition, she was \nnot able to do the kind of care diabetics are able to do.\n  It is a horrible disease. My best friend had diabetes. We have \nfriends and neighbors and family members and colleagues and associates \nwho have diabetes. Most of them, if they have a good health insurance \nplan, are able to live normal lives and don't have these kinds of \nthings happen that happened to Amber.\n  What has happened, lost feeling in her hands and feet, kidney and \nintestinal problems, all the awful things that come out of diabetes are \nbecause it is a chronic disease. They are manageable. You know what \nwill happen. Amber ends up in the hospital. Because she doesn't have \ninsurance, it costs others in Morrow County who have insurance. They \nall pay more because they have to take care of Amber in a very \nexpensive situation instead of providing insurance for Amber so she can \nmanage her diabetes at much less cost and much more humanely.\n  It simply doesn't make sense to continue to stall. I have been around \na good while in government. I have never been more upset than I have \nwatching these stall tactics. These are not games people should be \nplaying when you think about the human life, you think about Amber, you \nthink about Amy, you think about how we all have people in our States \nwho have suffered because they do not have insurance. We know how to \nfix it. We need to move forward and get this done as quickly as we can.\n  Four hundred Ohioans losing their insurance every day; 45,000 \nAmericans dying every year because they don't have insurance. Those \nthings simply are not acceptable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, with America aging at an unprecedented \nrate, and with the high and rising costs of caring for a loved one, the \nfinancing of long-term care must be addressed if we are going to get \nhealth care costs under control. For those who can plan ahead while \nthey are still healthy, and who can afford it, private long-term care \ninsurance may play a helpful role\n\n[[Page S12613]]\n\nin enhancing their retirement security--but only if the policies they \npurchase are sound and the protections are strong.\n  We all know that long-term care is expensive. The cost of care in a \nnursing home now averages $75,000 per year. However, most Americans do \nnot realize Medicare provides only very limited assistance through home \nhealth services, and that Medicaid will not cover long-term care costs \nunless their household savings are nearly eliminated. States share the \nresponsibility of providing Medicaid funding for long-term care with \nthe Federal Government, and are also looking for ways to reduce their \nexpenses. As of today, 43 States are in the process of launching \n``partnership'' programs, which provide consumers who purchase private \nlong-term care insurance and exhaust their benefits the ability to \nretain higher assets than are normally permitted if they go on to \nreceive services under Medicaid.\n  We have a duty to try to ensure that these policies, which often span \ndecades, are financially viable. During the last several years, several \nlong-term care insurance carriers have fallen into financial \ndifficulties, raising questions about how protected policyholders' \ninvestments are, and others have sharply raised premiums to compensate \nfor actuarial miscalculations. Such premium increases can be \ndevastating for older persons who are living on fixed incomes. Their \nchoices are often stark and very limited: they can either dig deeper \nand pay the increased premiums, or let their policy lapse, leaving them \nwith no coverage if they ever need care.\n  Last year, I was joined by several Senate and House colleagues in \nreleasing a GAO report on whether adequate consumer protections are in \nplace for those who purchase long-term care insurance. The report found \nthat rate increases are common throughout the industry, and that \nconsumer protections are uneven. While some States have adopted \nrequirements that keep rates relatively stable, some have not, leaving \nconsumers unprotected.\n  The amendment I am cosponsoring with Senators Wyden and Klobuchar \nwill help mitigate these problems and do a better job of protecting \npolicyholders who buy policies in the future. We need to strengthen \nstandards for all policies to ensure that premiums increases are kept \nto a minimum; that insurance agents receive adequate training; and that \ncomplaints and appeals are addressed in a timely manner. We also need \nto make it easier for consumers to accurately compare policies from \ndifferent insurance carriers, particularly with regard to what benefits \nare covered and whether the plan offers inflation protection. States \nshould also have to approve materials used to market Partnership \npolicies. This amendment will institute these and many other \nimprovements.\n  It is estimated that two out of three Americans who reach the age of \n65 will need long-term care services and supports at some point to \nassist them with day-to-day activities, and enable them to maintain a \nhigh-quality, independent life. Long-term care insurance is an \nappropriate product for many who wish to plan for a secure retirement. \nBut to be a viable part of the health care solution, we must take the \nnecessary steps to guarantee that consumers across the country have \nadequate information and protections, and that premiums won't skyrocket \ndown the road.\n  I am pleased to say that this policy is strongly supported by the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners and the Wisconsin \nOffice of the Insurance Commissioner, Consumers Union, Genworth \nFinancial, Northwestern Mutual, the National Treasury Employees Union, \nand California Health Advocates, which provides support to that state's \ninsurance counseling and advocacy programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/07/senate-section/article/S12613-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Madam President, tomorrow will be a somber and very \ndifficult day in my home State.\n  That is because tomorrow, just over a week after the single worst act \nof violence against law enforcement in Washington State history, police \nofficers from across the State and Nation, heartbroken Washington State \nresidents, the community of Lakewood, WA, and the families of the \nvictims of last Sunday's brutal attack on four police officers will \ngather to say goodbye.\n  Tomorrow's memorial for the four officers killed on the morning of \nNovember 29th will begin with a procession that leaves from just steps \naway from the coffee shop that was the site of that senseless and \ncowardly attack.\n  An attack in which four officers were targeted solely because they \nwere in uniform, solely because they had sworn to protect their \ncommunity.\n  The procession will then weave its way through that very community--\nLakewood, WA, a community that has been devastated by this tragedy, a \ncommunity where these four officers were original members of their \npolice force--and were loved and respected by their colleagues and the \npeople they served.\n  Along the way, the procession route is expected to be lined by \nthousands of Lakewood residents and by all those who have been so \ndeeply affected by this tragedy from throughout my State.\n  At the Lakewood Police Department the procession will stop to pick up \nthe families of the fallen officers--families who together now include \nnine children left without a parent--families whose grief is hard to \nimagine.\n  The procession will end at a service that is expected to be attended \nby more than 20,000 law enforcement officers from every corner of my \nState and from throughout the Nation.\n  It will be an emotional end to a week that has rocked my home State.\n  It will also be farewell for four police officers who devoted and \nultimately gave their lives to protect others.\n  Law enforcement is not for everyone. In fact, it takes a special kind \nof person to be willing to wake up each day--motivated and ready to be \nthe line of protection between dangerous criminals and our \nneighborhoods and people.\n  But in the case of Sergeant Mark Renninger and Officers Gregory \nRichards, Tina Griswold and Ronald Owens it is easy to see where they \ngot that motivation from.\n  When you hear their life stories, it is clear that, to a person, \nthese were officers who beyond all else, were dedicated to family; \nofficers who knew that the work they did protected those they love and \nfamilies just like theirs.\n  In a telling quote this week, a fellow Lakewood officer described his \nfallen colleagues by saying that they were executed because they were \ncops, but that none of them saw their lives that way.\n  Instead he said they saw themselves first and foremost as family men \nand women.\n  For these four police officers any reminder of just how critical the \nduties they performed each day were came when they went home each \nnight.\n  Officer Greg Richards leaves behind a wife and three children. He was \nan 8-year veteran who served in the Kent Police Department before \njoining the Lakewood department.\n  In memorials he has been described as a glass-half-full guy, someone \nwho made things better for the people around him. His wife Kelly has \ntalked this week about his passion for music, his job and of course his \nfamily.\n  Officer Tina Griswold leaves behind a husband and two children. She \nwas a 14-year veteran who served in the police departments in Shelton \nand Lacey before joining the Lakewood police force in 2004.\n  She stood 4 foot 11 but as her colleagues have said many times--she \nwouldn't back down from anyone. She was a member of the riot response \nteam, a hard-charging officer and mom who loved her job and her family.\n  Officer Ronald Owens leaves behind a daughter. Owens followed his \nfather into law enforcement and was a 12-year veteran who served on the \nWashington State Patrol before moving to the Lakewood Police \nDepartment.\n  He has been remembered as spending almost all of his off-duty time \nwith his daughter--attending all of her school\n\n[[Page S12614]]\n\nfunctions, riding bikes together, and treating her to nights out \nwhenever he could.\n  Sgt. Mark Renninger leaves behind a wife and three children. He was a \nveteran, who wore the uniform of the United States before putting on \nthe uniform of the Tukwila Police Department in 1996. He joined the \nLakewood Police Department in 2004.\n  He was an Army Ranger and has been described as having the kind of \nnatural leadership abilities that put other officer at ease in \ndifficult situations.\n  He was a SWAT team trainer known for an enthusiasm for his job. But \nhe was also remembered this week for the joy that family brought him--\nwhether it was trips to Mariners games or family vacations to Mount \nRainier.\n  This was a senseless and brutal killing--and it specifically targeted \nthe people who sacrifice each day to keep all of us safe.\n  This terrible crime has not only left the families of the victims \nshattered, but it has shattered our sense of safety and left an entire \ncommunity in disbelief.\n  It was also part of a shockingly violent month for my State's law \nenforcement community that has also included a senseless attack on \nOctober 31 which killed Seattle Police Officer Timothy Brenton and left \nanother officer--Britt Sweeney--injured.\n  These attacks remind all of us of the incredible risks our law \nenforcement officers take each day, and that even when doing the most \nroutine aspects of their jobs, our law enforcement officers put \nthemselves on the line for our safety.\n  Already this year more than 100 police officers across our country \nhave given their lives while serving to protect us.\n  Each of these tragedies sheds light on just how big a sacrifice our \npolice officers make in the line of duty.\n  But these most recent attacks in my home State also offer an \nimportant reminder that our officers are always in the line of duty, \neven when they are training other officers, out on routine patrols, or \nsimply having coffee.\n  There is no doubt that these senseless attacks have left many law \nenforcement officers across my State and our country feeling targeted. \nBut there is also no doubt that their willingness to put themselves on \nthe line to protect us will continue unshaken. That is a testament to \nthe commitment they make to serve and protect us every day, and it \nshould remind all of us that these brave men and women deserve all the \nsupport we can provide to keep them safe.\n  As my State prepares to say goodbye to these four heroes, I again \nextend my condolences and the condolences of the entire Senate to their \nfamilies.\n  Our law enforcement professionals put themselves between us and \ndanger every day. Right now, in light of such horrible events, we hold \nthem even closer in our own thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/07/senate-section/article/S12614-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PEARL HARBOR ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise in remembrance of the attack on \nPearl Harbor, the ``Day of Infamy,'' 68 years ago today.\n  I had other things on my mind when I woke up on the morning of \nSunday, December 7, 1941. I was 17 years old and studying at the \nKamehameha School for Boys. I climbed to the roof of my dormitory in \nthe foothills above Pearl Harbor--and saw the planes swarm. I watched \nas their bombs and torpedoes delivered a crippling blow to the Pacific \nfleet. I saw smoke rise to the sky as the USS Arizona and other \nbattleships sank.\n  When the planes flew over our campus for a second bombing run in \nKaneohe, close enough to see the unmistakable red sun of imperial \nJapan, I confirmed what I had feared: we were under attack. I did not \nknow what would happen next, but I knew for certain that my life, \nHawaii, the United States, and the world would never be the same.\n  As an ROTC cadet, I spent the rest of that day in the foothills above \nour campus, searching for paratroopers. Later, I joined the Army and \nserved as a noncommissioned officer in the Pacific.\n  Hawaii changed immediately. Martial law was declared. A military \ngovernor was appointed. Food and supplies were rationed. The people of \nHawaii were subjected to a curfew, and sat in darkness all night--\nlights were banned to make it harder for the enemy to find the islands.\n  The terrible attack inspired a generation of young people to set \ntheir lives and dreams aside to fight World War II. When we returned \nhome, victorious, we returned to a grateful Nation. Thanks to the G.I. \nbill and other reintegration efforts, these young veterans went on to \nbecome The Greatest Generation: Presidents, Nobel laureates, and \nleaders in their communities.\n  We who lived through Pearl Harbor and fought World War II know too \nwell that today's service men and women face challenges similar to \nthose from our youth. So does our Nation. But we benefit from the \nlessons of World War II: that our warriors can do great things if they \nreturn to a grateful Nation that provides them with the care and \nsupport they have earned.\n  World War II changed our country forever, revolutionizing our defense \nforces, industrializing our Nation, and leading the United States to \nassert its global leadership and become the world's superpower.\n  As we pause to remember those lost on the ``Day of Infamy,'' let us \nalso honor those who are overseas fighting today, and all those who \nhave sacrificed to defend our great country over the years.\n  Like the veterans of World War II, today's servicemembers and former \nservicemembers can achieve great things if they are supported by the \nNation they have defended. With that in mind, let us show our thanks by \nhonoring our veterans and preserving the Union they risked everything \nto protect.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, 68 years ago today, the United States \nwas thrust into World War II following the surprise attack on Pearl \nHarbor. Today, we pay tribute to those who survived the attack and \nremember the men and women who perished.\n  Although the attack claimed the lives of more than 2,300 Americans, \nit did not break the resolve of our military. Today, we are grateful \nfor the service of those we lost in conflict as well as those who \nreturned after fighting to keep us safe and free. I join all Floridians \nin honoring those who fought for our freedom on that day and throughout \nthe ensuing campaigns in Europe and the Pacific.\n  On this Pearl Harbor Day, I thank all World War II veterans who \nanswered our Nation's call to serve in the cause of freedom. They are \ntrue heroes and our Nation will always remember their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/07/senate-section/article/S12614-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12614-S12615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Lieutenant Colonel James Gentry\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of LTC \nJames Gentry, commander of the 1st Battalion, 152nd Infantry of the \nIndiana National Guard.\n  Jim was only 52 years old when he tragically lost his long and heroic \nbattle with cancer on November 25, 2009, the day before Thanksgiving.\n  A native of Mitchell, IN, he served two tours of duty in Iraq. It was \nin Iraq in 2003 where Lieutenant Colonel Gentry and the more than 600 \nsoldiers he bravely led were exposed to the lethal chemical sodium \ndichromate while guarding the Qarmat Ali water treatment facility in \nBasrah.\n  In 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Gentry was diagnosed with terminal cancer \nand given 2 months to live. He not only valiantly fought this \ndebilitating illness--and survived much longer than doctors expected--\nbut he also fought to bring crucial details about the tragedy at Qarmat \nAli to the Nation's attention.\n  With his quiet courage, he advocated for justice for the soldiers \nunder his command until his final days. Due in large part to his \nefforts, the Department of Defense is now investigating why so many \nservice men and women were exposed to this deadly chemical.\n  As Americans, we take pride in the example Lieutenant Colonel Gentry \nset as a soldier, a leader, and a patriot. I had the privilege of \nspeaking with him on the phone a little more than a month ago. Even in \nwhat turned out to be his final days, he remained steadfast in his \ndedication to his troops and in his efforts to ensure they received \nproper care.\n  Jim is survived by his devoted wife LouAnn Grube Gentry, five \nchildren Sarah Clark, Jason Newman, Emily\n\n[[Page S12615]]\n\nGentry, Jennafer Newman, and Ellen Gentry, his parents George and \nBrenda Sue Gentry, brother Sanford Gentry, and sister Carolyn Hodges.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Gentry was a brave man who put his soldiers before \nhimself, both on and off the field of battle. Today and always, he will \nbe remembered by family and friends, fellow soldiers and all Hoosiers \nas a true American hero. We cherish the legacy of his service and his \nlife.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of LTC James Gentry in the Record \nof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy, and peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/07/senate-section/article/S12615-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AMINATOU HAIDAR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week I spoke about the situation of \nAminatou Haidar, a Sahrawi human rights activist who has been on a \nhunger strike since shortly after November 13 when her passport was \nconfiscated by Moroccan authorities and she was deported to the Canary \nIslands. She is now in the third week of her hunger strike, and her \nhealth has seriously declined. An agreement between the Spanish and \nMoroccan governments was reportedly reached on Friday, but it fell \nthrough at the last minute and Ms. Haidar remains at the Lanzarote \nAirport.\n  Given this dire situation and the damage it is causing to efforts to \nresume good-faith negotiations on the future status of the Western \nSahara, I want to repeat my appeal to the Moroccan authorities to \nreinstate Ms. Haidar's passport and allow her to return home to her \nfamily.\n  Morocco and the United States are friends and allies. The denial of \ncitizenship and forcible exile of Ms. Haidar is inconsistent with \ninternational human rights norms to which Morocco is a signatory and \nwill accomplish nothing positive. It also raises the question, as do \nthe recent arrests of other Sahrawi activists, of whether the United \nNations' mandate in Western Sahara should be expanded to include human \nrights monitoring. I believe the State Department should seriously \nreview this issue when the UN mission's term comes up for extension in \nthe Security Council in April.\n  There is still time, but it is running out, to resolve this issue in \na manner that serves Morocco's interests and protects Ms. Haidar's \nrights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/07/senate-section/article/S12615-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING MITCH DEMIENTIEFF\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to remember the life of a \nmuch respected and accomplished resident from my home State of Alaska, \nMr. Mitch Demientieff of Nenana. Mitch passed away on December 1, 2009. \nHe was 57.\n  Mr. Demientieff not only held many important positions in the Native \ncommunity, he was an ardent preserver of his Athabascan culture and a \ntrue family man. While a student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, \nhe accomplished something truly amazing: at age 19, he was elected \npresident of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, a post he held again years \nlater. One year before his election as president, he broke into the \nlocal political scene as mayor of Nenana.\n  His legacy at the Chiefs included the modernization of the tribal \nhealth programs and working to provide education to the youth in the \nNative community. His personal legacy revolves around his dedication to \npreserving Native culture. Mitch was committed to making sure the \ntraditions of Alaska Natives and his people were not lost. His \ninterests included the stories he heard and passed on, traditional \nsongs and dances, how clans were run and the practices of traditional \nmedicine.\n  His achievements later in life included service on the Federal \nSubsistence Board where he was a strong advocate for subsistence rights \nfor Natives. At the time of his passing, he was serving on the Nenana \nCity Council and was the Nenana tribal chief.\n  In his personal life Mitch was an avid sports fan and coach who was \nloved by his family and community. He and his wife Kathleen, married \nfor 24 years, have a blended family of six children and 14 \ngrandchildren. Mitch was both beloved and respected in their community \nand throughout interior Alaska. Everywhere Mitch went, he made friends.\n  Mitch Demientieff will be missed by his family, friends, and all of \nthe people he touched in the State of Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/07/senate-section/article/S12615-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIIBUTE TO DR.

This population will increase as a result \n     of Armed Forces structure initiatives during the next several \n     years.\n       (5) A significant portion of Alaska's population is \n     comprised of Medicare beneficiaries.\n       (6) Almost \\1/4\\ of Alaska's population is comprised of \n     Medicaid beneficiaries.\n       (7) Federal agencies have undertaken efforts to improve and \n     increase access to health care in the State of Alaska for \n     Federal health care system beneficiaries, but there are \n     finite medical resources in the State for which such \n     beneficiaries must compete.\n       (8) To ensure improved and increased access to health care \n     for beneficiaries of Federal health care systems in the State \n     of Alaska, comprehensive policies and interagency \n     collaboration are required.\n       (b) Interagency Access to Health Care in Alaska Task \n     Force.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established a task force to be \n     known as the ``Interagency Access to Health Care in Alaska \n     Task Force'' (referred to in this section as the ``Task \n     Force'').\n       (2) Activities.--The Task Force shall--\n       (A) assess access to health care for beneficiaries of \n     Federal health care systems in Alaska, which shall include \n     consideration of, with regard to the State of Alaska--\n       (i) current Federal health care delivery methods at Federal \n     treatment facilities and through civilian provider networks;\n       (ii) shortfalls in delivering health care to beneficiaries \n     of Federal health care systems at Federal treatment \n     facilities and through civilian provider networks; and\n       (iii) the impact of reimbursement rates and claims \n     processing on civilian provider participation; and\n       (B) develop a strategy for the Federal Government to \n     improve delivery of health care to Federal beneficiaries in \n     the State of Alaska, which shall include--\n       (i) interagency collaboration opportunities for addressing \n     shortfalls in delivering health care to beneficiaries of \n     Federal health care systems;\n       (ii) increasing Federal Government primary care and \n     specialty care capability practices in the State of Alaska at \n     Federal treatment facilities and in the civilian provider \n     community.\n       (c) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointment.--\n       (A) Federal members.--The Task Force shall be comprised of \n     Federal members who shall be appointed as follows:\n       (i) One member shall be a representative of the Department \n     of Health and Human Services and shall be appointed by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n       (ii) One member shall be a representative of the Centers \n     for Medicare and Medicaid Services and shall be appointed by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n       (iii) One member shall be a representative of the Indian \n     Health Service and shall be appointed by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services.\n       (iv) One member shall be a representative of the TRICARE \n     Management Activity and shall be appointed by the Secretary \n     of Defense.\n       (v) One member shall be a representative of the Army \n     Medical Department and shall be appointed by the Secretary of \n     the Army.\n       (vi) One member shall be a representative of the Air Force \n     and shall be appointed by the Secretary of the Air Force from \n     among officers at the Air Force performing medical service \n     functions.\n       (vii) One member shall be a representative of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs and shall be appointed by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n       (viii) One member shall be a representative of the Veterans \n     Health Administration and shall be appointed by the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs.\n       (ix) One member shall be a representative of the United \n     States Coast Guard and shall be appointed by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security.\n       (B) Non-federal members.--Individuals appointed by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Task Force from \n     outside the agencies may include officers or employees of \n     other departments and agencies of the Federal Government and \n     individuals from the private medical community in Alaska and, \n     at the election of the Governor of the State of Alaska, shall \n     include at least one employee representative of the State of \n     Alaska.\n       (2) Timeframe for appointment.--All appointments of \n     individuals to the Task Force, as described in paragraph (2), \n     shall be made not later than 45 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Co-chairpersons.--There shall be 2 co-chairpersons of \n     the Task Force, appointed at the time of appointment of \n     members under paragraph (1).
