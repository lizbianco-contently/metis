Mr. President, last fall, many of us in Congress \nweren't all that excited about rescuing financial firms from problems \nthat many of them had brought about themselves, but we decided swift \naction was needed precisely to protect ordinary Americans from the \nmistakes these firms had made. At the time, Republicans insisted on \nstrong taxpayer protections. None of us had any doubt that once these \nbanks were healthy again, they would pay the money back to the \ntaxpayers who gave it to them.\n  Let me say that again. None of us had any doubt that once the banks \nwere healthy again, they would pay the money back to the taxpayers. In \nfact, many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle only supported \nthe bill because of the representations that were made that we would \nrecoup--the Government would recoup--the money. Now we are hearing a \ndifferent story.\n  A number of the firms that taxpayers helped out last fall are now on \nthe road to recovery and want to pay back their loans. Unfortunately, \nTreasury doesn't seem to want to take the money. Let me say that again. \nThese firms are getting healthy, they want to pay back the money, and \nTreasury doesn't seem to want to take the money. This wasn't the \noriginal plan, and it doesn't seem right to most people. If a bank \nwants to pay the taxpayers back--if a bank wants to pay the taxpayers \nback--the Government shouldn't block the door.\n  Just as troubling is a new report by the special inspector general \nwho is overseeing all the financial rescue programs. It alleges the \nsame kind of fraud we warned about back in October, including about 20 \npreliminary and full criminal investigations for everything ranging \nfrom securities fraud to mortgage fraud, to insider trading, to public \ncorruption related to the $700 billion in rescue funds.\n  All of this is a major wakeup call. The Treasury needs to root out \nthe\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\nfraud now, particularly at a time when the new administration is vastly \nexpanding the size and the scope of these programs. As these programs \nexpand, so will the potential for abuse. The Treasury Department also \nneeds to let these banks extract themselves from Government control as \nsoon as they want to. That was the original plan the American people \nsigned onto, and they have a right to expect that the original plan \nwill be carried out free from fraud and abuse.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4528-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today is Earth Day, a day of \ncelebration of the environment and the landscape of the great American \noutdoors. The President is on his way to Iowa to visit a windmill \nfactory.\n  It is also a good day for us in the Senate to ask, ``exactly what is \nour energy policy in the United States and what should it be?'' Is it a \nnational clean energy policy; or is it a national renewable energy \npolicy; or is it a national windmill policy? It makes a difference. \nBecause in terms of electricity, we use about a quarter of all the \nelectricity in the world, and our computers and our homes in the summer \nand winter and our factories all depend upon a generous supply of \nreliable, low-cost electricity. That is what we need.\n  I believe this is our policy, and I believe most on the Republican \nside believe this as well, and I hope many on the other side do too. I \nbelieve that what we should do for the foreseeable future is to produce \nAmerican energy, and use less energy, and that we ought to do it as \ncleanly as possible, as reliably as possible, and at as low a cost as \npossible.\n  Let's see if that is what we are actually doing and if that is what \nthe legislation we are considering would actually do. Nothing has \ncaptured the media's attention, nor the attention of those of us who \nare elected to office, quite so much as renewable energy. I heard the \nPresiding Officer make what I believe was his maiden speech on the \nfloor of the Senate on this subject not long ago. And the President of \nthe United States--President Obama--has talked about powering our \nelectricity by capturing the energy of the Sun, and the wind, and the \nEarth.\n  We will be considering, within a few weeks, legislation that would \nrequire all our electric utilities to generate a portion of their \nelectricity from a very narrowly defined group of energies--mostly the \nSun, the wind, and the Earth--and we have huge subsidies, especially \nfor windmills--billions of dollars by taxpayers. That is the subject of \nanother speech, but last year we added another $13 billion or $14 \nbillion in subsidies over the next 10 years that we would be giving to \nbanks and wealthy people and others who are wind developers.\n\n  The total number is in the $25 billion to $26 billion in taxpayer \nmoney that is now going just to subsidize wind turbines. The subsidies \nare huge. As a country, we have gotten infatuated with energy from the \nSun, the wind, and the Earth.\n  I went to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory a year ago and talked \nabout the importance of a clean energy future for our country, and \namong the suggestions I made was that we have a new Manhattan Project \n(like the World War II project that created the atom bomb), or a series \nof mini Manhattan Projects, and that they would be directed toward such \nthings as making solar cost competitive within 5 years. Solar energy \ncosts three or four times as much as other energies, so the technology \nneeds to be improved. Also, we should make advanced biofuels more of a \nreality. In other words, making fuel from crops that we don't eat so we \ndon't distort the food market.\n  We have made some progress on renewable energy, but there is a \npotentially dangerous energy gap facing us in America because, today, \nrenewable energy from the Sun, the wind, and the Earth produces 1\\1/2\\ \npercent of all the electricity we use. The President wants to double \nthat. Well, that is 3 percent. What if we tripled it? Well, that is on \nup to 5 or 6 or 7 percent. What about the other 90 percent? How are we \ngoing to heat our homes and cool our homes and how are we going to keep \nprices low enough so our factories and jobs will stay here rather than \ngoing overseas? It will be a long time before electricity or energy \nfrom the Sun and the wind and the Earth can power this big country of \nours. There will be a gap between the renewable energy we want and the \nreliable, low-cost energy we must have.\n  Congressman Heath Shuler of North Carolina and I are co-chairs of the \nTennessee Valley Authority Congressional Caucus. We went to Knoxville \nlast week and held a very interesting forum on the renewable energy \noptions in the Tennessee Valley Authority area. One of the two big \nplants that make polysilicon, which is essential for solar, provided \ntestimony. We are very glad to see that in Tennessee. But each of those \nplants uses 120 megawatts of power. They will become almost immediately \nTVA's largest, or among their largest, customers. They need large \namounts of low-cost, reliable electricity to make solar panels. Today, \nof course, the kind of energy President Obama wants to use only \nproduces 1.5 percent of that needed by the United States. We need low-\ncost electricity for all jobs, not just green jobs.\n  Here is what we found that was promising--solar especially. I \nmentioned it cost a lot more today and that it takes up a whole large \narea. A nuclear powerplant might take up one square mile. The \nequivalent amount of solar power might take up 10 times that much area. \nBut nevertheless, our State and the Oak Ridge Laboratory and the \nUniversity of Tennessee are focused on doing our best to try to make \nsolar cost competitive, and we should redouble that effort in this \ncountry. We should be spending our money on energy research and \ndevelopment for that purpose.\n  For example, we heard about underwater river turbines. The Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission says there may be 30,000 megawatts of \nelectricity that could be produced by turbines in the Mississippi \nRiver. That would be pretty good, if it works, because the river runs \nall the time, unlike the Sun, which only produces energy when the Sun \nshines. Of course, you can't store energy from the Sun. People overlook \nthat sometimes. You have to use it when it happens. The wind often \nblows at night, when we don't need it. But the river runs all day \nlong--old man river does--and if it can produce that kind of energy, \nthat would be promising.\n  Biomass may help. The Southern Companies are building a plant that \nwould have about 100 megawatts. In our part of the world, a bad choice \nwould be wind turbines. We have one wind plant. The problem with it is, \nNo. 1, the wind doesn't blow, at least not enough to make much \nelectricity. It blows 18 percent of the time in the case of TVA's one \nwind farm--the only wind farm in the southeastern United States.\n  Second, much of that is at night, when TVA has about seven nuclear \npowerplants worth of electricity that is unused. So TVA is wasting, in \nmy opinion, $60 million on big wind turbines that it could be spending \non conservation, nuclear power, and pollution control equipment.\n  More than anything else, we do not want to see giant, 500-foot wind \nturbines on top of the most beautiful mountains, we believe--with all \nrespect to the Senator from New Mexico--the\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\nmost beautiful mountains at least in the eastern part of the United \nStates. Boone Pickens was asked if he was going to put wind turbines on \nhis ranch? He said: No, they are ugly. If they are too ugly for his \nranch then they are too ugly for the Great Smokey Mountains, and they \nare the wrong choice for us. Solar? Yes. Underwater turbines? Yes. \nBiomass? Yes. There may be others, but there are good choices and there \nare bad choices.\n  The bridge to the future for clean energy means this. While we do all \nwe can on research and development to find a way to make solar cost \ncompetitive, to find a way to create advanced biofuels, we are still \ngoing to need a lot of power. Based on what we saw in the TVA region, \nyou could start with conservation. We use 143 percent of the national \naverage, per person, of electricity in Tennessee. We waste a lot of \nelectricity. If we just used the national average, that would be the \nsame as four new nuclear plants, five coal plants the size of Bull Run \nand nine natural gas plants such as the ones TVA is building in \nJackson. So we start with conservation.\n  If we are talking about fuel, the simplest and easiest thing to do on \nEarth Day is to recognize we could electrify half of our cars and \ntrucks in America--that might take 20 years--but without building one \nsingle new powerplant, not one nuclear plant, not one coal plant, not \none windmill on a mountaintop. We don't have to do that because, in \nTVA's case, they have 6,000 or 7,000 megawatts of unused electricity at \nnight when we are all asleep and the factories are not working. So plug \nyour car in at night at cheaper rates, bring in a lot less oil from \noverseas, save billions of dollars. That would take care of us for the \nnext 20 years. That would be a smart decision to make on Earth Day.\n  But the other thing we need to do is recognize that, if we care about \nclean air, and especially if we are worried about global warming, as I \nam, that we have to take nuclear seriously. Nuclear plants in America \nproduce only 20 percent of our electricity but they produce 70 percent \nof our carbon-free, mercury-free, nitrogen-free, sulfur-free \nelectricity. Let me say that again. They are only 20 percent of our \nelectricity but they are 70 percent of our clean electricity. So in the \nTennessee region especially, we should not be wasting money on \nwindmills where the wind doesn't blow and it desecrates the \nenvironment. We should be spending money on making coal plants cleaner \nthrough pollution control. We know how to do that, except for carbon. \nWe should also build more nuclear plants and retire the dirtiest coal \nplants. That is the smart thing to do. And we should emphasize \nconservation.\n  My point today is simply this. I think all of us want to make sure we \nhave a stable energy future. A stable energy future means plenty of \nreliable, low-cost electricity so we can heat and cool our homes and \nkeep our jobs from going overseas. And we want to make sure it is \nclean. So our goals should be to produce more American energy, to make \nus more energy independent by electrifying our cars, to make coal \nclean, and to use wind and solar when it is appropriate to do that. But \nif we truly want to make a difference, we should build 100 new nuclear \npowerplants in the next 20 years, at least five or six a year, because \nthat is the best way to have clean air. That is the best way to have \nlow costs. And we should launch another mini-Manhattan Project and \nreserve a Nobel Prize for the scientist who can get rid of the carbon \nfrom existing coal plants, because coal provides half our energy. We \nknow what to do about nitrogen, mercury, and sulfur. But we have not \nfigured out what to do about carbon. If we did, India would also do it, \nChina would also do it, the rest of the world would do it, and we could \nhave low-cost energy.\n  I mention low cost because so often we talk about new forms of energy \nas if cost didn't matter. It matters to the executives who met with me \nyesterday from the TVA region. TVA's residential rates are low, \nrelatively. But the industrial rates are not. If they are too high, \nthose jobs move out of our region, maybe overseas. And last December \nthe people in Nashville, our capital city, did not think the \nresidential rates were so low because 10 percent of them said they were \nunable to pay their electric bill in December because it was too high.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  So on Earth Day my suggestion is that, as we celebrate the day, we \nshould ask what is our energy policy--Is it a national clean energy \npolicy? Is it a national renewable energy policy? Is it a national \nwindmill policy?--we should recognize there is a potentially dangerous \ngap between the renewable energy we want and the reliable low-cost \nenergy we must have, and between now and then we must build a strong \nbridge to a clean energy future.\n  We can agree on conservation, but during that time we will need 100 \nnew nuclear plants, we will need offshore drilling for oil, and fast, \nbecause we need the gas and we can't electrify all of our cars as \nquickly as we might like.\n  Earth Day is a day for celebration, but it is also a day for realism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4529-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for \nacknowledging Earth Day. All of us are conscious of the fact that, at \nleast over the last 30 years or so, we have begun to realize the \nimportance of our environment and the important responsibility we have \ntoward our environment. I am troubled by the fact that only a few weeks \nago on this very Senate floor as we debated the budget resolution, \namendment after amendment was offered to try to stop us from dealing \nwith the issue of global warming. I think it is a sad commentary that \nstill too many Senators of both political parties are looking for \nexcuses to do nothing. We give our speeches, we acknowledge to student \ngroups and others that we face a challenge. Yet when we have an \nopportunity, as we do in the Senate, to deal with that, too many of my \ncolleagues race away. We cannot do that any longer. We owe it to future \ngenerations to make important, albeit difficult, decisions which will \nlead us to the point where we are resolving the challenge of global \nwarming and climate change. These are realities. We owe nothing less to \nthe next generation but to come up with responsible approaches to \nthose.\n  The budget resolution debate of a few weeks ago was a discouraging \nchapter in this saga. I hope many of my colleagues will come to realize \nthat we must accept this responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4529-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4529-S4530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.S. POLICY TOWARD CUBA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last month during the vote on the omnibus \nbill we heard the beginnings of a discussion on the best way to \nencourage change in Cuba. Shortly thereafter several of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Dorgan, Lugar, Dodd, and Enzi spoke about their \nbill, the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which I am pleased to \ncosponsor.\n  And last week President Obama announced an easing of U.S. policy \ntoward Cuba--one that allows for, among other things, greater family \ntravel and unlimited remittances to the island. These wise steps begin \nto undo decades of counterproductive policy toward Cuba.\n  The President's similarly timed visits to Mexico and the Summit of \nthe Americas in Trinidad demonstrate a welcome and hopeful level of \nreengagement in the region--one in which we have many shared interests \nand challenges.\n  Yet the debate on U.S. policy toward Cuba raises many passions and \nheart felt concerns.\n  While all of us want to see a more open and democratic Cuba, the \nmeans to reach that goal are often vigorously debated.\n  I am under no illusions about the horrendous record of the Cuban \nregime regarding human rights and political freedom. The Castro \ngovernment has regularly jailed those who oppose its rule or want even \na semblance of political freedom. Many languish in inhuman conditions \nwithout trial or recourse.\n  According to the State Department's most recent Human Rights Report \non\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\nCuba, at least 205 political prisoners and detainees were in jail at \nthe end of 2008 and as many as 5,000 citizens, including 1,000 women, \nserved sentences this year without being charged with a specific crime.\n  Beatings and harassment of human rights activists and political \ndissidents by government-recruited mobs, police, and state security \nofficials remain commonplace. Journalists continue to be denied the \nright to openly criticize their government without fear of reprisal. \nAnd domestic human rights groups are not even recognized or permitted \nto legally function.\n  We all want this to change. It must change.\n  Yet for almost 50 years the United States has tried the same policy \nwith Cuba, one of isolation, and it has failed.\n  I wish that were not true, but it is.\n  I believe sanctions can be an important foreign policy tool. Their \nuse should be carefully considered on a case by case basis.\n  Yet after almost half a century of a failed isolation policy in terms \nof Cuba, don't we owe it to ourselves and the Cuban people to rethink \nthis issue?\n  I am not arguing that we lift all sanctions against Cuba. The regime \nmust begin to release its political prisoners and implement political \nreforms before we take any such steps.\n  The Cuban government must listen to the brave voices of its own \npeople such as Oswaldo Paya, who has collected thousands of signatures \nfor a petition given to the Cuban government requesting greater \npolitical freedoms--a petition process that is in fact allowed for \nunder the Cuban constitution.\n  But President Obama was right in beginning to change U.S. policy \ntoward Cuba.\n  Cuba is no longer a serious threat to the United States; we no longer \nneed to think in black or white Cold War terms. Since that time, we \nhave seen globalization, an unprecedented flow of information between \npeople in different countries, and the emergence of many new countries \nseeking democracy.\n  Why should the people of Cuba be held back from the benefits of this \nnew world? There is already limited use of the Internet and cell phones \non the island--but I bet if you ask the Cuban people, they would tell \nyou they want more access to these links to the outside world, not \nless. President Obama's policy of allowing telecommunications licensing \non the island should help foster such access to the outside world.\n  We should replace the Castro regime with an open, democratic Cuba the \nsame way we brought down the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union. We need \nto expand the contact of everyday Cubans with freedom, opportunity and \npeople whose lives are inspired by our values.\n  Isolation is not the answer. An invasion is the answer--but not a \nmilitary invasion; the invasion of openness and freedom and new ideas.\n  It is not a Pollyanna-ish position to argue this. My mother was born \nin Lithuania. Lithuania, a Baltic nation, was under suppression by the \nSoviet Union after World War II, isolated, cut off from the world as \nwas most of Eastern Europe. But then the day came when the conversation \nopened, when the doors opened, when the people of the Baltics and \nEastern Europe could see the Western world and realize how much their \nlives had been denied by totalitarian rule.\n  I think the same thing can happen in Cuba. We should not be closing \nthe doors to Cuba. We should throw them wide open. I had some friends \nwho recently went to Cuba, through Mexico, with a visa. They came back \nand said, ``You know, they are still using oxen for power in their \nagriculture.'' Yoking oxen, in the 21st century, 90 miles offshore from \nthe United States? If they knew and could see what modern agriculture \ncould bring to them, if they could understand what freedom meant, even \nmore, we would have a greater chance of bringing real change to Cuba.\n  Earlier this year, Congress eased travel restrictions. President \nObama has eased them further. The more Americans and Westerners move \ninto Cuba, the more they will bring ideas and commerce and opportunity \nand change to Cuba. Isolation for 50 years has failed. Why would we \ncling to a failed policy?\n  It is a poor country, a nation that struggles with natural disasters \nas well as poverty of its own creation and one that would be open to \nchange and opportunity.\n  I might also say that the embargo which we have imposed has hurt our \nchances to export food to Cuba, which is needed. We should open those \nopportunities in the hopes that commerce will not only feed people who \nare hungry but establish stronger relationships and a better \nunderstanding by the Cubans of what a free market economy could bring \nthem. The U.S. policy of isolation strengthens the Castro \ndictatorship. If at a time when we should be opening the doors by \nclosing them, we gave Castro, Fidel Castro, and his brother Raul \nexcuses for the misfortunes that people realize in Cuba, we have an \nopportunity to change those things, and I certainly hope that we do.\n\n  It was interesting to me when the President of the United States went \ndown for this Summit of the Americas, the biggest story that came out \nof it was the fact that he was not rude to Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, \nthat he actually shook his hand and took a book from him.\n  Some of the cold warriors that I hear on television, the commentators \njust cannot get over that. They cannot imagine that we would change a \nforeign policy that we have had over the Bush administration years, a \npolicy that sadly did not reach its intended goals of better \nrelationships and better respect around the world.\n  President Obama is opening negotiations and conversations with \ncountries around the world and creating an opportunity, an opportunity \nfor new freedom, an opportunity for new strength, and a new image of \nthe United States. It may trouble some of the cold warriors of years \ngone by who want confrontation and lack of communication, but that \ncertainly does not serve the needs of the 21st century.\n  I welcome this change that President Obama has brought to Washington. \nI welcome this opening of foreign policy in the hope that his approach \nand his image and status in the world will bring us to a safer place in \nthe 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet.) The Senate is in morning business \nwith 5 minutes remaining under the majority's control.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to compliment the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Illinois for what he just said. As he \nknows, of course, he was the earliest supporter of his then-colleague, \nthen-Senator Barack Obama, and he knows I also supported him very early \non.\n  I was asked why I supported then-Senator Obama, and I said because we \nhave to reintroduce America to the rest of the world. I believe we are \na great and wonderful nation. We are the Nation of the Marshall Plan, \nthe Peace Corps, the Nation that brought together a coalition to defeat \nthe fascists and the Nazis and others in World War II. We are a great \nnation. We discovered polio vaccines. We have done so much. The rest of \nthe world had lost sight of that. There is animosity toward our ``it is \nour way or no way'' approach. It is the ``we are right you are wrong'' \nattitude of this country and the reference to ``Old Europe'' and things \nlike this that were so dismissively done. Any of us who traveled around \nthe world realized how that was.\n  As a proud American, as one who believes we do live in the greatest \ndemocracy history has ever known, I wanted to reintroduce America, the \nAmerica I believe in, to the rest of the world. That is why I supported \nBarack Obama. That is why I was glad to see President Obama reintroduce \nus first in Europe and then in Latin America.\n  The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. It is all I hear in my \nState, a State that has a very strong sense of internationalism but a \nvery strong sense of patriotism: Thank goodness somebody is showing \nwhat America is.\n  I commend the President for doing that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4530-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4530-S4531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the majority \nleader for his persistence. I regret that the weeks we spent reaching \nacross the aisle for a time agreement on this bill were unavailing. The \nmajority leader was required to file cloture to get us to this point.\n  We are talking about going after people who defrauded American \ntaxpayers, and the sooner we can go after them, the better we all are. \nI commend Senators Grassley and Kaufman, Klobuchar, Dorgan, and Shaheen \nfor their statements to the Senate on Monday in support of this fraud \nenforcement bill. Their strong statements no doubt contributed to the \nreversal of the position that now allows us to proceed to what is a \nbipartisan fraud enforcement bill. In total, six Senators spoke in \nfavor of the bill on Monday and no one spoke against. Each of us who \nspoke on Monday is a cosponsor. The bipartisan group of 16 Senators who \nhave cosponsored this bill include, Senators Schumer, Murray, Bayh, \nSpecter, Snowe, Harkin, Levin, Whitehouse, Rockefeller, and Sanders.\n  On Monday, as the Senate debated the motion to proceed to the Leahy-\nGrassley fraud enforcement bill, the Obama administration issued a \nStatement of Administration Policy on the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the Statement of \nAdministration Policy printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. This statement begins:\n\n       The Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 386. \n     Its provisions would provide Federal investigators and \n     prosecutors with significant new criminal and civil tools and \n     resources that would assist in holding accountable those who \n     have committed financial fraud.\n\n  I thank the President and the administration for their strong \nsupport.\n  The statement continues:\n\n       [The] legislation would benefit U.S. taxpayers by both \n     addressing existing fraud and deterring waste, fraud and \n     abuse of public funds.\n\n  That is something we all should be in favor of. They went on to add \nthat it ``would provide needed resources to strained law enforcement \nagencies.'' Of course, pointing out what we all know, these additional \nresources will far more than pay for themselves through fines and \npenalties, restitution, damages, and forfeitures.\n  But there is more of a human thing in here. We have families losing \ntheir homes, defrauded, and losing their life savings. People are \ndefrauding them and getting away with it. I want to not only get the \npeople who did it, but I want to deter others from doing it in the \nfuture.\n  I said on Monday that the Justice Department and the FBI, the Secret \nService, the special inspector general for TARP, law enforcement \nofficers, and many good-government advocates supported the bill.\n  As we continue our debate, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my statement a number of editorials and \nnews articles favorable to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Just this weekend, the New York Times wrote that fraud \nenforcement must be one of our priorities as we rebuild our economy, \nnot only to hold accountable those who committed fraud and contributed \nto these hard times but to protect our efforts to stabilize the banking \nsystem and to jump-start the economy. They wrote:\n\n       While Washington is spending billions to shore up the \n     financial system, it is doing far too little to strengthen \n     the federal government's ability to investigate and prosecute \n     the sort of corporate and mortgage frauds that helped cause \n     the economic collapse.\n       Those efforts--never fully adequate--have suffered in \n     recent years as money and people were shifted from white-\n     collar fraud to anti-terrorist activities.\n\n  That is precisely what law enforcement officials from the Justice \nDepartment and the FBI and the special inspector general for the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program told us in their testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\n  As the Times wrote, referring to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct:\n\n       A bipartisan measure newly approved by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee and now coming before the full Senate would begin \n     to close the enforcement gap . . . and strengthen existing \n     federal fraud and money-laundering provisions, updating the \n     definition of ``financial institution'' in federal fraud \n     statutes to include largely unregulated mortgage businesses, \n     for example, and reversing flawed court decisions that have \n     undermined the effectiveness of the False Claims Act, one of \n     the most potent weapons against government fraud.\n       Like a similar enforcement buildup in response to the \n     savings and loan crises of the 1980s, this one will \n     contribute far more than it costs to the federal Treasury \n     through restitutions and asset recoveries. . . .Senators \n     should not be asking if the expenditure is affordable, but \n     whether it is enough.\n\n  Every prosecutor I have talked to says they need this. I am willing \nto bet that every person who has been defrauded by some of these \nunregulated mortgage companies would give anything to have had this on \nthe books and these people there 6 months or a year ago before they \nlost their life savings, before they lost their homes, their chance for \ntheir children to go to college, and before they lost the chance for \nretirement. But there are still millions of Americans at risk. Let's \nprotect them. Let's show that we are against such crime and that we \nwill provide the tools to stop it.\n  One of the things every prosecutor knows and learns is, if you ask \npeople if they are against crime, everybody is against crime. If you \nask legislative bodies: Are you willing to pass resolutions against \ncrime, of course they are. But then you ask the real question: Will you \ngive us the tools to fight crime? That is where everybody goes: Well, \nlet's see.\n  Here are the tools to fight crime.\n  This is something supported across the political spectrum. Look at \nthe Washington Times, a very conservative newspaper. They raised very \nsimilar concerns about the need to fight fraud and protect the \ntaxpayers' money being spent on the economic stimulus. In an editorial \non March 26 entitled ``Stimulus Spending Ripe for Fraud,'' the \nWashington Times called for fraud enforcement. In commenting on an \nEnergy Department official who was concerned with waste, fraud, and \nabuse in stimulus funding, they wrote:\n\n       The same attitude must be adopted by all agencies \n     overseeing the implementation of the massive spending \n     measure.\n\n  Well, they are right. They went on to say that simply having a Web \nsite to provide greater transparency, while a good thing, is not \nenough. They said:\n\n       [E]ven an unprecedented level of post-spending transparency \n     will do only so much to ensure waste is kept to a minimum. . \n     . . It will take more than a new Web site and the sort of \n     staff training the administration has implemented to turn an \n     understanding of the problem into real accountability. . . .\n\n  The administration is, in fact, doing more than creating the most \ntransparent Government in history. They are supporting this bill and \nits aggressive response to fraud enforcement. The bill will actually \ntranslate rhetoric into reality, a reality that can save billions. It \nis just the kind of action these editorials from the right to the left \nhave asked for.\n  Look at a front page article of March 12, entitled ``Financial Fraud \nIs the Focus of Prosecutors.'' The New York Times reported that fraud \nwas surging, particularly mortgage fraud cases.\n  It is very interesting. We talk about tough enforcement. The chairman \nof the House Banking Committee said, ``Rules don't work if people have \nno fear of them.'' Anybody in law enforcement can tell us that. Every \nState has laws against burglary, for example. But put two warehouses on \nthe same street, one with a rusty lock on the door and no alarm system, \nno lights, one with a state-of-the-art alarm system, lights, the \nability to call police immediately, and which one gets broken into? The \nlaw is the same. You are going to break into the one that is easy. You \ncan have all the laws in the world on mortgage fraud, and if people \nthink they are not going to be enforced, they are going to break those \nlaws. If you believe the worst that will happen is you might get a \nfine, if you have a $100 million fraud operation going and you might \nget a $5 million fine, gee-whiz, that is the cost of doing business. If \nyou find out, however, that you might go to prison, that in all \nlikelihood you will go to prison as well as losing the money you \ndefrauded from people and allow that money to go back to them, then you \nare going to think twice.\n  Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Assets \nRelief Program, issued a 250-page report warning yet again that the \nbank bailout funds are particularly vulnerable to fraud. He talked \nabout protecting American taxpayers. He testified about similar \nconcerns when he appeared before the Judiciary Committee in support of \nthe bill.\n  Strengthening fraud enforcement is a key priority for the President. \nDuring the campaign, President Obama promised to ``crack down on \nmortgage fraud professionals found guilty of fraud by increasing \nenforcement [but also] creating new criminal penalties.'' The \nPresident, in his budget to Congress, called for additional FBI agents \n``to investigate mortgage fraud and white collar crime,'' as well as \nhiring more Federal prosecutors and civil attorneys ``to protect \ninvestors, the market, and the Federal Government's investment of \nresources in the financial crisis, and the American public.'' \nAdditional money was included in the initial recovery package for the \nFBI, but it was cut out during negotiations that led to its passage. \nThis bill is our chance to authorize the necessary resources.\n  I can't state enough, it is not enough to have a law on the books \nthat says: Thou shalt not commit crime. It works only if people think \nthey are going to get caught and they are going to lose the money they \nhave stolen and they are going to go to jail on top of that. As long as \npeople carrying out these frauds and these scams think they will never \nget caught, will never get prosecuted, the laws aren't tough enough, \nthey are in an unregulated industry, nobody is going to go after them, \nwhy not keep trying. The worst that could happen is somewhere along the \nline you might have to give a little bit of the money back and keep \nscamming people, keep ruining people's lives, keep taking people's \nhomes away from them, keep taking people's retirement accounts, keep \ntaking the money they have saved for their kids to go to college. If \nall you think you might get is a little slap on the wrist or in all \nlikelihood you will get away with it completely, what is to stop you?\n  Obviously not a sense of morality, as we saw with Bernie Madoff and \nothers. We have to have laws to stop them. We have to have enforcement \nof the laws. We have to have people go to prison for stealing \nretirement accounts and stealing children's money being saved for \ncollege and stealing homes through mortgages scams. We should pass \nthis.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania in the Chamber. He \nis a man with a distinguished career, first as a prosecutor before he \ncame here and now a man who has been both chairman and ranking member \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. He understands this.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n           S. 386--FRAUD ENFORCEMENT AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2009\n\n        (Sen. Leahy (D) Vermont and 4 cosponsors, Apr. 20, 2009)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 386. \n     Its provisions would provide Federal investigators and \n     prosecutors with significant new criminal and civil tools and \n     resources that would assist in holding accountable those who \n     have committed financial fraud.\n       Specifically, the legislative enhancements would help the \n     Department of Justice to combat mortgage fraud, securities \n     and commodities fraud, money laundering and related offenses, \n     and to protect taxpayer money that has been expended on \n     recent economic stimulus and rescue packages. Further, the \n     legislation would amend the False Claims Act (FCA) in several \n     important respects so that the FCA remains a potent and \n     useful weapon against the misuse of taxpayer funds. In \n     general, this legislation would benefit U.S. taxpayers by \n     both addressing existing fraud and deterring waste, fraud, \n     and abuse of public funds. Moreover, S. 386 would provide \n     needed resources to strained law enforcement agencies and \n     prosecutors that would enable the Department and its partners \n     to advance the pace and reach of the enforcement response to \n     the current economic crisis. These additional resources will \n     provide a return on investment through additional fines, \n     penalties, restitution, damages, and forfeitures. With the \n     tools and resources that S. 386 provides, the Department of \n     Justice and others would be better equipped to address the \n     challenges that face this Nation in difficult economic times \n     and to do their part to help the Nation respond to this \n     challenge.\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 18, 2009]\n\n                              Fraud Factor\n\n       While Washington is spending billions to shore up the \n     financial system, it is doing far too little to strengthen \n     the federal government's ability to investigate and prosecute \n     the sort of corporate and mortgage frauds that helped cause \n     the economic collapse.\n       Those efforts--never fully adequate--have suffered in \n     recent years as money and people were shifted from white-\n     collar fraud to anti-terrorist activities. Over time, the \n     ranks of fraud investigators and prosecutors were \n     dramatically thinned, leaving the F.B.I. and the larger \n     Justice Department ill prepared to keep pace with a \n     skyrocketing number of serious fraud allegations. Now they \n     are ill equipped to police the vast infusion of federal money \n     into the economy.\n       A bipartisan measure newly approved by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee and now coming before the full Senate would begin \n     to close the enforcement gap.\n       Sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Edward \n     Kaufman of Delaware, both Democrats, and Senator Charles \n     Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the Fraud Enforcement and \n     Recovery Act of 2009 would significantly expand the number of \n     prosecutors, agents and analysts devoted to pursuing \n     financial crimes.\n       It would strengthen existing federal fraud and money-\n     laundering provisions, updating the definition of ``financial \n     institution'' in federal fraud statutes to include largely \n     unregulated mortgage businesses, for example, and reversing \n     flawed court decisions that have undermined the effectiveness \n     of the False Claims Act, one of the most potent weapons \n     against government fraud.\n       The measure envisions spending $490 million over the next \n     two fiscal years. Like a similar enforcement buildup in \n     response to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, this \n     one will contribute far more than it costs to the federal \n     Treasury through restitutions and asset recoveries, according \n     to the Congressional Budget Office forecast. Senators should \n     not be asking if the expenditure is affordable, but whether \n     it is enough.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 26, 2009]\n\n                Stimulus Spending Remains Ripe for Fraud\n\n       The many billions shoveled to the Energy Department as part \n     of the $787 billion stimulus package recently signed into law \n     may provide a cautionary tale about potential abuse, judging \n     from a recent Energy Inspector General's warning.\n       As if on cue, FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress \n     yesterday that he, too, expects a surge in stimulus-related \n     fraud. ``Our expectation is that economic crimes will \n     continue to skyrocket,'' he said. ``. . . The unprecedented \n     level of financial resources committed by the federal \n     government . . . will lead to an inevitable increase in \n     economic crime and public corruption cases.''\n       Undaunted, President Obama earlier this week continued his \n     intense promotion of the stimulus package, ignoring the great \n     potential for significant fraud as federal agencies rush to \n     dispense the money. He hyped the $59 billion for clean energy \n     and related tax incentives in the stimulus bill as a down \n     payment on an additional $150 billion in Energy Department \n     spending in his 2010 budget. He didn't seem to get the recent \n     warnings from Energy Inspector General Gregory Friedman about \n     the high probability for fraud and waste in distributing \n     stimulus dollars, which call into question the agency's \n     ability to even distribute the stimulus money effectively.\n       Most importantly, Friedman, a Clinton-era appointee, \n     highlighted the need for a level of proactive accountability \n     historically absent in the federal bureaucracy. As reported \n     by Congress Daily, Friedman's memo last week to Energy \n     Secretary Steven Chu and other department officials argues \n     that the massive increase in funding going through the agency \n     will strain and fundamentally change the agency's mission \n     while creating the potential for rampant abuse. The stimulus \n     provides the agency over $38 billion in funding along with \n     authority over energy loans totaling $127 billion, spending \n     that dwarfs the $27 billion provided in the agency's 2009 \n     budget.\n       Friedman reportedly notes that during regular agency \n     operations misuse of funds, falsification of data, kickbacks, \n     bribes and other forms of fraud happen with ``troubling'' \n     frequency. He also argues, correctly, that anti-corruption \n     oversight should be a priority. Friedman's laudable honesty \n     exposes both the unintended consequences inherent in the \n     quickly passed package and the daunting task faced.\n       The same attitude must be adopted by all agencies \n     overseeing the implementation of the massive spending \n     measure. What is true, or likely, at Energy is very likely \n     true or likely at other departments and agencies as well. \n     Exhibit ``A'' is the continued lax oversight and lack of \n     transparency seen with the Treasury Department's handing of \n     the banking industry bailout. The White House is yet to be \n     convincing that it is adequately addressing the potential of \n     a major waste of taxpayer funds.\n       Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board chairman \n     Earl Devaney, who is functionally the chief auditor of the \n     stimulus package, told a House panel last week that some \n     fraud is inevitable. But he also expressed horror that \n     accounting industry standards for fraud acceptability is 7 \n     percent, or $55 billion in taxpayer money. Devaney, who \n     has a reputation for vigilance, promised a zero tolerance \n     approach. That is very good to hear.\n       With over 40 states launching websites intended to track \n     stimulus spending, Devaney's board will oversee the Web site \n     Recovery.gov, aimed at maintaining public access to the Fed's \n     spending records. The board aims to change the fact that the \n     federal government has never been particularly successful in \n     the timely and reliable tracking of spending data.\n       But even an unprecedented level of post-spending \n     transparency will only do so much to ensure waste is kept to \n     a minimum. Perusing the data online only comes after the \n     fact. It will take more than a new Web site and the sort of \n     staff training the administration has implemented to turn an \n     understanding of the problem into real accountability.\n       While some degree of waste is almost inevitable from any \n     government endeavor, the degree must not reach the level of \n     finding 7 percent fraud--$55 billion in the case of the \n     entire package--an acceptable figure. The White House is \n     saying the right thing by indicating zero is the goal, not \n     $55 billion. We can only hope their rhetoric translates into \n     additional action that defies history and saves billions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 12, 2009]\n\n           Financial Fraud Is Focus of Attack by Prosecutors\n\n                            (By David Segal)\n\n       Spurred by rising public anger, federal and state \n     investigators are preparing for a surge of prosecutions of \n     financial fraud.\n       Across the country, attorneys general have already begun \n     indicting dozens of loan processors, mortgage brokers and \n     bank officers. Last week alone, there were guilty pleas in \n     Minnesota, Delaware, North Carolina and Connecticut and \n     sentences in Florida and Vermont--all stemming from home loan \n     scams.\n       With the Obama administration focused on stabilizing the \n     banks and restoring confidence in the stock market, it has \n     said little about federal civil or criminal charges. But its \n     proposed budget contains hints that it will add to this \n     weight of litigation, including money for more F.B.I. agents \n     to investigate mortgage fraud and white-collar crime, and a \n     13 percent raise for the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n       Officials at the Justice Department have not said much in \n     public about their plans. But people who have met with \n     Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. say he is weighing a \n     range of strategies.\n       ``It's clear that he and other top-level members of the \n     Obama administration want to seize the opportunity to send a \n     message of zero tolerance for mortgage fraud,'' said \n     Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who \n     attended a meeting with Mr. Holder and other state attorneys \n     general last week in Washington. ``The only question is when \n     and how they will do it.''\n       One person who had discussed the matter with Mr. Holder, \n     but declined to be identified because he was not authorized \n     to speak for the Justice Department, said that the attorney \n     general was deciding whether to form a task force to \n     centralize the effort or allow state attorneys general to \n     develop cases on their own.\n       A Justice Department spokesman, Matthew A. Miller, would \n     not comment, other than to write by e-mail, ``It will be a \n     top priority of the Justice Department to hold accountable \n     executives who have engaged in fraudulent activities.''\n       At the low end of the mortgage transaction ladder, state \n     prosecutors have had a relatively easy time prevailing, but \n     recent history suggests that the government's odds of winning \n     drop when they go after Wall Street executives. Some high-\n     profile convictions have been won in the last decade, but \n     several of the Enron-related prosecutions and some cases \n     brought by Eliot Spitzer when he was New York's attorney \n     general fell apart or were overturned on appeal.\n       As federal authorities decide on a course of action, \n     Congress is becoming impatient. Representative Barney Frank, \n     chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, announced \n     plans last week for a hearing on March 20, inviting Mr. \n     Holder, bank regulators and leaders of the S.E.C. to answer \n     questions about their enforcement plans.\n       ``Rules don't work if people have no fear of them,'' Mr. \n     Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said. State and local \n     prosecutors, it seems, do not need the nudge. Last week, the \n     district attorney's office in Brooklyn announced the creation \n     of a real estate fraud unit, with 12 employees and a mandate \n     to ``address the recent flood of mortgage fraud cases \n     plaguing New Yorkers.'' In late February, Maryland unveiled a \n     mortgage fraud task force, bringing together 17 agencies to \n     streamline investigations.\n       With all the state activity and portents of a new resolve \n     at the federal level, lawyers who defend white-collar clients \n     sense growing momentum to perp walk and prosecute executives \n     involved in the mortgage crisis.\n       ``It's going to be open season,'' says Daniel M. \n     Petrocelli, a lawyer whose clients include Jeffrey K. \n     Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron. ``You'll see a \n     lot of indictments down the road, and you'll see a lot of \n     prosecutions that rely on vague theories of `deprivation of \n     honest services.' ''\n       Many financial executives have hired lawyers in the last \n     few months, either through\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\n     internal counsels or, more discreetly, on their own, several \n     lawyers who defend white-collar clients said.\n       While assorted Wall Street executives have been prosecuted \n     over the years, any concerted legal attack on the financial \n     sector would have little precedent. After the Depression, \n     Congress formed what became known as the Pecora Commission, \n     which grilled top financiers. But the point was mostly to \n     embarrass them, and the upshot was to set the stage for \n     stricter regulations. The most indelible image of the \n     commission's hearings was a photo of J.P. Morgan Jr. with a \n     midget who had been plopped in his lap by an opportunistic \n     publicist.\n       The question behind any cases brought against Wall Street \n     will boil down to this: Was the worst economic crisis in \n     decades caused by law-breaking or some terrible, but \n     noncriminal, mix of greed, naivete and blunders? The \n     challenge for the Obama administration will be to prove that \n     it was the former, said Michael F. Buchanan, a partner at \n     Jenner & Block and a former United States attorney in New \n     Jersey.\n       ``We punish people for intentional misconduct, we don't \n     punish them for stupidity or innocent mistakes,'' he said. \n     ``If you're a prosecutor, you want evidence that shows real \n     dishonesty. You want something that shows that these people \n     were doing something wrong, and they knew it.''\n       That nearly all of the banking industry acted the same, \n     possibly reckless, way could actually help any executive who \n     lands in court, lawyers said. The herdlike behavior suggested \n     that bankers were competing for business using widely shared \n     assumptions, rather than trying to get away with a crime. It \n     would be hard to prove that anyone broke the rules, these \n     lawyers said, since regulations in the riskiest parts of the \n     mortgage industry were so lax.\n       One defense lawyer said he expected to argue that either \n     his clients did not understand the financial instruments they \n     were marketing, or were not warned of the dangers by \n     underlings.\n       ``We'll all sing the stupidity song,'' said the lawyer, who \n     said he feared that speaking publicly by name would deter \n     potential clients. ``We'll all sing the `These guys never \n     told me' song.''\n       But for government lawyers, the environment for corporate \n     fraud cases could scarcely be more inviting. It is not just \n     that the public's zeal for Wall Street pelts is high. The \n     resources are there, too, because some of the money once used \n     to fight terrorism is being shifted to fighting financial \n     fraud. And in recent years the use of wire fraud statutes has \n     expanded, allowing prosecutors to turn virtually anything \n     said or sent by e-mail in private into a federal crime, if it \n     contradicts what investors were told in public disclosures.\n       Wire fraud charges were among those against two former Bear \n     Stearns managers who were arrested in June, accused of \n     praising their hedge fund to clients as they worried about it \n     to colleagues. Federal sentencing guidelines also link the \n     length of a prison term to the size of the financial loss to \n     the public. Given that so many billions have vaporized \n     recently, convictions could easily lead to life sentences, \n     defense lawyers said, and the mere threat of such sentences \n     gives prosecutors enormous leverage in settlement talks.\n       ``There are executives now getting sentences longer than \n     murderers and rapists,'' said Mr. Petrocelli, the lawyer, \n     referring to white-collar prosecutions in recent years, \n     including that of Mr. Skilling of Enron, who is now serving a \n     24-year sentence for securities fraud and other crimes.\n       Why has there not been a batch of subpoenas at the federal \n     level already? The Department of Justice is missing important \n     staff members, says Reid H. Weingarten, a defense lawyer and \n     former trial lawyer for the Justice Department. Former \n     members of the Justice Department say that prosecutors and \n     regulators are reluctant to act while the markets are in such \n     disarray for fear of further unnerving investors and the \n     public.\n       Lawyers for white-collar clients say they expect to be \n     busy, but not all of them predict that means they will be \n     earning huge fees. In the past, the legal bills of Wall \n     Street higher-ups were paid by insurers that indemnified \n     them. But that is not necessarily the case with banks that \n     have gone bankrupt or disappeared.\n       ``I know bankers are not now evoking much sympathy from the \n     public at large,'' Mr. Weingarten said. ``But these days many \n     Wall Street types are struggling mightily with mortgage \n     payments, tuition bills and health insurance. It's a very \n     different world out there now.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act, the legislation which is currently \non the floor. Before the distinguished chairman leaves the Chamber, if \nI could have his attention, I agree with him about the importance of \nhaving strong law enforcement on crimes involving business fraud and on \nwhite-collar crimes. We are dealing with a financial situation where \nthere are billions of dollars at stake, if not trillions. It is hard to \nknow exactly how many zeros to add on. We are faced with a very \ndesperate--strong word but understated if anything--challenge as to \nwhat to do with the economy worldwide. We had a $700 billion program \nproposed by President Bush for companies in trouble and a twin brother \nproposed by President Obama, $787 billion.\n  As I travel through my State, all I hear are questions. I don't hear \nany commendations. The Congress is not exactly held in high esteem. And \nthe questions are: Why are we bailing out companies which made bad \nbusiness judgments? If somebody makes a bad business judgment, why \nshouldn't they sustain the loss instead of coming to the taxpayers for \na bailout?\n\n  You have these fancy Wall Street instruments. What is a derivative? \nThen there is the explanation about how no longer do you have mortgages \nwith simply a home buyer and a banker, but you have all of these \ncommercial papers lumped together and securitized. I do not know how \nlong the word ``securitized'' has been in the dictionary. In fact, I am \nnot sure it is in the dictionary, and most Americans are trying to find \nout what it means.\n  You slice them up, and they are securitized, and they are sold around \nthe world. Much of the time, they are filled with misrepresentations to \nthe extent that they become fraud. Fraud is a crime, and you have \nprosecutions which are brought which involve extraordinary sums of \nmoney, and then there is a fine which looks big in the newspapers but \nnot when compared to what has been involved. It is a license to do \nbusiness or, perhaps more accurately, a license to steal. But if you \nhave criminal prosecutions and you have jail sentences, that is \nmeaningful.\n  Mr. President, may I direct a question to the distinguished chairman.\n  I say to the Senator, I believe you were a prosecuting attorney in \nVermont. What experience did the Senator have on the difference between \na fine and a tough jail sentence?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, Mr. President, I suspect my experience is probably \nsimilar to that of the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. Fines, \nespecially in these commercial fraud type things, were seen as the cost \nof doing business. If you steal $100 million, and you get a $5 million \nfine, then you stole $95 million. But if they think they are going to \ngo to prison, that is when they think twice. We saw this after Enron \nand other things that when people actually believe they are going to go \nto prison, then they start thinking twice.\n  I am sure this was the experience the Senator from Pennsylvania had. \nIt is the experience I had. Nothing focuses the attention of somebody \nwho is going to want to defraud someone if they think they are going to \nspend years in a tiny cell. That focuses their attention, and suddenly \nit is not worth the effort. That is what we want to do here because the \npeople who are being defrauded are the most defenseless. They are the \npeople who have lost their retirement. They are the people who have \nlost their homes. They are the people who have lost the ability to pay \nfor their kids to go to college.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely right.\n  (Mrs. GILLIBRAND assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, may the Record show the Presiding \nOfficer has changed while I was looking at Senator Leahy. I concur with \nwhat Prosecutor Leahy said. It bears out the experience I had when I \nwas a prosecuting attorney myself: that jail sentences are important in \nthe way to deal with this kind of crime.\n  When I have been questioned by my constituents on my travels through \nPennsylvania about who is going to be held accountable, and I tell them \nthat the prospects for jail sentences are real, they are somewhat \nassuaged.\n  Madam President, I note the distinguished Republican leader has come \nto the floor. If I may have his attention and make an inquiry. If he \ncares to take precedence--he is busier than I am, although I am very \nbusy--I would be glad to yield to Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I was not seeking the floor. I was \ngoing to talk to the Senator from Pennsylvania when he finishes his \nremarks. So I am not seeking recognition.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, I thank Senator McConnell for those comments.\n  The statute which is on the floor--the bill which is on the floor, \nproposed statute--is a very important legislative\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\npiece. It will strengthen law enforcement being directed against \nprecisely the kinds of white-collar crime we are talking about.\n  The bill authorizes $165 million a year for hiring fraud prosecutors \nin the Department of Justice, including $75 million for the FBI to \nbring on 190 additional special agents and more than 200 professional \nstaff. The bill includes $50 million a year for the U.S. Attorneys' \nOffices to staff those strike forces. The bill authorizes $80 million a \nyear over the next 2 years for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the \nInspector General, the Secret Service, and the office of Housing and \nUrban Development.\n  It amends the definition of ``financial institution'' to extend \nFederal fraud laws to mortgage lending businesses that are not directly \nregulated or insured by the Federal Government. These companies were \nresponsible for nearly half of the residential mortgage market before \nthe economic collapse, yet they remain today largely unregulated and \noutside the scope of traditional Federal fraud statutes. This bill will \ncorrect that.\n  It amends the major fraud statute to protect funds expended under \nTARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and the economic stimulus \npackage. So we are providing criminal sanctions for the people who are \ngoing to misuse the moneys which have been appropriated in the past \nyear.\n  It amends the Federal securities crime statute to cover fraud schemes \ninvolving commodities futures and options, including derivatives \ninvolving the mortgage-backed securities that caused such damage to our \nbanking system.\n  It also amends the Federal money laundering statutes to cover not \nonly profits but proceeds. The Supreme Court interpreted the statutes \nso narrowly that it needs modification. And there were also judicial \ninterpretations of the False Claims Act which this legislation will \ncorrect.\n  So this is a very important bill. That is a very short statement of \nthe bill and its purpose. It is my hope anyone who has amendments would \ncome to the floor to offer them. I believe this is a bill which will \nget very widespread support in the Senate. We have a great many \nimportant legislative matters behind it, so it would be my hope we \ncould move this bill through expeditiously, giving people an \nopportunity to offer amendments if they have some. We would be looking \nfor a time agreement as soon as we could construct one. So I urge my \ncolleagues to come to the floor to help on this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I want to say, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is someone who, when I was growing up in Philadelphia, was \nthe district attorney there and known to be a tough and good \nprosecutor. So having Senator Specter speak to this bill says a lot \nabout the bill and about the underpinnings of it.\n  I want to make a few comments. This bill is important. The American \npeople are upset and outraged with the abuses that have rocked the \nfinancial sector, and which has especially put so many Americans into \ndire financial straits.\n  It is a good bill, plain and simple. I wish to run through some of \nthe reasons why I think this bill is important and why I think it is \none of the easiest votes a Member will make in this session of the \nCongress.\n  First, this bill is a critical step to restoring investor confidence \nin the financial markets by assuring the public that criminal behavior \nby unscrupulous mortgage brokers and corrupt financiers will be \nprosecuted and punished.\n  When I travel around and talk to people, they feel no one is paying a \nprice for this--except the hard-working people out around America who \nhave been hit so hard by this financial crisis. They do not feel as \nthough the people on Wall Street, the people who did this, the people \ninvolved and the mortgage brokers are paying a price. Therefore, very \nimportantly, they do not feel it is time to get back into the markets. \nThey are concerned the markets are not fair and the markets are not on \nthe up and up.\n  So what we are going to do with this legislation is assure the public \nthat criminal behavior by unscrupulous mortgage brokers and corrupt \nfinanciers will be prosecuted and punished.\n  Second, this bill is a deterrent. Prosecuting white-collar crime \ntoday sends a message to those who would be tempted to cheat and \ndefraud again. I do not want to be a party to the fact that 5, 10, 15, \n20 years from now people will be ready to make a financial deal and \nsomeone will say: This is breaking the law. We are doing something here \nthat is against the law. And someone else will say: Well, they did that \nback in 2007, 2008, 2009, and no one ever was prosecuted for it. These \nare very complicated financial dealings. If we do this, we are going to \nbe just fine because, remember, nobody went to jail for what happened. \nFrankly, if we do not add more FBI agents, more prosecutors, and more \nfinancial training, that is exactly what could happen.\n  Third, this bill rebalances law enforcement resources. If you go back \nto September 11, many Federal agents were rightly redeployed from \ncriminal work to counterterrorism. Counterterrorism was the key thing. \nWe had to do something about this. We had to find the people who \nperpetrated 9/11. We had to find the people who could think about doing \nus harm in the future. So, rightfully, we moved FBI agents away from \nfinancial fraud and on to counterterrorism. But the problem is, we \nnever replaced those agents.\n  In 2008, we had less financial fraud cases brought than we had in \n2001. It is incredible to believe that in this environment we had less \ncriminal cases brought in 2008 than in 2001. So what we have to do is \nrebalance law enforcement resources. That is what this bill does. It \nallows us to get more Federal agents, more prosecutors, and more \ntraining back to where it was before.\n  We have about 240 FBI agents now working on financial fraud. At the \nheight of the savings and loan crisis, we had over 1,000. So we want to \nget back to that level. We want to get the FBI agents back, get them \nthe training they need, and get the prosecutors and the training they \nneed. So this is a wonderful way to rebalance law enforcement \nresources.\n  Fourth, this bill helps ensure that sophisticated criminals cannot \ncover their tracks and escape liability. Unless we get more agents \nworking on these cases soon, the trails may go cold.\n  I know many people in America watch ``Law & Order.'' They know if you \ndo not catch a criminal usually within the first 24 hours, it is very \ndifficult to ever catch them. I think in this case that is what is \ngoing on here. This is one of the reasons why we have to pass this \nbill, and pass this bill soon. Because when you have these complicated \nfinancial cases, the sooner you get to the case--before people can \ncover their tracks, before people can go back and clean up what they \nhave done--the better. We need the FBI agents on the job gathering the \ndata and gathering the information.\n  Another point is, this bill modernizes several areas of Federal fraud \nlaw. Among other things, it updates the definition of ``financial \ninstitution'' to cover mortgage lending businesses that are not \ndirectly regulated or insured by the Federal Government.\n  Remember, much of the things that went on, much of our problem had to \ndo with the mortgage lending business. The fact is, people went out and \nsearched for and had people take out mortgages, many of whom were not \nqualified to have the mortgages; then they bundled up the mortgages and \nsecuritized them and then went off and sold them. In this area, there \nis enough anecdotal evidence to indicate there was some kind of fraud \ngoing on with this.\n\n  What this bill does is it makes financial fraud--it moves the \nmortgage lending businesses under the definition of ``financial \ninstitution'' so we can go after these folks.\n  Sixth, this bill is money well spent. Taxpayers have paid billions \nfor bailouts. We should spend the millions it would take to find and \nprosecute all those who should be in jail. Again, taxpayers have paid \nbillions in bailouts. No American whom I talk to--no American in my \nhome State of Delaware--can understand why we would not spend the money \nwe need to spend to prosecute these people for the crimes they have \ncommitted. It sends the wrong signal to the American people if, in \nfact, we do not get these folks\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\nand if we do not take the money and prosecute all those who were \ninvolved in this financial fraud.\n  Next, this bill is an investment. This is easy. As I said, this is \nthe easiest vote anyone will cast in this session of Congress. History \ntells us funds spent on fraud enforcement net money for the Government \nat a rate of $15 recovered for every dollar spent. I have heard from \nsome people concerned about spending this money. I think I have gone \nthrough the points on why we should spend the money, but if you are \nfiscally and financially conservative and if you basically believe \nthere is nothing the Federal Government should spend money on, there is \none thing that even you will agree with, and that is spending $1 to get \nback $15. That is the most fiscally conservative program that has ever \nbeen invented in the history of the Federal Government. We have a \nprogram where we will have to spend some money, but we know we are \ngoing to get the money back but many times over.\n  Finally, and I think most importantly, this bill will make it clear \nto all Americans that we hold Wall Street to the same standards as Main \nStreet. We have to have people believe--it is essential to our system--\nthat if you break the law, you will suffer the consequences. Keep in \nmind that many banks and mortgage brokers avoided the subprime market \nand acted responsibly. Respect for the rule of law demands that we \nidentify, investigate, and punish those who self-dealt millions of \ndollars to line their own pockets while leaving investors in the dark. \nHowever, we have to be careful about whom we are trying and whom we are \nprosecuting. This is not a witch hunt. We are not out to get everybody \nand nail everybody in this business, but we need the FBI agents and the \nprosecutors to make sure we get the right people and that they are \nprosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  I think the American people--I know the American people--are looking \nfor swift action to restore faith in our financial markets and the rule \nof law. This bill is a great opportunity to do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 6 minutes for the purpose of introducing a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaufman pertaining to the introduction of S. 853 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               Earth Day\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, in honor of Earth Day, I want to \nshare with you some of the experiences I had this week when I was in \nNew York. I met with a number of students from the New York Harbor \nSchool. Robert Kennedy, Jr., joined me. We were celebrating the \nachievements and efforts this school has made to make a difference for \nour future. The school is focusing on teaching the next generation \nabout the environment and offering an environmental education so that \nwe can create the stewards of our air and water into the next \ngeneration.\n  I was pleased to stand with Bobby Kennedy and these outstanding young \npeople to discuss the importance of progressive environmental policy. I \nwill partner with them and be a strong advocate for a greener New York \nand country.\n  What was so exciting about these children is that they were telling \nme about the work they were doing to ensure a cleaner Hudson River, \nwhat they were doing to make sure we can have a cleaner environment and \nair. Their curiosity was extremely compelling and inspiring. We talked \nabout how the work they were doing would allow for their communities to \nbe safer, to be able to have a clean Hudson River so they can eat fish \nout of it someday, and to have air that is cleaner. They really did \nunderstand the relationship between the communities around them and \nwhat they could do to have an impact in the future.\n  I met with Murray Fisher, the founder of the New York Harbor School. \nI met with him in Washington, and then I talked with him and his \nstudents in New York. The Harbor School brings innovative environmental \nand maritime-focused learning to the Bushwick neighborhood of \nBrooklyn--taking graduation rates from 20 percent, before their program \nbegan, to 75 percent this year. The student body of the school \nrepresents the most at-risk young people--80 percent come from \nhouseholds that are actually under the poverty line.\n  The skills these children have been learning--measuring water quality \nand studying aquaculture--will enable them to be part of a green \nfuture, part of the energy revolution. It was inspiring not only to see \nyoung people so engaged and enthusiastic about environmental education \nbut realizing in speaking with them that they now understand what it \ntakes to have a cleaner New York and the impact it can have in their \nown lives. I asked a young girl what she hoped to do when she \ngraduated. She said she wants to be a marine biologist. I asked a young \nman if this is something he thought could make a difference. He said: I \nthink so because it can change the quality of water and air that we \nhave. They see a future for themselves to be the stewards of our \nenvironment.\n  Too often, the young people of low-income New York neighborhoods live \nwith the risks of polluted environments. There are many brownfields \nsites across New York City, and the majority are located within the \nlow-income people-of-color communities. Brownfields are clustered in \nthese communities due to a history of industrial use, illegal dumping, \nor improper storage and handling of commercial products. These \nincidents have led to health hazards that further diminish the limited \nopportunities afforded many New Yorkers. For example, in the Bronx, we \nhave the Nation's leading rate of asthma. In the Bronx neighborhood of \nHunts Point, for example, we have one in four elementary children who \nsuffers from asthma. I have been to the Bronx and to the community \nhealth center there, and I have met with parents. They do worry because \nthe air quality is poor, and they have this historical environmental \ndegradation.\n  We need to do better by our communities and make sure every child in \nAmerica has a chance to achieve his or her God-given potential. That \nmeans having clean air to breathe, safe water to drink, and a community \nthat is healthy.\n  When we bring our environmental education into our schools, such as \nthe Harbor School, we are teaching children that they can have an \nimpact on their environment and that it actually creates opportunities \nfor them.\n  The current economic challenges we face in New York and around the \ncountry are significant, but the programs that are offered by the New \nYork Harbor School can really make a difference. Unfortunately, many of \nthese programs are in jeopardy due to budget cuts, and schools are \nbeing forced to scale back environmental education. No Child Left \nInside, introduced by Senator Jack Reed this week, would provide for \nenvironmental education in schools; it would provide the critical \nfunding that is necessary to ensure our children receive the kinds of \nhands-on education that connects them with the environment and prepares \nthem for our future.\n  Despite all of the economic challenges our country is facing, we must \nnot lose our focus on the important investments that are required to \nassure New York's and our Nation's leadership in the years to come. The \nenvironmental problems that many of our communities face are also \nopportunities for the young people of the Harbor\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\nSchool to be the problem-solvers of the future and to be able to make a \ndifference in their own communities.\n  Bobby Kennedy recognized early on that State and Federal \nenvironmental legislation cannot only be positive for air, land, and \nwater, but also good for the economy and job creation. He said to me:\n\n       We can turn every American into an energy entrepreneur, \n     every home into a power plant, and fuel our country through \n     our own energy initiatives, rather than Saudi oil.\n\n  I thought that statement was extremely inspiring. He is saying that \nthrough energy entrepreneurialism and innovation, we can transform this \neconomy not only into a green economy but into an energy revolution \nwhere we are creating not only the products through energy sources--\nwhether it is fuel cells, hydropower, wind, solar, biofuel, or \ncellulosic ethanol--but we have the opportunity to transform \nmanufacturing in this country to create the new products that are going \nto run on these new energy sources. It is a recognition that there is \nextraordinary opportunity here to make an opportunity for every \nindividual, every home, and every business to be part of the energy \nsolution.\n  As a country, we have undertaken infrastructure projects with the \nunderstanding that once the upfront costs were incurred and building \nwas completed, private investment would follow, creating lucrative \npaths of commerce. This has been seen throughout New York's history. In \nthe early days of America, we had one very audacious building project \ncalled the Erie Canal. It was going to connect Lake Erie to the Hudson \nRiver, opening markets of the eastern seaboard to inland goods. Even \nsome visionaries, such as Thomas Jefferson, didn't think it was a very \ngood idea, calling it ``a little short of lunacy,'' and ultimately it \nfell on New York State, under Gov. Dewitt Clinton's leadership, to fund \nthe project. The Erie Canal contributed immensely to the economic \ngrowth and wealth of New York. From New York City through Buffalo, it \nmade an enormous difference to open Upstate New York and western New \nYork to commerce, and that legacy continues to be with us today.\n  That is why the vision of President Obama on new infrastructure is so \nimportant. Today, we have high-speed rail, which is a great opportunity \nfor mass transit. If we can have high-speed rail from New York City to \nNiagara, again it would open not only downstate to upstate but upstate \nto the rest of the eastern seaboard. It is very exciting to be able to \ncreate these opportunities for long-term economic growth.\n  The same thing is true with the power grid. When T. Boone Pickens \ntalks about his windmills, he cannot build them if he doesn't have \nanyplace to plug in. We cannot have electric cars that can transform \nthe entire automotive industry if we don't have a place to plug in. \nThat is what President Obama's vision is in terms of building the new \nelectric grid, so we can have sustainable, renewable energy and be able \nto use the new technologies and innovations to drive a new economy.\n  New York is in the enviable position to lead the Nation's green \nmovement. We have had a history of energy independence. We have had \nhydropower for well over 100 years, whether you are talking about the \nHudson River Valley or Niagara Falls. We have some of the greatest \nagriculture in the whole Nation, so we can be a source for cellulosic \nethanol and other biofuels. We have some of the greatest entrepreneurs \nof this generation, from fantastic SUNY schools to terrific engineering \nschools, including engineering students from RPI, where we are at the \nforefront of photovoltaic energy, wind, and solar. We are in a position \nto lead the Nation's recovery through energy independence.\n  I celebrate Earth Day today by commending the great work of the \nHarbor School and the extraordinary leadership of Robert F. Kennedy, \nJr., and also to talk about our future because when children are \ninterested in learning about the environment and they create a \nrelationship to the environment, whether it is through cleaner air or \ncleaner water or being that young engineer who figures out how to build \nan electric car for $25,000 so all of America can get the equivalent of \n240 miles per gallon, that is a vision of the future that I see, and \nthat is the vision of how we are going to turn the economy around and \ncreate jobs.\n  I will work with President Obama to make sure we create good-paying \njobs all across New York.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that we are on the \nfinancial fraud legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. That vehicle is open for amendment, true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 984\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 984.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase funding for certain HUD programs to assist \n      individuals to better withstand the current mortgage crisis)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Madam President, what we hear on the morning news almost \nevery day--but today especially--is that there are problems in the \nhousing industry around America. Today, they listed the top 10 cities \nfor foreclosure. No. 1 is Las Vegas. We have a lot in common with nine \nother cities. Many of the 10 are in California, and Phoenix, AZ, is \none, and there are places in Michigan and in Florida.\n  I hope this amendment can be worked out with the managers. It is an \namendment that authorizes money in three different areas: $10 million \nto HUD for the purpose of providing resources to be used for \nadvertising in support of HUD programs and approved counseling agencies \nin the 50 metropolitan statistical areas with the highest incidence of \nhome foreclosures per capita. At least half of those resources are to \nbe used for Spanish-language advertising. We have found that in Las\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\nVegas, which has a significant number of Spanish-speaking people, they \nare being scammed by people who are trying to take advantage of them \nand others. The rationale is that some of these metropolitan \nstatistical areas are being flooded with advertising from illegitimate \nactors promising mortgage reductions and modifications for a fee. HUD \nwill use these funds to advertise HUD services, as well as to explain \nthe availability of HUD-approved counseling to homeowners to avoid some \nof these scams.\n  No. 2 is the authorization of $50 million to be provided through the \nHousing Counseling Program at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to HUD-certified housing counseling agencies located in the \n50 metropolitan statistical areas. These would be areas with the \nhighest incidence of home foreclosures per capita, for the purpose of \nassisting homeowners with inquiries regarding mortgage modification \nassistance and mortgage scams.\n  We have found in the economic recovery package, and in the housing \nbill, that direct moneys went to these agencies--approved agencies--to \nhelp them talk to people and counsel them as to what they can do to \navoid foreclosure. It has worked very well.\n\n  The 2008 housing bill and subsequent spending bills directed funds to \ncounseling agencies, but the metropolitan statistical areas that are \nhardest hit--Las Vegas among those--still need more resources given the \ndepth of the problem.\n  Additional resources will allow HUD-certified agencies to staff up \nand meet growing demand for their services, which will counterbalance \nthe increase in illegitimate agencies promising mortgage modification \nservices for a fee. These entities that are going to get this money \ncharge nothing.\n  Finally, Madam President, the authorization of $5 million to HUD's \nOffice of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity will help to provide \nadditional personnel in HUD offices located in these 50 areas with the \nhighest incidence of foreclosure. The rationale, of course, is that \nlocal HUD offices in these areas are understaffed and unable to meet \nthe demand for their services and expertise concerning mortgage scams. \nFair Housing Program personnel are trained to address these issues, and \nthey are badly needed.\n  I would hope the managers and those other Members who are interested \nin this issue would review this matter. We believe strongly this is the \nright direction. If people have a better idea, I would be happy to \nvisit with them. I will not call for a vote until people, of course, \nhave an opportunity to review this in detail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 985\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment for purposes of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 985.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To modify the definition of the term ``obligation'')\n\n       On page 26, strike lines 1 through 5, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(3) the term `obligation' means an established duty, \n     whether or not fixed, arising from an express or implied \n     contractual, grantor-grantee, or licensor-licensee \n     relationship, from a fee-based or similar relationship, from \n     statute or regulation, or from the retention of any \n     overpayment; and\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me describe this amendment briefly and \nnote that it is my understanding that when Senator Leahy is able to be \non the Senate floor, it is his intention to suggest that we take this \namendment by unanimous consent. It has been worked out with \nrepresentatives on both sides of the aisle, but I would like to \ndescribe it briefly.\n  This is an amendment relating to section 4 of the bill, which amends \nthe False Claims Act. My amendment replaces the bill's proposed \ndefinition of the word ``obligation,'' which has important implications \nfor the so-called ``reverse'' False Claims Act pursuant to which \nprivate parties may be held liable for failing to pay an obligation due \nto the United States.\n  This amendment originally grew out of concerns about the underlying \nbill that were raised by the Chamber of Commerce and other business \ngroups. Having reviewed those concerns, I have concluded that some of \nthem could only arise under a strained reading of the bill.\n  The bill's new definition of the word ``obligation,'' in particular, \nposed several problems. The original language spoke of ``contingent'' \nobligations. Such contingent or potential duties could include duties \nto pay penalties or fines, which could arise--and at least become \n``contingent'' obligations--as soon as the conduct that is the basis \nfor the fine has occurred.\n  Obviously, we don't want the Government or anyone else suing under \nthe False Claims Act to treble and enforce a fine before the duty to \npay that fine has been formally established. It is unlikely that \nJustice would ever have brought suit to enforce a claim of this nature, \nbut the FCA can also be enforced by private realtors who often may be \nmotivated by personal gain and not always exercise the same good \njudgment that the Government usually does.\n  To preclude such a reading of the act, my amendment strikes \ncontingent obligations from the FCA's new definition of ``obligation.''\n  My amendment also makes a few other housekeeping changes to the \ndefinition of ``obligation.'' It removes the words ``quasi-contractual \nrelationship.'' A ``quasi-contract'' is a remedy for a breach of duty, \nnot an independent source of a duty. The amendment also makes clear \nthat the words ``similar relationship'' only modify the words ``fee-\nbased relationship'' and not the entire list of relationships that \nprecede that term.\n  Under some readings of the rule of the last antecedent, the comma in \nthe committee-reported bill that preceded the words ``or similar \nrelationship'' could be read to reverse the usual presumption of that \nrule and have the words ``similar relationship'' modify all of the \nwords in that list. My amendment makes clear that ``similar \nrelationship'' only modifies ``fee-based relationship.''\n  As a result of discussions with the sponsors of the bill, I have also \nagreed to allow my amendment to add duties arising out of regulations, \nrather than just statutes, to the list of obligations made actionable \nunder the law. I declined, however, to also allow obligations to be \nenforced that arise out of a mere rule. The term ``rule'' is defined at \nsection 551 of title V, and as that definition makes clear, the term is \nfar too broad. It can include all manner of rules of which defendants \nwould have no reasonable notice.\n  Regulations, on the other hand, are published in the Federal Register \nin the Code of Federal Regulations, and so Congress can reasonably \nexpect participants in regulated industries to have notice of them. \nThus, as amended, the term ``obligation'' encompasses duties arising \nout of statutes and out of formal regulations published in the CFR.\n  I might also say a few words about aspects of the definition of \nobligation that I ultimately concluded that it was not necessary to \naddress in this amendment. At the Judiciary Committee's mark up of this \nbill, I circulated an amendment that would limit obligations arising \nout the retention of any overpayment so as to make clear that no \nobligation arises if the defendant is pursuing some type of \nadministrative, judicial, or other process for reconciliation of \nalleged overpayments. The sponsors of the bill raised the concern, \nhowever, that such a safe harbor might immunize parties that \nintentionally and maliciously obtain an overpayment, and then spend \nyears exhausting a reconciliation process, all in bad faith and knowing \nfull well that they must repay the money, but earning interest on the \noverpayment in the interim. Apparently incidents like this have \noccurred, in cases involving sums that allowed the defendant to earn \ntens of millions of dollars in interest. The sponsors of the bill also \nnoted to me that, under subparagraph (G)'s modification of the reverse \nFalse Claims\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\nAct, avoiding or decreasing an obligation is only actionable, in \nrelevant part, if the defendant ``knowingly and improperly avoids or \ndecreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the \nGovernment.'' Therefore, a good-faith pursuit of a reconciliation \nprocess would not be actionable.\n  I asked my staff to research the meaning of ``knowingly and \nimproperly'' to confirm that a person who pursues reconciliation of an \noverpayment in good faith could not be held liable under the reverse \nFalse Claims Act. The answer that I received is that the term \n``knowingly and improperly,'' though infrequently used in the caselaw, \nis consistently construed to mean that a person either acted with bad \nintent or that he employed means that are inherently tortious or \nillegal.\n  For example, the State of Massachusetts uses the standard of \n``knowing and improper'' to determine whether a business competitor's \ninducing a third party to breach a contract constitutes tortious \ninterference with contract. See Boyle v. Boston Foundation, Inc., 788 \nF.Supp. 627 (D. Mass. 1992); Restuccia v. Burk Technology, Inc., 1996 \nWL 1329386, at *3 (Aug. 13, 1996). And as the cases giving content to \nthe Massachusetts standard make clear, under that test the \n``[d]efendant's liability may arise from improper motives or from the \nuse of improper means.'' United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, 406 \nMass. 811, 816 (1990) (quoting Top Service Body Shop, Inc. v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 283 Or. 201, 209-210 (1978). See also United Truck Leasing at \npages 816-817, quoting other cases as construing this standard to \nrequire an ``improper purpose or improper means.'' The Top Service Body \nShop case, quoted by the Massachusetts court, further elaborates, at \nfootnote 11, on what types of means constitute ``improper means.'' \nThese are noted to commonly include ``violence, threats or other \nintimidation, deceit or misrepresentation, bribery, unfounded \nlitigation, defamation, or disparaging falsehood.'' In the False Claim \nAct context, this list may include other improper means, but ``improper \nmeans'' must be means that are malum in se--that is, means that are \ninherently wrongful and constitute an independent tort.\n  Though less carefully considered than the Massachusetts intentional-\ninterference jurisprudence, other judicial uses of the words ``knowing \nand improper'' confirm that the term would not reach good-faith \nexhaustion of procedures for reconciling an overpayment. In the Matter \nof Banas, 144 N.J. 75, 81 (1996), for example, reprimands a lawyer for \n``knowingly and improperly retaining--his client's--$5,000 payment.'' \nAnd the court makes clear that it bases this conclusion on a previous \nfinding that the lawyer ``knew from the beginning that the purpose of \nthe payment'' was to satisfy a condition that he had not met. See Banas \nat 80. In another attorney-sanctions case, In re Aston-Nevada Limited \nPartnership, 391 B.R. 84, 102 (D. Nev. 2006), the court found that the \nlawyer ``repeatedly, knowingly, and improperly'' misused particular \nwords in his filings, and then emphasized that the lawyer's \n``prevarications and misstatements were deliberate and not careless.''\n  Given that the words ``knowingly and improperly'' have a fixed \nmeaning that, at the very least, requires either improper motives or \ninherently improper means, the changes made by this bill cannot be read \nto make actionable the retention of an overpayment when the defendant \nis pursuing in good-faith the exhaustion of a reconciliation procedure. \nIt is with this understanding that I have declined to insist on further \nqualification of the bill's predication of liability on the retention \nof an overpayment.\n  Finally, as a matter of usage, I would note that, contrary to the \nwording of the bill's new definition of ``obligation,'' duties arise \nfrom contracts and the like, not from ``relationships.'' The bill's \nlanguage is somewhat Oprahfied in this regard, but given that the \nsponsors have accommodated me on other, more substantial issues, I did \nnot think it worth forcing a rewording of the provision to address this \nproblem.\n  Other groups have also suggested the bill's new definition of the \nword ``claim,'' by encompassing situations where money is spent or used \n``to advance a government program or interest,'' could make actionable \nunder the False Claims Act any garden-variety overbilling or \nunderpayment of a contractor by a subcontractor if some Federal money \nis involved in the project. I think this is an unreasonable reading of \nthe bill that is precluded by the committee report, as well as by \ncommon sense. The report makes clear that the purpose of the new \ndefinition of ``claim'' is to overrule the Totten and Allison Engine \ncases and preclude application of a formalistic presentment requirement \nof an unnecessary intent requirement, and to restore the previous \nunderstanding of the law. And that previous understanding, as well as \ncommon sense, dictate that a particular transaction does not ``advance \na Government program or interest'' unless it is predominantly federal \nin character--something that at least would require, as the report \nnotes in footnote 4, that the claim ultimately results in a loss to the \ngovernment. Obviously, the government does not intend to make \nactionable under the FCA any garden-variety dispute between a general \ncontractor and a subcontractor simply because the general receives some \nfederal money. On the other hand, if the transaction is still \npredominantly Federal in character, and the false claim results in a \nloss to the government, recovery under the FCA should not be precluded \nsimply because the claim was not directly presented to the government, \nor because the malfeasant did not specifically intend to defraud the \ngovernment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside this amendment \nfor the purpose of calling up four other amendments pending at the \ndesk, and those numbers are 986, 987, 988, and 989.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Will the Senator please yield so we have a chance to \nlook at the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to share these amendments with the other side, \nbut I was not aware the other side had a veto over amendments offered \nby Members of this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I would just like to----\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to share the amendment, of course. I will \nwithhold for a moment so the Senator can see what the amendment is, and \nperhaps we can move forward.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand there is a pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and it be in order for me to send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 993\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof myself and Senator Grassley. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 993.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To clarify the amendments relating to major fraud)\n\n       On page 15, strike beginning with line 20 through page 16, \n     line 10, and insert the following:\n       (d) Major Fraud Against the Government Amended to Include \n     Economic Relief and Troubled Asset Relief Program Funds.--\n     Section 1031(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by--\n       (1) inserting after ``or promises, in'' the following: \n     ``any grant, contract, subcontract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, \n     insurance or other form of Federal assistance, including\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\n     through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, an economic \n     stimulus, recovery or rescue plan provided by the Government, \n     the Government's purchase of any troubled asset as defined in \n     the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, or in'';\n       (2) striking ``the contract, subcontract'' and inserting \n     ``such grant, contract, subcontract, subsidy, loan, \n     guarantee, insurance or other form of Federal assistance,''; \n     and\n       (3) striking ``for such property or services''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise to explain what this is, and then \nI will try to schedule a vote on the Kyl amendment and the Grassley-\nLeahy amendment at some time, I hope in the next few minutes.\n  As we begin consideration of the bill, Senator Grassley and I are \noffering a brief managers' amendment. I was just explaining for \neverybody that it makes two simple technical changes in the bill in \norder to clarify the original intent of the bill and in order to avoid \nany ambiguity in the statutory language. It makes sure the bill extends \nthe major fraud statute to all the funds being expended to stabilize \nand strengthen our banking system.\n  The original language in the bill amended the major fraud statute to \nprotect against frauds related to many Government economic recovery \nprograms, including the purchase of ``preferred stock in a company'' by \nthe Government as part of our efforts to stabilize banks. The Justice \nDepartment advises that this language may be too narrow, as recovery \nefforts may include purchases of other types of stock or other troubled \nassets. So the Justice Department, which supports the Leahy-Grassley \nbill, has requested that the reference to ``any preferred stock in a \ncompany'' be replaced with the phrase ``any troubled asset as defined \nin the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.'' This simple \nchange will make clear that all troubled assets purchased by the \nGovernment as part of the recovery effort will be covered under the \nmajor fraud statute. This change is consistent with the original intent \nof the bill and simply provides greater assurances that taxpayers' \nmoney will be protected to the full extent of the Federal law.\n  Second, the amendment strikes five words in the bill that could \ncreate unintended ambiguity in the statute and could be used to limit \nthe effect of the bill. The phrase ``for such property or services'' \nappears in the original statute as a modifier of the kinds of contracts \nor subcontracts covered by the major fraud statute. With the changes \nincluded in the bill, the language is no longer applicable because the \ntransactions involved in our efforts to stabilize banks include grants, \nloans, and purchases of assets that may not legally be characterized as \n``property or services.'' If this phrase remained in the statute, it \ncould be used improperly to limit the scope of the major fraud statute \nand undermine the intent of this legislation, which is to cover all of \nthe Government's efforts to rebuild our economy and restart our banking \nsystem.\n  Frankly, when we send prosecutors out to get people for defrauding \nAmericans, I don't want to have something unintentionally in the \nstatute which may limit the ability of prosecutors to go after those \nwho are defrauding Americans.\n  These changes that have been requested and supported by the Justice \nDepartment have the full support of Senator Grassley, the lead \nRepublican cosponsor of this bill and the Republican manager for this \nbill. All Senators should support this bipartisan managers' amendment \nwhich should protect our efforts to strengthen the banking system and \nrestart the economy.\n  What I am going to do, Madam President, I am going to suggest that \nwhen Senator Kyl gets here and Senator Grassley gets back to the floor, \nwe accept this managers' amendment--I think it is noncontroversial--and \nthat we then have a vote as soon as he has had a chance to say what he \nwould like to on the Kyl amendment. In the meantime, we will leave the \nmanagers' amendment the pending amendment just so Senators then can \nunderstand, if we can work it that way, hopefully we will have a vote \nrelatively soon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I now wish to speak in support of S. 386, \nthe Trade Enforcement Recovery Act. I commend Senator Leahy, my \ncolleague from Vermont, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for \nintroducing this important piece of legislation.\n  As a result of the greed, recklessness and, in my view, illegal \nbehavior of a handful of executives on Wall Street, we are suffering \ntoday from the most severe economic crisis that we have experienced \nsince the Great Depression.\n  Millions of people have lost their homes, their jobs, their life \nsavings, their ability to send their kids to college, and their sense \nof hope that their children will follow the American dream and have a \nhigher standard of living than they do.\n  It is critical that we provide the FBI, the Justice Department, and \nall our Federal agencies the tools and resources they need to hold \nthose responsible for the financial crisis accountable and throw those \nwho engaged in fraud in jail where they belong. That is what the Fraud \nEnforcement and Recovery Act is all about. It is imperative we pass \nthis bill as soon as possible.\n  Under President Bush, the Federal Government basically turned a blind \neye to white-collar crime. After September 11, about 100 FBI white-\ncollar fraud investigators had their job responsibilities shifted to \nfocus on terrorism, which is understandable. But the problem is, they \nwere never replaced to do and continue the work on white-collar crime. \nAs a result, literally thousands of allegations of financial and \nmortgage fraud are going unexamined this day.\n  Chairman Leahy's bill will turn this abysmal situation around by \nproviding the resources necessary for the FBI to hire 160 additional \nspecial agents and more than 200 professional staff and forensic \nanalysts dedicated to investigating white-collar crime.\n  This bill also provides the resources necessary for the Justice \nDepartment to add up to 200 prosecutors and civil enforcement attorneys \nnationwide, as well as 100 support staff to focus on fighting fraud. \nThis bill provides the resources necessary for the U.S. Postal \nInspection Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the inspector general \nat HUD to hire several hundred additional fraud agents, analysts, and \ninvestigators to combat fraud.\n  This bill is desperately needed. It is important that we take a very \naggressive look at the fraud that is going on in that area. I hope very \nmuch that all our colleagues will support this legislation\n  With regard to this issue of what has been going on on Wall Street, \nthere is no question but that the American people are furious--and \nrightly so. The American people want answers. What I wish to do now is \nsay a word above and beyond this legislation, some of the areas that I \nthink we have to go after we pass this bill. I think the American \npeople are demanding an investigation to understand how we got into \nthis financial crisis in the first place. Who are those people \nresponsible? Some people say: Well, it is all of us. We are all \nresponsible for this financial crisis. That simply is not accurate. The \ntruth of the matter is, there are probably a few hundred people who, \nthrough their greed, their recklessness, their illegal behavior, have \npulled our Nation and much of the world into a deep recession.\n  We need to know who they are. We need to know what they did. We need \nto make sure this never happens again. And where illegal activity has \ntaken place, we need to hold them accountable.\n  One other area I wished to touch on, to look at another issue that is \nof concern to people in the State of Vermont--and I get e-mails on this \nvirtually every day, I know it is true nationwide--at the same time as \nwe are bailing out huge Wall Street financial institutions, at the same \ntime as these financial institutions are getting zero interest loans \nfrom the Fed, you know what they are saying to the American people. \nThey are saying: Thanks,\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\nchump. We appreciate all your help. Now we are going to charge you 20, \n25, 30 percent interest rates on the credit cards we gave you.\n  Recently, I have been receiving many e-mails from people who have \nseen the Bank of America, for no particular reason, doubling their \ninterest rates all over this country. People are using their credit \ncards to pay for their groceries, to pay for basic needs. College kids, \nthey are using credit cards to pay college expenses, and they are being \ncharged outrageous rates.\n  The reality is, today in America, if you can believe it, one-third of \nall credit card holders in this country are paying interest rates above \n20 percent, and as high as 41 percent, which is more than double what \nthey paid in interest in 1990.\n  What we are looking at right here is a situation in which the \nAmerican people are bailing out these large institutions and in return \nwhat we get are outrageously high interest rates. I have introduced, \nalong with Senators Durbin, Levin, Leahy, Harkin, and Whitehouse, \nlegislation that will require any lender in this country to immediately \ncap all interest rates on consumer loans at 15 percent, including \ncredit cards.\n  The reason we have selected that number is, it is precisely what \ncredit unions all over the country are operating under and have \noperated under for 30 years, and they have done well. They are not \ncoming to Washington for hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts.\n  I think if it has worked well for the credit unions, it can work well \nfor financial institutions. I hope we can get that bill on the floor \nand see it pass to protect millions of credit card holders all over \nthis country.\n  There is another issue I think we have to address. The reason \nCongress has provided $700 billion to bail out Wall Street, against my \nvote I should say but that is what happened, the reason the Fed has \nlent out over $2 trillion to large financial institutions has a lot to \ndo with the phenomenon of ``too big to fail.''\n  The thought is, if a large financial institution goes under, it will \nbring systemic damage to our entire economy, and it has to be propped \nup. As I said on the floor of this Senate more than once, if an \ninstitution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.\n  I will be introducing legislation soon to require that the Federal \nbanking regulators examine every bank in this country to make sure no \nbank is too big to fail over a reasonable period of time. In other \nwords, I think we have to take a look at what Teddy Roosevelt did 100 \nyears ago, over 100 years ago. If an institution is too big to fail, \nlet's start breaking them up right now so we do not find ourselves back \nin the same place some years from now.\n  It goes without saying, in another area, we have clearly got to end \nthe deregulation of banking laws that were passed over the last decade \nthat helped cause this crisis. There was a belief that if we let Wall \nStreet do all the wonderful things they are capable of doing, well, \nthey are going to provide and create prosperity, not only for their \npeople but all over our country.\n  Clearly, we have learned a lesson: When you leave Wall Street alone, \nthey will do what they do best; that is, act in a very greedy way to \nmaximize their profits. For them, 20 percent, 30 percent were not \nenough. They needed 40 percent, they needed 50 percent rates of return. \nTheir CEOs needed not $20 million, not $50 million, in some cases they \nneeded $1 billion.\n  I think it is now widely understood that we have to reverse the \nderegulation that took place over the last decade, and we have to move \nforward with sensible regulation. That means we have to revisit \ncertainly Gramm-Leach-Bliley, we have to restore the firewalls that \nwere imposed by the Glass-Steagall Act in 1934 and that were repealed \nas a result of deregulation.\n  On another issue, I think there is growing concern that the Federal \nReserve has taken on new responsibilities and that there is a clear \nlack of transparency in the Fed. The American people have a right to \nknow what is going on there, and today we are kept in the dark.\n  Regardless of one's views on the merits of the $700 billion financial \nrescue package that was signed into law by President Bush on October 3, \none thing we can say is that if the taxpayers and the citizens of this \ncountry want to know who received this money, all they have to do is go \nto a Web site and they can find that.\n  On the other hand, if you want to know who received $2.2 trillion \nfrom the Fed, if you want to know what the terms are of those \nagreements, you will not find any information whatsoever. All of that \ninformation has been kept secret from the American people.\n  I am grateful that as part of the budget debate, the Senate voted 59 \nto 39 in favor of an amendment I offered to the budget resolution with \nSenators Bunning, Webb, and Feingold, calling on the Fed to release \nthis information. In my view, it is time for the Fed to listen to the \nwill of the Senate and the American people and release this information \nas soon as possible.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying I think today we are debating a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, \nintroduced by my colleague from Vermont. This is an extremely important \nlegislation. Let's get it passed as soon as possible with as large a \nvote as we can.\n  After we do that, let's start turning our attention to other aspects \nof this Wall Street crisis so we can respond to the frustration and the \nanger of the American people, create a new Wall Street, create \naccountability, lower interest rates, and do many of the things the \nAmerican people want to us to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been in discussions with the \ndistinguished Republican deputy leader, Senator Kyl. We do not have a \nformal agreement but what we are looking toward doing, in the next 10 \nminutes or so, is having acceptance of the managers' technical \namendment and then going to a rollcall vote on Senator Kyl's amendment, \nwhich I will support.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 993, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nLeahy-Grassley amendment at the request of the Justice Department to \nadd the word ``or'' after the comma at page 2, line 1. I send the \nmodification to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that right. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 15, strike beginning with line 20 through page 16, \n     line 10, and insert the following:\n       (d) Major Fraud Against the Government Amended to Include \n     Economic Relief and Troubled Asset Relief Program Funds.--\n     Section 1031(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by--\n       (1) inserting after ``or promises, in'' the following: \n     ``any grant, contract, subcontract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, \n     insurance or other form of Federal assistance, including \n     through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, an economic \n     stimulus, recovery or rescue plan provided by the Government, \n     or the Government's purchase of any troubled asset as defined \n     in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, or in'';\n       (2) striking ``the contract, subcontract'' and inserting \n     ``such grant, contract, subcontract, subsidy, loan, \n     guarantee, insurance or other form of Federal assistance,''; \n     and\n       (3) striking ``for such property or services''.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized until Senator \nKyl returns to the floor or for a shorter period of time, whichever may \nbe the shortest.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, nobody disputes the intent that we ought \nto go after the fraud that has been associated with the mortgage \nindustry and some of the problems thereof. We passed the stimulus bill \nthat had a lot of money for the Justice Department in it. We didn't \ntell them they should\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nuse the money on this. We passed an omnibus bill, none of which did we \nput money in. We put $10 million in for the FBI. Now we come before the \nSenate wanting to authorize $500 million more for a bill in a \ndepartment, the Justice Department, that will end this fiscal year with \nover $2 billion in the bank. Since I have been a Senator, they have had \nover $2 billion at the end of the year. There is something unique about \nthe Justice Department. The Justice Department is the only Federal \nagency that doesn't ultimately have to send its unspent money back to \nthe Treasury. They get to keep it.\n  In a time where we are spending money to the tune of $112 billion a \nday every day we have been in session so far in this 111th Congress, to \nsay that we ought to send another $500 million to an agency that is \ngoing to have $2 billion left over at the end of this year and the next \nfew years to come tells us we are not good money managers, but most of \nthe American people know that already.\n  On fiscal grounds, what we are doing is, we are authorizing money. \nAnd that is what will be the response to this debate: It is just an \nauthorization. The fact is, if you are authorizing, you intend to spend \nit. You are going to try to get another $500 million appropriated on \nthis bill.\n  Secondly, we don't have ex post facto laws. So everything this bill \ndoes has no application in terms of a statute change to any of the \ncrimes committed, either the fraud or money laundering or anything \nelse. It has no application. None of it will apply to misdeeds and \ninfractions of the law that happened that got us into this crisis.\n  Additionally, every act that was committed that broke a law under the \nstatutes we have today, both Federal mail fraud and wire fraud, can be \nprosecuted already. What is going on? What is going on is, we are going \nto pass a bill in reaction to a problem that Congress created in the \nfirst place by incentivizing poor behavior at Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac, by not doing oversight, and we are going to make everybody feel \nbetter because we reacted to it. We don't need new laws on the books. \nWhat we need to do is enforce the laws we have today. It may be true \nthat the Justice Department might need additional moneys. But where is \nthe oversight?\n  We released a report earlier this year that showed $10 billion over \nthe last 5 years of waste in the Justice Department. Here is a \ndepartment that has wasted $10 billion over the last 5 years, has $2 \nbillion at the end of this year with which they could fund this. We \ndidn't fund any of it except $10 million in the stimulus bill or the \nomnibus bill, and we are adding new laws to the books that we don't \nneed to prosecute the people who broke the law. It is a typical \ncongressional reaction when what we should be doing is enforcing the \nlaws already on the books and supplying on a priority basis the funding \nfor the Justice Department to prosecute that.\n  I see Senator Kyl is here. I will continue my comments later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have the Leahy-Grassley technical \namendment. I ask for its passage.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \npending amendment?\n  Hearing no further debate, without objection, the amendment, as \nmodified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 993), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KYL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 985\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe it would be in order now to bring up the Kyl \namendment; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Kyl amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will describe this amendment in one \nsentence so as not to be more confusing than it otherwise would be. It \nis clearly a technical amendment and has strong support on both sides. \nIt modifies the bill's definition of the term ``obligation'' as used in \nthe reverse False Claims Act to exclude contingent obligations, thus \nprecluding the possibility that conduct that makes a defendant liable \nfor a penalty or a fine could become actionable under this law before \nthat fine is actually established or assessed. I believe the amendment \nis agreed to on both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. He worked \nwith me and Senator Grassley. We both support his amendment. I will \nvote for it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate on \nthe amendment, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 985.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 160 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--94\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Sanders\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n  The amendment (No. 985) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 995\n\n(Purpose: To establish the Financial Markets Commission, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and the clerk call up amendment No. 995.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 995.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am honored to be introducing this \namendment today on this piece of legislation. I am particularly pleased \nto have worked for the past 3\\1/2\\ months with the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad, who is the principal cosponsor on what is known as \nthe Financial Markets Commission.\n  In the last year, the people of the United States have seen the value \nof their homes decline, the value of their\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\n529 savings accounts for their kids' college decline, their mutual \nfunds, and their investments in whatever category. Declines that \nstarted out to be a hiccup became colossal and we now find ourselves in \na position where we are deleveraging and we are deflating in the United \nStates of America.\n  There should be some answers. Quite frankly, there is plenty of blame \nto go around, but we need some answers. We need some guidance. We need \nto ensure that my grandchildren and my children and yours don't ever go \nthrough the experiences we have gone through and we have shared with \nthe American people in the last 12 months.\n  The only way to get an objective evaluation of what went wrong and \nwhere mistakes were made is to create an independent commission of \nrecognized people of experience to look into the financial markets, the \nrating agencies, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, investment bankers, hedge \nfund operators, commodities traders--everybody--and FASB and say: What \nwent right, what went wrong, and what could we have done better to have \nprevented this from going on?\n  I have a lot of suggestions. I could drop a lot of bills right now, \nincluding transparency for hedge funds and changing who compensates the \nrating agencies from the seller securities to the buyer securities. But \nwe need a forensic audit of the laws of the United States as it relates \nto the financial markets, the Federal Reserve, and every aspect, so \nwhatever did go wrong that could have been avoided is avoided.\n  This Commission is designed to operate for 18 months. It has a budget \nof $5 million and subpoena powers and it is directed to report back to \nthe Congress of the United States its findings. It is specific in every \nregard so that anybody who could have been a part of what happened in \nthis financial collapse is subject to investigation, is subject to \nscrutiny, and is subject to the sunshine that is necessary to get \nanswers.\n  I think we owe it to the American people. I know I owe it to my \nchildren and grandchildren and to those people who voted for me to find \nout what went wrong and try and make it right.\n  Senator Conrad has been diligent in his effort to help. He has made \nvery constructive suggestions concerning the amendments to this \nlegislation. Jointly with him, we worked with the Banking Committee \nmembers, the ranking member, and the chairman to try to incorporate the \nideas of everyone and to make sure we don't miss the mark, that we stay \non focus, and we get what the American people deserve; that is, answers \nto what caused the financial collapse that has decreased the value of \ntheir homes, the value of their savings accounts, protracted their \nretirement, and brought about the uncertainty that we have today in the \neconomy of the United States of America.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his help. I \nthank the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank Senator Isakson for his leadership in this \nmatter. It has been exemplary. I have truly enjoyed working with \nSenator Isakson and his staff. They are the leads on this legislation, \nwhich I think is one of the more important pieces of legislation we \nwill consider this year.\n  We have had two extraordinary tragedies in this country in the last \nperiod of time: September 11, when this country was attacked, and also \nwhat was very close, I believe, to a global financial meltdown. In \nfact, I will never forget as long as I live when, last fall, being \ncalled to a special urgent meeting in the leader's office with the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury of \nthe previous administration and being told they were going to take over \nAIG the next day and they believed if they did not do it, we could \nsuffer irreparable damage to the economy of the United States and, in \nfact, we could face a global economic meltdown.\n  After 9/11, we put into place a commission--bipartisan, nonpartisan--\nto review what happened, why it happened, and what could be done to \nprevent it from ever happening again.\n  That is precisely what we must do now with respect to the economic \ncrisis that is upon us. We have an obligation to the people of this \ncountry and to our colleagues to put into place a commission, which is \nseparate from partisan politics, to do a careful review of what \nhappened, why it happened, and how it could be avoided from ever \nhappening again.\n  All across America, millions of people are wondering about their \nretirement. They are wondering if they will be able to retire. They are \nwondering what the quality of their life is going to be in retirement. \nThey are wondering how their 401(k) became a 201(k). How did their \nretirement savings get cut in half? What occurred and who is \nresponsible and what could be done to prevent it from happening again?\n  This Commission will have 10 members appointed by the majority and \nminority leaders of the Senate, the speaker and minority leader in the \nHouse of Representatives, the chairman and ranking members of the \nSenate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee. It \nwill be charged with reporting back to the President, the Congress, and \nthe American people by the end of next year. The Commission will also \nhave the authority to refer evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the \nJustice Department and State attorneys general for prosecution.\n  I believe this Commission is absolutely essential to determine, in a \nnonpartisan way, how this financial crisis occurred. Where were the \nmistakes made? Were there failures of regulation? Were there failures \nin the regulatory agencies? Were there failures in the private sector?\n  I think we all know the answer to every one of those questions is \nyes. There were failures in the Congress of the United States and in \nthe administration. This is not a finger-pointing exercise; this is an \nexercise to determine, on a fair and objective basis, what occurred and \nwhat can be done to prevent it from happening again. That is the goal \nof the legislation introduced by Senator Isakson, which I am proud to \ncosponsor.\n  Let me conclude by saying that working with Senator Isakson has been \na delight. He is a fairminded, serious legislator who has spent an \nenormous amount of time doing this legislation--and, let me say, doing \nit right, talking directly to the committees of jurisdiction, trying to \nget their input, their assessment, and also talking to other colleagues \nand preparing something that I think is fair, balanced, and is \ncompletely intended to be objective in its outcome.\n  I think all of us have a responsibility to see this through to the \nend, so that at some future date the American people will be able to \nlook back and find out, on an objective basis, what were the failures \nof fiscal policy, what were the failures of monetary policy, what were \nthe failures of the private sector, what were the failures of \nGovernment regulation and the policymakers in the Congress of the \nUnited States and in the administration? What could be done to prevent \nit from ever happening again? We have that obligation to the American \npeople.\n  Again, I thank Senator Isakson for his leadership on this important \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the things being \nsaid. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Georgia, who said we \nshould find out what went wrong and try to make it right. The \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota said we should find out what \nhappened and why it happened and make sure it never happens again. And \nit should be a nonpartisan effort, not finger pointing.\n  I find myself closely aligned with this. I said the same thing about \nhaving an accountability commission on what happened in areas including \ntorture, the OLC memos that twisted statutes and policy, and with White \nHouse interference in prosecutions and law enforcement. And I have been \nmaking such a recommendation for some time, so that we can find out \njust what happened. As we now found, opinions were written that were \ntotally contrary to the law. We find such things as the Bybee memo. I \nhope that Judge Bybee, now that that memo has become public, will do \nthe honest thing, the moral thing, the right thing, and resign from\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\nthe bench. We find out about more and more of these alarming issues, \nbut we still do not have all the facts.\n  I think we should have some type of a nonpartisan commission, as the \nSenator said--not for finger-pointing, as he said--but to find out what \nhappened and why it happened and to make sure it never happens again. \nWe must find out what happened in order to try to make it right, as the \nSenator has also said.\n  I am tempted to offer, as a second-degree amendment to this one, an \namendment to include an examination of everything that went on during \nthe last administration with regard to the manipulation of prosecutors, \nthe manipulation of the law, and those who wrote memos saying basically \nthat certain people in the Government are above the law, cannot be \naffected by the law, and cannot be held accountable to the law. Those \nindividuals even went so far as to say that the President could simply \ndecide the law does not apply to him, which, of course, would be the \nfirst time in this Nation's history that any binding Executive branch \nmemo has ever claimed a President has that authority that I am aware \nof. All the arguments made by the Senator from North Dakota, which I \nbelieve were good arguments, could be made, for my commission proposal. \nOn the question of why people decide not to follow our laws, how they \nconvinced themselves to do that, and how they managed to get lawyers to \nwrite twisted memos to justify the idea that they did not have to \nfollow the law: we had a certain cadre of such people within the White \nHouse and within the administration. And they apparently believed they \ncould automatically excuse themselves from following the law.\n  As I have said, there is the temptation to offer this as a second-\ndegree amendment. I will not. But I simply point out that if it is \napplicable here, it is certainly applicable in those areas where people \nwere not just trying to steal money, they were trying to steal the \nConstitution of the United States. And they are trying to steal the \nlaws of the United States. I think that should be looked into just as \nmuch as somebody who might want to steal money from the United States. \nMoney can be paid back and should be paid back. Once you lose honor, \nonce you lose your integrity, once you lose credibility, once you lose \nadherence to our Constitution, that takes a lot longer to get back.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will speak on a provisions of the bill dealing with \nmoney laundering. This section of the bill that I am referring to would \namend the criminal money laundering statute to make clear that the \nproceeds of specified unlawful activity include the gross receipts of \nillegal activity and not just the profits of that illegal activity.\n  The money laundering statutes make it an offense to conduct financial \ntransactions involving the ``proceeds'' of a crime, sometimes referred \nto as ``specific unlawful activity'' in the statutes.\n  These statutes, however, do not define what the term ``proceeds'' \namounts to. Instead, the term has been left to definition by our \ncourts.\n  For 22 years, since the money laundering statute was enacted in 1986, \ncourts have construed ``proceeds'' to mean ``gross receipts'' and not \n``net profits'' of illegal activities consistent with the original \nintent of Congress.\n  However, last year, the Supreme Court entered into it and, of course, \nreverses the definition in a case called United States v. Santos.\n  The Supreme Court suggested that the term ``proceeds'' was \n``ambiguous''--that is their word--and as a result, under the rule of \nlenity, the Court gave the term a much narrower definition.\n  In this decision, the Court mistakenly limited the term ``proceeds'' \nto the ``profits'' of a crime, not the more global word ``receipts.''\n  As a result, the Court's decision has limited the money laundering \nstatutes to only profitable crimes. It gives criminal defendants an \nargument against their criminal conduct by forcing the Government to \nprove that they actually made a profit, regardless of the criminal \nactivity.\n  This decision of the Court is contrary to the intent of Congress in \npassing the money laundering statutes and weakens one of the Federal \nGovernment's primary tools used to recover the proceeds of illegal \nactivity, including mortgages and securities fraud.\n  For example, these are some of the problems created by the Santos \ndecision.\n  If a drug dealer committed a financial transaction with the proceeds \nof illegal drug dealing but the money was only used to purchase drugs, \nthen they could not be prosecuted for money laundering. I know, \neverybody hears that, and they say common sense dictates otherwise. But \nthe Supreme Court interpretation puts us in that sense that is contrary \nto common opinion.\n  Another example: If a fraudulent broker, such as a mortgage broker, \nintentionally overvalued the fair market of a home for purposes of a \nmortgage, that broker could only be charged for money laundering \nrelated to any fees or potential profit made in the fraudulent \ntransaction, not based on the full value of the house.\n  Another example: An executive who committed security fraud could not \nbe charged with money laundering if the fraud were unsuccessful in \nmaking a profit even though there was a fully completed financial \ntransaction.\n  Those are just three of many examples I could give about how Santos \nvery narrowly construes the possible prosecution and limits the \nprosecution of certain unlawful activity in the area of money \nlaundering.\n  This legislation corrects the Santos decision and moves us forward so \nthat profit or not, there is money laundering actually going on, we \nwill have an opportunity to prosecute and hopefully succeed in the \nprosecution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will in a period of time offer an \namendment with my colleague, Senator McCain, dealing with a select \ncommittee of the Senate. We are waiting for Senator Dodd, and as soon \nas Senator Dodd arrives I will relinquish the floor so he might \nproceed.\n  As we are waiting, I wish to commend my colleagues, Senator Isakson \nand Senator Conrad, on the legislation they have introduced dealing \nwith a commission. The formulation of a commission seems to me to make \nsome sense.\n  I offered something called the Taxpayer Protection Act in late \nJanuary of this year. One of the five provisions of that act called for \nthe creation of such a commission. Frankly, Senator Isakson and Senator \nConrad have substantially improved on that idea. Their amendment is \nvery well done. It is something I very strongly support and I think \nwill advance the interests of the Congress and the American people in \ntrying to understand what exactly has happened here.\n  I do want to mention that the amendment I will offer following a \ndiscussion in a few minutes by Senator Dodd will be an amendment that \nrelates to S. Res. 62, a Senate resolution Senator McCain and I jointly \nsubmitted about 2 months ago calling for the creation of a select \ncommittee to investigate, through the use of subpoenas and other \napproaches, the narrative of what has happened. While I think a \ncommission is valuable in making recommendations, having some of the \nbest minds around the country serving on an independent commission, I \nalso believe there is a responsibility in the Senate for a select \ncommittee of the type that has existed in history on a number of \noccasions to do the work to understand what is the master narrative \nhere, what has happened to cause this unbelievable financial crisis. I \nwill talk more about the\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\nissue and the need for the establishment of a select committee when I \nintroduce the amendment, but for the moment I wanted to say a couple of \nthings.\n\n  One, I believe this issue of a commission that my colleagues have \nadvanced is something very worth supporting. Both my colleagues, \nSenator Isakson and Senator Conrad, have done a lot of work on this, \nand it is very good work and it deserves, in my judgment, our support.\n  I also want to say, in the context of these discussions, that before \nour colleague, Senator Dodd, who is coming to the floor in a bit, and \nwho is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, now lies the task of \ntrying to put together the pieces of this puzzle and to find out how \nall of this works. He has done an enormous number of hearings. What \nSenator Dodd is doing in these hearings in the committee and under his \nleadership is trying to figure out how do you lift this country out of \nthe ditch? How do you put this system back together? How do you fix \nwhat is wrong in this banking system? How do you put the pieces \ntogether so they fit and represent the public interest so this doesn't \nhappen again?\n  Senator Dodd has done so many hearings on this in the recent months. \nVery few Members of the Senate, I think, understand the hours it has \ntaken Senators Dodd and Shelby, leading that committee. But I must say \nagain, they are forward looking to try to figure it all out. This \ncountry is in a huge hole. We have a banking system in chaos. We have a \nfinancial crisis. How do you get out of this hole? How do you lift this \ncountry? How do you put the pieces back together? How do you fix what \nis wrong in order to make it right so we can provide for recovery in \nthis country?\n  I want to say again that our colleague, Senator Dodd, and let me also \nsay the ranking member of that committee, has an enormous burden. Under \nSenator Dodd's leadership, I think they have done an extraordinary job \nand they are at that work even today as I speak.\n  As we talk here on the floor about these issues, I don't want anybody \nto misunderstand the responsibilities of the committee and what that \ncommittee is trying to do. I don't serve on that committee, but we have \nsome awfully good Senators who do--Republicans and Democrats--and we \nhave a good chairman--who are all trying to figure out how you put this \ntogether going forward.\n  You know, this country has not seen this kind of financial collapse \nfor a long time--the first time in my lifetime, certainly. It is a \ncollapse of the sort that harkens back to the Great Depression. And the \nquestion isn't whether this country will recover--it will. This is a \ngreat country, very resourceful, and full of great people who want to \nlift this country up. We need to do that work together. The question \nisn't whether; the question is when and how we will effect this \nrecovery. And that is part of what all of us are grappling with, most \nnotably, of course, the Senate Banking Committee. The discussions that \nare underway this afternoon are discussions about a commission, a \ncommittee, and so on. They are very important.\n  Let me make one other point. The legislation that is the subject of \namendment is legislation brought to us on a bipartisan basis by Senator \nLeahy and Senator Grassley and others. That is a piece of legislation \nthat is very important as well, and I will speak more about that at \nsome later point. But the underlying legislation is another piece of \ntrying to grapple with something that should never have happened but \nnow must be fixed. They are talking about providing the resources \nnecessary for the investigators, for the prosecutors, for the law \nenforcement functions that need to be exercised here to find \naccountability--who did what. We don't know.\n  It is interesting, there are a lot of things that have caused us \nproblems and that steered this country into a financial ditch--a lot of \nthem. Debt, deregulation, and dark money are just three, and I could \ndescribe all of them at great length. But our colleagues, Senator Leahy \nand Senator Grassley and others, on a bipartisan basis, are bringing \nsomething to the floor that says let us have the resources to go after \nsome of these kinds of practices.\n  Let me show you something. I went to the Internet today. This is on \nthe Internet today. This is an advertisement: You want to get a loan? \nThese folks want to give you a loan. It is called speedy bad credit \nloans. Isn't that unbelievable? With all this country has faced, you \ncan go to a company called speedybadcreditloans.com. You have bad \ncredit? They say that is okay. You have no credit? Well, that is OK \ntoo. If you have been bankrupt, that is no problem. Come to us, we will \ngive you some money. These are the same shysters who have been involved \nin this and who ran this country into the ditch.\n  I was wondering if I should spell that word. Maybe I shouldn't have \nused the word, but the fact is it is the same kind of folks who ran \nthis country into the ditch in the first place by putting out subprime \nmortgages and saying: If you have bad credit, come to us. No credit, \nslow pay, no pay? Come to us. Doesn't matter. We want to give you some \nmoney. It is unbelievable to me.\n  So here on the Internet today--bad credit mortgage, no credit, bad \ncredit, bankruptcy, no downpayments, no delays. You certainly don't \nneed delays if you don't have a good credit rating. You want to get \nsome money from somebody? By the way, these folks are making a fortune. \nThey put money out there on the street and then they would securitize \nit, pass the risk on up, and everybody was making a bunch of money.\n  My colleagues, Senators Leahy and Grassley and others, are saying: \nYou know what, the resources needed to go after these kinds of people \nand prosecute this bad behavior and hold people accountable, those \nresources need to be passed by this Congress. And I agree with that.\n  Here is another on the Internet today. CC Financial Group working \ntogether to build your dreams. Bad credit? Poor credit? We can get you \nin your dream home. In fact, we will finance the current home that you \nhave. Isn't that something? CC Financial Group says, you have bad \ncredit? You have poor credit? Hey, we have a deal for you. Borrow some \nmoney from us.\n  Let me tell you the little trick these folks have been doing. They \nput you into a mortgage with a teaser loan. They say: You know what, \nyou are paying way too much on your monthly payment. We will give you a \nloan with a 2-percent interest rate. We can cut that monthly payment by \nhundreds and hundreds of dollars a month. Oh, they don't tell you that \nit will reset; and yes, that 2-percent interest rate that gets that \npayment way down in about 2 or 3 years will reset to 10 percent or 12 \npercent, and then you won't be able to afford to make the payment. And \nby the way, we will lock in something called a prepayment penalty--\nwhich you will never hear about. It means you can never repay it.\n  Now, why do they do that? So they could pack these up like sausages. \nThey used to pack sawdust in sausages for filler. They would pack them \nup like sausages with sawdust, and then slice them and dice them and \nsell them as securitized loans. And they say to these hedge funds, \ninvestment banks, and others that wanted to buy all this nonsense, all \nthis investment trash, they would say, we have a good deal for you. We \nhave a bunch of loans in here with prepayment penalties, so they can't \nget out of it, and by the way, the yield is good. All these smart \npeople in the room didn't understand that nobody was going to be able \nto repay those loans.\n  They also say: Do you want a loan with no documentation of your \nincome? It is called a no doc. No documentation. We will give you a \nloan on your home and you don't even have to document your income. We \ndon't care. No doc. You want a loan you don't have to pay any principal \non, just the interest? If that is not good enough, you can't pay the \ninterest even? We will do this for you. You don't have to pay any \nprincipal, or all the interest. We will wrap it around the back side of \nthe mortgage. Or even better, we don't have to document your income, \nyou don't have to pay any principal, any interest, and we will make the \nfirst 12 payments for you.\n  That is how lucrative this business was. You got bad credit, can't \npay your bills, are you a bad risk? Come to us. The biggest mortgage \ncompany in the country--Countrywide Mortgage--here\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nis what they said--the biggest mortgage company in the country. And by \nthe way, they went belly up, and the folks at the top of that company \nwent home with hundreds of millions of dollars--hundreds of millions of \ndollars. Here is what the biggest mortgage company in the country said \nin the middle of all this. They said: Do you have less than perfect \ncredit? Do you have late mortgage payments? Have you been denied by \nother lenders? Call us. We consider you a buddy, because we can make a \nbunch of money off of you.\n  Well, Mr. President, I will discuss more about this later. I have \nbeen waiting for my colleague from Connecticut, who I indicated was on \nhis way, and I wish to yield the floor now, and following my \ncolleague's presentation, at that point I wish to offer an amendment \nwith my colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Connecticut is \nwaiting, so I will be brief. There is not much I can add to the words \nof my friend and colleague Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, whom I have \nhad the privilege of working with in the past on a number of issues, \nespecially the investigation of a scandal that is still ongoing, as a \nmatter of fact, concerning Mr. Abramoff and his corrupting effect on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  All of us just came back from a recess. All of us had an extended \nopportunity to visit with our constituents. In Arizona, I had that \nopportunity. Traveling around my State, I saw that there is confusion, \nthere is frustration, and there is justified anger. People are not able \nto stay in their homes, and they are unable to keep their jobs, with \nunemployment continuing to go up. A State such as mine was hurt very \nbadly because we were on the crest of the wave of the housing and the \ncrashdown in the most dramatic fashion. So I understand and appreciate \nand sympathize with the fear and anger and frustration people feel \nabout what is going on in America's economy today, and they want \nanswers.\n  Actually, they want two things: They want answers and they want \nrelief. But they also want to know what are we going to do to prevent a \ncrisis of this nature from ever happening again. So far we haven't \ngiven them any real good answers. That is why the proposal of Senator \nDorgan, which I am pleased to join in, is so important at this time. \nThe American people deserve to know what caused this crash, what caused \nthis catastrophe which caused them to lose their homes, their families, \ntheir jobs, and futures.\n  A select committee could get to work right away. We could be in \nbusiness for a year. I have been on select committees before, including \nthe one on POW and MIA issues. We were able to resolve the issue to a \nsignificant degree in a bipartisan fashion. I have no doubt this could \nbe a bipartisan select committee. There have been select committees in \nthe past and there may be select committees in the future, but this is \nvital to Americans now because they lack confidence in our economy \ntoday and in their future.\n  Americans deserve to know what happened, to apportion \nresponsibilities, and most importantly to know this will never befall \nthem again. So I urge my colleagues to act and act quickly. We can talk \nabout a commission. I have no objection to commissions. Some have been \nsuccessful, some have not. The 9/11 Commission, which I was proud to \nsponsor, had magnificent results. The Commission on Social Security and \nMedicare disappeared like a stone.\n  I understand there are various areas of jurisdiction. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee is here, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee is here, and I know \nthey are working hard, and I know they are going into their areas of \nresponsibility. But I would allege that these areas of examination \ninclude economic, financial, banking, housing, trade, and a broad range \nof issues which are not under the jurisdiction of a specific committee. \nI understand jurisdictional proprietorship. I also understand some \npeople may view this as some kind of encroachment upon their \nresponsibilities. But another thing about a select committee is that it \ngets the kind of attention that select committees get. I have been \naround the Congress long enough to see that when there is a crisis, \nselect committees get the kind of attention and the kind of results \nthat can lead to the kinds of reforms that are necessary.\n  We are in the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. \nEveryone knows that. The American people deserve to know what happened, \nwho caused it, and what we are going to do about it.\n  It does not just lie under the jurisdiction of one committee. It \ncrosses all lines, and it should be composed, frankly, of the most \nqualified people and staff we can come up with. So I urge my \ncolleagues, in the interest not of specific committee jurisdiction but \nin the argument that this crisis, in its size and severity, is nearly \nunprecedented in American history and requires extraordinary actions. \nThat is not business as usual.\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside any partisan or jurisdictional \ndifferences and vote in favor of an immediate appointment of a select \ncommittee to immediately address this crisis which has affected the \nUnited States of America in the most painful fashion.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota, who fits the best and finest \nand most admirable definition of a prairie populist. I thank him and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on the particular matter, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nhave spoken about the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, and I \nassume the chairman of the Rules Committee will speak about it. I also \nunderstand that Senators Schumer and Coburn have amendments. I urge \nthem to come to the floor because there has been a request for a vote \non the Isakson-Conrad amendment. I will not make a unanimous consent \nrequest at the moment, but it is our intent to have a vote on that \naround 4:20, 4:30--on the Isakson-Conrad amendment.\n  I understand, because of budget matters that come up tomorrow, there \nis an intent to try to finish this bill tonight. We can finish this \nbill tonight. I hope we could finish it before 6 or 7 or 8 o'clock. \nHaving an Irish father and Italian mother, I come with a hopeful \nattitude by nature. But I note we will have a vote around 4:30, 4:20 or \n4:30.\n  There are a number of matters. I see the distinguished and able \nchairman of the Banking Committee here. There are a number of matters \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I will let him speak \nto that.\n  I urge Senators who have amendments to bring them to the floor \nbecause as soon as we have no amendments apparently here, we are going \nto try to move to final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, commend our colleague \nfrom Vermont for his work on the underlying subject matter, which is of \ngreat importance not only to the Senate but to the American people, to \ndeal with issues of fraud and related matters. I think it is \ntremendously helpful.\n  I was not on the floor. I apologize to my colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Isakson, and to Senator Conrad, with whom I have joined in \noffering their proposal to establish a commission to examine, as the \nSenator from Arizona has accurately pointed out, and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota pointed out, the most serious economic crisis in the last \n100 years of our Nation. This is a matter that not only deserves our \nattention, in terms of what steps we take as legislators to avoid the \nkind of problems we are witnessing today, but also, I think \nimportantly, to look back as to how we ended up in this situation over \nthe last several years.\n  Going back, it all didn't begin a year ago or 2 years ago, but \ndecisions that were made as many as 20 years ago--15, 10 years ago--had \nan awful lot to do with the problems that emerged, particularly in the \narea of residential mortgage foreclosures that became the root cause of \nthe economic collapse.\n  There is no debate about whether we ought to look back. At least I \ndon't see any. I think it is critically important, as other Congresses \nat other moments in our Nation's history when confronted with other \ncrises have done. Whether it was the great Civil War, the\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\nsinking of the Titanic, the so-called Pecora Commission--which was \nnamed for the legal counsel of the Senate Banking Committee during the \nGreat Depression, looking back, obviously, the 9/11 Commission. There \nis example after example. The only question that remains for us to \ndecide here is what is the best way to do this.\n  Senator Isakson, Senator Conrad, myself, and others who may join us, \nbelieve the outside commission is probably the best alternative, given \nthe magnitude of the problem that must be examined. I think it will \ntake a significant amount of hard work by some very talented and \nknowledgeable people over the next year, year and a half or so to do \nthe job. Or do we engage in the same effort internally in this body \nwith a select committee made up of Members of the Senate who would have \nto pretty much dedicate almost their entire time, in my view, to that \nsubject matter at the very time we are trying to step forward with some \nanswers that will provide some solutions as to how we avoid pitfalls.\n  Obviously, we were not waiting in the Banking Committee. Senator \nShelby and I, my very able and competent former chairman of the \ncommittee and today ranking member, have already had, I think, some 15 \nor 16 hearings just since the end of January on the subject matter--the \nPresiding Officer is a distinguished member of our committee--on how we \ncreate the architecture to go forward and fill in the gaps so we don't \nend up with the same kind of problems that created the situation we are \nin. We cannot wait until the next Congress to do that. I believe it \nincumbent on us to come up with some answers to that in this Congress. \nWe are working very hard on exactly that effort. There are some other \nmatters we have to pay attention to, but that, I would argue, is the \nprincipal job of our committee in this the 111th Congress.\n  I know other committees are deeply involved. The Finance Committee is \ndeeply involved in health care. Senator Max Baucus and Senator Chuck \nGrassley are going to be spending virtually every waking hour over the \nnext several months, along with Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, on \nthe Health and Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, not to mention \nothers, dealing with that issue.\n  We have the climate change issues. We have the budgetary matters. \nSenator Conrad and his committee, along with Judd Gregg from New \nHampshire, are deeply involved in the budgetary questions.\n  When you start talking about forming a select committee made up of \nMembers of this body, some of the very people on the Finance Committee, \nthe Banking Committee, the Budget Committee, are already consumed with \nmajor responsibilities. The likelihood that a group of ourselves here \ncould dedicate the time and the effort that needs to be dedicated to \nthe examination of this issue while simultaneously trying to get our \neconomy back on its feet again, I think is asking an awful lot.\n  My disagreement with my very good friend, and he knows this, my close \nfriend from North Dakota, along with John McCain, with whom I have had \na very good and positive relationship over the years, is not about \nwhether we ought to do this--there is no debate about that--but where \nis the best venue for this to occur.\n  Let me make a second argument to my colleagues. This has already been \na pretty acrimonious debate regrettably, but it has turned into that. \nThere was a lot of finger-pointing going on. None of us may like that \nindividually, but it is what it is. I think to the extent we can ask \nthe body, that is a political body in nature, to kind of do the job \nwithout engaging in some of that ``blame the other guy for the problems \nwe have'' is unavoidable. I don't think any of us objectively believe \nthat is a very good way to proceed. We are not going to get very much \nout of it if that becomes what happens in these select committees, \nmaking sure someone else gets responsibility for the difficulty. \nBelieve me, there is a lot of responsibility to go around.\n\n  But I believe if you end up having that kind of framework you are \ninviting that kind of environment and I think the last thing this body \nneeds at this hour is to be seen as engaging in nothing more than the \npolitics of the blame game.\n  I argue, again, that an outside commission made up of people who are \nknowledgeable, coming from the world of finance, academia, labor, \nconsumers, others, who could dedicate the time and effort along with a \ncompetent staff to work with them and reporting back to us, the \ncommittees that have jurisdiction, as they uncover evidence or ideas \nthat would help us fill in these gaps that we need to do legislatively, \nmakes more sense. For that reason, I commend Senator Isakson, who is \nthe principal author of this. Senator Conrad has joined him, as I have \nand my staff. We worked together over the last number of days. Senator \nShelby's staff has also been tremendously constructive and positive \ntrying to put together this idea that would make sense to our \ncolleagues.\n  That is the difference. Do we go with a select committee made up of \nourselves--and certainly every committee that has some jurisdiction on \nthis would want some members on the committee. The idea that we would \nask a group of us who have nothing to do with the subject matter to \nbecome part of the select committee also works counter to what we are \ntrying to achieve, and so the Members who have jurisdiction, I assume, \nwould insist on being a part of it.\n  Which subcommittee chairs it? How do you decide how big that \ncommittee is? All these are matters which could end up dividing us, \nwhen our job ought primarily to be to find out what went on and utilize \na means that would help us achieve that and then, more importantly, to \ndo our jobs to make sure the very problems and gaps that existed to \nallow this problem to emerge are taken in so we plug those, in effect, \nor mend those in a way and help create that architecture that would \nallow our economy to grow, the confidence to be restored, and the sense \nof optimism to come back to our country.\n  I am very complimentary of my colleague from North Dakota for talking \nsome weeks ago. He is not a Johnny-come-lately to the issue. He argued \nfor this idea of looking back. I thought about it a lot and have been \ntrying to determine which way is the best for us to proceed. It is \nalways with some regret when you disagree with a friend--not about the \ngoals. In that there is an absolutely common interest. But which of the \nmethods should we use to help us achieve those goals? I believe our \ncolleague from Georgia and our colleague, ironically, from North Dakota \nas well--the two Senators from North Dakota are kind of on opposite \nideas of this issue. Not on the issue of what we ought to achieve but \nrather----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We are not on opposite sides, necessarily. I said I \nsupport the Isakson-Conrad-Dodd Commission; I don't think it is a case \nof either/or. I think it is a case where both are necessary. But I wish \nto make the point I am not at odds with my colleague from my State or \nSenator Dodd or Senator Isakson on this issue.\n  Mr. DODD. I stand corrected on that point. I appreciate my colleague \nmaking that correction.\n  That is my case, basically. I don't know what my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson, or my colleague, Senator Conrad, had to say \nabout this, about how this might have to be constructed, but this may \nbe a choice we have to make in the coming half-hour or an hour or so, \nas to which of these ideas we will use. The idea that we do both gets a \nlittle complicated but, nonetheless, sometimes as an institution we are \ninclined to take the course or the path of least resistance on these \nmatters, which sometimes can even add to more difficulties down the \nroad.\n  But I urge my colleagues to support the Isakson-Conrad-Dodd proposal. \nWe think it makes a great deal of sense to achieve that very important \ngoal while simultaneously allowing this institution to perform the \nfunction many would expect us to fill and that is to start crafting the \nstructures that would allow the modernization of our financial \ninstitutions in a responsible and thoughtful manner. That work alone, \nas the Presiding Officer knows, is going to be almost all consuming in \nthe coming weeks.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for their \nattention on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I, too, rise in support, as I have \nindicated earlier, in support of the proposal that was offered by my \ncolleagues, Senator Isakson, Senator Conrad, Senator Dodd. I think it \nis a worthy thing. As I indicated, I offered a Taxpayer Protection Act \nin late January that included a commission involved in that 5-step \nproposal. But I think they have dramatically improved on that. I think \nthis bill they have offered is one worthy of support, and I certainly \nsupport it. I think an outside commission makes a great deal of sense.\n  But as I indicated, it is not either/or. It cannot and should not be \neither/or. This notion that somehow this is too much politics in the \nCongress to be evaluating what has happened here and what you need to \ndo about it--I don't know. John F. Kennedy used to say that every \nmother kind of hopes her child might be able to grow up to be \nPresident, as long as they don't have to be active in politics. Oh, \nyeah? Politics is what we do. The political system is the system in \nwhich we make decisions. I happen to agree--the New York Times wrote a \npiece about this, and I agree with it fully:\n\n       The investigation should not be performed by outside \n     experts . . . whose report the Congress is free to accept or \n     reject. It should be a part of the Congressional process and \n     include an investigator with subpoena power and the right to \n     participate in the questioning of witnesses, as well as to \n     prep lawmakers for the hearings.\n\n  Let me make this point. This is not either/or. I support this \nCommission. This Commission makes sense. My colleague from Georgia is \nhere, and I wish my colleague from North Dakota were here because, as I \nread the proposal of theirs, they have done some good work. I strongly \nsupport it.\n  But let me make this point. In addition to an outside commission \ntaking a look outside of this institution, it is this Congress that has \noffered up $700 billion of funding to the Secretary of the Treasury. \nThat is what this Congress has done: Here is $700 billion. We are the \nones who appropriate the money. Accountability exists to do what is \nnecessary to find out what has happened, to do the master narrative of \nwhat has occurred here and what are the things we can and must and \nshould learn from that.\n  Let me describe a select committee. Let me describe a committee in \n1940 named the Truman Committee. Harry S. Truman on the floor of this \nSenate, with a member of his own party in the White House, said there \nis unbelievable waste and fraud going on in defense spending and we \nought to investigate it. They investigated for 7 years with a special \ncommittee. They did 60 hearings a year. Think of that. The committee \nspent $15,000 to be created and saved the taxpayers $15 billion over 7 \nyears.\n  What an unbelievable value that was for the Senate to have done, the \nTruman Committee. In fact, you know, I spoke a while back to Herman \nWouk, one of the great authors in America, the author of ``War and \nRemembrance'' and so many other great works. He is in his nineties, one \nof America's great authors. He is still writing, by the way.\n  One of the things he talked about, he said, I do not know a lot going \nforward, but I know from about 1950 back, 1945 back.\n  He talked about the Truman Committee as a part of the history of what \nthe Senate has done in the middle of the Second World War, a special \ncommittee established by the Senate, the Truman Committee, bipartisan, \nsubpoena power, 60 hearings a year, 7 years. Saved the taxpayers $15 \nbillion, we are told.\n  Well, you know, I am on the floor with my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, because both of us believe there is a requirement for a \nselect committee in this case. The Truman Committee, Kefauver Committee \non Organized Crime, Church Committee, Kerry-McCain on POWs-MIAs I mean \nthere have been a lot of examples of committees that have done some \nextraordinary work here on very big issues.\n  I said before my colleague from Connecticut came in something that \nwill embarrass him, I am sure. I said the Banking Committee with my \ncolleagues Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby is doing extraordinary work \nthat most of us are not aware of, because we are not sitting over there \nhour after hour after hour trying to put together the notions of what \nare the solutions to get us out of this ditch.\n  The Banking Committee has done extraordinary work and continues to do \nit and will be required to do that for months now to try to lift this \ncountry. So my hat is off to the work of Senator Dodd, the leadership \nhe offers us, and all of those who are working on the Banking \nCommittee. This proposal for a select committee is not a reflection on \ntheir work at all.\n  But I would say this: There is not one committee in the Congress--\nthat includes the Banking Committee--there is not one committee here \nthat has anything more than three or four or five investigators at \nbest. No committee has the capability that ought to exist and ought to \nbe required to discharge the responsibilities that fall on the \nshoulders of this Congress and this Senate, in my judgment.\n  I know the Speaker of the House last week talked about a Pecora \ncommittee. In fact, they called it a Pecora Commission. Pecora, that \nwas not a select committee, but that was right after the financial \ncollapse and the Great Depression. He held a lot of hearings, a lot of \nhearings. He was I believe the chief counsel to the Senate Banking \nCommittee. History records the Pecora committee or Commission, the \nPecora effort. We remember it in 2009 it was so significant, because he \nwas looking back.\n  Senator Dodd does not have that luxury at the moment. We have got to \nlook forward and lift this country up and put the economy back \ntogether. And we have got to do it in a hurry. We do not have 3 years \nor 5 years. We have got to lift this country out of this ditch. This is \na financial crisis unlike anything we have seen since the Great \nDepression. So they do not have a lot of luxury over in the Banking \nCommittee to say, you know what, we are going to spend a lot of time \nlooking in the rearview mirror. But I will tell you this: If we do not \nfully understand the narrative of what has happened here, we are \ndestined someday to repeat it. We are destined to allow it to happen \nagain.\n  I said this, and this relates to the underlying bill on the floor \nthat Senators Leahy, Grassley, and others have brought here. Go to the \nInternet today and take a look at this. This is one. I could have \nbrought many. This is a company who says--it is called \nspeedybadcreditloans.com.\n  After all we have faced and the financial collapse and the subprime \nloan scandal, with a bunch of bad actors leaving with hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of ill-gotten gains and leaving victims in their \nwake all over this country, massive foreclosures and the financial \ncollapse--after all of this, go to the Internet today, and find a \ncompany that is called speedybadcreditloans. They say on the Internet: \nDo you have bad credit? That is okay. Do you have no credit? That is \nall right. Do you have bankruptcy? No problem. Come and get a loan from \nus. Is that unbelievable? Just unbelievable.\n  There is one more, CC Financial Group. If you have bad credit, you \ngot poor credit--I could do 40 of these, by the way--come to us. We can \nget you into your dream home, by the way. They say: With all of these \nvalues due to foreclosures and short sales, now is the time. Got bad \ncredit, got an appetite to get a new home.\n  I wonder if they are doing what those mortgage companies did that \nsteered us into the ditch to say to potential borrowers: Hey, come over \nhere. You are paying $700 a month house payments. You know what, we \nwill give you a mortgage to pay $200 a month. Why should you pay more \nthan triple what you ought to pay? You get a mortgage from us, $200 a \nmonth. Oh, by the way, you do not even have to document your income. We \ndo not care. We will charge you an extra quarter percent, but you do \nnot have to document it. Well, maybe 2.25 percent will be your new \nmortgage, maybe $210 a month. We are going to put a little deal in \nthere, it is going to reset in 3 years, it is going to be 12 percent. \nThat may be a problem, but do not worry, that home value is going like \nthat. You can sell it if there is a problem. But we are going to allow \nthat to reset. And we are not going to mention this to you. We are \ngoing to put a prepayment penalty in it so you cannot get out of this.\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\n  Then what we are going to do is we are going to wrap it into a big \npiece of sausage, like they used to fill sausage with filler. Then we \nare going to chop it up and we are going to sell it. We have got hedge \nfunds and investment banks that are yearning for these kinds of \ninstruments. So we sell the risk. I am a big old mortgage company that \nadvertises: We want bankrupt people to come to us. We want people with \nbad credit to come borrow with us, because, you know what, we are not \ngoing to sit across the desk and look into their eyeballs to see \nwhether they can repay this loan. No, we are not going to do that. We \nare going to sell the risk. So we do not have to do what is called \nunderwriting. That means sitting across the desk, and the lender \nevaluates whether the borrower can actually repay it. It is the old way \nyou used to do things, not the modern way. It is the old way. You do \nnot have to underwrite if you are going to sell the risk. In fact, sell \nit two or three times.\n  Then, by the way, when someone is being foreclosed upon, the new \ntechnique is to say in court: Show us the original mortgage. And they \nare having a devil of a time trying to find an original mortgage \nbecause it has been sold upstream. Disconnect the borrower and the \nlender from the risk--well, not the borrower, but the lender from the \nrisk. And meanwhile they are all making massive amounts of money.\n  You know, the year before last, I looked up to see who was the \nbiggest income earner in the country in the middle of this unbelievable \navalanche of financial good news. Who earned the biggest income in the \ncountry, individually?\n  Well, a guy who ran a hedge fund earned the biggest income, $3.6 \nbillion. Now, that person earned in 3.5 minutes what the average worker \nin America earned in a year. When that person comes home and says: I \nhad a pretty good day, and the spouse says: Well, honey, how are you \nfeeling?\n  Well, I made $10 million today.\n  Mr. President, $10 million every day. How is it that people were \nworking those kinds of stratospheric incomes, $3.6 billion, or even \nmuch lower, a CEO from one of the biggest mortgage banks in the country \nthat went belly up, and he left with a couple of hundred million \ndollars, much lower income? How is it they ended up with all of this \nmoney? They ended up with all of this money by creating all kinds of \nfancy instruments and getting payments by moving all kinds of money \naround and a lot of victims in their wake. So the question is, what do \nyou do about all of this? Well, the first thing to try to understand \nhere is what has happened. I am talking now about subprime mortgages.\n  But you know what, that is one piece. It is like a book with several \nchapters, many chapters. It is one piece. But I am describing how \nunbelievable this piece is. So the question is, what do we know at this \npoint? What really do we know about what has happened that has caused \nthis collapse?\n  I talked about dark money a bit ago. Debt helped cause this collapse. \nSome of that is here. Federal budget debt. Federal trade debt, by the \nway, $800 billion a year trade debt. That is money we owe to other \ncountries, $800 billion a year.\n  So debt, part of our responsibility. Somebody said to me, well, it is \nthe Federal Government that is spending more than it has. I said: Oh, \nreally, have you taken a look at credit card debt and household debt? \nDoubled in a reasonably short period of time. Corporate debt. Take a \nlook at household and credit card and corporate debt. Dramatic \nincreases. Take a look at Federal debt by the Congress. Substantial \nincreases. Trade debt. Debt is a problem. We know that.\n\n  Deregulation. You decide, you know what, we are going to loosen the \nrules and not look. We will hire regulators who want to boast that they \ndo not have the foggiest interest in seeing what is happening. Boy, \nthat is a recipe for disaster. And yet that is exactly the case. Dark \nmoney, all of this money.\n  Did anybody know I wrote a piece in 1994, 1994, that was the cover \nstory for the Washington Monthly magazine? My article was the cover \nstory for the Washington Monthly magazine 15 years ago that was titled: \n``Very Risky Business.'' It was about the notion that at that point \nthere were $40 to $50 trillion dollars of notional value of derivatives \nin this country. So there is a lot to discuss about the narrative of \nwhat has happened with this financial crisis. Some take the position \nthat we should do only a commission and they oppose a select committee \nof the Senate. I support a commission because I think that would \nprovide another view, another way of outside experts. I think as I said \nbefore my colleague from Georgia came in, Senator Isakson and Senator \nConrad have produced a piece of legislation that I think is very \nsmartly done, very well crafted, makes a lot of sense. I stand here to \nstrongly support it.\n  But I disagree with my other colleague who seemed to suggest that it \nis an either/or. Doing an outside commission does not absolve the \nresponsibility of the Congress, in, I think, one of the most \nsignificant and momentous events of our lifetime, that is, the \nfinancial collapse that has, at its root, so many different causes.\n  It does not absolve us of the responsibility to do what is necessary \nto investigate that cause, understand it, and make sure it can never \nhappen again.\n  Again, let me read from the editorial I started with from the New \nYork Times:\n\n       Investigation needs to be a part of the Congressional \n     process, and include an investigator with subpoena power and \n     the right to participate in the questioning of witnesses, as \n     well as to prep lawmakers for the hearings [and so on.]\n\n  We have done that in the past with the Watergate hearings. We have \ndone it in the past with the Church hearings. We have done it in the \npast with the Truman Committee, which I think is a shrine to what this \nCongress can and should do when it puts its mind to it.\n  If we decide we cannot do it now and should not do it now, we will \nhave missed a very significant opportunity, and we will have abrogated \na significant responsibility of this Congress. It is our job as well. \nSo I stand here to say, I strongly support the commission proposal. We \nwill vote for it. I am very pleased my colleagues have offered it.\n  But I also believe, as Senator McCain does, that there is more to do \nand there is a responsibility that cannot be delegated. And that \nresponsibility that cannot be delegated is our responsibility to \nempanel a select committee to do what is necessary to investigate from \nthe standpoint of the Congress what has happened to cause this very \nsubstantial financial crisis.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment, and I \noffer the amendment I have described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me withhold my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will withhold that request for a moment. While I am \nwaiting, let me say that the underlying bill we are dealing with is a \npiece of legislation that will address the opportunity to prosecute, \nwhich is another issue, prosecute wrongdoing and illegal behavior and \nsome of these financial shenanigans that we have seen and that I have \ndiscussed.\n  The underlying bill as well as a piece of legislation is something I \nwould strongly support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis comments with regard to the commission. I want to reiterate what I \nsaid in my earlier speech. When I thought about this, when I watched my \nkids' 529s, when I watched my own savings for retirement, when I saw \nwhat was happening to men and women across the United States, I felt \nthis was a situation that needed a forensic audit, maybe even an \nautopsy. The damage had already been done. There were multiple factors \nthat led to it. I am not smart enough--I don't know that anybody is--to \nput a finger on exactly where the blame lies, but I know this: To not \nfind the problems and cure them would be a mistake on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Without talking about the select committee as a pro or a con, I want \nto say why I didn't go that route with this legislation. We are part of \nwhat needs to be scrutinized--the Senate. We are part of what needs to \nbe seen. If we left this just strictly to a select committee,\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\nit would be like appointing the board of directors to AIG to tell us \nwhat went wrong with AIG. It wouldn't be a good autopsy. It wouldn't be \nobjective. Senator Conrad and I have tried to put together a piece of \nlegislation that no one could say is partisan, that no one could say is \nloaded, that is objective, that gives subpoena power to individuals who \nhave the credibility, the knowledge, and the past experience to \nevaluate the highly technical derivatives, the highly technical hedge \nfunds, and the rules of trading on the Securities and Exchange \nCommission.\n  We may need a select committee for oversight if our committees can't \ndo oversight. But we do not need a select committee to investigate the \ncollapse that has happened. We need an independent body, independent of \nthis body. We need them to have the power and the funds necessary to \nget the answers to the problem so we can objectively say we exposed \nourselves to the same scrutiny to which we wish to expose everybody \nelse. We will have the recommendations of what went wrong, who might \nhave done wrong, and if there were criminal acts on the part of \nsomebody, referrals to the Justice Department.\n  This is a clean, targeted, bipartisan, specific approach to address \nthe No. 1 financial problem the American people are facing today, and \nthat is the collapse of their savings and the retirement and college \neducation funds of millions of Americans.\n  I appreciate the endorsement of the Senator from North Dakota, but I \nwant to make sure we understand that a select committee would be no \nsubstitute for this independent commission at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \nunderlying bill, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, and in \nparticular about its impact on detecting fraud in the housing industry. \nFirst, however, let me offer my appreciation to the senior Senator from \nVermont for bringing forward this important piece of legislation for \nour consideration. We all know the grave nature of the economic crisis \nwe are in. Oregon has been hit particularly hard. The unemployment rate \nin Oregon is 12.1 percent. It has nearly doubled in just over 6 months, \nthe second highest unemployment rate in the Nation. Oregonians are \ngoing into foreclosure at record rates. This legislation, by giving law \nenforcement additional tools, will help stop the bleeding and begin the \nprocess of addressing an underlying problem that caused this crisis, \ndeceptive practices in the mortgage industry.\n  The bill before us today is straightforward but important. It gives \nthe Government the extra tools and resources it needs to combat, \nidentify, and prosecute financial fraud. As the Federal Government \nspends billions to bring stability to the economy, the modest amount of \nmoney authorized in this bill will go a long way to protect our \ninvestments and return money to the taxpayer.\n  Let me highlight just how important this effort is in the area of \nhousing. A lot of attention has been paid to the rising number of \nforeclosures and the havoc these foreclosures are wreaking on the \nhousing market. But not so much attention has been paid to the role \nfraud has played in causing these foreclosures.\n  Just last month, HUD's interim report on the root causes of the \nforeclosure crisis found that 1 in 10 delinquencies in this crisis has \nbeen associated with some form of fraud. That means this week alone \n5,000 families will lose their homes to foreclosure as a result of \nfraud. That is 5,000 families too many.\n  Mortgage fraud is at an all-time high. The Mortgage Asset Research \nInstitute has found that mortgage fraud increased by 26 percent from \n2007 to 2008. Sadly, this number is only growing as new schemes come \nforward seeking to defraud Americans of the financial foundation of \ntheir future.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. In one widespread fraud, buyers \nwith stolen identities bought homes. If the value of the homes went up, \nthey sold the homes and cashed in. If the value of the homes went down, \nthey walked away, leaving not only a vacant home but leaving the \nunsuspecting victim of identity theft in a very difficult situation.\n  In another case identified by HUD, defrauders inflated home values \nthrough bogus appraisals, fabricated borrowed deposit amounts, \nfalsified loan documents to obtain FHA-insured mortgages, and HUD lost \n$2.3 million on just 30 mortgages. Over 9,000 FHA loans have entered \ninto default after no or only one payment, a particular sign of fraud.\n  HUD's inspector general has done much to address this. The office \ncaptured $2 billion in questionable expenses, obtained $80 million in \nrestitution money, and closed over 1,000 cases. That is a significant \neffort. But it is only the tip of the iceberg. That is why this fraud \nact we are considering today is so important. It takes a significant \nstep in restoring an investigative unit that was largely dismantled in \n2003 under the Bush administration. It expands the inspector general's \nstaff. It takes an important step to restore investigative capabilities \nwhich are so important to protecting the vital nature of the American \nhousing market. In these extraordinary economic times, we need to be \nespecially vigilant against new forms of fraud.\n  I am thinking now of the predatory foreclosure scams that so many of \nmy Oregon constituents have been talking about. These scams engage in \ndeeply deceptive practices and sometimes outright fraud. The worst of \nthese schemes falsely promised homeowners a way out of foreclosure if \nthey put up a small fee of several thousand dollars. In one such scam--\nI will call the couple John and Mary who were affected. They are 70 \nyears old and 66 years old, respectively, hard-working Oregonians. John \nis a self-employed trucker. Most of his business is generated from \nhauling debris from the demolition of houses. His business has declined \nwith the fall-off of new construction.\n  In the course of things, John and Mary struggled to keep up their \nmortgage payments. They reached out to their servicer--at the time it \nwas Countrywide--to explore their options but couldn't connect and get \nanyone to work with them on their mortgage. But telemarketers started \ncalling with offers to help them modify their mortgage for $2,000 or \n$3,000. It is fortunate that John and Mary didn't sign any of these \ncontracts but instead contacted my office. We connected them with a \nHUD-approved housing counselor who was able to help them modify their \nloan and get back on a straight path.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what might have happened; that is, a scam \nin which not only is the family facing foreclosure asked to put up a \nfee, but they are asked to sign over their house to the firm, and then \nthey are converted into being a renter. When they miss a rent payment, \nthey are evicted from their house. So not only do they lose their \ninvestment, they lose a place to live. They can go from a homeowner in \nslight trouble to homeless in short order.\n  These scams are unacceptable. It is our job to step forward and \nprotect the American people. We must fireproof our mortgage lending \nbusiness and ban deceptive and risky practices. In the coming days, I \nand others will be offering and working on legislation to reestablish \nsound practices in the mortgage finance markets. But today we consider \na significant act that empowers our officials to lay down a firebreak \nagainst the most blatant forms of fraud. I encourage colleagues to \nsupport it. It is an important step. Let's work together to protect \nAmerican homeowners.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to amendment No. 995 at 4:32 p.m. today and \nthat the 4 minutes immediately prior to the vote be equally divided and \ncontrolled between myself and Senator Isakson or our designees; that no \namendment be in order to the amendment prior to a vote in relation \nthereto; and upon disposition of amendment\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nNo. 995, Senator Dorgan be recognized to offer his select committee \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the chairman for the 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, Senator Conrad and I have worked very diligently for \n3\\1/2\\ months to create a platform in which we can get the answers the \nAmerican people deserve and need with regard to the financial collapse \nthat happened to this country. We have created a bipartisan commission \nthat has no elected officials on it--all experts are within their \nchosen fields--a commission that has both subpoena power and the \nfunding necessary to do precisely what the 9/11 Commission did. It is \nstructured in the same way except targeted on the investigation of the \nfinancial markets, the securities markets, the commodities markets, \nFreddie Mac, Fannie Mae, the financial services market, the hedge \nfunds, and every other institution that had a part in what has been a \ncollapse of our economic system and a great decline in the value of \nequity for our people, college savings for their children, and \nretirement for their future.\n  I urge colleagues to vote favorably on the creation of the Financial \nMarkets Commission.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, has the Senator from Georgia requested a \nrollcall vote?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I consulted with Senator Dodd and Senator \nConrad, both of whom want a rollcall.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield back all time and ask that the \nrollcall vote start now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 995.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 92, nays 4, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 161 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--92\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--4\n\n     Bunning\n     Grassley\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Kennedy\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n  The amendment (No. 995) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, is offering an amendment. We are not going to \nhave any more votes tonight. If there is a vote required, we will add \nit to whatever we have to vote on tomorrow morning. The managers are \nhere, willing to take whatever amendments they think are appropriate \ntonight.\n  As I have indicated to the Republican leader, we are going to finish \nthis bill this week, and we are going to finish the budget, getting it \nto conference this week. We hope we can do it in a real short week; \notherwise, we will have to work into the weekend, which we don't want \nto do and there is no reason to do that. I have a couple of meetings I \nhave to attend tonight involving the Speaker and the President, so we \ncan't have any more votes tonight. I apologize to everyone if they \nwanted to vote late tonight. I don't think we will be able to do that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Nevada, the distinguished majority leader. I will stay here for a \nfew minutes, if there are some amendments pending. If there are some \namendments pending that we could take by voice vote, I am perfectly \nwilling to do that tonight. If there are rollcalls, if there are \namendments people think will need rollcalls, I don't know what time the \ndistinguished leader wants to go back on the bill in the morning, but I \nwould suggest that if we start early on that----\n  Mr. REID. If my friend would yield, we will have no morning business \ntomorrow, so we will go to this bill early. But sometime tomorrow we \nare going to have to go to the budget and conference, so we should, by \n1 or 2 o'clock, do our best to finish this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then if I might further inquire of the leader--and I think \nthat is perfectly fair--I intend that at such time as there are no \namendments pending, or no amendments pending that people actually \nexpect to go forward, we will go to final passage.\n  This is a bill that saves taxpayers' money but more importantly \nprotects a lot of people who are being preyed upon by people wanting to \ndefraud them out of their homes, out of their retirement, out of the \nmoney they have saved for their children to go to college. So I think, \nwith what is happening--and it has been proven--all of these frauds \nthat have taken place all over the country, the last thing in the world \nthe American people want to see is us delay it.\n  I thank the distinguished leader for bringing up this bill this week. \nIt is my intention--my hope, anyway--to have it finished by noon \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would also say to my friend that he \ncovered everything except that this is a bipartisan bill, it is as \nbipartisan as any bill could be, and there shouldn't be any problem. If \npeople have amendments, the managers of the bill have been ready for \nthose amendments all day.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would note further to the leader that Senator Grassley, \nwho is not only the chief sponsor, but we have a dozen or so sponsors \non both sides of the aisle--Senator Grassley and I worked very closely \nwith a number of Senators to work out amendments. The first amendment \nwe brought up was one we worked on with Senator Kyl on, and I think \nthat passed 95 to 1, or something like that. So we are ready to work \nwith people, but we will finish this bill soon.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 999\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a select committee of the Senate to make a \n    thorough and complete study and investigation of the facts and \n  circumstances giving rise to the economic crisis facing the United \n States and to make recommendations to prevent a future recurrence of \n                             such a crisis)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I can offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 999.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have spoken on this amendment \npreviously. I have spoken of the underlying bill Senator Leahy and \nSenator Grassley and others have brought to the floor and my admiration \nfor that bill. That bill falls right in with what the responsibility of \nthe Senate should be at this point. I commend them for that. It is not \nmy intention, nor would it be the intention of my colleague, Senator \nMcCain, as we offer this amendment to in any way interrupt the \nlegislation on the floor. We believe our amendment enhances it.\n  Second, let me say to my colleague, Senator Dodd, the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, I have spoken at length about what they are doing to \ntry to put the pieces together to lift this country out of the ditch \nand try to figure out how to put this financial system together in a \nway that makes it work again.\n  Having said all of that, I indicated earlier that I offered an \namendment with my colleague, Senator McCain, that would establish a \nselect committee of the Senate, in the tradition of the Truman \nCommittee and the Watergate Committee and other select committees, to \ntry to do a narrative of what has happened with respect to the \nfinancial crisis. I believe that a commission is fine, but we cannot \ndelegate all responsibility. There is a responsibility for Congress to \ndo comprehensive oversight on this issue, which I think is the largest \nfinancial issue we have faced--the financial crisis, the financial \ncollapse--since the Great Depression.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand there is a request for a \nrollcall on the Senator's amendment. I was not going to ask for one, as \nhe knows. I wonder if he would have any problem with a unanimous \nconsent agreement that when we come back on the bill in the morning, \nhis amendment will be the pending amendment and there be 10 minutes a \nside, and we then proceed to a vote on it.\n  I am throwing this out as a suggestion, so my colleagues will hear \nit. For one thing, rather than spend several hours on the same \namendment in the morning, or tonight, perhaps we will be able to do \nthis: I say to the floor staff that this is a unanimous consent request \nthat I will be making. I do not intend to make a unanimous consent \nrequest at this time. I will soon make this request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would certainly agree with that. It is a \nfair request. Let me finish so my colleague, Senator McCain, can say a \nfew words as well.\n  This amendment doesn't do a disservice to the underlying bill. It is \nexactly in the tradition of what the Senate ought to do. We cannot \ndelegate the responsibility. This financial crisis has imposed an \nenormous burden on this country. All of us hope and pray that we can \nlift this country out of this difficulty. We are all working to do \neverything we can.\n  Do you know what. We need to understand what is the dimension, the \nnarrative of what happened, what caused all of this, and make sure we \nput into place things that will prevent it from happening again. That \nis our responsibility. In the grand tradition of the Senate of select \ncommittees on big issues, this ought to be a bipartisan select \ncommittee with subpoena power to understand what happened and to make \nsure it can never happen again. That is why I have offered this with \nSenator McCain.\n  I have one final point. I hope we will be able to get you to take \nthis without a recorded vote. Maybe only one person in the Senate has \nsuggested maybe a recorded vote is necessary. We can talk to this \nperson, and we can talk to that person. Whatever the request will be by \nthe chairman, I will be amenable to it.\n  I yield the floor so that my colleague from Arizona may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and floor manager for his cooperation. We are trying to get \nthe request for a recorded vote vitiated. Right now, there is a request \non this side for a recorded vote. Whatever, I know the distinguished \nmanager wants to move forward with the bill. We are ready to dispense \nwith it as quickly as possible. Senator Dorgan and I have spoken at \nsufficient length.\n  I thank Senator Dorgan again for this very important legislation. Why \nis it important? Mr. President, America is in the midst of the greatest \neconomic crisis of our lifetime. The American people are angry and \nconfused. They have a right to know what caused this. But, most of all, \nthey have a right to know the path out so that we can prevent it from \never happening again to the American people.\n  All the cards have to be put on the table. Everything that happened \nthat caused this--somebody called it a ``house of cards'' that \ncollapsed. Many Americans lost homes, jobs, health insurance, and their \nvery futures. They deserve to know. The most effective way to do that, \nin my view, is a select committee.\n  I have seen select committees in action before. They have been \nefficient and effective. The American people have a right to know what \ncaused this train wreck and how we can prevent it from ever happening \nagain. I hope my colleagues cannot only voice-vote it but put enough \npressure on so that we could act immediately with the appointment of \nthis select committee with subpoena powers, which I am confident will \nhave bipartisan participation, bipartisan support, and the nonpartisan \nsupport of the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just make another brief comment \nabout the amendment that is pending. I will be mercifully brief. I \nmentioned earlier the grand tradition of the Senate, as demonstrated by \nthe Truman committee, Harry Truman, a former Member of this body, who \nhad a select committee established in 1940 to investigate waste and \nabuse and fraud with respect to defense contracting. When I talked \nabout the Truman committee, I said I had talked to one of America's \ngreat authors, Herman Wouk. I mentioned his book, ``War and \nRemembrance.'' He also wrote ``Winds of War'' and ``Caine Mutiny.'' He \nis an unbelievably wonderful man who is now 92 or 93 years old. I had \nthe opportunity, last year and the year before, to visit with him. He \nis still writing; he is writing a new work. He talked about the Truman \ncommittee. He said something interesting because he wrote so much about \nespecially the Second World War.\n  He said, ``I don't know much beyond 1945, but I know everything just \nbefore 1945.'' He put it in his wonderful books. Then he talked about \nthe contracting going on in Iraq and the stories of waste, fraud, and \nabuse--perhaps the greatest waste, fraud, and abuse in this country--\nthose are my words. He said, ``You ought to create a Truman \ncommittee.'' He described to me the select committee headed by Harry \nTruman.\n  I went back and read the record of what they did in 1940--Truman with \na member of his own party in the White House. He traveled around the \ncountry to military installations and met with contractors on military \nbases, and he concluded there needed to be an investigation. They put \ntogether a bipartisan committee with subpoena power. It cost $15,000 to \ncreate a select committee and it met for 7 years and held 60 hearings a \nyear and it saved the taxpayers by cutting down on the waste and abuse \nin defense contracting. They did it in the middle of a war. Think of \nit.\n  My point earlier, when I mentioned Herman Wouk, was to describe the \nTruman committee in the grand tradition of what the Senate can do when \nit should do what is necessary to make certain that the economy works \nand the taxpayers' money is spent effectively. So now we find ourselves \nin a circumstance unlike any we faced in my lifetime--an unbelievable \nfinancial wreck that has occurred. The victims of that wreck are all \nover. We have lots of folks--millions--looking for a job.\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\nCan you imagine one person coming home--just one--saying: Honey, I have \nlost my job today. I worked there for 20 years, and I have done a good \njob. It is not my fault. I have tried hard, but I don't have a job \nanymore because I was told they are laying off at the office or plant. \nThink of that conversation--to tell the kids that dad or mom doesn't \nhave a job anymore. Not just one time or 100,000 times--think about the \nmillions of times that it happened in recent months; 3.6 million people \nsince the recession began have had to come home and say: I have lost my \njob.\n  These are people who want to work. It describes why it is so \nimportant for an economy to expand and lift opportunity in this great \ncountry.\n  We have been blessed for a long time. It is not some inherent right \nof ours to live in an economy that grows in an unrelenting way. That is \nnot an inherent right. This economy will grow and will produce expanded \nopportunities for the American people if we do the right things. We \nhave been through a period where a lot of people in very important \npositions did a lot of wrong things, trading a lot of paper that didn't \nhave any value at all, making money on both sides, buying things they \nnever had from people who will never get it, and making money on both \nsides of the trade. That is not real finance. That is not real \ninvestment, real productivity. That is a paper economy that is built on \nspeculation and is destined to come down.\n  I described a while ago just the subprime loan scandal. That is just \na part of it. I described it, and it almost makes me sick to see the \ngreed and avarice that existed under the name of responsible business. \nShame on all of those people who were making a lot of money. They were \nmaking so much they could not count it, and they were leaving victims \nin their wake. They created this circumstance where the economy \ncollapsed.\n  Our job is to find out what happened and try to lift it back up. You \nhave to put the pieces of the puzzle together and decide and understand \nwhat happened. We owe it to ourselves and the American people to \nunderstand all of what happened to make sure we never allow it to \nhappen again.\n  We cannot delegate that responsibility. I supported the commission, \nand I complement my colleagues who offered it. Having an outside group \nof experts to look at this and make recommendations, that makes sense. \nBut we cannot delegate our responsibility. It is our responsibility. \nThat is why this amendment I have offered with Senator McCain is so \nimportant.\n  Finally, the underlying bill to which we are talking about amendments \nis so important because it is part of the solution--to say those folks \nwho have been doing those things--there has to be a responsibility and \nfunding for prosecutors and investigators to get to the bottom of that \nand make people accountable for the actions and behavior that steered \nthe economy into a ditch.\n  I have great hope for the future of this country if we do the right \nthing. I believe we can. The step offered by Senator Leahy is a step in \nthat direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, \nApril 23, after the Senate resumes consideration of S. 386, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. be for debate with respect to Dorgan-McCain amendment No. \n999, with the time equally divided and controlled between Senators \nDorgan and myself, or our designees; that no amendments be in order to \nthe amendment prior to a vote in relation thereto; that at 10 a.m., the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 996 to Amendment No. 984\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order so that I may \noffer a second-degree amendment to the Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. At this point, I wish to offer a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself, Mr. \n     DeMint, and Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Alexander, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 996 to amendment No. 984.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 4, United States Code, to declare English as \n     the national language of the Government of the United States)\n\n       On page 3, after line 8, add the following:\n       (d) Amendment to Title 4.--\n       (1) In general.--Title 4, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n                ``CHAPTER 6--LANGUAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT\n\n``Sec.\n``161.

Language of the Government..............................161''.....\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment that I \nhave offered on two other occasions. It is called the National Language \nAct of 2009. I offer it as an amendment to the Reid amendment No. 984. \nThis legislation recognizes the practical reality of the role of \nEnglish as our national language. It makes English the national \nlanguage of the U.S. Government, a status in law it has not had before, \nand it calls on Government to preserve and enhance the role of English \nas the national language. It clarifies that there is no entitlement to \nreceive Federal documents in languages other than the English language \nunless required by statutory law, recognizing decades of unbroken court \nopinions that civil rights laws protecting against national origin \ndiscrimination do not create rights to Government services and \nmaterials in languages other than English.\n  Let me be clear, there is nothing in the amendment that prohibits the \nuse of a language other than the English language. When I offered this \nbefore, I remember several times people would stand up and object and \nthe basis of that objection was that we were not able to use other \nlanguages. We can use other languages. I have spoken languages, such as \nthe Spanish language, on the floor of this Senate. It has nothing to do \nwith that.\n  There is no prohibition against giving Medicare services, for \nexample, or any other Government services in languages other than \nEnglish. All this amendment does is simply say there is no entitlement \nunless Congress has explicitly provided so. This bill does not ban \ntranslation services being offered by Federal employees who have the \nlanguage skills to do so. Instead, it eliminates the notion that once \none translation is provided to someone in one language, a legal \nentitlement has been created to provide translations to anyone in any \nlanguage they wish.\n  The aim is to prohibit class action lawsuits based upon perceived \nentitlements that some individuals claim.\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\n  The National Language Act is an attempt to legislate a common sense \nlanguage policy that a nation of immigrants needs one national \nlanguage. Our nation was settled by a group of people with a common \nvision. As our population has grown, our cultural diversity has grown \nas well. This diversity is part of what makes our nation great. \nHowever, we must be able to communicate with one another so that we can \nappreciate our differences. When members of our society cannot speak a \ncommon language, misunderstandings arise. Furthermore, the individuals \nwho do not speak the language of the majority miss out on many \nopportunities to advance in society and achieve the American dream. By \nestablishing that there is no entitlement to receive documents or \nservices in languages other than English, we set the precedent that \nEnglish is a common to us all in the public forum of government.\n  I want to empower new immigrants coming to our Nation by helping them \nunderstand and become successful in their new home. I believe that one \nof the most important ways immigrants can achieve success is by \nlearning English.\n  There is enormous popular support for English as the national \nlanguage, according to polling that has taken place over the last few \nyears. Eighty-seven percent of Americans support making English the \nofficial language of the United States. Seventy-seven percent of \nHispanics believe English should be the official language of government \noperations. Eighty-two percent of Americans support legislation that \nwould require the Federal Government to conduct business solely in \nEnglish. Seventy-four percent of Americans support all election ballots \nand other government documents being printed in English. This polling \ndata refers to making English an ``official'' language of the United \nStates, or further creating an affirmative responsibility on the part \nof government to conduct its operations in English. While I have \ndrafted legislation that accomplishes this as well, the National \nLanguage Act is more measured, simply stating that no entitlement shall \narise to government documents or services.\n  OMB reported in 2002 that they could not accurately endorse any \nsingle cost estimate of providing materials and services to Limited \nEnglish Proficiency--LEP--persons, but that the estimate ``may be less \nthan $2 billion, and perhaps less than $1 billion.'' When talking about \ndollar amounts of this magnitude, we know the cost is high regardless \nof the OMB's ability to accurately calculate, and it is likely becoming \nhigher. If we are spending all this taxpayer money for services in a \nforeign language, we need to at least clarify that there is no legal \nentitlement to such.\n  My colleagues who have followed this debate will remember that the \nNational Language Act of 2009 is identical to S. 2715 from the 110th \nCongress. It is also the same as the English amendment that passed the \nSenate in 2007 as Senate amendment No. 1151, and in 2006 as Senate \namendment No. 4064, each being part of the Comprehensive Immigration \nReform Act of each respective Congress. Senate amendment No. 1151 was \nagreed to in the Senate by a vote of 64 to 33. Senate amendment No. \n4064 was agreed to in the Senate by a vote of 62 to 35. As you can see, \nthere is widespread and bipartisan support for this legislation, and I \nhope that you will join me this Congress in supporting the National \nLanguage Act of 2009.\n  This is one of the few things that comes along that everyone is for. \nThe lowest percentage we have from polling in the last 3 years as to \npeople's acceptance of English as the national language is 87 percent. \nInterestingly enough, we even have polls showing that 71 percent of \nHispanics would rather have English as the national language.\n  It is interesting, I have been around quite a bit, around the African \ncountries quite a bit. Several of the African countries, including \nGhana in West Africa, have English as their national language. When you \ntry to explain to people in the real world--when you get out of \nWashington and get back to Illinois or the State of Oklahoma, you find \npeople ask the question: Why is it some 52 countries have English as \nthe national language and we don't here? There is no logical reason.\n  It probably enjoys a larger popularity than any amendment we have had \nin recent years. I ask that it be considered as a second-degree \namendment to the Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Chair, at such time as we take up the Reid \namendment, I will offer this as a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 996 has been offered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to set aside this amendment for \nthe purpose of offering an amendment to S. 386.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand and appreciate that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 991\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up the Vitter amendment No. 991.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 991.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize and remove impediments to the repayment of funds \n    received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPAYMENT OF TARP FUNDS.\n\n       Section 111(g) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act \n     of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5221(g)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Subject to'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) Repayment permitted.--Subject to'';\n       (2) by inserting ``if, subsequent to such repayment, the \n     TARP recipient is well capitalized (as determined by the \n     appropriate Federal banking agency having supervisory \n     authority over the TARP recipient)'' after ``waiting \n     period,'';\n       (3) by striking ``, and when such assistance is repaid, the \n     Secretary shall liquidate warrants associated with such \n     assistance at the current market price''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) No repayment precondition for warrants.--A TARP \n     recipient that exercises the repayment authority under \n     paragraph (1) shall not be required to repurchase warrants \n     from the Federal Government as a condition of repayment of \n     assistance provided under the TARP. The Secretary shall, at \n     the request of the relevant TARP recipient, repay the \n     proceeds of warrants repurchased before the date of enactment \n     of this paragraph.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It is \nregarding the TARP program, and it simply allows banks that want to \nrepay taxpayer dollars back to the Government, back into the program, \nto do so. It is a pretty simple idea. It only allows it if the bank is \ngoing to be financially stable and meet all the applicable capital \nrequirements without the money. Again, it is a pretty simple idea. Yet \nthis amendment is clearly necessary in order to allow banks to do that \nwithout having Washington bureaucrats veto that decision, which should \nrest with those private financial institutions.\n  As this body knows, I have been a cynic and critic of TARP from the \nvery beginning. I voted against it last year under President Bush. \nUnfortunately, many of my greatest fears about its weaknesses and how \nit would develop have come to pass. But there is one recent trend with \nregard to the program that I find enormously promising, and that trend \nis that more and more banks that got the taxpayer money want to pay it \nback, want to exit the program and have nothing more to do with it as \nsoon as possible.\n  I am happy to say that positive trend was begun in Louisiana. It was \nbegun by a significant Louisiana bank named Iberia Bank of Lafayette \nwhich became the first bank in the country to try to repay its TARP \nmoney. Of course, the Iberia Bank did eventually get to repay\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\nthat money. The bank said that being a recipient of TARP funds, it \nrealized, after some experience, placed it at an ``unacceptable \ncompetitive disadvantage.''\n  I think it is very important to underscore that this was not an issue \nof executive compensation or bonuses. Iberia Bank is in Lafayette, LA, \nnot Wall Street, New York City, NY. It had nobody in its structure that \nwould have been limited in terms of compensation by the rules Congress \nplaced with regard to that. Executive compensation wasn't the issue \nwith them at all. However, they feared a couple of things. They saw the \nincreasing role of government in the boardroom of banks that had \naccepted TARP money, they saw what they considered a contract with \nregard to the TARP money between the bank and the taxpayer being \nunilaterally changed by Federal bureaucrats every week, and they saw \nthat as a very clear building trend. So they decided they wanted out \nbecause they feared they were going to be more and more hamstrung by \nFederal bureaucrats and the government growing to become their senior \npartner, rather than as the original role of a junior partner. They saw \nthe government becoming more and more involved in how their bank was \nrun, and they wanted out. And as they said very directly, they then \nconsidered having the TARP funds as an ``unacceptable competitive \ndisadvantage.''\n  Seven banks in all have reached that same conclusion and have been \nable to repay TARP funds to the program. That repayment has totaled \nabout half a trillion. Iberia Bank of Lafayette, LA, was the first to \nstart this trend, but they were followed by Bank of Maine Bankcorp, Old \nNational Bankcorp, Signature Bank, Sun Bankcorp, Shore Bancshares, and \nCentra Financial Holding, Inc. All of these banks said: We want out. We \nthink this is a real problem. The government is getting more and more \ninto how we run our business. We want to repay and get out of the \nprogram. And these banks were allowed to repay TARP funds back to the \ngovernment and withdraw from TARP.\n  Mr. President, you might say: Well, if these banks were allowed to do \nit, what is the problem? The problem is that Secretary Geithner and the \nTreasury Department have made it clear that while they allowed \nrepayment in those cases, they may well not allow it in other cases, \nparticularly in the case of much larger institutions. Again, this is \nvery clear from recent discussion and recent testimony from Secretary \nGeithner. In the last few days, Secretary Geithner has testified on \nCapitol Hill, and the main message from that testimony with regard to \nthe ever evolving TARP program and how precisely it is going to be \noperated in the future is that we are not sure. We are not sure about \nguidelines for repayment. Stay tuned.\n  On the one hand, the Secretary indicated a willingness to allow banks \nto repay, but at the same time, on the other hand, he indicated clearly \nthat it will largely depend on the credit needs of the broader economy \nand not simply the health of that individual bank.\n  Yesterday's Wall Street Journal confirmed exactly this, because it \nreported an interview with Secretary Geithner where he indicated ``that \nthe health of individual banks won't be the sole criterion for whether \nfinancial firms will be allowed to repay bailout funds.'' So in other \nwords, the Secretary is taking the position that he wants to maintain a \nveto over any repayment beyond the issue of whether that single bank, \nthat particular financial institution, would be perfectly sound and \nhealthy without holding on to that TARP money.\n  I think that is unacceptable. I think that is offensive, in fact. \nThat is a government bureaucrat saying: No, no, no, no. I know this is \nyour business, but we know best. I know you have decided this is best \nfor you, but we have a veto over this because of our general concerns \nabout the broader economy. That is unacceptable.\n  So again, we come back to my amendment--Vitter amendment No. 991--\nwhich is necessary in light of this stance of Secretary Geithner and \nthe Treasury Department. Again, my amendment is very simple. It ensures \nthe immediate repayment of TARP funds for banks that want to repay, but \nonly in a few circumstances. First, the government must be repaid \neverything it is owed. The government has to be repaid everything it is \nowed, although it does prohibit the government from requiring a company \nto repurchase its warrants.\n  My amendment also ensures that TARP recipients be well capitalized, \nmeet all the soundness and safety and capitalization liquidity \nrequirements after the repayment. So my amendment wouldn't allow a \nrepayment if that repayment would sink a bank to a position of not \nbeing well capitalized, of not meeting the normal capitalization \nliquidity requirements to ensure safety and soundness. Those \nrequirements are spelled out by the regulators, as they have always \nbeen. So my amendment does not threaten that at all. It requires that \nthose capitalization requirements be adhered to and a repayment only \nhappen if the bank meets those capitalization and liquidity \nrequirements after the repayment.\n  I hope this amendment not only passes but gets overwhelming \nbipartisan support. After all, why shouldn't it? This amendment is \nsimply saying that a private business will be in control of its own \ndestiny; that a private business can pay back TARP money, with \ninterest, with everything that is required to the government, if it \ndecides that is the best thing for that business to do, as long as that \nrepayment does not affect the safety and soundness of the institution \nand make it dip below already established guidelines with regard to \ncapitalization and liquidity.\n  Again, I believe this idea and this amendment should not only pass, \nit should have overwhelming bipartisan support because it seems to me \nthose who oppose this amendment--presumably including Secretary \nGeithner--have to be saying one of two things, or maybe both: No. 1, \nthey have to be saying, in a very arrogant way: No, we know better. No, \nyou may run your business, you may be aware of all aspects of it, but \nwe know better so we have to have a veto, or they have to be saying and \nacting on the basis of: We are now involved in your business. You have \nthe government as a dominant partner, and we are not going to let go \nbecause letting go means loss of power and control as well as your \nrepaying the money.\n  I encourage all of our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to come \ntogether and support this very reasonable commonsense amendment. Banks \nthat can afford to repay the TARP money and that want to repay the TARP \nmoney certainly should have the absolute unquestioned right to repay \nthe TARP money. It is as simple as that. We shouldn't stand here on the \nSenate floor or in the Department of the Treasury and say: No, we know \nbetter. And we certainly shouldn't stand here on the Senate floor or in \nthe Department of the Treasury and say: No, the government has now sunk \nits claws into you and we are not letting go. We like the control. We \nlike the takeover. We like the authority and we are not giving that up.\n  That is a very dangerous statement for the government to get out, and \nit is quite frankly what so many Americans are fearful of--that these \nemergency measures in the midst of the financial crisis are really a \ndramatic, long-term expansion of the authority and role of the Federal \nGovernment in the free market.\n  With that, Mr. President, I look forward to further debate and a vote \non this amendment tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. VITTER. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1000\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know we are waiting to see if I can send \nan amendment to the desk, and ask that the pending amendment be set \naside. It would be my intention to do so when we can get the clearance \non the other side.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. I think it is important that people \nunderstand it is with Senator Corker, Senator Snowe, and Democratic \nSenator Jeff Merkley. What we are trying to do is make sure that in the \nTARP program, when these toxic assets are sold off, there are no \nkickbacks between the seller of the asset and the private party. What \nwe would\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\ndo is make sure that the inspector general has enough funds to go after \nthat type of conflict of interest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment, and I understand the clerk has my amendment at the desk, if \nhe would read it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Corker, and Mr. Merkley, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1000.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nbe dispensed with, because I have described it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize monies for the Special Inspector General for the \n Troubled Asset Relief Program to audit and investigate recipients of \nnon-recourse Federal loans under the Public Private Investment Program \n                   and the Term Asset Loan Facility)\n\n       On page 20, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       ``(e) Additional Appropriations for the Special Inspector \n     General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.--\n       ``(1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated \n     to the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief \n     Program (in this subsection referred to as the Special \n     Inspector General), $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2010.\n       ``(2) Priorities.--In utilizing funds made available under \n     this subsection, the Special Inspector General shall \n     prioritize the performance of audits or investigations of \n     recipients of non-recourse Federal loans made under the \n     Public Private Investment Program established by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury or the Term Asset Loan Facility \n     established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System, to the extent that such priority is consistent with \n     other aspects of the mission of the Special Inspector \n     General. Such audits or investigations shall determine the \n     existence of any collusion between the loan recipient and the \n     seller or originator of the asset used as loan collateral, or \n     any other conflict of interest that may have led the loan \n     recipient to deliberately overstate the value of the asset \n     used as loan collateral.''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Leahy. I know he is so \nanxious to get this bill through, and it is not my intention to slow \nanything up. I do think I stand here as a former stockbroker, and I \nknow we need integrity in the system, and I know that is the purpose of \nthis bill, so I feel this bipartisan amendment would add quality to his \nalready excellent bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and it is my understanding that my \namendment would be pending. I ask the Presiding Officer if that is the \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is currently pending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask to be able to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          A Doomsday Solution\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has issued a proposal, a proposal \nfinding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a danger to the public's \nhealth and welfare. The Washington Post has referred to this as a \n``determination that could trigger a series of sweeping regulations \naffecting everything from vehicles to coal-fired power plants.'' \nAccording to legal experts, the scope of these regulations could cover \nhospitals, schools, farms, commercial buildings, and even nursing \nhomes.\n  EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said that the EPA was not looking for \na doomsday solution. Well, I have news for the administrator--this is \none. In fact, this endangerment finding, once finalized, could cover \nany source that emits more than 250 tons per year of carbon dioxide. \nThis is the limit expressly mentioned in the Clean Air Act. Hospitals, \nschools, farms, commercial buildings, and nursing homes will be \nrequired to obtain preconstruction permits for their activities. \nFurther, according to the legal scholars, the statutory language is \nmandatory and does not leave any room for the EPA to exercise \ndiscretion or to create exemptions.\n  The economic consequences of this will be great. According to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, one-fifth of all food service businesses, \none-third of all health care businesses, one-half of the entire lodging \nindustry--all of those could be covered under the scope of the Clean \nAir Act. According to the Heritage Foundation, such regulations would \nlead to job losses that would exceed 800,000 jobs. I thought this \nadministration was interested in creating jobs, not killing them. But \nthat is what this ruling says. The gross domestic product lost to the \ncountry could be $7 trillion by the year 2029.\n  In short, unless Congress acts, this administration is taking an \nenormous risk, an enormous economic gamble with the future of the \nAmerican people. It is a bad bet, with no hope for any temperature \nreductions--which is what they are trying to do.\n  The EPA Administrator has stated that she wants to avoid a regulatory \nthicket. If this approach is such a bad option, let's take it off the \ntable. Why would the administration deliberately leave a bad option, a \nregulatory thicket for Americans, on the table? It makes no sense. It \nis for that reason that today I have sent a letter to President Obama \nasking that he take this option off the table. He must urge the Senate \nleadership and the House leadership right here to pass legislation to \nexempt the Clean Air Act from becoming a climate change tool. It is a \nbad option for Americans, and it is no option for America.\n  The Administrator of the EPA has stated that, if necessary, she is \npoised to be specific on what we regulate and on what schedule. I asked \nthe EPA nominee, who will oversee the Clean Air Act, how this would be \ndone. She responded that President George W. Bush's advance notice of \nproposed rulemaking laid out the options. This is the same advance \nnotice of proposed rulemaking that has been so roundly criticized by \nthe majority.\n  I asked how the EPA would handle losing court challenges if the \ndepartment tried to exempt farms and schools and hospitals and nursing \nhomes and small businesses from the reach of the Clean Air Act. The \nnominee responded again that President Bush's rulemaking ``explored a \nnumber of possible ways of streamlining'' the Clean Air Act. This is \nnot an answer at all. The American people need to know how they will be \nprotected from the long arm of Washington.\n  The EPA Administrator admits that a better option is to have Congress \npass legislation to deal with climate change. The option on the table \ntoday is the President's energy tax. The President's energy tax is \nmoving in the House of Representatives. It is called the American Clean \nEnergy and Security Act of 2009. The President's energy tax will fund a \ntrillion-dollar climate bailout scheme--a bailout scheme that will not \nreduce global temperatures by even a single degree. Moving forward with \na $1 trillion climate bailout scheme to avoid the Clean Air Act \nregulations is the legislative equivalent of moving the American \ntaxpayers from the frying pan into the fire.\n  This President's cap-and-trade scheme will dramatically raise prices \non businesses as well as on consumers. It is bad for consumers, it is \nbad for jobs, and it is bad for our economy.\n  We have passed numerous bailout bills over the past 6 months. We \npassed a $787 billion stimulus package for an economic bailout intended \nto save or create jobs. This is money we have been borrowing from \nChina. They have such concerns they are not so interested in lending it \nto us anymore.\n  The American people already have bailout and borrowing fatigue. We \nall know our deficits are soaring. We have saddled future generations \nwith this debt for years to come. I hear that when I go to the schools \nand talk to the high school students.\n  Spending trillions of additional dollars to address climate change \nthrough an untested cap-and-trade scheme is an unnecessarily risky \napproach. It, too, is a regulatory nightmare. This approach will cost \nthousands of jobs in the very same sectors that will be hit\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\nunder the Clean Air Act. It is not a viable option, and it is not a \nresponsible option.\n  I call on the Senate leadership to expedite legislation to the \nPresident that takes the Clean Air Act out of the business of \nregulating the climate. Let us come together and find a solution to our \nNation's energy needs. With all seriousness, we need all of it, we need \nall the sources of energy because we will continue to use it all. We \nneed a solution that makes American energy as clean as we can, as fast \nas we can, and without hurting our economy.\n  It is time for the Environmental Protection Agency to get that \nmessage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet.) The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment for the purpose of offering four amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as the Senator from Illinois, I \nobject.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 986\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will offer one amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, amendment No. 986 is at the desk. I call it \nup for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 986.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit the amount that may be deducted from proceeds due to \n     the United States under the False Claims Act for purposes of \n compensating private intervenors to the greater of $50,000,000 or 300 \n          percent of the expenses and costs of the intervenor)\n\n       On page 26, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON AWARDS TO CERTAIN INTERVENORS.\n\n       Section 3730(d) of title 31, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) in the first sentence, by inserting ``but in no event \n     more than the greater of $50,000,000 or 300 percent of the \n     expenses, fees, and costs awarded to such person under the \n     fourth sentence of this paragraph'' after ``prosecution of \n     the action''; and\n       (B) in the second sentence--\n       (i) by striking ``Government Accounting Office'' and \n     inserting ``Government Accountability Office'';\n       (ii) by inserting ``but in no event more than the greater \n     of $50,000,000 or 300 percent of the expenses, fees, and \n     costs awarded to such person under the fourth sentence of \n     this paragraph'' after ``advancing the case to litigation''; \n     and\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking the second sentence and \n     inserting ``The amount, which shall be paid out of the \n     proceeds of the action or settlement, shall be not less than \n     25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the amount of such \n     proceeds, but in no event more than the greater of \n     $50,000,000 or 300 percent of the expenses, fees, and costs \n     awarded to such person under the third sentence of this \n     paragraph''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I will explain. The other three amendments are precisely the \nsame, except they have a different dollar amount in them. I will ask \nfor their consideration later, or for their introduction at a later \ntime.\n  At this point, I defer to the Senator from Oklahoma if he is ready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 386, the Fraud \nEnforcement and Recovery Act of 2009. Although I certainly support the \nwell-intended purpose of this bill, I have concerns about the proposal \nthat I would like to explain today.\n  S. 386 aims to ``beef up'' the Government's efforts to combat fraud, \nparticularly in the mortgage industry and Federal assistance programs. \nTo that end, the bill creates a host of new criminal provisions and \nauthorizes nearly half a billion dollars in spending over the next 2 \nyears.\n  As a threshold matter, I am concerned about the necessity of these \nnew criminal provisions. In my mind, Congress should have a compelling \nreason for adding to the already monstrous Federal criminal code. With \nmore than 4,400 Federal offenses already on the books, it is hard to \nimagine there being conduct the Government cannot reach.\n  The Federal criminal code is often criticized for being overly broad, \nand legislators on both sides of the aisle have been known to bemoan \nits growth. Yet when ``tough-on-crime'' bills come before Congress, \nnobody wants to stand in their way and risk political consequences. \nThis is a truly unfortunate trend.\n  Turning back the tables on over-criminalization isn't a partisan \nissue. Legislators from both sides of the aisle have seen first-hand \nthe sometimes devastating unintended consequences that flow from the \napplication of Federal law. Democrats and Republicans could be working \ntogether to reevaluate some of these provisions; instead, we are doing \nbusiness as usual, responding to every crisis by further littering the \ncriminal code.\n  With respect to S. 386, two prominent organizations, the National \nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and the Heritage \nFoundation, formed an unlikely alliance in opposition to the bill. Both \norganizations believe that S. 386 contributes to overcriminalization, \nand their concerns are detailed specifically in a joint letter that \ndescribes the new criminal proposals as ``redundant and risks \noverreaching.''It notes that within the 4,450 offenses already in \ncriminal law, prosecutors have all the tools needed to reach crimes \nassociated with fraud. In general, it points to the Federal mail and \nwire fraud statutes as being sufficiently broad to cover mortgage fraud \nand other related crimes. As further evidence, it references an FBI \npress release identifying nine existing Federal criminal statutes that \ncan be used to prosecute mortgage fraud.\n  Because it is not my intention to prevent law enforcement from \npursuing truly criminal conduct, I studied the issue to determine \nwhether there are any insufficiencies within existing law that would \ngive perpetrators of fraud safe haven. I have found no examples of \nconduct or entities outside the reach of current law.\n  It is true that not every provision of the criminal code reaches \ncertain fraudulent acts. It is also true that not every entity in the \nmortgage industry is regulated by the Federal Government. It is not \ntrue, however, that the conduct or entities targeted by this bill are \ncurrently going unpunished. Prosecutors have successfully used other \nlaws, particularly the mail and wire fraud statutes, to aggressively \nprosecute these crimes at the Federal level.\n  The FBI's recent successes serve to demonstrate this point. The FBI \nhas handled mortgage fraud since 1989 and is actively pursuing these \ncrimes now. It has 65 mortgage fraud task forces and working groups \nacross the country that coordinate federal, state and local law \nenforcement officials. The FBI has 180 agents devoted to the sector. \nThey are handling more than 2,000 investigations, and have opened 734 \ncases this year. In fiscal year 2008, they obtained 560 indictments/\ninformations and 338 convictions. Last year, one operation resulted in \nthe roundup of more than 400 people accused of inflicting more than $1 \nbillion in losses, who were caught up in a nationwide sweep named \nOperation Malicious Mortgage.\n  The Secret Service has also been working hard to combat fraud \ndirected at financial institutions. It has an established network of 35 \nfinancial crimes task forces and 24 electronic crimes task forces. The \nSecret Service also partners with U.S. Attorney's Offices across the \ncountry to participate in mortgage fraud working groups. In fiscal year \n2008 alone, the Secret Service indicted and arrested 5,633 individuals \nresponsible for $442 million in fraud losses.\n  These impressive statistics, from both the FBI and the Secret \nService, suggest that Federal criminal law is more than sufficient to \naddress crimes of fraud associated with the ongoing economic crisis.\n  Federal prosecutors are not alone in pursuing mortgage fraud. Just \nlast month, the New York Times ran an article saying, ``Across the \ncountry, attorneys general have already begun indicting dozens of loan \nprocessors, mortgage brokers and bank officers. Last week alone, there \nwere guilty pleas in Minnesota, Delaware, North Carolina and \nConnecticut and sentences in Florida and Vermont, all stemming from \nhome loan scams.'' The article gave specific examples of State actions \nbeing taken to address the crisis:\n\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\n\n       State and local prosecutors, it seems, do not need the \n     nudge. Last week, the district attorney's office in Brooklyn \n     announced the creation of a real estate fraud unit, with 12 \n     employees and a mandate to ``address the recent flood of \n     mortgage fraud cases plaguing New Yorkers.'' In late \n     February, Maryland unveiled a mortgage fraud task force, \n     bringing together 17 agencies to streamline investigations.\n\n  As the joint letter from the Heritage Foundation and the National \nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers correctly notes, States are the \n``primary regulators of mortgage brokers and the insurance industry.\n  State governments are also closest to the people and are well-\nsituated to detect and prosecute these crimes. Aided by the recent \nallocation of nearly $5 billion in Federal funding for State and local \nlaw enforcement, states should be able to continue and enhance their \nexisting efforts to pursue mortgage fraud.\n  In short, both Federal and State criminal law is sufficient to combat \nmortgage and other financial fraud crimes. Congress should resist the \ntemptation to overreach on this issue by enacting new criminal laws, \nand instead focus its efforts on enforcing existing law.\n  Enforcing existing law, of course, requires resources. In addition to \nthe significant resources already being expended by the Federal \nGovernment to address fraud, S. 386 authorizes $490 million for fiscal \nyears 2009 and 2010. CBO has scored the bill and estimates that \nimplementing it would cost the full amount over the 2010-2014 period.\n  Proponents argue that the recent influx of Federal dollars into the \neconomy is sure to invite fraud. I do not disagree, but this problem \ndid not develop overnight. Surely Congress realized the possibility for \nfraud when it wrote these checks just months ago? Instead of taking \ntime to include safeguards in the bill or otherwise ensure responsible, \neffective allocation of hard-earned taxpayer dollars, Congress rushed \nthe bills out the door at break-neck speed. In doing so, Congress \ncreated an environment ripe for fraud.\n  The answer to this problem is, of course, to ask the taxpayers to \nshoulder even more of the burden. The 111th Congress has now spent more \nthan $1.5 trillion, yet it has somehow neglected to fund a priority as \nimportant as combating fraud. The omnibus appropriations bill, passed \njust weeks ago, only contained $10 million for the FBI to pursue \nmortgage fraud. The stimulus bill, which provided $4 billion for State \nand local law enforcement, amid nearly $1 trillion in spending, failed \nto provide any money specific to fraud enforcement. Why, when \nopportunities to address this problem arose, did Congress not do the \nright thing and prioritize the funding authorized by S. 386?\n  In this time of economic crisis, Congress no longer has the luxury of \nspending money haphazardly. We must learn to set priorities and make \nsacrifices, and perhaps even think creatively about how to stretch \nlimited resources to meet our needs.\n  For example, the Department of Justice has access to ``unobligated \nbalances,'' which are unspent dollars that have been appropriated but \nnot obligated during a fiscal year. Such money is typically required to \nbe returned to the U.S. Treasury, but the Justice Department has unique \nauthority to retain and carry over its unobligated funds for use in the \nfollowing year. Fiscal year 2007, DOJ had almost $2.9 billion in \nunobligated balances, and it is estimated to have had nearly $2.3 \nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2008, and to have $2 billion at the \nend of fiscal year 2009. This excess would be a good source of funding \nfor priorities such as investigating and prosecuting mortgage fraud \nduring a housing crisis.\n  Moreover, the Department of Justice has become infamous for its \nwasteful spending. Last year, I released a report titled, ``Justice \nDenied: Waste & Mismanagement at the Department of Justice,'' which \nidentified more than $10 billion in wasteful spending. The Justice \nDepartment should be required to make more responsible use of the funds \ncurrently within its authority before Congress entrusts it with even \nmore of the taxpayers' hard-earned money.\n  Unfortunately, many of the dollars wasted at the Department of \nJustice are done by way of congressional earmarks. Earmarks consume \nscarce resources and prevent experts at DOJ from allocating money to \nareas with the most pressing need. Congress should allow DOJ officials \nto reprogram existing earmarks so that higher priority needs, like \ncombating mortgage fraud, can be met.\n  One thing is certain, the American taxpayer has already paid too high \na price for irresponsible governance. Continuing ``business-as-usual,'' \nby funding parochial pet projects before we take care of legitimate \nbusiness, cannot continue.\n  While I surely support the legislation's goal of addressing fraud, \nespecially in the mortgage industry, I do not believe S. 386 is either \nnecessary or prudent at this time of economic crisis. Our national debt \nis more than $11 trillion, and CBO recently set this year's deficit at \n$1.7 trillion, projected to rise to $1.845 trillion by year's end. I \nbelieve Government can and should prioritize spending to fulfill its \nresponsibilities without asking more of the American people. I also \nbelieve that State and Federal criminal law are sufficient to address \nfraud and would father see efforts focused on enforcing those existing \nlaws, rather than on creating new ones.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 982\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and amendment No. 982 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 982.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the use of TARP funds to cover the costs of the \n                                 bill)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. USE OF TARP FUNDS TO PAY FOR ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES.\n\n       Effective upon the date of enactment of this Act, of the \n     amounts of authority made available pursuant to paragraphs \n     (1) and (2) of section 115(a) of the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343) to purchase \n     troubled assets that remain unused as of such date of \n     enactment, such amounts as may be necessary shall be \n     available, notwithstanding any provision of such Act, to \n     provide the amounts authorized under subsections (a), (b), \n     (c), and (d) of section 3.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Earlier today, I spoke for a short period of time on this \nbill. I wish to retrace some of that before I talk about this \namendment. It is important that the American people understand what \nthis bill is doing.\n  All of us wish to get rid of the fraud, the money laundering, we wish \nto punish the people who have, in fact, helped cause part of this \nproblem. I would tell you the biggest person or group of people \nresponsible for the problem we face today is the Congress, this body \nand the House of Representatives.\n  We failed to do our job on oversight. We incentivized and socialized \nhousing, we incentivized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to do things that \nwere inappropriate, to take risks they should not have done, and then \nwe did not have the regulatory mechanisms in place, nor did we do the \noversight to see what was going on.\n  This bill, however, is attempting to fix a problem with a statute, \ncriminal statute. Most people know we do not need more criminal \nstatutes. The fact is, nobody can name an act that occurred on any of \nthis fraud or any of this money laundering that is not prosecutable \nunder the Criminal Code we have today.\n  Off the record, when we asked some pertinent people from the Justice \nDepartment, they laughed when asked if we needed these new criminal \nstatutes. The other point I would make is, none of this, with the \nexception of the false claim portion, has any application to what has \nalready happened because you cannot apply a new law to a crime that \nalready existed under our Constitution.\n  So what are we doing? What we are doing is trying to make the \nAmerican public think we are doing something now that, in essence, does \nnot need to be done. We may need to fund the Justice Department at a \ngreater level because we did not do what we should have done earlier.\n  It is the typical knee-jerk reaction. We have plenty of laws on the \nbooks. As a matter of fact, the new penalties in some of this stuff are \ngreater for fraud and mortgage than for manslaughter under the Federal \nCode.\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\n  We need to be very careful as we approach this. I am not saying we \nshould not go after all those people. I am not saying we should not put \nin the resources to do that. But when we put the resource there, we \nought to make sure they are used just for that.\n  No. 2, we ought to look at the Justice Department and how they spend \nmoney. Late last year I released a report on the $10 billion worth of \nwaste in the Justice Department over the previous 5 years, $10 billion \nthat was wasted over the previous 5 years.\n  Nobody disputed it. I mean, the Justice Department did not even \nanswer it and say, that is not right, because they knew it was right. \nThe fact is we refuse to make priorities.\n  This amendment is very simple. If we are going to appropriate a half \nbillion dollars in increased funding to go after the fraud and money \nlaundering associated with this financial situation that the Congress \ncreated and incentivized individuals, should we take it from the \nAmerican taxpayers or should we take it out of money that we have \nalready allocated?\n  The Justice Department is different than every other agency in the \nFederal Government, because at the end of the year, every other \ndepartment's unexpended balances, unobligated balances eventually \nfilter back to the Treasury. Not so at the Justice Department. They \nactually get to keep theirs. They are the only agency that gets to keep \nit.\n  Now, what have they averaged over the last 5 years in unobligated and \nunexpended balances? Over $2 billion a year. So here is an agency with \n$2 billion that they have not spent, and we are going to give them \nanother $500 million, and their incentive is not to spend the money on \nthe things we need to do; it is to keep it to do with what they want \nout of the direction of those that control the purse strings.\n  What this amendment says is we have already allocated money in terms \nof TARP funds; that if, in fact, we are going to send more money, which \nI do not think we should--I think we ought to spend it from the money \nwe have--but if we are going to do it, let's take it from the money we \nhave already taken from the American taxpayer, and it is not the \nAmerican taxpayer; it is their grandkids, and let us use some of that \nmoney because the return on that money will be far greater than the \nreturn we are going to get on any TARP money.\n  It is very simple, very straightforward as a funding treatment. What \nwe will use is money that has already been appropriated in the TARP \nfunds, which they have a significant balance--in the billions--and we \nwill take, over the next 2 years, $250 million or so to give to the \nJustice Department, if we agree we should be giving it to the Justice \nDepartment. Do not be fooled by the typical Washington turnaround that \nhappens all the time up here, the sleight of hand that says: We are \nfixing a problem. We tend to fix problems that are not broken and not \nfix the problems that are broken. The mess we are in demonstrates that \nvery straight forwardly.\n  We are going to have a $2 trillion deficit this year. We are going to \ndouble the national debt in 5 years. We are going to triple it in 10 \nunder the Obama budget. Should not we be about priorities? Should not \nwe be about holding the agencies accountable? Should not we be about \nmaking sure the money is spent properly?\n  If we are going to spend new money, try to get it from areas we \nalready are not spending the money in but it has been appropriated. The \nAmerican people would agree with that. I hope my colleagues will as \nwell.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting the authors of \nthe bill before the Senate today. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct, or FERA, provides important tools to the Departments of Justice, \nHomeland Security and Housing and Urban Development to investigate and \nprosecute mortgage fraud. I am afraid that our government must be \nparticularly vigilant today, as criminals seek to exploit people's \neconomic hardships, and as some persons harmed by the downturn resort \nto fraud as a desperate measure.\n  This problem is grave, and it is getting worse by the day. Last year, \nfinancial institutions reported that mortgage loan fraud increased by \n44 percent from the previous year. And this year, mortgage loan fraud \nis reportedly increasing even more--26 percent over last year. And \nstill, disappointingly, many incidents of fraud go unnoticed. While \nthis bill appropriately addresses the problem by providing additional \nresources to bring criminals to justice, including 400 new prosecutors \nand agents, I believe that efforts to arrest this alarming trend must \nalso focus on preventing frauds from even being perpetrated in the \nfirst place.\n  Fortunately, the Obama administration is doing just that. Earlier \nthis month, a new initiative was announced targeting mortgage loan \nmodification fraud and foreclosure rescue scams. This effort, led by \nthe Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement and \nNetwork, or FinCEN, is coordinating efforts across Federal and State \ngovernments as well as the private sector to share intelligence and \nidentify criminal enterprises and deceptive schemes. Once such scams \nwere identified, FinCEN is issuing ``early warnings'' to law \nenforcement, regulatory agencies, and the consumer protection community \nto watch for tell-tale signs of such scams. Already, FinCEN reports \nthat this information is providing critical leads to protect consumers \nfrom falling victim to fraud. In addition, FinCEN is helping private \nindustry perform their own due diligence, issuing advisories to alert \nfinancial institutions to the risks of emerging schemes by describing \nwhat they call ``red flags,'' that typify loan modification or \nforeclosure rescue scams. Banks, in turn are thus advised on how to \nfile suspicious activity reports to Treasury, to ensure that law \nenforcement authorities may stay up-to-date in tracking potential fraud \nactivity.\n  As the industry publication, American Banker, reported last week, \nincreases in the filing of suspicious activity reports this year may be \ndemonstrating a rise in fraud. In any case, in my estimation, these \nfilings indicate that cases of fraud are being taken very seriously \nboth by the government and industry. For that reason, I believe that, \nif implemented appropriately, the FinCEN-led Foreclosure Rescue Scams & \nLoan Modification effort will help both law enforcement combat fraud \nand consumers avoid scams.\n  I appreciate the Obama administration's efforts, and I urge every law \nenforcement agency, including the Department of Justice, to coordinate \nwith FinCEN as we attempt to safeguard our financial system from fraud \nand prosecute those who break the law. I support the bill currently \nbefore the Senate, which I believe will greatly complement Treasury's \nprograms to combat financial crimes.\n\n\n                         Anti-Money Laundering\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations, I have conducted a series of hearings and issued \nreports on various issues pertaining to money-laundering and tax \nhavens, and I appreciate the benefit of the Banking Committee \nchairman's insight on these matters.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 before us importantly \nmodifies the money laundering statute to include tax evasion. I believe \nthat we should also expand anti-money laundering laws to apply to other \nentities involved in financial transactions.\n  In particular, hedge funds, other private investment vehicles, and \ncompany formation agents are not subject to the same anti-money \nlaundering regulations as others who play roles in the financial \nservices world. Currently, unregistered investment companies, such as \nhedge funds and private equity funds, have limited responsibilities \nunder the Bank Secrecy Act. For example, hedge funds themselves are not \nrequired to establish Know Your Customer programs or file suspicious \nactivity reports. Suspicious activity and tax evasion by clients may go \nunnoticed by appropriate authorities. Indeed, offshore tax abuses cost \nthe U.S. Treasury an estimated $100 billion each year.\n  Complicating the Government's ability to establish and enforce AML \nregulations for this industry is the fact that many private investment \nfunds and company formation agents have largely escaped general \nregulatory oversight. For example, when the Securities and Exchange \nCommission attempted to require hedge funds to register, the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\nthe SEC, lacked the appropriate authority. I believe that the SEC's \nattempts were well-intentioned, but the court's findings indicate that \nclearer authority must be established for key sectors of the financial \nservices industry, including hedge funds and company formation agents.\n  Because hedge funds, private equity funds, and company formation \nagents are as vulnerable as other financial institutions to money \nlaunderers seeking entry into the U.S. financial system, there is no \nreason why they should continue to serve as pathways into the U.S. \nfinancial system for substantial funds of unknown origin. We need to \nestablish a clear statutory mandate for these entities to implement \nsound anti-money laundering programs and to report on suspicious \nactivities.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate Senator Levin's and his subcommittee's hard \ninvestigative work on this very difficult subject matter. I share his \nconviction that America's regulatory system must be reformed to address \nchallenges posed by business practices surrounding 21st century \nfinancial products. The United States cannot afford to have investment \nvehicles used to engage in abusive practices of fraud, illicit \nactivity, and tax evasion. As the Banking Committee undertakes a \ncomprehensive effort to modernize the securities and banking system, I \nwill look forward to engaging the senior Senator from Michigan on \nissues of particular importance to him, including anti-money laundering \nmeasures.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this housing crisis is the root of our \nlarger economic crisis. As the mortgage mess rapidly worsens--and \nhurting more hardworking families--the implications for every other \npart of our economy are disastrous.\n  Today we learned that the number of American families at risk of \nlosing their homes skyrocketed in the past few months. The problem is \nsignificantly worse at the beginning of this year than it was at the \nsame time last year. In Las Vegas alone, 1 in every 22 homes received a \nforeclosure notice between January and March. That's seven times the \nnational average.\n  The American people know we must do more. The people of Nevada \ncertainly know this--families in my State lose their homes at the worst \nrate in the Nation. They know we must act now, before this emergency \nspins even further out of control.\n  But the declining health of our housing market comes with serious \nside effects. As foreclosures rise, so do reports of fraud. According \nto one report, the Nevada Bureau of Consumer Protection now receives \n100 complaints each month from homeowners identifying possible mortgage \nscams. One Nevada scam recently offered a 100-percent money-back \nguarantee. The scammer, unsurprisingly, didn't hold up his end of the \nbargain. Another scheme charged homeowners heavy upfront fee and \nmonthly charges on top of that--only later did they learn they were not \ngetting any services in return.\n  While we are working to help the millions of desperate homeowners who \nneed to modify their mortgages, countless swindlers are working to take \nadvantage of them. And the way the system works now, we can't keep up.\n  The mortgage and corporate fraud bill will strengthen our ability to \nstop those who game the system on the backs of families who play by the \nrules and make an honest living. It gives law enforcement the necessary \ntools to probe, prosecute, and punish those responsible for the frauds \nthat exploit hardworking homeowners and endanger our economy.\n  It is a strong start to solving a critical component of this crisis. \nBut if we are going to protect families, it is not enough to punish the \nperpetrators--we must also stop the scams before they start. That is \nwhat the amendment I have submitted today does.\n  My Amendment No. 984 complements the larger effort in the underlying \nbill in three important ways, with each component focusing on the areas \nwhere foreclosures are the highest:\n  First, we will authorize more resources for advertising to help \npeople avoid the mortgage rescue scams that bilk homeowners of \nthousands of dollars by raising awareness of the problem and \nencouraging the use of legitimate, free counseling agencies there to \nhelp. Because many of these areas have large Latino populations, at \nleast half of those resources will be used for Spanish language \nadvertising.\n  Second, we will increase resources for HUD-certified housing-\ncounseling agencies in those hardest-hit areas. Las Vegas, Reno and \nother reeling regions still need more help as this problem gets worse. \nThis amendment will help the agencies staff up and meet the growing \ndemand for their services.\n  Third, we will send well-trained and experienced HUD officials to \nfurther support those agencies and other efforts by the Federal \nGovernment to combat the foreclosure crisis and prevent scams.\n  Hardworking Americans have lost enough in this storm. They need not \ngive thousands of dollars to con artists who will leave them with \nstruggling with the same mortgage and even less money to pay it. They \nneed not be duped into turning over the keys to their home only to be \nevicted later.\n  To stabilize the economy, we must build on the administration's and \nour own prior efforts to stabilize the housing market. To do that, we \nmust start by stopping fraud. Yes, we must put away the swindlers, but \nwe must also do more to stop the vultures before they can prey on the \nmost vulnerable.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today Chairman Dianne \nFeinstein and I, with the agreement of Vice Chairman Kit Bond, have \nposted on the Web site of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \na document newly declassified by the Obama administration. I ask that \nthis document be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  In so doing we conclude an effort that I began as chairman of the \ncommittee in the last Congress to provide to the public an initial \nnarrative of the history of the interrogation and detention opinions of \nthe Department of Justice's--DOJ--Office of Legal Counsel, OLC.\n  I applaud President Obama's decisive action last week not only to \nrelease four of the OLC opinions discussed in our narrative but also to \nstate firmly our Nation's support for the front-line intelligence \nprofessionals who relied on that legal advice in good faith. I couldn't \nagree more.\n  Three of these OLC documents are among those that I sought for the \ncommittee starting as far back as 2005, when it became increasingly \nclear to me that Congress had not been given complete information \nregarding the Bush administration's interrogation policies and \npractices.\n  I said publicly in July of 2005 and still firmly believe today that \nsecret legal opinions that are kept even from oversight by the Congress \ncan lead to great error. In the years since then I--together with \nChairman Feinstein and others--have sought within the committee, on the \nSenate floor, and in\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\nwritten demands to the Bush administration to launch a comprehensive \ninvestigation of these issues and to advance legislation to end \ncoercive interrogation practices.\n  Now, thanks to President Obama's wise decision and to the ongoing \nwork of the Senate Intelligence Committee, we have at last begun the \ntask of fully setting the record straight, holding our government \naccountable, and learning from past errors in order to protect our \ncountry into the future.\n  Let me be clear--in the wake of 9/11 we all wanted to leave no stone \nunturned in our pursuit of terrorists to prevent future attacks. At \nthat time and since, the Senate Intelligence Committee sought to work \nin partnership with the administration to keep America safe. But we now \nknow that essential information was withheld from the Congress on many \nmatters and decisions were made in secret by senior Bush administration \nofficials to obscure the complete picture.\n  It is my hope and intention that the document we release today helps \nto fill in some of the facts, even as many other pieces of the puzzle \nare brought forth.\n  The genesis of this document is as follows:\n  Last year, I sought declassification of the August 1, 2002, OLC \nopinion, along with a short contextual narrative to accompany it. While \ndeclassification of that opinion was resisted, we engaged instead in a \njoint effort with Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey to declassify a \nbroader narrative surrounding all of the OLC's opinions on these \nmatters.\n  The objective was to produce a text that describes the key elements \nof the opinions and sets forth facts that provide a context for those \nopinions, within the boundaries of what the DOJ and the Intelligence \nCommunity would recommend in 2008 for declassification.\n  By late 2008, the DOJ, the Director of National Intelligence--DNI--\nand the Central Intelligence Agency--CIA--all had approved the public \nrelease of this narrative, but the Bush Administration National \nSecurity Council--NSC--held it and would not agree to its \ndeclassification.\n  I renewed the declassification effort as soon as Attorney General \nEric Holder took office in early February 2009, and I am pleased to \nhave received the support again of the DOJ, DNI and CIA, and now also \nof the NSC, for its release as a contextual description of the OLC \nmemos.\n  Readers of the narrative should bear in mind that its text is current \nthrough President Obama's Executive orders of January 22, 2009, but has \nnot been revised following the release of the four OLC opinions on \nApril 16, 2009. While there is now more public information available \nabout those four opinions, the narrative adds important facts about the \napproval of the interrogation program beginning in 2002 and about \nopinions subsequent to the four that have been released.\n  For the moment, I would like to note three points that emerge from \nthe narrative: First, the records of the CIA demonstrate that the \nlawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel--OLC--did not operate in a \nvacuum. Key legal officials at the CIA, NSC, DOJ's Criminal Division, \nthe Office of White House Counsel, all participated in meetings leading \nto the approval of methods used by the CIA. The then Vice President and \nthe National Security Adviser are at the center of the discussions. \nBut, strikingly, unless there is a further story in records not yet \nshown to us, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, were \nnot involved in the decision making process despite the high stakes for \nU.S. foreign policy and for the treatment of the U.S. military.\n  Second, the narrative and the May 30, 2005, opinion demonstrate that \nthe Detainee Treatment Act of December 2005, was substantially \nundermined by the May 30, 2005, OLC opinion. The Bush administration \nhad already construed the main provisions of the act to authorize its \nfull gamut of coercive techniques.\n  Third, the narrative demonstrates that the job of declassifying the \ninterrogation and detention opinions of the OLC is not complete. There \nwere important opinions in 2006 and 2007 that will, among other things, \nshow how OLC interpreted the Detainee Treatment Act and the war crimes \namendments of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, and Common Article \n3 of the Geneva Conventions. The prompt declassification of those \nopinions, accompanied by their withdrawal as valid OLC opinions, is \nessential to completing the progress achieved by the President's \ndeclassification and the Attorney General's withdrawal of four opinions \nlast week.\n  Finally, I am gratified that the release of the August 2002 and May \n2005 opinions, followed by the release of this narrative of the history \nof OLC opinions from 2002 to 2007, are themselves but first steps.\n  In this new environment, and with the shared determination of our new \nchairman, the Senate Intelligence Committee is undertaking a major \nreview not only of the origin of the detention and interrogation \nprogram but also of its actual implementation. We will be asking \nprobing questions about what took place during interrogations and what \nintelligence was gained from detainees. We will also be examining what \nwas told to the Congress, including both the content and the \nlimitations on the briefings that were provided.\n  It is long overdue but certainly not too late. As we enter a new \nperiod committed to openness and change, and bid farewell to the former \nadministration's obscurity and dishonesty, there is the potential for \ngreat progress in our intelligence and national security activities.\n  The trust between the executive branch and the Congress was breached, \nand the trust and confidence of the American people has been eroded. \nBut I remain confident that if we restore the vital role of the \nCongress in overseeing our intelligence activities, we can bridge the \ndivide, restore integrity, and get back to the business of lawfully and \neffectively securing this great Nation.\n  The material follows:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2009.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     Senate. Select Committee on Intelligence,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: This responds to your letter of \n     February 3, 2009, which requested declassification and \n     release of a narrative regarding advice provided by the \n     Department to the Central Intelligence Agency on the legality \n     of the CIA's use of certain interrogation techniques.\n       As you know, we have worked with Committee staff in \n     reviewing the narrative for this purpose and we are pleased \n     to advise you that this process has now been completed. We \n     are transmitting the now declassified narrative to you with \n     this letter for the further action necessary in order to \n     disclose the document.\n       We appreciate the leadership that you and the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence have demonstrated on these \n     important issues. We also are grateful for your patience as \n     we have worked through the process leading to this \n     declassification.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n       Enclosure.\n                                  ____\n\n\nRelease of Declassified Narrative Describing the Department of Justice \n     Office of Legal Counsel's Opinions on the CIA's Detention and \n                         Interrogation Program\n\n            (Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, April 22, 2009)\n\n\n                                PREFACE\n\n       The release of the following declassified narrative \n     completes an effort that I began last year as Chairman of the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence. The document is an effort \n     to provide to the public an initial narrative of the history \n     of the opinions of the Department of Justice's Office of \n     Legal Counsel (OLC), from 2002 to 2007, on the legality of \n     the Central Intelligence Agency's detention and interrogation \n     program.\n       In August 2008, I asked Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey \n     to join the effort to create such an unclassified narrative. \n     The Attorney General committed himself to the endeavor, \n     saying that if we failed it would not be for want of effort. \n     Over the next months, Committee counsel and representatives \n     of the Department of Justice, CIA, Office of the Director of \n     National Intelligence, and the office of the Counsel to the \n     President discussed potential text. The shared objective was \n     to produce a text that, putting aside debate about the merits \n     of the OLC opinions, describes key elements of the opinions \n     and sets forth facts that provide a useful context for those \n     opinions, within the boundaries of what the Department of \n     Justice (DOJ) and the Intelligence Community would recommend \n     in 2008 for declassification.\n       The understanding of the participants was that while the \n     final product would be a Legislative Branch document, the \n     collaborative nature of this process would provide the \n     Executive Branch participants with the opportunity to ensure \n     its accuracy. Before the end\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\n     of the year, this process produced a narrative whose \n     declassification DOJ, the DNI and the CIA supported. However, \n     the prior Administration's National Security Council did not \n     agree to declassify the narrative.\n       I renewed this effort in early February as soon as Attorney \n     General Eric H. Holder, Jr., took office. Except for this \n     preface, some minor edits, and the addition of a final \n     paragraph to bring the narrative up to date as of President \n     Obama's Executive Orders of January 22, 2009, this document \n     is the same as the one that secured support for \n     declassification last year. This declassification, which \n     National Security Adviser James L. Jones effected on April \n     16, 2009 and Attorney General Holder transmitted to the \n     Committee on April 17, 2009, is supported again by the DOJ, \n     the DNI, and the CIA. Because the text of the narrative was \n     settled prior to the release on April 16, 2009 of the \n     declassified OLC opinions from August 2002 and May 2005, the \n     narrative does not include additional information from those \n     opinions that is now in the public domain.\n     John D. Rockefeller IV.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      OLC Opinions on the CIA Detention and Interrogation Program\n\n Submitted by Senator John D. Rockefeller IV for Classification Review\n\n       On May 19, 2008, the Department of Justice and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency (CIA) provided the Committee with access \n     to all opinions and a number of other documents prepared by \n     the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     (OLC) concerning the legality of the CIA's detention and \n     interrogation program. Five of the documents provided \n     addressed the use of waterboarding. Committee Members and \n     staff reviewed these documents over the course of several \n     weeks; however, the Committee was not allowed to retain \n     copies of the OLC documents about the CIA's interrogation and \n     detention program.\n       The Committee had previously received one classified OLC \n     opinion--an August 1, 2002, OLC opinion--in May 2004 as an \n     attachment to a special review issued by the CIA's Inspector \n     General on the CIA's detention and interrogation program. The \n     opinion is marked as ``Top Secret.'' The Executive Branch \n     initially provided access to this review and its attachments \n     to the Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman and staff \n     directors. On September 6, 2006, all Members of the Committee \n     obtained access to the Inspector General's review. The August \n     1, 2002, opinion is currently the only classified OLC opinion \n     in the Committee's possession as to the legality of the CIA's \n     interrogation techniques.\n\n\nThe capture of Abu Zubaydah and the initiation of the CIA detention and \n                         interrogation program\n\n       In late March 2002, senior Al-Qa'ida operative Abu Zubaydah \n     was captured. Abu Zubaydah was badly injured during the \n     firefight that brought him into custody. The CIA arranged for \n     his medical care, and, in conjunction with two FBI agents, \n     began interrogating him. At that time, the CIA assessed that \n     Abu Zubaydah had specific information concerning future Al-\n     Qa'ida attacks against the United States.\n       CIA records indicate that members of the National Security \n     Council (NSC) and other senior Administration officials were \n     briefed on the CIA's detention and interrogation program \n     throughout the course of the program. In April 2002, \n     attorneys from the CIA's Office of General Counsel began \n     discussions with the Legal Adviser to the National Security \n     Council and OLC concerning the CIA's proposed interrogation \n     plan for Abu Zubaydah and legal restrictions on that \n     interrogation. CIA records indicate that the Legal Adviser to \n     the National Security Council briefed the National Security \n     Adviser, Deputy National Security Adviser, and Counsel to the \n     President, as well as the Attorney General and the head of \n     the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.\n       According to CIA records, because the CIA believed that Abu \n     Zubaydah was withholding imminent threat information during \n     the initial interrogation sessions, attorneys from the CIA's \n     Office of General Counsel met with the Attorney General, the \n     National Security Adviser, the Deputy National Security \n     Adviser, the Legal Adviser to the National Security Council, \n     and the Counsel to the President in mid-May 2002 to discuss \n     the possible use of alternative interrogation methods that \n     differed from the traditional methods used by the U.S. \n     military and intelligence community. At this meeting, the CIA \n     proposed particular alternative interrogation methods, \n     including waterboarding.\n       The CIA's Office of General Counsel subsequently asked OLC \n     to prepare an opinion about the legality of its proposed \n     techniques. To enable OLC to review the legality of the \n     techniques, the CIA provided OLC with written and oral \n     descriptions of the proposed techniques. The CIA also \n     provided OLC with information about any medical and \n     psychological effects of DoD's Survival, Evasion, Resistance \n     and Escape (SERE) School, which is a military training \n     program during which military personnel receive counter-\n     interrogation training.\n       On July 13, 2002, according to CIA records, attorneys from \n     the CIA's Office of General Counsel met with the Legal \n     Adviser to the National Security Council, a Deputy Assistant \n     Attorney General from OLC, the head of the Criminal Division \n     of the Department of Justice, the chief of staff to the \n     Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the \n     Counsel to the President to provide an overview of the \n     proposed interrogation plan for Abu Zubaydah.\n       On July 17, 2002, according to CIA records, the Director of \n     Central Intelligence (DCI) met with the National Security \n     Adviser, who advised that the CIA could proceed with its \n     proposed interrogation of Abu Zubaydah. This advice, which \n     authorized CIA to proceed as a policy matter, was subject to \n     a determination of legality by OLC.\n       On July 24, 2002, according to CIA records, OLC orally \n     advised the CIA that the Attorney General had concluded that \n     certain proposed interrogation techniques were lawful and, on \n     July 26, that the use of waterboarding was lawful. OLC issued \n     two written opinions and a fetter memorializing those \n     conclusions on August 1, 2002.\n\n\n                      August 1, 2002 OLC Opinions\n\n       On August 1, 2002, OLC issued three documents analyzing \n     U.S. obligations with respect to the treatment of detainees. \n     Two of these three documents were unclassified: an \n     unclassified opinion interpreting the federal criminal \n     prohibition on torture, and a letter concerning U.S. \n     obligations under the Convention Against Torture and the Rome \n     Statute. Those two documents were released in 2004 and are \n     publicly available.\n       The third document issued by OLC was a classified legal \n     opinion to the CIA's Acting General Counsel analyzing whether \n     the use of the interrogation techniques proposed by the CIA \n     on Abu Zubaydah was consistent with federal law. OLC had \n     determined that the only federal law governing the \n     interrogation of an alien detained outside the United States \n     was the federal anti-torture statute. The opinion thus \n     assessed whether the use of the proposed interrogation \n     techniques on Abu Zubaydah would violate the criminal \n     prohibition against torture found at Section 2340A of title \n     18 of the United States Code. The Department of Justice \n     released a highly redacted version of this opinion in July \n     2008 in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\n       The classified opinion described the interrogation \n     techniques proposed by the CIA. Only one of these \n     techniques--waterboarding--has been publicly acknowledged. In \n     addition to describing the form of waterboarding that the CIA \n     proposed to use, the opinion discusses procedures the CIA \n     identified as limitations as well as procedures to stop the \n     use of interrogation techniques if deemed necessary to \n     prevent severe mental or physical harm. Although a form of \n     ``waterboarding'' has been employed on U.S. military \n     personnel as part of the SERE training program, the Executive \n     Branch considers classified the precise operational details \n     concerning the CIA's form of the technique.\n       The opinion also outlined the factual predicates for the \n     legal analysis, including the CIA's background research on \n     the proposed techniques and their possible effect on the \n     mental health of Abu Zubaydah. The opinion described the \n     information provided by the CIA concerning whether \n     ``prolonged mental harm'' would be likely to result from the \n     use of those proposed procedures. Because the military's SERE \n     training program, like the CIA program, involved a series of \n     stressful interrogation techniques (including a form of \n     waterboarding) the opinion discussed inquiries and statistics \n     relating to possible adverse psychological reactions to SERE \n     training.\n       The anti-torture statute prohibits an act ``specifically \n     intended'' to inflict ``severe physical or mental pain or \n     suffering.'' The opinion separately considered whether each \n     of the proposed interrogation techniques, individually or in \n     combination, would inflict ``severe physical pain or \n     suffering'' or ``severe mental pain or suffering.'' The \n     opinion also considered whether individuals using the \n     techniques would have the mental state necessary to violate \n     the statute.\n       The opinion concluded that none of the techniques \n     individually was likely to cause ``severe physical pain or \n     suffering'' under the statute. With respect to waterboarding, \n     the OLC opinion concluded that the technique would not \n     inflict ``severe physical pain or suffering'' because it does \n     not inflict actual physical harm or physical pain. The \n     opinion concluded that, although OLC did not then believe \n     physical suffering to be a concept under the statute distinct \n     from physical pain, waterboarding would not inflict severe \n     suffering, because any physical effects of waterboarding did \n     not extend for the protracted period of time generally \n     required by the term ``suffering.''\n       The OLC opinion also concluded that none of the techniques \n     would constitute ``severe mental pain or suffering'' as that \n     term is defined under the anti-torture statute. The opinion \n     concluded that under the anti-torture statute, ``severe \n     mental pain or suffering'' requires the occurrence of one of \n     four specified predicate acts, as well as ``prolonged mental \n     harm.'' The opinion interpreted ``prolonged mental harm'' to \n     require harm of some lasting duration, such as mental harm \n     lasting months or years.\n       With respect to waterboarding, based on information \n     provided by the CIA, the OLC opinion assessed whether it \n     constituted, as a legal matter, one of the four predicate \n     acts under the mental harm component of the anti-torture \n     statute. The opinion concluded that the technique would not \n     cause ``severe mental pain or suffering'' because, based on \n     the U.S. military's experience with the form of 5 \n     waterboarding used in its SERE program, the CIA did not \n     anticipate that\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\n     waterboarding would cause prolonged mental harm.\n       After evaluating the proposed techniques individually, the \n     OLC opinion considered whether the combined use of the \n     proposed interrogation techniques would cause ``severe \n     physical pain or suffering'' or ``severe mental pain or \n     suffering.'' OLC concluded that the combined use of the \n     interrogation techniques would not constitute severe physical \n     pain or suffering, because individually the techniques fell \n     short of and would not be combined in such a way as to reach \n     that threshold. The opinion concluded that OLC lacked \n     sufficient information concerning the proposed use of the \n     techniques to assess whether their combined use might inflict \n     one of the predicate conditions for severe mental pain or \n     suffering. The opinion concluded, however, that even if a \n     predicate condition would be satisfied, it would not violate \n     the prohibition because there was no evidence that the \n     proposed course of conduct would produce any prolonged mental \n     harm.\n       Finally, the opinion addressed whether an individual \n     carrying out the proposed interrogation procedures would have \n     the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain \n     or suffering required by the statute. It concluded that the \n     interrogator would not have the requisite intent because of \n     the circumstances surrounding the use of the techniques, \n     including the interrogator's expectation that the techniques \n     would not cause severe physical or mental pain or suffering, \n     and the CIA's intent to include specific precautions to \n     prevent serious physical harm.\n       For those reasons, the classified opinion concluded that \n     none of the proposed interrogation techniques, used \n     individually or in combination, would violate the criminal \n     prohibition against torture found at section 2340A of title \n     18 of the United States Code.\n\n\n          Events after issuance of August 1, 2002 OLC opinion\n\n       According to CIA records, after receiving the legal \n     approval of the Department of Justice and approval from the \n     National Security Adviser, the CIA went forward with the \n     interrogation of Abu Zubaydah and with the interrogation of \n     other high-value Al-Qa'ida detainees who were then in, or \n     later came into, U.S. custody. Waterboarding was used on \n     three detainees: Abu Zubaydah, Abd alRahim al-Nashiri, and \n     Khalid Sheikh Muhammad. The application of waterboarding to \n     these detainees occurred during the 2002 and 2003 timeframe.\n       In the fall of 2002, after the use of interrogation \n     techniques on Abu Zubaydah, CIA records indicate that the CIA \n     briefed the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee on \n     the interrogation. After the change in leadership of the \n     Committee in January of 2003, CIA records indicate that the \n     new Chairman of the Committee was briefed on the CIA's \n     program in early 2003. Although the new Vice-Chairman did not \n     attend that briefing, it was attended by both the staff \n     director and minority staff director of the Committee. \n     According to CIA records, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of \n     the Committee were also briefed on aspects of the program \n     later in 2003, after the use of interrogation techniques on \n     Khalid Sheikh Muhammad.\n       In the spring of 2003, the DCI asked for a reaffirmation of \n     the policies and practices in the interrogation program. In \n     July 2003, according to CIA records, the NSC Principals met \n     to discuss the interrogation techniques employed in the CIA \n     program. According to CIA records, the DCI and the CIA's \n     General Counsel attended a meeting with the Vice President, \n     the National Security Adviser, the Attorney General, the \n     Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \n     Counsel, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, the Counsel to \n     the President, and the Legal Adviser to the National Security \n     Council to describe the CIA's interrogation techniques, \n     including waterboarding. According to CIA records, at the \n     conclusion of that meeting, the Principals reaffirmed that \n     the CIA program was lawful and reflected administration \n     policy.\n       According to CIA records, pursuant to a request from the \n     National Security Adviser, the Director of Central \n     Intelligence subsequently briefed the Secretary of State and \n     the Secretary of Defense on the CIA's interrogation \n     techniques on September 16, 2003.\n       In May 2004, the CIA's Inspector General issued a \n     classified special review of the CIA's detention and \n     interrogation program, a copy of which was provided to the \n     Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman and staff directors in \n     June of 2004. The classified August 1, 2002, OLC opinion was \n     included as an attachment to the Inspector General's review. \n     That review included information about the CIA's use of \n     waterboarding on the three detainees.\n       After the issuance of that review, the CIA requested that \n     OLC prepare an updated legal opinion that incorporated actual \n     CIA experiences and practice in the use of the techniques to \n     date included in the Inspector General review, as well as \n     legal analysis as to whether the interrogation techniques \n     were consistent with the substantive standards contained in \n     the Senate reservation to Article 16 of the Convention \n     Against Torture.\n       Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture requires \n     signatories to ``undertake to prevent in any territory under \n     its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman and degrading \n     treatment which do not amount to torture.'' The Senate \n     reservation to that treaty defines the phrase ``cruel, \n     inhuman and degrading treatment'' as the treatment prohibited \n     by the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n     Constitution. Thus, the CIA requested that OLC assess whether \n     the interrogation techniques were consistent with the \n     substantive provisions of the due process clause, as well as \n     the constitutional requirement that the government not \n     inflict cruel or unusual punishment.\n       In May 2004, after the issuance of the Inspector General \n     review, CIA records indicate that the CIA's General Counsel \n     met with the Counsel to the President, the Counsel to the \n     Vice President, the NSC Legal Adviser, and senior Department \n     of Justice officials about the CIA's program and the \n     Inspector General review.\n       In June 2004, OLC withdrew its unclassified August 1, 2002, \n     opinion on the anti-torture statute. OLC did not, however, \n     withdraw the classified August 1, 2002 opinion, because it \n     concluded that the classified opinion was narrower in scope \n     than the unclassified opinion that was withdrawn. The \n     classified opinion applied the anti-torture statute to the \n     CIA's specific interrogation methods, but, unlike the \n     unclassified August 1, 2002, opinion, it did not rely on or \n     interpret the President's Commander in Chief power or \n     consider whether torture could be lawful under any \n     circumstances.\n       In July 2004, the CIA briefed the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee on the facts and conclusions of the \n     Inspector General special review. The CIA indicated at that \n     time that it was seeking OLC's legal analysis on whether the \n     program was consistent with the substantive provisions of \n     Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture.\n       According to CIA records, subsequent to the meeting with \n     the Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman in July 2004, the \n     CIA met with the NSC Principals to discuss the CIA's program. \n     At the conclusion of that meeting, it was agreed that the CIA \n     would formally request that OLC prepare a written opinion \n     addressing whether the CIA's proposed interrogation \n     techniques would violate substantive constitutional \n     standards, including those of the Fifth, Eighth and \n     Fourteenth Amendments regardless of whether or not those \n     standards were deemed applicable to aliens detained abroad.\n\n\n                 DOJ Advice from June 2004 to May 2005\n\n       Following the withdrawal of the unclassified August 1, \n     2002, opinion in June 2004, OLC began work on preparing an \n     unclassified opinion concerning its interpretation of the \n     anti-torture statute. At the same time, in accord with the \n     request described above, OLC worked on classified opinions \n     that would evaluate the specific techniques of the CIA \n     program, individually and in combination, under its revised \n     interpretation of the anti-torture statute, as well as an \n     opinion that would evaluate whether the program was \n     consistent with the substantive provisions of Article 16 of \n     the Convention Against Torture.\n       On July 14, 2004, in unclassified written testimony before \n     the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, an \n     Associate Deputy Attorney General explained the Department of \n     Justice's understanding of the substantive constitutional \n     standards embodied in the Senate reservation to Article 16 of \n     the Convention Against Torture. The official's written \n     testimony stated that under Supreme Court precedent, the \n     substantive due process component of the Fifth Amendment \n     protects against treatment that ``shocks the conscience.'' In \n     addition, his testimony stated that under Supreme Court \n     precedent, the Eighth Amendment protection against Cruel and \n     Unusual Punishment has no application to the treatment of \n     detainees where there has been no formal adjudication of \n     guilt.\n       While OLC worked on drafting new opinions with respect to \n     the CIA program, the CIA continued its interrogation of high-\n     value Al-Qa'ida detainees in U.S. custody. On July 22, 2004, \n     the Attorney General confirmed in writing to the Acting \n     Director of Central Intelligence that the use of the \n     interrogation techniques addressed by the August 1, 2002, \n     classified opinion, other than waterboarding, would not \n     violate the U.S. Constitution or any statute or treaty \n     obligation of the United States, including Article 16 of the \n     Convention Against Torture. On August 6, 2004, the Acting \n     Assistant Attorney General for OLC advised in writing that, \n     subject to the CIA's proposed limitations, conditions and \n     safeguards, the CIA's use of waterboarding would not violate \n     any of those legal restrictions. The letter noted that a \n     formal written opinion would follow explaining the basis for \n     those conclusions. According to the CIA, the CIA nonetheless \n     chose not to use waterboarding in 2004. Waterboarding was not \n     subsequently used on any detainee, and was removed from CIA's \n     authorized list of techniques sometime after 2005.\n       On December 30, 2004, the Office of Legal Counsel issued an \n     unclassified opinion interpreting the federal criminal \n     prohibition against torture, 18 USC 2340-2340A, superseding \n     in its entirety the withdrawn August 1, 2002, unclassified \n     opinion. That December 30, 2004, opinion included a footnote \n     stating ``While we have identified various disagreements with \n     the August 2002 Memorandum, we have reviewed this Office's \n     prior opinions addressing issues involving treatment of \n     detainees and do not believe that any of their conclusions \n     would be different under the standards set forth in this \n     memorandum.''\n       In January of 2005, in response to a question for the \n     record following his confirmation hearing, Attorney General \n     Gonzales indicated that ``the Administration . . . wants\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\n     to be in compliance with the relevant substantive \n     constitutional standard incorporated in Article 16 [of the \n     Convention Against Torture], even if such compliance is not \n     legally required.'' Attorney General Gonzales further \n     indicated that ``the Administration has undertaken a \n     comprehensive legal review of all interrogation prac-\n     tices. . . . The analysis of practices under the standards of \n     Article 16 is still under way.''\n       The CIA briefed the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the \n     Committee on the CIA's interrogation program again in March \n     2005. At that time, the CIA indicated that it was waiting for \n     a revised opinion from OLC.\n\n\n                           May 2005 Opinions\n\n       In May 2005, OLC issued three classified legal opinions \n     analyzing the legality of particular interrogation \n     techniques. The first legal opinion analyzed the legality of \n     particular interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, \n     under the interpretation of the federal criminal prohibition \n     against torture set forth in the December 30, 2004, \n     unclassified opinion. The May 2005 opinion includes \n     additional facts about the proposed techniques and a more \n     extensive description of the applicable legal standards than \n     the August 1, 2002, opinion.\n       With respect to waterboarding, the opinion concluded that \n     while the technique presented a substantial question under \n     the statute, the authorized use of waterboarding, when \n     conducted with measures identified by the CIA as \n     safeguards and limitations, would not violate the federal \n     criminal prohibition against torture. To understand the \n     possible effects of waterboarding, the May 2005 opinion \n     relied on the military's experience in the administration \n     of its form of the technique on American military \n     personnel who had undergone SERE training, while \n     recognizing some limitations with that reliance, such as \n     the expectations of the individual going through the \n     practice. The opinion also relied on the CIA's experience \n     with the use of its form of waterboarding on the three \n     detainees in 2002 and 2003.\n       The opinion concluded that waterboarding does not cause \n     ``severe physical pain'' because it is not physically \n     painful. It further reasoned that the CIA's form of \n     waterboarding could not reasonably be considered specifically \n     intended to cause ``severe physical pain.'' The opinion also \n     concluded that under the limitations and conditions adopted \n     by the CIA, the technique would not be expected to cause \n     distress of a sufficient intensity and duration to constitute \n     ``severe physical suffering,'' which the December 30, 2004 \n     unclassified opinion had recognized to be a separate element \n     under the federal anti-torture statute. The opinion concluded \n     that waterboarding would not cause ``severe mental pain or \n     suffering'' because OLC understood from the CIA that any \n     mental harm from waterboarding would not be ``prolonged,'' \n     even if it met a predicate condition under the statute.\n       OLC's second legal opinion issued in May 2005 addressed the \n     legality of the combined use of particular techniques, \n     including waterboarding, under the criminal prohibition \n     against torture. That opinion relied on information provided \n     by the CIA concerning the manner in which the individual \n     techniques were proposed to be combined in the CIA program. \n     After considering the combined use of techniques as described \n     by the CIA, OLC concluded that the combined use of the \n     proposed techniques by trained interrogators would not be \n     expected to cause the severe mental or physical pain or \n     suffering required by the criminal prohibition against \n     torture.\n       OLC's third legal opinion in May 2005 assessed the legality \n     of particular interrogation techniques under Article 16 of \n     the Convention Against Torture. The Executive Branch had \n     previously concluded that Article 16 does not apply to \n     detainees, such as those in CIA custody, who were held \n     outside territory under U.S. jurisdiction. Nonetheless, as \n     articulated in the January 2005 testimony of the Attorney \n     General, the Executive Branch had decided to comply, as a \n     matter of policy, with the relevant substantive \n     constitutional standards incorporated in Article 16. Because \n     of that policy determination, and because of the CIA's \n     request that OLC address the substantive ``cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading'' standard, OLC analyzed whether a number of \n     interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, would \n     violate the substantive constitutional standards contained in \n     the Senate reservation to CAT.\n       The May 2005 opinion on Article 16 concluded that the CIA's \n     use of interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, on \n     senior members of al-Qa'ida with knowledge of, or involvement \n     in, terrorist threats would not be prohibited by the Fifth, \n     Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments under the particular \n     circumstances of the CIA program. OLC concluded that with \n     respect to the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, who \n     had not been convicted of any crime, the relevant \n     constitutional prohibition was the ``shocks the conscience'' \n     standard of the substantive due process component of the \n     Fifth Amendment. Under the ``shocks the conscience'' \n     standard, OLC concluded that Supreme Court precedent requires \n     consideration as to whether the conduct is ``arbitrary in the \n     constitutional sense'' and whether it is objectively \n     ``egregious'' or ``outrageous'' in light of traditional \n     executive behavior and contemporary practices.\n       To assess whether the CIA's interrogation program was \n     ``arbitrary in the constitutional sense,'' OLC asked whether \n     the CIA's conduct of its interrogation program was \n     proportionate to the governmental interests involved. \n     Applying that test, OLC concluded that the CIA's \n     interrogation program was not ``arbitrary in the \n     constitutional sense'' because of the CIA's proposed use of \n     measures that it deemed to be ``safeguards'' and because the \n     techniques were to be used only as necessary to obtain \n     information that the CIA reasonably viewed as vital to \n     protecting the United States and its interests from further \n     terrorist attacks.\n       OLC also concluded that the techniques in the CIA program \n     were not objectively ``egregious'' or ``outrageous'' in light \n     of traditional executive behavior and contemporary practice. \n     In reaching that conclusion, OLC reviewed U.S. judicial \n     precedent, public military doctrine, the use of stressful \n     techniques in SERE training, public State Department reports \n     on the practices of other countries, and public domestic \n     criminal practices. OLC concluded that these sources \n     demonstrated that, in some circumstances (such as domestic \n     criminal investigations) there was a strong tradition against \n     the use of coercive interrogation practices, while in others \n     (such as with SERE training) stressful interrogation \n     techniques were deemed constitutionally permissible. OLC \n     therefore determined that use of such techniques was not \n     categorically inconsistent with traditional executive \n     behavior, and concluded that under the facts and \n     circumstances concerning the program, the use of the \n     techniques did not constitute government behavior so \n     egregious or outrageous as to shock the conscience in \n     violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n       Before the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act, in \n     October of 2005, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney \n     General for OLC noted in response to questions for the \n     record: ``[I]t is our policy to abide by the substantive \n     constitutional standard incorporated into Article 16 even if \n     such compliance is not legally required, regardless of \n     whether the detainee in question is held in the United States \n     or overseas.'' Similarly, in December of 2005, both the \n     Secretary of State and the National Security Adviser stated \n     publicly that U.S. policy was to treat detainees abroad in \n     accordance with the prohibition on cruel, inhuman and \n     degrading treatment contained in Article 16.\n\n\n                   Subsequent Developments in the Law\n\n       In December 2005, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment \n     Act (DTA), and the President subsequently signed it into law \n     on December 30, 2005. That Act applied the substantive legal \n     standards contained in the Senate reservation to Article 16 \n     to the treatment of all detainees in U.S. custody, including \n     those held by the CIA. At the time of the passage of the DTA, \n     the Administration had concluded, based on the May 2005 OLC \n     opinion, that the CIA's interrogation practices, including \n     waterboarding, were consistent with the substantive \n     constitutional standards embodied in the DTA.\n       In June 2006, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court held \n     that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention applied to the \n     conflict with Al-Qa'ida, contrary to the position previously \n     adopted by the President. Common Article 3 of the Geneva \n     Conventions requires that detainees ``shall in all \n     circumstances be treated humanely,'' and prohibits ``outrages \n     upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and \n     degrading treatment'' and ``violence to life and person, in \n     particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment \n     and torture.'' At the time of the Hamdan decision, the War \n     Crimes Act defined the term ``war crime'' to include ``a \n     violation of Common Article 3.''\n       In August 2006, OLC issued two documents considering the \n     legality of the conditions of confinement in CIA facilities. \n     One of the documents was an opinion interpreting the Detainee \n     Treatment Act; the other document was a letter interpreting \n     Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, as enforced by \n     the War Crimes Act. These documents included consideration of \n     U.S. constitutional law and the legal decisions of \n     international tribunals and other countries.\n       On September 6, 2006, the President publicly disclosed the \n     existence of the CIA's detention and interrogation program. \n     On the same day, the CIA briefed all Committee Members about \n     the CIA's detention and interrogation program, including the \n     CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques.\n       In October 2006, Congress passed the Military Commissions \n     Act (MCA) to set forth particular violations of Common \n     Article 3 subject to criminal prosecution under the War \n     Crimes Act. Specifically, the MCA amended the War Crimes Act \n     to designate nine actions as grave breaches of Common Article \n     3, punishable under criminal law. Although only these nine \n     violations of Common Article 3 are subject to criminal \n     prosecution, Congress recognized that Common Article 3 \n     imposes additional legal obligations on the United States. \n     The MCA provided that the President has the authority ``to \n     interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva \n     Conventions and to promulgate higher standards and \n     administrative regulations for violations of treaty \n     obligations which are not grave breaches of the Geneva \n     Conventions.''\n       In July 2007, the President issued Executive Order 13440, \n     which interpreted the additional obligations of the United \n     States imposed by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. \n     In conjunction with release of that Executive Order, OLC \n     issued a legal opinion analyzing the legality of the \n     interrogation techniques currently authorized for\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\n     use in the CIA program under Common Article 3 of the Geneva \n     Conventions, the Detainee Treatment Act, and the War Crimes \n     Act.\n       The July 2007 opinion includes extensive legal analysis of \n     the war crimes added by the MCA, U.S. constitutional law, the \n     treaty obligations of the United States, and the legal \n     decisions of foreign and international tribunals. The July \n     2007 opinion does not include analysis of the anti-torture \n     statute but rather incorporates by reference the analysis of \n     the May 2005 opinions that certain proposed techniques do not \n     violate the anti-torture statute, either individually or \n     combined.\n       In considering ``traditional executive behavior and \n     contemporary practices'' under the substantive due process \n     standard embodied in the Detainee Treatment Act, OLC \n     considered similar sources to those considered in the May \n     2005 opinion on Article 16. In addition, OLC examined the \n     legislative history of the MCA, which the President had \n     sought, in part, to ensure that the CIA program could go \n     forward following Hamdan, consistent with Common Article 3 \n     and the War Crimes Act. OLC observed that, in considering the \n     MCA, Congress was confronted with the question of whether the \n     CIA should operate an interrogation program for high value \n     detainees that employed techniques exceeding those used by \n     the U.S. military but that remained lawful under the anti-\n     torture statute and the War Crimes Act. OLC concluded that \n     while the passage of the MCA was not conclusive on the \n     constitutional question as to whether the program ``shocked \n     the conscience,'' the legislation did provide a ``relevant \n     measure of contemporary standards'' concerning the CIA \n     program and suggested that Congress had endorsed the view \n     that the CIA's interrogation program was consistent with \n     contemporary practice.\n       Because waterboarding was not among the authorized list of \n     techniques, the 2007 OLC opinion did not address the legality \n     of waterboarding. OLC therefore has not considered the \n     legality of waterboarding under either of the two provisions \n     that have been applied to the CIA's treatment of detainees \n     since the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act in December \n     of 2005: Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and the \n     War Crimes Act, as amended by the MCA.\n\n\n                         Present Circumstances\n\n       On January 30, 2008, at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on Oversight of the Department of Justice, the \n     Attorney General disclosed that waterboarding was not among \n     the techniques currently authorized for use in the CIA \n     program. He therefore declined to express a view as to the \n     technique's legality. The Attorney General also stated that \n     for waterboarding to be authorized in the future, the CIA \n     would have to request its use, the CIA Director ``would have \n     to ask me, or any successor of mine, if its use would be \n     lawful, taking into account the particular facts and \n     circumstances at issue, including how and why it is to be \n     used, the limits of its use and the safeguards that are in \n     place for its use,'' and the President would have to address \n     the issue.\n       In February 2008, in testimony before this Committee, the \n     CIA Director publicly disclosed that waterboarding had been \n     used on three detainees, as previously described. At that \n     same hearing, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \n     testified that waterboarding was not currently a part of the \n     CIA's program, and that if there was a reason to use such a \n     technique, the Director of the CIA and the Director of \n     National Intelligence would have to agree whether to move \n     forward and ask the Attorney General for a ruling on the \n     legality of the specifics of the situation. The Committee \n     also discussed the CIA's interrogation program with those two \n     officials in closed session.\n       Although waterboarding was no longer a technique authorized \n     for use in the CIA program, and the Attorney General and DNI \n     testified in 2008 that a new legal opinion based on current \n     law would be required before it could be used again, the May \n     2005 opinions on the legality of waterboarding under the \n     anti-torture statute and Article 16 of the Convention Against \n     Torture (the legal standards subsequently embodied in the \n     DTA) remained precedents of the Office of Legal Counsel at \n     the time of the Attorney General's and DNI's 2008 testimony.\n       On January 22, 2009, the President issued Executive Order \n     13491 on ``Ensuring Lawful Interrogations.'' The Executive \n     Order revoked Executive Order 13440, limited the \n     interrogation techniques that may be used by officers, \n     employees, or other agents of the United States Government, \n     and established a Special Interagency Task Force on \n     Interrogation and Transfer Policies to report recommendations \n     to the President. With respect to prior interpretations of \n     law governing interrogation, section 3(c) of Executive Order \n     13491 directed that, unless the Attorney General provides \n     further guidance, officers, employees, and other agents of \n     the United States Government may not rely on interpretations \n     of the law governing interrogations issued by the Department \n     of Justice between September 11, 2001, and January 20, \n     2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4566-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4566-S4567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Corporal Donte Jamal Whitworth\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of Marine Cpl Donte Jamal Whitworth from Noblesville, IN. Donte \nwas 21 years old when he lost his life on February 28, 2009, from \ninjuries sustained from a vehicular accident near Al Taquddum Air Base \nin Al Anbar Province, Iraq. He was a member of Combat Logistics \nRegiment 15, 1st Marine Logistics Group, Marine Corps Air Station of \nYuma, AZ.\n  Donte, a 2005 graduate of Noblesville High School, joined the Marines \nimmediately after graduation, eager to serve his country. While \ndeployed, he commanded supply convoys transporting goods between U.S. \nmilitary bases in Iraq. Donte was a dedicated basketball fan who always \nhad a smile on his face. Born into a family of marines, he was proud to \nembrace the tradition and become a member of our country's Armed \nForces. Scheduled to return home in March, Donte planned on reenlisting \nafter his tour was complete.\n  Today, I join Donte's family and friends in mourning his death. Donte \nwill forever be remembered as a loving son, grandson, and friend to \nmany. He is survived by his mother, Carla Plowden; father, Daniel \nWhitworth; step-father, Kerry McGee; grandparents, Robert and Catherine \nWilliams; and a host of other relatives, friends, and fellow marines.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Donte set as a dedicated soldier. Today and \nalways, Donte will be remembered by family, friends, and fellow \nHoosiers as a true American hero, and we cherish the sacrifice he made \nwhile dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas we can take some measure of solace in knowing that Donte's heroism \nand memory will outlive the record of the words here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Donte Jamal Whitworth in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. I pray \nthat Donte's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah \nwho said:\n\n       He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \n     wipe away tears from off all faces.\n\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Donte.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Bradley Marshall\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life, \nachievements, and memory of SGT Bradley Marshall of Little Rock, AR. He \ngave his life on July 31, 2007, defending citizens of the United States \nand advancing democracy throughout the world.\n  Sergeant Marshall served in the 2nd Battalion, 377th Parachute Field \nArtillery Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, Airborne, 25th Infantry \nDivision, Fort Richardson, AK. His bravery on behalf of this Nation is \nheroic. His service, professionalism and allegiance to this country \nwill continue to serve as the standard bearer for which to honor our \ngreat Nation.\n  Friends and family described Bradley as athletic and fun-loving. He \nwas a loyal and valued member of his church, community, and Nation. As \na husband and father, Bradley loved his family greatly and always \ncherished their time together. His wife of 17 years, Gina Marshall, \nsaid of him ``Brad was the love of my life.'' His son Wesley remembers \nhis dad stopping by his room each night to say, ``I love you.'' Tanner, \nMarshall's other son, put together a slide show presenting hundreds of \npictures of his father.\n  He touched many lives and was respected by everyone that knew him. \nBradley was known as the dependable man who made sure things got done \nin his own quiet way such as cutting the grass at church, remodeling a \nhome for his former high school coach, doing chores around the house, \nand helping with vacations for the family. Bradley's church named their \nnew Brad Marshall Family Life Center in honor\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\nof him and the sacrifice he gave to this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the \nsacrifice SGT Bradley Marshall and his family have given to protecting \nour freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4567-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING ELISHA ``RAY'' NANCE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to pay appropriate tribute today to \nan American hero--Elisha ``Ray'' Nance--of Bedford, VA.\n  He passed away last Sunday at the age of 94, and memorial services \nare being held today.\n  Mr. Nance was the last surviving member of what has come to be known \nas ``The Bedford Boys''--members of Company A, 116th Infantry, 29th \nDivision.\n  Mr. Nance was among 38 National Guardsmen from the close-knit \ncommunity of Bedford who were called to active service in World War II. \nOn June 6, 1944, 19 were killed when they landed on Omaha Beach at the \nstart of the D-day invasion. Two more died later.\n  ``We Bedford boys,'' Nance recalled, ``we competed to be in the first \nwave. We wanted to be there. We wanted to be the first on the beach,'' \nhe would write as he recovered from his own severe wounds.\n  Bedford recorded 21 casualties out of 38 men who served, all from the \nsame small town of 3,200 people located in central Virginia.\n  That overwhelming loss led to Bedford's selection as the site of the \nNational D-day Memorial--a worthy project I was honored to support, \nboth as a private citizen and as Virginia Governor.\n  But Ray Nance's public service did not end with his military service.\n  To honor his fallen brethren, Nance returned home to Bedford and \nhelped reorganize Company A of the Virginia National Guard, and served \nas its first commander. He then built a career as a rural postal \ncarrier, and served in the Elks.\n  At the end of his life, he was a proud resident of the Elks National \nHome in Bedford.\n  In recent years, he visited the D-day Memorial often to help teach \nyounger generations about the service, courage and sacrifice \ndemonstrated by ``The Bedford Boys'' and others of the ``greatest \ngeneration.''\n  Ray Nance's life and example demonstrate the very best qualities--and \nthe responsibilities--of citizenship.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his widow Alpha and their children, \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren. A grateful Commonwealth and \nNation thanks them for their lifetime of support for Ray Nance--a \nhero--and the last of ``The Bedford Boys.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4567-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to mark an anniversary, one \nthat was many tragic years in the making. According to the Idaho AFL-\nCIO, 35 Idaho workers were killed due to on the job injuries in 2007. \nNext Tuesday, April 28, is National Worker's Memorial Day, which \ncelebrates the day the Occupational Safety and Health Act--OSHA--became \nlaw in 1970.\n  More than 30 years ago, in 1967 a construction worker in Nampa, ID, \nLouis Jose Archuleta, was killed in a jobsite accident. Louie and \nothers were installing a sewer line, 35 feet deep, in sandy soil, when \nthe soil caved in. It trapped Louie, and, although fellow workers and \nrescue crews worked diligently for two and a half hours, their efforts \nwere hampered due to further collapses of cleared areas, and Archuleta \ndid not survive.\n  But Louie and many other workers knew what they were facing. Just a \nweek before the accident, Louie told his sister Victoria that it was \nthe most dangerous job he had ever worked on. Safety inspectors were in \nthe process of shutting the job down at the time of the accident, a \nprocess that, in 1967, took at least 5 days to shut down a job.\n  Louie was very active in the local labor union and served three \nterms--9 years--as president of Labor's Union Local No. 267 in \nPocatello, ID. He was a strong advocate for a retirement system. As a \nresult of the tragedy, the Idaho AFL-CIO joined the push for Federal \nlegislation to protect workers, legislation that was later known as \nOccupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA.\n  With Louie, his family and the many others who have suffered due to \nworker safety issue, I am honored to recognize National Worker's \nMemorial Day, keeping in mind Louis Jose Archuleta and all fallen \nworkers for their contribution to the infrastructure of the State of \nIdaho and the Nation and to the establishment of OSHA and much-needed \nincreased worker safety standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4567-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4567-S4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. PRESIDENT, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My personal and family circumstances are good with regard \n     to income and out-go. That being said, the price of fuel, \n     whether diesel or gasoline, is still an outrage, but there is \n     absolutely nothing the government should do about it \n     directly. Yes, we should make a meaningful effort to develop \n     alternative fuel sources and methods of transportation and \n     even responsibly drill for our own oil and gas here at home. \n     But, the minute [price controls are started], that is when \n     all hell breaks loose and things go to hell in a handbasket. \n     Please advise your colleagues to not impose a windfall \n     profits tax on oil companies. That will be another direct tax \n     on the American consumer, [even though many do not pay \n     attention.] Most Americans will just continue to believe it \n     is the oil companies that are the culprits because of what we \n     hear on TV!\n       Please be smart about this. Let capitalism rule. Tell our \n     ``friends'' in the Middle East to enjoy selling to China and \n     India and let us become responsibly self-sufficient, like we \n     should be. And, by the way, if oil were not traded as a \n     futures commodity, I am betting the price would tank quickly \n     and substantially. What do you think?\n     Scott, Malad.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking about how gasoline prices are \n     affecting my family. The increase of energy costs has allowed \n     my family to make conscious decisions, instead of acting on \n     impulses. Our family is combining trips and errands. We are \n     going with each other instead of separately and enjoying our \n     new shared times. I am so disappointed when I reviewed the \n     salaries of the big oil executives and found them arrogant \n     when I watched them testifying before the Committee on C-\n     SPAN. It looks to me like they pocketed the money and failed \n     to improve their facilities.\n       I have been discouraged that not one of Idaho's \n     Congressional delegation has asked my family to conserve one \n     ounce of petroleum. I do not want a knee-jerk reaction to \n     higher prices at the pumps and check-outs; I want \n     examination, reviews and bipartisan recommendations. It seems \n     the decisions made in hurry during the last eight years have \n     caught up with us. Slow down and do what is right for \n     America.\n     June.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am grateful that you have given us a chance to be able to \n     express our frustrations and opinions on what is going on \n     with the energy situation.\n       We moved to Idaho Falls from Utah four years ago because my \n     husband was able to get a job, with his Bachelors degree, \n     that paid more per year than I was making with a Masters \n     degree teaching. The cost of living was lower than Utah, and \n     we absolutely love the area. We bought our home, as a \n     foreclosure, three years ago about six miles outside of Idaho \n     Falls, in Iona. It was cheaper to buy a foreclosure than it \n     was to rent an apartment.\n       We are not extravagant by any means. We try to conserve \n     energy. We are fixing our home as fast and as cost-effective \n     as we can, which has not been too fast. About a year ago, \n     because all of our bills were going up and our paycheck was \n     not, we made the decision that it was better to forego \n     medical insurance for the family and put money away into a \n     health savings account (HSA). Our reasoning is that we have \n     to live day-to-day\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\n     paying our bills, and it is an off-chance that we use our \n     insurance. We have definitely paid more for premiums in the \n     last two years than we have used since we married six years \n     ago, besides the fact that the premiums were once again going \n     up to a level that we could not afford them anyway. It was \n     wonderful! We were able to start paying down debt (which we \n     really do not have a lot of outside our house and student \n     loans). We drive older vehicles that are paid off.\n       Since then, our bills have about doubled. We put a wood \n     stove in our home two years ago because of the high increase \n     in natural gas and, although that has saved us a lot of \n     money, the price increase is still staggering. Our power bill \n     has almost doubled also, although we use our furnace/AC about \n     half as much as we used to, put in the compact fluorescent \n     bulbs and put in a clothesline.\n       My husband works as a PSR worker and has anywhere from 6-10 \n     clients a week, and is pretty much mandated by Medicaid to \n     spend three or less hours with each client. The only problem \n     is that his clients live anywhere from Menan to Ammon. His \n     work reimburses him $3/hour/client (billable hour--meaning he \n     has to be with his client to bill) to pay for gas, phone and \n     wear and tear on our vehicle. He puts about 200 miles on the \n     ``work car'' each week. He is already gone about 55 hours a \n     week, in which he is only paid 40-43 because he is not paid \n     for drive time. Lately [he has been] working overtime which \n     allows us to pay our bills and pay a little extra each month. \n     But his bosses have been getting tough on allowing overtime \n     (which is a catch-22 since they will not guarantee him 40 \n     hours a week--if he has a client cancel on him, tough luck). \n     We have considered him getting another job, but he really \n     does not have any time to fit in another job, and he is \n     scared of leaving his current job because our family depends \n     on him for support and he does not want to go from bad to \n     worse.\n       Since the price of energy has gone up, we have cut our \n     expenses as much as we can. We did not drive much before but \n     other than my husband working, we go to church on Sunday and \n     go into town, as a family, to do shopping and other errands \n     about once a month. We have also had to cut our grocery list \n     because of the price of food. It is not just gas, electricity \n     and natural gas that have gone up, our water, sewer and now \n     property taxes have gone up too, where is this going to end?\n       We look at our budget now and wonder what else we can cut \n     when (and we have no illusions that anything is going down \n     anytime soon) energy costs go up anymore. We can cut our \n     internet, landline and our entertainment budgets which will \n     save us $60 a month--a tank of gas right now. But other than \n     that we are stretched pretty thin, and we are not paying \n     anything into a HSA because there is nothing left.\n       I do not have all the answers, but I know that it is a \n     failed policy on the part of our government that is making \n     things more difficult than it needs to be. When our country \n     is allowing a minority group of people (environmentalists) \n     create our energy policies the majority of the people are \n     going to suffer. I know that we have a need to protect our \n     environment, but there are new technologies there that we are \n     not allowed to pursue either. I am frustrated beyond words. \n     Our government is trying to help everyone in a crisis, but is \n     creating a greater crisis with regulations. I could have had \n     the same policy as the government and not gotten a degree \n     because it would not have immediate effects. I could \n     completely neglect my children because the things I teach \n     them now will not have an immediate effect. I could extend \n     the analogy to a lot of things. We need to start working \n     on new energy policies that may not take effect until \n     later, but will help later. Let us stop procrastinating \n     and do.\n     Carolyn.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a small business building contractor, our fuel prices \n     have gone out of sight, let alone building materials, which \n     our increases can hardly cover. The only thing that does not \n     go up is wages. We have to subsidize our workers' fuel just \n     to get them to work. It cannot go on this way for much \n     longer.\n     J.K.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like you and countless others, I believe that many of the \n     serious lifestyle challenges we face are energy-related. It \n     is obvious to any thinking Idahoan and hopefully most \n     Americans, that our physical security as a nation is gravely \n     undermined because of our dependence on foreign, particularly \n     Mid-East oil. Unfortunately I do not believe most people \n     understand the severe erosion and peril to our economic \n     security this dependence has placed us in. Our founding \n     fathers warned us against becoming entangled in foreign \n     affairs. I am not ignorant to how the world has become \n     smaller, but for us to be dependent on something so critical \n     as energy independence is to me unconscionable. I believe the \n     Founders roll in their graves when they look down on us and \n     see how we have trampled on the sovereignty they bequeathed \n     to us. I am hopeful that your effort includes work to help us \n     restore the freedoms and independence that has made America \n     such a remarkable phenomenon on the stage of world history. I \n     fear that we as a people and our representatives have \n     forgotten our roots the principles we were founded upon. We \n     are being carefully led down a slippery slope away from a \n     heritage enshrining freedom by federal and world nannies who \n     ``know better'', patting us on the head along the way. My \n     concern is that in the struggle to get anything \n     ``accomplished'' in Washington, principles are sometimes \n     sacrificed for the sake of expediency. Compromising principle \n     for short-term gains, in my view, is not the noble and \n     magnanimous deed that most ascribe them to be. Would that we \n     defend principles in the Churchillian fashion of ``We will \n     never surrender!''.\n       I know you wish this to be brief and so after that rather \n     lengthy philosophic opener, I will now focus on some \n     specifics. These specifics are predicated that we as \n     Americans act as independent Americans, not vassals to world \n     opinion and the Benedicts amongst us.\n       New Domestic Oil Reserves: I believe we are smart and \n     responsible enough to aggressively pursue new petroleum \n     sources domestically, including offshore sources, while being \n     good stewards of our environment. No intelligent human wants \n     to soil where he lives. Environmentalists were right with \n     their concerns in the past. We did stupid things while \n     chasing the dollar, ignoring the big picture impact of our \n     actions. However, today's environmental wackos have swung the \n     pendulum out of proportion. To remain a prosperous and free \n     nation, we must have energy independence. This is not an \n     option and we must move very quickly to achieve it. While \n     doing this we must find a way to foster a climate of \n     competition with existing interests rather than merely \n     providing them more tools to control this vital segment of \n     our economy.\n       A Call for a Congressional Investigation: The greatest \n     export our country has given to the world is freedom \n     resulting from our remarkable experiment in self-governance. \n     The miracle of our country's success is based upon collective \n     and individual freedom. We have wise laws prohibiting the \n     undermining of competition. I believe that over time, the oil \n     industries have systematically squelched competition and any \n     technology that has had any possible chance of adversely \n     affecting their sacred cash cows. I would like to see a \n     congressional investigation into how the oil industry has \n     been involved in these things over the last 50 years. There \n     is way too much anecdotal evidence of new conservation \n     technologies being snuffed out, new forms of energy being \n     squashed, and collusion amongst oil companies and nations to \n     just simply ignore as the rantings of those engaged in fringe \n     conspiracy theories. Something just does not smell right and \n     I would feel a whole lot better if there was an honest effort \n     to focus the light of day on these issues to see if there \n     will be any cockroaches scurrying for cover.\n       Nuclear Energy: I know you are aware of all of the \n     arguments for this and I will not belabor the points here. I \n     am in favor of getting the government off of our backs and \n     out of our faces so we can speed up the process of harnessing \n     the power of the atom. New research should also be \n     aggressively pursued, including fusion research for the long \n     term. Current nuclear regulations and bureaucracy have \n     strangled us and created the mess we are in today. It would \n     be an interesting exercise to pull the string on who has \n     benefited from all the obstacles that have been placed in the \n     path of the nuclear industry. While encouraging nuclear \n     energy, care must be taken so that this new form of energy \n     provides competition to those who already have one hand at \n     our throats and the other in our back pockets.\n       Alternative Forms of Energy: Research should be supported \n     exploring hydrogen, wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, etc. I \n     believe this to be a national security issue and justifies \n     the involvement of the federal government to achieve it. \n     Although these will not solve our problems immediately, we \n     should be doggedly engaged in reducing our dependence on oil \n     from multiple fronts with lasting solutions.\n       Conservation: While I do not believe conservation \n     adequately addresses the solution to our problems, I believe \n     it plays a part. Conservation efforts need to be encouraged \n     as long as they do not impinge upon the free market or \n     individual constitutional freedoms. The question needs to be \n     asked and then answered, ``Who has a vested interest in \n     keeping things as they are by undermining conservation \n     efforts?'' Then there are follow-up questions. Do they have \n     the means to impose their wills? If the answer is yes, how \n     and where have they done so? These same questions can also be \n     applied to our lack of progress in moving toward alternate \n     non-petroleum energy sources, including nuclear.\n       Political: I believe there are very powerful forces at play \n     benefitting those who currently have money, influence, and \n     power, maintaining and advancing their interests. I believe \n     this to be the root problem of our energy situation. Unless \n     this is addressed, I do not believe we will accomplish any \n     lasting cure. We may win a minor skirmish here and there and \n     deflect or delay the end result, but unless we attack the \n     heart of the problem, in my opinion, we will lose the battle. \n     The battle is over freedom. It is an ancient battle that has \n     been waged from before the foundations of the earth. You are \n     in a unique position to make a difference and what little \n     ability and support I can give to you in that struggle is \n     yours to draw from. I do not envy you if you choose to engage \n     this problem head on but I hope that you recognize the truth \n     in what I am saying. Much is at stake. You would risk much in \n     attempting to tackle it. My prayers are with you.\n       Thanks for listening and soliciting input on this issue. I \n     wish you good luck and\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\n     pledge you my support in this Herculean effort if you so \n     choose to fully engage yourself in it.\n     Keith, Rigby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4569-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETER FITHIAN\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

His tremendous commitment to the people \nof Hawaii has led to the establishment of the internationally renowned \nBillfish Tournament, which truly put Hawaii on the map of sport \nfishing, drawing both spectators and competitors from all over the \nworld. I commend him for his tireless efforts in building a \nlongstanding tradition while promoting tourism and marine conservation \nin our island community. Through Peter's unwavering passion in \ncultivating Hawaii's proud heritage of recreational fishing, he has \nfounded not only an event that encourages warm fellowship, but has \ncreated an educational opportunity that deserves our highest praise.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the \ngreat service and accomplishments of Mr. Peter Fithian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4569-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BOSTON AREA RAPE CRISIS CENTER\n\n Mr. KERRY.

I am proud to say that as part of this commemoration \nAttorney General Eric Holder will be honoring the Boston Area Rape \nCrisis Center, BARCC. I would like to add my congratulations and \nsincerest thanks for the important work that is done at BARCC.\n  BARCC has been helping victims of rape and sexual assault in Boston \nsince 1973, making it one of the first such centers of its kind. Highly \ntrained counselors and advocates team with volunteers from the area to \ncreate a nurturing, and supportive, environment for these victims. \nThrough their hard work and selfless dedication, they serve over 4,000 \nvictims a year providing critical services to the people of Boston. \nAdditionally, they participate in statewide and national training in \nbest practices and education sharing their knowledge and experiences. \nBARCC is also committed to preventing future victims by doing outreach \nin the community on sexual assault awareness, particularly on the many \ncollege and university campuses in Boston. Their comprehensive \nexpertise in violence prevention, victims' rights, and victims support \nis what makes BARCC such an exceptional facility.\n  I join Attorney General Holder, the people of Boston, and Janet \nYassen, director of the Victims of Violence Program, Cambridge Health \nAlliance, who nominated BARCC for this honor, in expressing our \ngratitude to the staff and volunteers at BARCC for the incredible \nservice they provide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4569-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 98 \nWorld War II veterans from all over Louisiana who will travel to \nWashington, DC, on April 25 to visit the various memorials and \nmonuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable \nservice members.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, sponsored this \ntrip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is honoring each \nsurviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them an opportunity \nto see the memorials dedicated to their service. The veterans visited \nthe World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iwo Jima memorials. They also \ntraveled to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath on the Tomb of \nthe Unknowns.\n  This is the second of four flights Louisiana HonorAir is making to \nWashington, DC, this spring. It is the 15th flight to depart from \nLouisiana, which has sent more HonorAir flights than any other State to \nthe Nation's Capital.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American service members were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today more than 33,000 living WWII \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory \nof freedom over tyranny. This group had 31 veterans who served in the \nU.S. Army, 23 in the U.S. Air Force, 35 in the Navy, 1 in the WAVES--\nWomen Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service--7 in the Marines, and 1 \nin the Merchant Marines.\n  Our heroes trekked the world for their country. Their journeys \nspanned Europe, the Utah and Omaha Beaches, France, the Rhineland, \nCentral Europe, Holland, Italy and North Africa. They fought in the \nPacific as well--at Russell Island, Gilbert Island, the Philippines, \nTarawa, Luzon, New Guinea, Tinian, Guam, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, \nGuadalcanal, New Hebrides, Saipan and Bougainville. Their fight for \nfreedom extended to Alaska, Azores, Iceland, and the Aleutian Islands.\n  One of our Army Air Corps veterans received the Croix de Guerre Avec \nPalm and the Bronze Service Star for campaigns in Northern France, \nCentral Europe, and the Rhineland. He also fought at Utah Beach on D-\nday. Another of our Army Air Corps veterans fought in the Mediterranean \nTheater and completed 50 missions as a ball turret gunner.\n  One of our marines received the South Pacific Purple Heart, and an \nArmy veteran fought at Omaha Beach with GEN George Patton. Yet another \nArmy veteran was on GEN Douglas McArthur's staff.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 98 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, who will visit Washington, and Louisiana HonorAir for \nmaking these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4569-4", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4569-S4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL ELDER GRANGER, M.D.\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \noutstanding service that MG Elder Granger has given to Arkansas and our \ngreat Nation through his work in the military medical services.\n  Since 2005, MG Elder Granger, M.D., has served his country as the \ndeputy director of the TRICARE Management Activity in the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. Prior to joining \nTRICARE, Major General Granger led the largest U.S. and multinational \nbattlefield health system in our Nation's recent history as Commander \nof the Task Force 44th Medical Command and Command Surgeon for the \nMultinational Corps in Iraq.\n  Major General Granger also brilliantly implemented TRICARE's $22.5 \nbillion Defense Health Program that benefitted over 9.2 million people \nworldwide. With his compassion and dedication, Major General Granger \nimproved patient care for the entire military health system by managing \nthe TRICARE benefits for an international network of 75 military \nhospitals, 461 service clinics, and a network of civilian providers and \nhospitals. An enthusiastic advocate for the military health system, \nMajor General Granger directed the launch of a TRICARE Web portal which \nimproved communications between beneficiaries and enhanced health \nbenefits information services. This technology is projected to reach 23 \nmillion individuals by 2009.\n  Through the TRICARE's mail order pharmacy program, Major General \nGranger increased the number of users utilizing mail-order pharmacy \nprescriptions by 16 percent, as well as increasing total prescription \nvolume by\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\n21 percent. In addition, he established a Web/call-in center which \nhandled 21,412 beneficiary requests for 47,213 prescription conversions \nas of November 2008, which amounts to an estimated cost avoidance of \n$3.2 million to date. Major General Granger also oversaw the \nestablishment of the voluntary agreement for retail rebates, which has \nresulted in a pharmaceutical industry rebate of $28 million since the \nbeginning of 2007. Further, he established electronic claims processing \nwhich has already saved $1.6 million in administrative fees in addition \nto $105 million in overhead savings.\n  A native of West Memphis, AR, MG Elder Granger has played an active \nrole in veterans' medical services since the beginning of his career. \nHe represents the great progress that has and will continue to occur \nwithin the military health system. He is a mentor to his staff, a \nleader in his field, and a soldier ready for any mission.\n  I am honored to recognize his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4570-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO HAROLD ``BUDDY'' BROWN\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today the people of Interior \nAlaska--our Native people and the entire Fairbanks community--mourn the \nloss of one of the most promising Native leaders of this generation.\n  Harold ``Buddy'' Brown died yesterday of cancer at the age of 39. \nBuddy is survived by his wife Patti and two children, Xavier, age 7, \nand Alana, age 3.\n  Throughout Indian Country we are witnessing the generational shift in \nleadership to young people who have mastered the challenge of living in \ntwo worlds. They have completed college, gone on to obtain graduate and \nprofessional degrees, and returned to serve their people. One foot in \nthe traditional world of their Native communities, the other in the \nmodern worlds of business, finance, management and law.\n  Within the Alaska Native community, Buddy Brown stood at the vanguard \nof this generational shift. After graduating from the University of New \nMexico Law School in 1997, he immediately went to work for the Tanana \nChiefs Conference, the consortium of 42 tribes in Interior Alaska. He \nwas hired on as associate counsel.\n  Five years later, Buddy was elected President of the Tanana Chiefs \nConference. In this role he led a region which encompasses about \n235,000 square miles, an area equal to about 37 percent of the State of \nAlaska and just slightly smaller than the state of Texas. In 2006, \nBuddy retired from this position to heal and to spend time with his \nfamily.\n  The Tanana Chiefs region is known throughout the State of Alaska for \nproducing leaders of statewide and national repute--Bridge builders who \nhave a particular talent for engaging the broader community to support \nthe causes and concerns of our Native people.\n  The late Morris Thompson, who tragically died in the 2000 crash of \nAlaska Airlines Flight 261, is the best known Native leader to come \nfrom this region, beloved throughout the State for his talent in \nbuilding bridges.\n  Morris Thompson was Buddy Brown's mentor and friend, and I am told \nthat he expected Buddy Brown would grow to become a leader whose \naccomplishments would exceed Morris's own. Buddy was widely regarded in \nAlaska as the best and brightest of this new generation. He reached \ngreat heights in a few short years, but I am saddened that Alaska will \nnever realize the true potential of this truly extraordinary \nindividual.\n  There is little I can say to console our grieving community today but \nI do have a few words for Xavier and Alana and the Native youth of \nInterior Alaska. Buddy Brown appreciated that youth is no impediment to \nleadership, that the energy and new ideas of the youth are desperately \nneeded to keep our Native institutions thriving. Buddy devoted his life \nto preparing to undertake this leadership role.\n  Take inspiration from Buddy's life and become the leader that each of \nyou has the potential to be. I want to help you to achieve this goal \nfor yourself, for your people, and for all of Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4570-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4570-S4571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MORRIS O'QUIN\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I honor the life and work of \nMorris O'Quin of Harrison, AR. Morris passed away unexpectedly on April \n19, 2009, due to a sudden respiratory illness. I know the thoughts of \nmany Arkansans and others around the country are with the O'Quin \nfamily, especially his wife of 21 years, Dana, and their children, \nMarrick and Morgan.\n  Morris devoted his life to public service and Arkansas agriculture. \nHe most recently served as a Farm Service Agency--FSA--county director \nin Boone County, AR. In this capacity, he also served as a national \nboard member for the National Association of Farm Service Agency State \nand County Office Employees--NASCOE--where he advocated on behalf of \nother employees and volunteers who served similar roles as public \nservants in the agricultural sector in Arkansas and throughout the \ncountry. He has been a lifelong advocate for agriculture.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 2003, I have had the benefit of getting \nto know Morris well during his frequent trips to Washington to meet \nwith other leaders of the Farm Service Agency, advancing the mission \nand purpose of the Agency. He was an ambassador for the State of \nArkansas and a tireless advocate for the FSA, its mission, and its \nemployees. He understood Arkansas agriculture and the importance of the \nAgency in supporting continued production of agricultural products. His \nduty to the Farm Service Agency and the promotion of its mission were \nhis passions.\n  I vividly remember working closely with Morris in 2005 to ensure that \nthe Department of Agriculture did not irresponsibly move to reduce the \nessential services that the Farm Service Agency provides to farmers and \nranchers through the county office structure. He explained to me that \nthe county offices provide essential services to the farmer through \nface-to-face interactions and that shutting down multiple county \noffices without making needed technology upgrades and providing \ntechnical assistance for this transition would cause significant harm \nto our nation's farmers and ranchers.\n  His advocacy for FSA workers and the farm community in Arkansas along \nwith his leadership within NASCOE helped me pass a critical amendment \nto 2006 Agriculture appropriations bill to prevent FSA county office \nclosures and further consolidations. This amendment prevented the \nadministration from closing over 700 county offices nationwide and \nensured that the critical services provided by these offices would \ncontinue until the USDA developed technology upgrades needed to make \nsuch a transition, and until the USDA clearly explained the needs and \nbenefits for making such drastic reforms. This was a tremendous \naccomplishment that would not have been possible without Morris's focus \nand leadership.\n  Morris understood that without the hard work and sacrifice of local \nFSA employees, many family farms would not have the resources necessary \nto make a living and provide America a safe and affordable food supply \nthat we all too often take for granted. This understanding was behind \nhis drive to convince me and other lawmakers of the importance of \nstopping the USDA initiative to diminish the role of FSA offices and \nemployees.\n  Morris's most recent accomplishment revealed his care for the \ncommunity. After the devastating Arkansas ice storms that hit in \nJanuary of this year, Morris spent hours working to deliver essential \nFSA services to neighbors, farmers, and ranchers in Boone County and \nother parts of northern Arkansas. The 2009 ice storm caused extreme \ndamage to northern Arkansas, and Morris stepped up to provide much \nneeded assistance. Under much pressure, he was doing a tremendous job \nof providing Environmental Conservation Program funds to help get \nimpacted farmers back on their feet and producing again. This is just \none other example of his exemplary work in his capacity as a public \nservant.\n  While I will remember Morris for his work as a county director and a \nNASCOE advocate, I will remember him most for his kind and calm \ndemeanor, his concern for the well-being of those around him, his \ntireless work on behalf of those who depended on him, and his character \nand integrity in all of his endeavors. He was a relatively quiet \nperson, not a personality\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nthat you get a lot of in Washington, but he was filled with pride for \nhis work, the work of FSA employees, and American agriculture. He would \nalways articulate the importance of these to me in the most clear, \nconcise, and endearing terms. Meeting with him was always a pleasure as \nhe carried a calmness about him that always reminded me of the best of \nArkansas. Much like many Arkansans I know, he possessed a kind heart \nand a gentle spirit always putting others before him. He earned my \nenduring respect and admiration. I will remember him for his optimistic \nspirit, enjoyable personality, and humble and effective leadership.\n  It is with great sadness, that I come before the Senate today, but I \nknow he has gone to a better place, and deservedly so. I am honored to \nhave known him and worked with him during his time on Earth. I send his \nwife Dana and their two children my deepest condolences. Morris O'Quin \nwill certainly be missed, but he will never be forgotten. I ask my \ncolleagues to keep the O'Quin family, Morris's coworkers, and his \nfriends in your thoughts and prayers in this most difficult \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4571-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VERMONT CELEBRATES ITS LEADERS IN LABOR RIGHTS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to rise today to honor two \nVermont businesses, Chroma Technology Corporation and Seventh \nGeneration, which have been named to the 2009 List of Most Democratic \nWorkplaces. This list, compiled by the labor rights organization \nWorldBlu, selects the gold standard in fair labor practices each year.\n  By creating incentives for workers to constructively participate in \nthe governance of their company, Chroma Technology Corporation of \nRockingham, VT, exemplifies the ideal of the Most Democratic Workplace. \nWith a decentralized power structure, and with every worker eligible to \nbecome a member of the board of directors, employees genuinely play a \nmajor role in business decisions and company practices. Moreover, \nChroma is 100 percent employee owned, and sets a limit on executive \ncompensation, a limit determined by a ratio of the pay scale for the \nlowest-paid workers in the firm. Chroma has also developed an \ninnovative profit-sharing system for all its employees.\n  The other Vermont business to receive this prestigious award, Seventh \nGeneration, is a producer of cleaning and home care products in \nBurlington, VT. This impressive firm truly challenges its employees to \nnot only participate in all aspects of the company's operations, but \nalso to take the company's mission of positive change and apply it to \nthe outside world. Employees can apply for committee-approved paid \nsabbaticals in order to participate in philanthropic endeavors. To \nfoster companywide professional development, Seventh Generation \ncombines teambuilding with cross-functional communication so employees \ngain perspective on the company's big picture operations and goals. \nThrough these professional opportunities and many other policies, \nemployees work outside of the box and come to share the mission of the \ncompany.\n  Perhaps not all companies can adopt every strategy of these two \nindustry leaders, but we should recognize the value of their business \nmodels. Both Chroma and Seventh Generation go above and beyond the duty \nof an employer, and our entire economy benefits from the investment \nthey make in training the best employees possible. I urge every \nAmerican company--indeed every lawmaker in Congress--to consider the \nlessons we can take from these Most Democratic Workplaces. Improving \njob training and developing human resources is important, especially in \nour current challenging economy; at the same time, investment in \nworkers creates a lasting benefit that lays the foundation for a strong \nfuture.\n  Treating workers with dignity and respect, enabling them to not only \ndevelop their capacities, but participate in decisionmaking, is \nessential to creating democratic and productive workplaces.\n  Mr. President, I commend Chroma Technology and Seventh Generation for \na job very well done and to congratulate them on their selection as a \n2009 Most Democratic Workplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4571-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING MICRO TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in our present economic situation, \nsmall businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain \ntheir current operations, let alone expand their facilities, add new \nemployees, or make significant improvements. Despite that, some firms \nare attempting to move forward on planned expansions, hoping to see a \ngreater return on their investment in the future. I rise today to \nrecognize Micro Technologies, a small company in my home State of Maine \nthat is pushing ahead to expand its business and bring new jobs to \nMidcoast Maine.\n  Founded in 1996, Micro Technologies, located in the rural town of \nRichmond, serves a very specialized niche in the world of science. \nFocusing on aquatic animal health, Micro Technologies provides critical \nresearch and testing, diagnostics, and veterinary services related to \nthe health of various aquatic marine species to a wide range of \nclients, from government agencies to small farms. The company presently \nhas 13 employees, most of whom are graduates of Maine universities and \ncolleges. Approved by Department of Agriculture, USDA, for export \ntesting, Micro Technologies works with companies across the United \nStates, Central and South America, as well as Europe.\n  The company's innovative research aids scientists in their quest to \nexplain and solve a plethora of complicated health problems of aquatic \nanimals, from common finfish like salmon and cod, to bivalves such as \noysters and clams, to crustaceans like the Maine lobster. For instance, \nMicro Technologies' work has centered on studying viruses that affect \nshrimp and the causes of shell disease among lobsters. Additionally, \nthe company tests various species for the presence of harmful viruses, \nensuring that firms involved in the shipment of these species have the \nsafest product possible. This, in turn, promotes expedient shipping, \nand reduces negative environmental impacts.\n  While the current economic insecurity poses problems to businesses \nlarge and small, Micro Technologies is moving forward on a plan to \nexpand its facilities, add employees, and broaden the scope of its \nwork. The company recently received a $200,000 grant from the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program, which is aimed at helping communities \nacross the country build affordable housing and retain businesses \nseeking to grow. Richmond's full board of selectmen unanimously \nendorsed the company's proposal before submitting the application to \nthe Maine Department of Economic and Community Development, which \napproved the grant. Partnering with the town of Richmond, Micro \nTechnologies will use this grant to make renovations to its existing \nfacility, purchase a nearby building, add seven quality new positions, \nand expand its manufacturing capabilities. Micro Technologies also \nhopes to begin an apprenticeship program to introduce students \ninterested in science to the unique work the company does.\n  American entrepreneurs have strengthened our country and its economy \nin good times and bad. As Micro Technologies seeks to grow, it will \nprovide a positive impact on the local community as well as the aquatic \nanimal health industry, which is crucial in Maine. I wish everyone at \nMicro Technologies best wishes and much success in their planned \nexpansion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4571-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4571-S4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 39.

A resolution adopted by the legislature of the \n     Province of Batangas, Republic of the Philippines, forwarded \n     by the Acting Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Legislative \n     Affairs, Department of State, commending and expressing \n     thanksgiving and commendation to the President of the United \n     States, the U.S. Congress, and the American taxpayers for the \n     signing of the U.S. Economic Stimulus Package, which includes \n     $198 million in benefits to Filipino veterans who fought \n     side-by-side with American soldiers in World War II; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                           Resolution No. 169\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Economic Stimulus Package, recently \n     signed into law by President Barack Obama includes some $198 \n     Million in benefits to Filipino Veterans who fought with \n     American soldiers of World War II;\n       Whereas, as provided, a one-time payment of $15,000 for \n     each Filipino Veteran who had since become a U.S. citizen and \n     $9,000 for non-citizens will be made to former soldiers or \n     their surviving spouses;\n       Whereas, historically, it is a fact that Filipino Veterans \n     of World War II had been conscripted and fought side-by-side \n     with their American comrades in the Pacific Theater, more \n     specifically in the battle front of Bataan and Corregidor. \n     Quoting Senator Daniel Inouye of the American Senate: ``In \n     1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued a military \n     order calling on the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines to \n     serve with the U.S. Army in the Far East, entitling Filipino \n     soldiers who served full U.S. Veterans benefits because of \n     their service'';\n       Whereas, the best feature of the provision is its \n     unequivocal recognition of the role played by Filipino \n     Veterans during the World War II. The implication is that it \n     is important enough to stand alongside solutions to \n     Americans' present day economic slump. This rectifies \n     previous ``snubs''--laws reneging on promises made to these \n     soldiers as part of the U.S.' post war cost-saving measures, \n     like the U.S. Recession Act of 1946, duly signed by then \n     President Harry S.

the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KAUFMAN (for himself, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 853. A bill to designate additional segments and tributaries of \nWhite Clay Creek, in the States of Delaware and Pennsylvania, as a \ncomponent of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am joined by Senator Carper and Senator \nCasey in introducing a bill that would expand the designation of the \nWhite Clay Creek National Wild and Scenic River in Delaware and \nPennsylvania to include two new sites: Lamborn Run in Delaware and the \nEast Branch and Egypt Run in New Garden Township in Pennsylvania.\n  In 2000, the White Clay Creek watershed was designated Delaware's \nfirst and only National Wild and Scenic River. The watershed is home to \na wide variety of plant and animal life, archeological sites dating \nback to prehistoric times, and a bi-State preserve and State park. It \nis also a source of drinking water for the region.\n  A National Park Service study released in 1994 details the \nwatershed's diversity of natural, historic, cultural, and recreational \nresources, and its results led the way for its original designation.\n  The watershed covers approximately 107 square miles and drains over \n69,000 acres in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Of those 69,000 acres, 5,000 \nacres are public lands owned by State and local governments and the \nrest is privately owned and maintained. There are no Federal lands \nwithin the watershed and no Federal dollars were used to purchase any \nof the land within its boundaries.\n  The watershed is centrally located between the densely urbanized \nregions of New York and Washington, DC. The legislation being \nintroduced today will expand the designation by incorporating an \nadditional 9 miles to White Clay's National Wild and Scenic River, \nbringing the total federally recognized miles within the watershed to \n199.9 miles.\n  National Wild and Scenic designation brings recognition to the unique \ncultural, natural, scenic, and recreational values of the White Clay \nCreek watershed. It provides an added level of protection from \noverdevelopment, and it elevates the value of the watershed when \napplying for State, local, and Federal grants. Projects located within \nthe White Clay Creek watershed have received almost $4 million in \nFederal funding since being designated in 2000.\n  While there are over 160 National wild and scenic rivers, the White \nClay Creek can claim a few distinctions. First, it is Delaware's first \nand only wild and scenic river. It is one of only 12 rivers nationwide \nthat is classified as a partnership river. That is a river that is \nmanaged on the local level with support from homeowners and communities \nand with the limited assistance of government on the local, State, and \nFederal level. It was the first to be studied and designated on a \nwatershed basis, and it is the only wild and scenic\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\nriver that runs through a college or university.\n  Thirty years ago, I was privileged to be a part of the effort that \neventually designated White Clay Creek as Delaware's first and only \nwild and scenic river. Today, I am proud to introduce legislation that \nwill further expand and preserve this unique region.\n  I wish to thank everyone who has worked so hard and for so long to \ncelebrate and preserve its natural beauty, so that 30 years from now \nour children and grandchildren can enjoy the same pristine landscape we \nappreciate today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``White Clay Creek Wild and \n     Scenic River Expansion Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the White Clay Creek watershed is 1 of only a few \n     relatively intact and unspoiled functioning river systems \n     remaining in the highly congested and developed corridor \n     between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Newark, Delaware;\n       (2) Public Law 102-215 (16 U.S.C. 1271 note; 105 Stat. \n     1664) directed the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation \n     and consultation with appropriate State and local governments \n     and affected landowners, to conduct a study of the \n     eligibility and suitability of White Clay Creek, in the \n     States of Delaware and Pennsylvania, and the tributaries of \n     the creek for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic \n     Rivers System;\n       (3) as a part of the study described in paragraph (2), all \n     segments listed in the amendments made by section 3 were \n     found eligible for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic \n     Rivers System;\n       (4) local communities and governments along the proposed \n     river segments have passed resolutions in support of the \n     designation of the segments listed in the amendments made by \n     section 3 as components of the National Wild and Scenic \n     Rivers System; and\n       (5) Public Law 106-357 (16 U.S.C. 1271 note; 114 Stat. \n     1393) designated 190 miles of river segments of White Clay \n     Creek (including tributaries of White Clay Creek and all \n     second order tributaries of the designated segments) in the \n     States of Delaware and Pennsylvania, to be administered by \n     the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF SEGMENTS OF WHITE CLAY CREEK, AS \n                   SCENIC AND RECREATIONAL RIVERS.\n\n       Section 3(a)(163) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 \n     U.S. C. 1274(a)(163)) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A)--\n       (A) by striking ``190 miles'' and inserting ``199 miles''; \n     and\n       (B) by striking ``(dated June 2000)'' and inserting \n     ``(dated February 2009)'';\n       (2) by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(B) 22.4 miles of the east branch beginning at the \n     southern boundary line of the Borough of Avondale, including \n     Walnut Run, Broad Run, and Egypt Run, outside the boundaries \n     of the White Clay Creek Preserve, as a recreational river.''; \n     and\n       (3) by striking subparagraph (H) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(H) 14.3 miles of the main stem, including Lamborn Run, \n     that flow through the boundaries of the White Clay Creek \n     Preserve, Pennsylvania and Delaware, and White Clay Creek \n     State Park, Delaware beginning at the confluence of the east \n     and middle branches in London Britain Township, Pennsylvania, \n     downstream to the northern boundary line of the City of \n     Newark, Delaware, as a scenic river.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to establish an Energy Assistance Fund to guarantee \nlow-interest loans for the purchase and installation of qualifying \nenergy efficient property, idling reduction and advanced insulation for \nheavy trucks, and alternative refueling stations, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Energy Assistance \nFund Act of 2009, legislation which will assist people who want to \ninvest in energy conservation and alternative energy technologies and \nhelp set us on a path toward energy independence.\n  As I visit communities around the State of Maine, I hear time and \nagain that the costs of energy create hardship for many of our \ncitizens. Unpredictable, and often increasing, prices for home heating \noil, gasoline and diesel fuel are a huge burden for many families, \ntruckers, and small businesses.\n  I am concerned that in a difficult economy, investments in energy \nconservation and alternative energy improvements are simply too costly \nfor many American families and small businesses. For example, under the \npresent code, taxpayers who install energy efficient windows and \nskylights or solar water heating systems receive a 30 percent tax \ncredit. In both instances, the investment which must be made by the \ntaxpayer far exceeds the credit amount. In the current economic \nclimate, most families and small businesses are already scrimping and \nsaving to make ends meet, and they do not have the money to finance the \ngap between the tax credit we provide and the cost of the investment.\n  The legislation I am introducing today calls for additional loan \nauthority to support current Federal programs that help families and \nsmall businesses finance energy efficiency improvements. The loan \nauthority I am proposing would expand existing Federal programs that \nmake low-interest loans to individuals and small businesses for energy \nefficiency improvements. This new loan authority would be made \navailable through a new energy assistance revolving loan fund within \nthe Treasury Department. Individuals who make less than 115 percent of \nthe national average median income would be able to apply for low-\ninterest loans to cover the difference between the tax credits \navailable for energy efficiency improvements and up to 90 percent of \nthe cost of those improvements. The Federal agencies can make these \nloans through their lender networks.\n  USDA, HUD, and other Federal agencies already have programs that can \nmake loans of this kind to individuals. Small businesses can seek low-\ninterest loans for energy efficiency improvements under existing loan \nprograms such as the SBA's 7(a) program. The revolving loan fund called \nfor by my bill will enable these agencies to offer more loans to the \nindividuals and small businesses we have asked them to serve.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together in a bipartisan way so that we \ncan help Americans overcome the challenge of our dependence on foreign \noil and restore and strengthen our Nation's economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 856. A bill to establish a commercial truck highway safety \ndemonstration program in the State of Maine, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to join with my senior colleague \nfrom Maine in sponsoring the Commercial Truck Highway Safety \nDemonstration Program Act, an important bill that addresses a \nsignificant safety problem in our State.\n  Under current law, trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are allowed to \ntravel on the portion of Interstate 95 designated as the Maine \nTurnpike, which runs from Maine's border with New Hampshire to Augusta, \nour capital city. At Augusta, the Turnpike designation ends, but 1-95 \nproceeds another 200 miles north to Houlton. At Augusta, however, heavy \ntrucks must exit the modern four-lane, limited-access highway and are \nforced onto smaller, two-lane secondary roads that pass through cities, \ntowns, and villages.\n  Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are permitted on interstate \nhighways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well as the \nCanadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight limit \ndisparity on various segments of Maine's Interstate Highway System is a \nsignificant impediment to commerce, increases wear-and-tear on our \nsecondary roads, and, most important, puts our people needlessly at \nrisk.\n  Senator Snowe and I have introduced this legislation several times in \nrecent years. We remain concerned about the safety of our citizens who \nare needlessly put at risk when heavy trucks are forced off the main \ninterstate and onto secondary roads through our\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\ntowns and communities. Unfortunately, Maine has experienced two tragic \ndeaths in the past few years due to accidents involving heavy trucks in \nthis situation.\n  One of these tragic accidents took the life of Susan Abraham, a \nbright and talented 17-year-old high-school student from Hampden, \nMaine, when her car was struck by a heavy truck on Route 9. The truck \ndriver could not see Susan's small car turning onto that two-lane road \nas he rounded a corner. It was an accident, but one that would have \nbeen avoided had the truck remained on the Interstate highway. \nInterstate 95 runs less than three-quarters of a mile away, but Federal \nlaw prevented the truck from using that modern, divided highway, a \nhighway that was designed to provide ample views of the road ahead.\n  That preventable tragedy took place almost one year to the day after \nLena Gray, an 80-year-old resident of Bangor, was struck and killed by \na tractor-trailer as she was crossing a downtown street. Again, that \naccident would not have occurred had that truck been allowed to use I-\n95, which runs directly through Bangor.\n  The problem Maine faces due to the disparity in truck weight limits \naffects many communities, but it is clearly evident in the eastern \nMaine cities of Bangor and Brewer. In this region, a two-mile stretch \nof Interstate 395 connects two major State highways that carry \nsignificant truck traffic across Maine. I-395 affords direct and safe \naccess between these major corridors, but because of the existing \nFederal truck weight limit, many heavy trucks are prohibited from using \nthis multi-lane, limited access highway.\n  Instead, these trucks, which sometimes carry hazardous materials, are \nrequired to maneuver through the downtown portions of Bangor and Brewer \non two-lane roadways. Truckers are faced with two options; the first is \na 3.5 mile diversion through downtown Bangor that requires several very \ndifficult and dangerous turns. The second route is a 7.5 mile diversion \nthat includes 20 traffic lights and requires travel through portions of \ndowntown Bangor as well. Congestion is a significant issue, and safety \nis seriously compromised as a result of these required diversions.\n  In June 2004, Wilbur Smiths Associates, a nationally recognized \ntransportation consulting firm, completed a study to examine the impact \na Federal weight exemption on non-exempt portions of Maine's Interstate \nHighway System would have on safety, pavement, and bridges. The study \nfound that extending the current truck weight exemption on the Maine \nTurnpike to all interstate highways in Maine would result in a decrease \nof 3.2 fatal crashes per year. A uniform truck weight limit of 100,000 \npounds on Maine's interstate highways would reduce highway miles, as \nwell as the travel times necessary to transport freight through Maine, \nresulting in safety, economic, and environmental benefits.\n  Moreover, Maine's extensive network of local roads would be better \npreserved without the wear and tear of heavy truck traffic.\n  Most important, however, a uniform truck weight limit will keep \ntrucks on the interstate where they belong, rather than on roads and \nhighways that pass through Maine's cities, towns, and neighborhoods.\n  In addition to the safety of motorists and pedestrians, there is a \nhomeland security aspect to this as well. An accident or attack \ninvolving a heavy truck carrying explosive fuel or a hazardous chemical \non a congested city street would have devastating consequences. That \nrisk can be alleviated substantially by allowing those trucks to stay \non the open highway.\n  The legislation that Senator Snowe and I are introducing addresses \nthe safety issues we face in Maine because of the disparities in truck \nweight limits. The legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation \nto establish a commercial truck safety pilot program in Maine. Under \nthe pilot program, the truck weight limit on all Maine highways that \nare part of the Interstate Highway System would be set at 100,000 \npounds for three years. During the waiver period, the Secretary would \nstudy the impact of the pilot program on safety and would receive the \ninput of a panel on which State officials, and representatives from \nsafety organizations, municipalities, and the commercial trucking \nindustry would serve. The waiver would become permanent if the panel \ndetermined that motorists were safer as a result of a uniform truck \nweight limit on Maine's Interstate Highway System.\n  Maine's citizens and motorists are needlessly at risk because too \nmany heavy trucks are forced off the interstate and onto local roads. \nThe legislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing is a commonsense \napproach to a significant safety problem in my State. Our efforts are \nwidely supported by public officials throughout Maine, including the \nGovernor, the Maine Department of Transportation, the Maine Secretary \nof State, and the Maine State Police. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to once again introduce legislation that seeks \nnot only to rectify an impediment to international commerce flowing \nthrough Maine, but more importantly, will offer a measure of safety and \nsecurity that many of my constituents in Maine do not currently \npossess.\n  As many of our colleagues know, expanding upon the current federal \ntruck weight limitation of 80,000 pounds is often looked upon as too \ndangerous, flaunting the safety of drivers who may be faced with a \ntruck weighing as much as 145,000 pounds. While my record reflects my \nlong commitment to safety on our roadways, I ask my colleagues not to \noverlook the safety of pedestrians as well.\n  Take the situation we face in Maine, where we currently have a \nlimited exemption along the southern portion of the Maine Turnpike. \nMany trucks traveling to or from the Canadian border or into upstate \nMaine are not able to travel on our Interstates as a result of the \n80,000 pound weight limit. This forces many of them onto secondary \nroads, many of which are two-lane roads running through small towns and \nvillages in Maine. Tanker trucks carrying fuel teeter past elementary \nschools, libraries, weaving through traffic to reach locations like our \nAir National Guard station. Not only is it an inefficient method of \nbringing necessary fuel to Guardsmen that provide our national \nsecurity, but imagine if you will one of those tanker trucks rupturing \non Main Street, potentially causing serious damage to property, causing \ntraffic chaos, and most importantly, killing or injuring drivers and \npedestrians.\n  This is not a far-fetched scenario. In fact, two pedestrians were \nkilled last year in Maine as a result of overweight trucks on local \nroadways, one tragic instance occurring within sight of the nearby \nInterstate. So I ask you, is the so-called safety argument truly a \nlegitimate reason for opposition as my constituents and many others \nacross small American communities are taking their lives in their hands \nwhen merely crossing Main Street?\n  What is the result of redirecting such traffic onto local roads? \nAccording to study conducted by the Maine Department of Transportation, \ntraffic fatalities involving trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are 10 \ntimes greater on secondary roads in Maine than on the exempted \nInterstates. Serious injuries are seven times more likely. Not to \nmention the exorbitant cost of maintaining these secondary roads, \nforced to handle these massive trucks. These roads were not designed to \nhandle this kind of traffic. Our Interstates were, yet these trucks are \nconsistently prevented from traveling on them.\n  As you can see, safety is indeed the issue. Unfortunately, I believe \nthe opponents of such legislation who continually cite safety as the \nreason behind their opposition are missing the point.\n  Another argument against allowing such trucks access to these \nInterstates is the classic ``slippery slope'', that if you allow one \nState to have such an exemption, pretty soon you'll have to give EVERY \nState such an exemption. Well, I would like to remind the opponents of \nthis bill that we're already almost there. A total of 46 States possess \nsome type of variance, already have some type of exemption, and 4 \nStates allow trucks weighing over 130,000 pounds on some roads within \ntheir State! To offer a clear picture of this, if you are driving a \ntruck weighing 100,000 pounds, you can leave Gary, Indiana, just \noutside of Chicago, and can\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\noperate that vehicle all the way to Portland, ME. There, of course, \nthey have to unload the additional weight--this case, 20,000 pounds--to \ncontinue on the Interstate, or travel the remainder of the way through \nthe State on these local roads, endangering the populace and other \ndrivers.\n  Conversely, you can operate a truck weighing 90,000 pounds from \nKansas City, Missouri and travel to Seattle, WA. So I ask you, is this \ntruly a legitimate reason for opposition while my constituents are \ntaking their lives in their hands when merely crossing Main Street? \nPerhaps, for the sake of fairness, every State should rescind their \ncurrent variances, instead requiring that all States operate at the \npresent federal level of 80,000 pounds. I suspect if that were the case \nmany of our opponents would no longer be so stalwart in their \nreluctance to support waivers.\n  Lastly, and most importantly, I would especially like to thank \nSenator Collins for her steadfast effort as, side-by-side, we continue \nto seek a resolution to this issue so vital to our State's economic \ncompetitiveness and to the safety of Maine's people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Nelson, of Florida):\n  S. 859. A bill to amend the provisions of law relating to the John H. \nPrescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Marine \nMammals Rescue Assistance Amendments Act.\n  In my home State of Washington, our history and economy is based on a \nrich maritime tradition that contributes as much as $3 billion to the \nState's economy each year. There are 3,000 vessels in Washington's \nfishing fleet that employ 10,000 fishermen. Nationwide, ocean-dependent \nindustries generate approximately $138 billion and millions of jobs to \nthe U.S. economy. According to the National Ocean Economic Project, 30 \nU.S. coastal states accounted for 82 percent of total population and 81 \npercent of U.S. jobs in 2006.\n  For these communities, their histories and economies literally ebb \nand flow with the tide. It is vital we remember the ocean resources \nthese communities depend on are a public trust, and a resource to be \nboth treasured and protected.\n  One important element of the oceans' ecosystems is marine mammals. \nThey reflect the greater health of the ocean environment, like a canary \nin a coal mine.\n  In Washington state, marine mammals like the endangered Puget Sound \nsouthern resident orcas are icons for our region.\n  My State's coastal waters are inhabited by gray whales, harbor seals, \norcas, humpback whales, Dall's porpoise, California sea lions, and sea \notters. They are an important part of Washington's marine environment, \nand deserve to be protected and respected.\n  But occasionally these remarkable animals run into trouble and need \nour help. They become stranded on beaches, ensnared in fishing gear, \nhit by boats, or harmed by marine trash. Human activities endanger \nthese animals, as such, it is our responsibility to do all that we can \nto protect them.\n  The Marine Mammals Rescue Assistance Amendments Act continues our \nGovernment's efforts to protect and preserve these remarkable \ncreatures.\n  It would reauthorize and amend provisions of the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act of 1972 relating to the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal \nRescue Assistance Grant Program, Prescott program.\n  Before this program was created, saving troubled marine mammals was \nthe burden of small, locally-funded volunteer organizations, many of \nwhom were members of the Marine Mammal Stranding Network. These groups \nof local citizens took on the financial burden of rescuing and \nrehabilitating stranded mammals, relied mainly on piecemeal \nfundraising, and were woefully underfunded.\n  The Prescott program lends a much-needed helping hand to these \norganizations, helping to defray their costs for marine mammal rescue \nand rehabilitation. It also allows eligible Marine Mammal Stranding \nNetwork participants to use funds to collect scientific data to improve \nthe treatment and operation of rescue and rehabilitation centers.\n  Reauthorization of this program is important to the Marine Mammal \nStranding Networks around the nation, aquariums and zoos, the \nenvironmental community, and NOAA.\n  For example, in my home state of Washington, organizations like the \nOrca Network, the Makah Tribe, The Whale Museum, and the Cascadia \nResearch Collective rely on this funding, and last year received a \ntotal of $319,000 in Prescott grant funding to help support their work \npreserving and protecting marine mammals.\n  The Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Amendments Act would amend \nsection 403 of the MMPA to: define the term ``entanglement'' and add \nauthorization for entanglement response as eligible for funding under \nthe program; require the Secretary of Commerce to collect and update \nexisting practices and procedures for rescuing and rehabilitating \nentangled marine mammals; establishes an interest bearing fund in the \nTreasury for emergency response to marine mammal entanglement and \nstranding, and allow the program to solicit and accept gifts and other \ndonations to increase the impact of the program; increase authorization \nfor the program to $7 million for each fiscal years 2009 to 2013; and \nincrease the maximum grant for projects from $100,000 to $200,000.\n  We cannot turn our backs on the damage we do to our marine mammals \nevery day. When marine mammals are harmed by human activities--whether \nintentional or unintentional, direct or indirect--we have an ethical \nobligation to do what we can to help.\n  As stewards of the oceans, we owe it to our coastal communities, our \nprecious marine mammals, and future generations to fulfill that \nobligation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 859\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \ntax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for \ncharitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Nation's charitable community has been \ndamaged from the harsh realties of the economic downturn. Dwindling \ncontributions and devastating market losses have hit many charities and \nphilanthropic activities, and the trusts and funds that support them.\n  Experts at the Congressional Research Service suggest that charitable \nassets could have lost more than $400 billion in value from the stock \nmarket's peak in October 2007. Some foundations with narrow investment \nportfolios have lost close to 50 percent since that time. Donations are \ndown at many charities across the country.\n  Yet, the work of these organizations to assist low-income families \nand individuals facing financial difficulty is more important than \never. The economy is in trouble--20,000 jobs are lost every day and the \nunemployment rate is approaching 9 percent. It is not surprising that \nmany charities are seeing an increase in those seeking help for food, \nrent or mortgage payments or utility bills, along with an increase in \nthe number of working poor seeking services, more generally.\n  The Senate recently sent a strong message to our charitable community \nthat we understand their financial challenges and will do what it can \nto help. During consideration of the fiscal year 2010 Budget \nResolution, the Senate unanimously passed an amendment I authored with \nSenator Snowe that gives a green light to pass legislation to extend \nand enhance the soon-to-expire charitable individual retirement \naccount, IRA, rollover tool that charities have used to help raise \nmoney. This tax incentive allows individuals to make gifts to charities \nfrom their IRAs without suffering adverse tax consequences.\n  Today, I am joined by Senator Snowe and 9 of our colleagues in \nintroducing the Public Good IRA Rollover Act, which would permanently \nextend and expand the tax-free charitable IRA rollover incentive.\n  Congress added a provision to the Tax Code in 2006 that permitted \ntaxpayers age 70\\1/2\\ or older to give money\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\ndirectly from their IRAs to charities, tax-free. This provision is \nmodeled after an approach for direct charitable gifts that we have \nadvanced in the Public Good IRA Rollover Act.\n  The results of this provision have been very exciting for many in the \ncharitable community. According to one survey, approximately 900 \ncharitable organizations had reported more than 8,500 individual IRA \ndistributions, with a total value of nearly $140 million.\n  Unfortunately, the tax-favored benefit of the charitable IRA rollover \nis only available for a temporary period and is scheduled to expire at \nthe end of this year unless Congress acts. The Public Good IRA Rollover \nAct will not only extend the charitable IRA rollover, it will modify it \nin a manner that we believe will result in more gifts to charity \nwithout busting the budget. These changes include: allowing taxpayers \nto make life-income gifts from their IRAs to charities at age 59\\1/2\\, \neliminating the current dollar cap, and making the charitable IRA \nrollover benefits available to more charitable organizations.\n  Adopting these provisions will result in more charitable giving, \nparticularly allowing taxpayers to make life-time gifts from their IRAs \nstarting at the age of 59\\1/2\\. Many charities secure funds from life-\nincome gifts, which involve the donation of assets to a charity, where \nthe giver retains an income stream from those assets for a defined \nperiod. While this provision would stimulate additional giving, \nevidence also suggests that people who make life-income gifts become \nmore involved with charities. And, because the income payouts for most \ngift annuities and charitable trusts will be higher than IRA payouts, \nIRA rollovers to life-income agreements may produce immediate taxable \nrevenues and score positively. In short, the life-income gift provision \nwould greatly benefit charities in a fiscally-responsible manner.\n  The Public Good IRA Rollover Act has strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate and House of Representatives. It has garnered the support of the \nIndependent Sector, the Council on Foundations, and the Partnership for \nPhilanthropic Planning. I am very pleased that the North Dakota \nAssociation of Nonprofit Organizations, which represents the interests \nof more than 140 nonprofits in my State, has also offered its support \nfor this legislation that could help North Dakota charities raise \nmillions of dollars in the coming years.\n  I also ask my colleagues to review this legislation and consider \ncosponsoring it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          North Dakota Association\n\n\n                                   of Nonprofit Organizations,\n\n                                     Bismarck, ND, April 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: The North Dakota Association of \n     Nonprofit Organizations (NDANO), on behalf of the more than \n     140 member nonprofits in our state, writes to express our \n     support for Public Good IRA Rollover Act you will be \n     introducing later this month.\n       NDANO's mission is strengthening member nonprofits, \n     building community and enhancing quality of life, and one of \n     the key issues on NDANO's public policy agenda is charitable \n     giving. More specifically, NDANO supports actions to preserve \n     and expand tax policies that increase incentives for \n     taxpayers to donate to charitable organizations. Donations by \n     individuals to support nonprofit work in North Dakota are \n     essential to increasing nonprofit capacity to meet the needs \n     of the state's citizens and communities, particularly in \n     these challenging economic times. This Act could be a real \n     boost to fundraising, encouraging those age 59\\1/2\\ and older \n     to make gifts to charities that would not otherwise be given.\n       NDANO appreciates your commitment to introduce this Act to \n     incentivize charitable giving. Thank you for your continuing \n     support of North Dakota nonprofits and the entire nonprofit \n     sector.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dana Schaar,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Independent Sector,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2009.\n     Re: Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009.\n\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dorgan and Snowe: On behalf of the over 550 \n     member organizations of Independent Sector, I am writing to \n     express our sincere appreciation for your leadership in \n     promoting nonprofits and the work they perform through your \n     introduction of the Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009.\n       Since it was enacted in August 2006, the current IRA \n     charitable rollover has helped nonprofits enrich lives and \n     strengthen communities across the country and around the \n     world by allowing individuals to make direct gifts to \n     charities from their Individual Retirement Accounts without \n     suffering adverse tax consequences. The IRA rollover is \n     particularly helpful for older Americans who do not itemize \n     their tax deductions and would not otherwise receive any tax \n     benefit for their contributions. We wholeheartedly support \n     the provisions in the Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009 \n     that make the giving incentive permanent, allow planned \n     giving programs to provide retirement security to donors \n     while helping nonprofits serve their communities, and expand \n     the IRA rollover to donor advised funds and supporting \n     organizations.\n       We believe that your Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009 \n     would greatly enhance the ability of individuals to give back \n     to their communities and offer our assistance in helping to \n     move this important bill through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patricia Read.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Partnership for\n\n\n                                       Philanthropic Planning,\n\n                                 Indianapolis, IN, April 21, 2009.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dorgan and Snowe: On behalf of the \n     Partnership for Philanthropic Planning (formerly the National \n     Committee on Planned Giving), I write to thank you for \n     reintroducing the Public Good IRA Rollover Act. We appreciate \n     your efforts to help our nation's charities during this \n     period of economic turmoil.\n       The Public Good IRA Rollover Act would make permanent and \n     expand the IRA Charitable Rollover enacted in 2006 and \n     extended at the end of last year. As you well know, the IRA \n     Charitable Rollover has already generated a significant \n     amount of new charitable giving by eliminating the barrier in \n     the tax law that had discouraged transfers from individual \n     retirement accounts to charities. These gifts are helping \n     organizations in every state build cancer centers, develop \n     programs for counseling at-risk youth, support housing for \n     homeless families, conserve wilderness areas, help \n     disadvantaged students attend college, and provide therapy \n     for people with disabilities.\n       We are pleased that your legislation would expand the \n     current law IRA Charitable Rollover by allowing for qualified \n     charitable distributions to life-income gifts, including \n     charitable gift annuities, charitable remainder trusts and \n     pooled income funds. We are also delighted your legislation \n     would permit distributions from IRA accounts to donor-advised \n     funds, supporting organizations, and private foundations. \n     These important provisions will offer increased options for \n     charitable giving, allowing an entire generation of generous \n     Americans to continue providing for others even in these \n     challenging economic times.\n       Again, thank you for reintroducing the Public Good IRA \n     Rollover Act. We look forward to working with your office to \n     ensure it is signed into law soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Tanya Howe Johnson,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Council on Foundations,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, April 21, 2009.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan and Senator Snowe: On behalf of the \n     Council on Foundations and our membership of more than 2,100 \n     grantmaking foundations and corporations, we would like to \n     thank you for your continued leadership on issues of critical \n     concern to the philanthropic sector and the communities which \n     we serve. We are particularly appreciative of your \n     sponsorship of the ``Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009'', \n     legislation which would both permanently extend current law \n     authorizing charitable rollovers of individual retirement \n     accounts (``IRAs''), and permit such rollovers to include \n     gifts to donor-advised funds, supporting organizations, and \n     private foundations.\n       Enactment of the ``Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009'' \n     will be a crucial step forward in ensuring that philanthropic \n     organizations have the means and flexibility to address \n     dramatically growing needs. Making current law regarding IRA \n     rollovers permanent will provide current donors the certainty \n     needed for prudent charitable gift\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\n     planning, and will ensure future donors have the ability to \n     use this efficient means of giving. Making the charitable IRA \n     rollover available for gifts to donor-advised funds, \n     supporting organizations, and private foundations will enable \n     additional donors, particularly among middle-income \n     Americans, to utilize charitable rollovers for the benefit of \n     organizations that are particularly well-suited to delivering \n     philanthropic resources quickly and effectively to \n     communities in need.\n       Two recent studies by the Council on Foundations show that, \n     in 2007, donor-advised funds accounted for over one-third of \n     all community foundation assets and 62% of their total \n     grantmaking. In addition, donor-advised funds located within \n     community foundations have a payout rate of 16.4%, over three \n     times the minimum required for private foundations by federal \n     law. The Council also has found that donor-advised funds are \n     a particularly effective tool for middle-income Americans to \n     engage in philanthropy. With most community foundations \n     accepting a donor-advised fund in the range of $5,000 to \n     $15,000, donor-advised funds are a philanthropic vehicle that \n     can go to work immediately, a particularly valuable asset \n     given current demands on philanthropic resources.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in providing \n     philanthropies with the tools needed to fulfill their \n     missions, and to help meet the growing needs of their \n     communities.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 regarding environmental education, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the No Child Left \nInside Act of 2009, which will provide new support for environmental \neducation in our Nation's classrooms. I thank Senators Collins, Cardin, \nDodd, Durbin, Gillibrand, Kerry, Lautenberg, Lincoln, Menendez, Murray, \nSanders, and Whitehouse for agreeing to be original cosponsors of this \nbill. Given the major environmental challenges we face today, teaching \nour young people about their natural world should be a priority, and \nthis legislation is an important first step.\n  For more than three decades, environmental education has been a \ngrowing part of effective instruction in America's schools. Responding \nto the need to improve student achievement and prepare students for the \n21st century economy, many schools throughout the Nation now offer some \nform of environmental education.\n  Yet, environmental education is facing a significant challenge. Many \nschools are being forced to scale back or eliminate environmental \nprograms. Fewer and fewer students are able to take part in related \nclassroom instruction and field investigations, however effective or \npopular. State and local administrators, teachers, and environmental \neducators point to two factors behind this recent and disturbing shift: \nthe unintended consequences of the No Child Left Behind Act and a lack \nof funding for these critical programs.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would address these two \nconcerns. First, it would provide a new professional development \ninitiative to ensure that teachers possess the content knowledge and \npedagogical skills to effectively teach environmental education in the \nclassroom, including the use of innovative interdisciplinary and field-\nbased learning strategies. Second, the bill would create incentives, \nthrough new funding, for states to develop a peer-reviewed \ncomprehensive statewide environmental literacy plan to make sure \nprekindergarten, elementary, and secondary school students have a solid \nunderstanding of our planet and its natural resources. Lastly, the No \nChild Left Inside Act provides support for school districts to \ninitiate, expand, or improve their environmental education curriculum, \nand for rigorous national studies to be conducted regarding the \neffectiveness of environmental education on improving student academic \nachievement and behavior. This legislation has broad support among \nnational and state environmental groups and educational groups.\n  The American public recognizes that the environment is already one of \nthe dominant issues of the 21st century. In 2003, a National Science \nFoundation panel noted that ``in the coming decades, the public will \nmore frequently be called upon to understand complex environmental \nissues, assess risk, evaluate proposed environmental plans and \nunderstand how individual decisions affect the environment at local and \nglobal scales. Creating a scientifically informed citizenry requires a \nconcerted, systemic approach to environmental education . . .'' In the \nprivate sector, business leaders also increasingly believe that an \nenvironmentally literate workforce is critical to their long-term \nsuccess. They recognize that better, more efficient environmental \npractices improve the bottom line and help position their companies for \nthe future.\n  Climate change, conservation of precious natural resources, \nmaintaining clean air and water, and other environmental challenges are \npressing and complex issues that influence human health, economic \ndevelopment, and national security. A federal study released earlier \nthis month found that students participating in environmental air \nquality education programs took action that resulted in improved air \nquality in their communities. The study concludes by recommending \nincreased support for environmental education programs. Finding \nwidespread agreement about the specific steps we need to take to solve \nthese problems is difficult. Environmental education will help ensure \nthat our Nation's children have the knowledge and skills necessary to \naddress these critical issues. In short, the environment should be an \nimportant part of the curriculum in our schools.\n  I know my constituents in Rhode Island, as well as the residents of \nother States, want their children to be environmentally literate and \nhave a connection with the natural world. In Rhode Island, \norganizations such as the Rhode Island Environmental Education \nAssociation, Roger Williams Park Zoo, Save the Bay, the Nature \nConservancy, and the Audubon Society as well as countless schools, \nteachers, and other groups across the country, reach out to children \neach and every day to offer educational and outdoor experiences that \nthese children may never otherwise have, helping to inspire them to \nlearn. Despite these extraordinary efforts, environmental education \nremains out of reach for too many kids. I am proud to sponsor this \nimportant legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact the No Child Left Inside Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 866\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Shirley Constantino Tan; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina \nnational living in Pacifica, California. She is the loving mother of 12 \nyear old U.S. citizen twin boys, Jashley and Joreine, and the spouse of \nJay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n  I have decided to introduce a private bill on Ms. Tan's behalf \nbecause I believe her removal from the U.S. would cause undue hardship \nfor her and her family. Without this legislation, this family will be \nseparated or they will be relocated to a third country where Ms. Tan's \nsafety and her children's well-being may be at risk. I believe Ms. Tan \nmerits Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form \nof relief as a private bill.\n  Before coming to the U.S., Ms. Tan experienced tragic hardship in the \nPhilippines after her mother and sister were murdered by her cousin. \nMs. Tan was only 14 years old at the time and the violent assault left \nher with a bullet wound in the head. Although the cousin who committed \nthe murders was eventually prosecuted, he received a short sentence and \nhis impending release from jail in 1990 compelled her to leave the \ncountry out of fear for her safety. Ms. Tan legally entered the U.S. on \na visitor's visa in 1989.\n  Ms. Tan faces deportation today in part because of the negligence \ndemonstrated by her previous counsel. Ms. Tan applied for asylum in \n1995. After years of appeals, the attorney received a brief from the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals, BIA, outlining the Government's position \non Ms. Tan's case. The attorney, however, failed to submit a reply \nbrief in her client's favor and, in May 2002, the case was dismissed \nand Ms. Tan was granted an order of voluntary departure from the U.S.\n  Ms. Tan should have received notice of the voluntary removal order \nfrom her attorney. However, the attorney had moved offices, did not \nreceive the order, and failed to inform Ms. Tan of the information. As \na result, Ms. Tan did not depart the U.S. and the voluntary removal \norder against her became a deportation order.\n  The first time that Ms. Tan received notice of the deportation order \nwas on January 28, 2009, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nofficers appeared at her home and took her into custody.\n  In effect, Ms. Tan was denied the opportunity to adequately represent \nherself in U.S. immigration proceedings as a result of her attorney's \nnegligence. Ms. Tan has since filed a complaint against her former \nattorney with the State Bar of California. A previous complaint has \nalso been filed against the same attorney with the California Bar for \nsimilar misconduct.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for permitting Ms. Tan to remain \nin the U.S. is the impact that her deportation would have on her two \nU.S. citizen minor children, Jashley and Joreine.\n  These children are currently seventh graders at Cabrillo Elementary \nSchool in Pacifica, California, where they have made the honor roll. In \nletters to me from two teachers at Cabrillo Elementary, Jashley and \nJoreine were described as ``ideal'' students--``the kinds of kids that \nmake my job feel easy.'' One of the teachers described their mother, \nMs. Tan, as a highly-involved, ``model'' parent, one who ``attends \nevery conference, drives on field trips and consistently checks in with \nher boys' teachers and the rest of our staff to make sure Jashley and \nJoreine continue to be successful.''\n  However, if Ms. Tan is forced to leave the United States, this family \nhas stated that they would follow her to the Philippines or relocate to \na third country to avoid their separation. This means that Jashley and \nJoreine will have to cut their education short and have to leave the \nU.S.--their birthplace and the only country they know to be home.\n  All too often, young U.S. citizen children like Jashley and Joreine \nare being put in this position when one or both of their parents may be \nremoved from the United States. A January 2009 report by the Department \nof Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that, over the \nlast 10 years, 108,434 immigrants who were the parents of U.S. citizen \nchildren were removed from this country.\n  A separate report completed this year by Dorsey & Whitney LLP to the \nUrban Institute affirms what many of us know--that the removal or \ndeportation of a parent is deeply traumatic and causes long-lasting \nharm to U.S. citizen children. For families that have no choice but to \nleave the United States as a unit in order to stay together, this has \nlife-altering consequences for U.S. citizen children. Besides the fact \nthat these children lose the opportunities that come with being raised \nin the United States, these children are more prone to anxiety, \ndepression, eating and sleeping disorders, post- traumatic stress \ndisorder, and behavior changes.\n  This is the situation facing the Tan family. While her marriage was \nlegally performed under California law at the time, Ms. Tan cannot take \nsteps to legally adjust her immigration status\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\nthrough the regular family-based immigration channels.\n  I do not believe that it is in our Nation's best interest to force \nthis family--including two U.S. citizen minor children--to make the \nchoice between being separated and relocation to a country where they \nmay face serious hardships.\n  The Tan family has built a stable and supportive home for themselves \nin the Pacifica, California community. Ms. Tan's spouse has worked for \n17 years at Biddle-Shaw Insurance Services, Inc., where her employer \ndescribes her as ``hard-working . . . trustworthy and dependable.'' \nThis couple owns their own home, and over many years they were active \nmembers of the Good Shepherd Catholic Church. At Good Shepherd, Jay was \na member of the School Board and Ms. Tan was a consummate volunteer. I \nreceived a heartfelt letter from the Pastor at Good Shepherd that \ndescribes Ms. Tan as a ``dedicated mother'' and attests to the family's \nspirit of volunteerism and commitment at the church.\n  In fact, I have received 45 letters from friends and community \nmembers and 3 letters from organizations, including the Human Rights \nCampaign, Love Exiles, and Immigration Equality, in support of Ms. Tan \nremaining in the U.S. I have also been contacted by Representative \nJackie Speier's office in support of this case. This family has also \nreceived substantial attention from the media in the San Francisco Bay \nArea.\n  Enactment of the legislation I am introducing on behalf of Ms. Tan \ntoday will enable this entire family to us continue to remain in the \nU.S. and make positive contributions to their community in Pacifica, \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SHIRLEY CONSTANTINO \n                   TAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Shirley Constantino Tan shall be eligible for issuance \n     of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of \n     an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon \n     filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Shirley Constantino Tan \n     enters the United States before the filing deadline specified \n     in subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered \n     and remained lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Shirley \n     Constantino Tan, the Secretary of State shall instruct the \n     proper officer to reduce by one, during the current or next \n     following fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas \n     that are made available to natives of the country of the \n     alien's birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of the alien's birth under section \n     202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Cabrillo School,\n\n                                      Pacifica, CA, April 2, 2009.\n       To Whom It May Concern: Jaylynn Mercado and Shirley Tan are \n     model parents to their 12-year-old twin boys, Jashley and \n     Joriene. It is upsetting to hear that Shirley is being forced \n     to leave the country and be separated from her family. Due to \n     the dedication of these parents, Jashley and Joriene are \n     ideal students. They are well liked by their peers and the \n     faculty of the school. They are both exceptional students. \n     Jaylynn and Shirley are always willing to help the school out \n     in any way possible. They are committed to encouraging their \n     children to do great things. Jaylynn and Shirley have modeled \n     and taught their boys some of the finest traits of respect \n     and compassion. It is my hope that this respect and \n     compassion is returned to the Mercado Family.\n       Please do what is possible to keep this family intact. They \n     are a lovely addition to our school community. Please contact \n     me if there is any more help that I can give.\n           Sincerely,\n     Meghann Elsbernd.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Cabrillo School,\n\n                                     Pacifica, CA, March 30, 2009.\n       To Whom It May Concern: My name is Jared Katz and I am \n     writing this letter in support of Shirley Mercado. I teach \n     6th grade at Cabrillo Elementary in Pacifica, California and \n     last year I was fortunate to have Joriene and Jashley Mercado \n     in my class. Both boys were exceptional students. They were \n     on the honor roll, athletic, confident, and popular with \n     their peers. Joriene and Jashley are the kinds of kids that \n     make my job feel easy.\n       Once I got to know their family a little bit I immediately \n     understood why the boys were so successful. Each year I see \n     sixty-four different families, from a variety of cultural and \n     economic backgrounds, and I don't think I've ever seen a \n     family as committed to each other as the Mercados. Being in a \n     room with the four of them together it's impossible to not be \n     envious of the strong bond between them and of the ease and \n     comfort in the way they relate to one another. And from our \n     first meeting it was obvious that Shirley is the center of \n     their family's strength. When you talk to them together all \n     the boys' actions revolve around her and as a member of our \n     school community she is the model parent. She attends every \n     conference, drives on field trips and consistently checks in \n     with her boys teachers and the rest of our staff to make sure \n     Joriene and Jashley continue to be successful.\n       When I heard the news this morning that she may be forced \n     to leave the country and be separated from her family I was \n     very shocked and saddened. If there's anything that can be \n     done to help preserve her family I hope that it will be \n     vigorously pursued. And if there's anything I can do to help, \n     please don't hesitate to ask.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jared Katz.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Church of the Good Shepherd,\n\n                                                     Pacifica, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein, It is an honor for me to write this \n     letter of support for one of your constituents, Ms. Shirley \n     Tan. I am her Pastor here at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in \n     Pacifica. I have gotten to know Shirley and her partner Jay \n     Mercado as well as their twin boys Jashley and Joriene. I \n     have been closely connected with this family for the past 5 \n     years. Shirley is a wonderful mother to her sons. She is \n     always available, her gentle spirit and loving heart guiding \n     all that she does as a parent. She and Jay want the best for \n     their sons. They want the boys to grow in wisdom and \n     knowledge and find their true and definite place in this \n     world. They provide a warm and welcoming home, with their \n     door open to family and neighbors (and even strangers!!) \n     Shirley and Jay were school parents here until recently, \n     when, they found a public school that better met the needs of \n     their boys. While they were here at Good Shepherd, Jay was a \n     faithful and responsible member of the School Board, and \n     Shirley was the consummate volunteer . . . always willing and \n     able to help out on campus, as a classroom aide, on special \n     school projects, as a chaperone on field trips . . . Whenever \n     there was a call for help from our Principal or from the \n     School Office, without a moment's hesitation, Shirley would \n     be one of the first to call and offer whatever assistance was \n     needed at the time.\n       Jay and Shirley were also faithful members of one of our \n     Sunday Mass choirs. Coming to church every week . . . being \n     faithful members of a Christian community . . . being whole-\n     hearted servants of God as ministers of music in this local \n     church . . . bringing their two boys to mass every Sunday and \n     encouraging them to become altar servers . . . Jay and \n     Shirley have for all the time I have known them been \n     wonderful Christian partners, parents, role models for their \n     two boys, and, as Scripture says, ``living stones'' helping \n     to form and to build up the Church, the Body of Christ, in \n     today's broken and violent world.\n       I urge you in the strongest possible terms to do to all \n     that you can to assist Shirley and to help quickly and justly \n     resolve her current legal situation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Piers M.

Res. 108\n\n       Whereas Somalia has been without a functioning central \n     government since 1991, resulting in lawlessness and an \n     increasingly desperate humanitarian situation;\n       Whereas according to a Somali human rights group, violence \n     during the period from 2007 to 2009 has killed an estimated \n     16,000 people, wounded more than 28,000 people, and displaced \n     more than 1,000,000 people;\n       Whereas these grim conditions and the absence of a \n     functioning government have made Somalia an ideal base for \n     piracy operations and a fertile ground for terrorist \n     organizations, including the group al-Shabaab, whose leaders \n     have ties to al-Qaeda;\n       Whereas acts of piracy off the coast of Somalia have been \n     on the rise for more than a year, with the International \n     Maritime Bureau reporting an estimated 111 attacks in 2008;\n       Whereas on Wednesday, April 8, 2009, Somali pirates used \n     grappling hooks and weapons to board the Norfolk, Virginia-\n     based container ship Maersk Alabama, which was captained by \n     Richard Phillips, a resident of Underhill, Vermont, and \n     crewed by 19 other citizens of the United States, and which \n     was delivering food aid from the World Food Programme to \n     hungry people in east Africa;\n       Whereas Captain Phillips, a native of Winchester, \n     Massachusetts and a 1979 graduate of the Massachusetts \n     Maritime Academy, bravely led the Maersk Alabama crew in \n     successfully retaking control of the ship by offering himself \n     as a hostage in exchange for the release of the crew;\n       Whereas 4 pirates took Captain Phillips into an 18-foot \n     lifeboat, held him captive at gunpoint, and repeatedly \n     threatened to kill him;\n       Whereas the United States Central Command dispatched to the \n     scene the destroyer U.S.S.

Halyburton and the U.S.S. \n     Boxer, along with Navy SEAL teams, Marine Corps helicopters, \n     and other joint assets of the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas hostage recovery experts from the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation gave guidance to the crew of the U.S.S. \n     Bainbridge, while the Department of State stayed in contact \n     with Captain Phillips' family, including Phillips' wife \n     Andrea and their 2 children, Daniel and Mariah, in Underhill, \n     Vermont;\n       Whereas Maersk Limited, based in Norfolk, Virginia, worked \n     diligently with the United States Armed Forces to try to \n     obtain the release of Captain Phillips and the Maersk Alabama \n     crew and to move the ship safely to port in Kenya, while \n     sending personal representatives to Vermont to keep the \n     Phillips family informed;\n       Whereas in the late evening of April 9, 2009, Captain \n     Phillips made an escape attempt, jumping into the water of \n     the Indian Ocean to swim for safety, only to be pursued by \n     the pirates and quickly recaptured;\n       Whereas the President received regular briefings on the \n     hostage crisis and provided the authority necessary for the \n     United States Armed Forces to resolve it;\n       Whereas on April 12, 2009, Easter Sunday, Captain Phillips \n     was rescued after the United States Armed Forces, which \n     throughout the crisis spared no effort to defuse the \n     situation and peacefully rescue Phillips, took the lives of 3 \n     of the pirate captors when Phillips was seen to be in \n     imminent danger; and\n       Whereas international commerce remains under threat while \n     Somali pirates continue to hold for ransom more than 200 crew \n     members of many nationalities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Captain Phillips deserves the respect and admiration of \n     all people of the United States for his brave conduct under \n     life-threatening circumstances;\n       (2) the Senate shares the sense of relief and gratitude \n     felt by the family and shipmates of Captain Phillips;\n       (3) all members of the United States Armed Forces involved \n     in the rescue operation, in particular members of the Navy \n     and Navy SEAL teams who rescued Captain Phillips, the \n     officials of other Federal Government departments and \n     agencies who contributed, and the crew of the Maersk Alabama, \n     are to be commended for their exceptional efforts and \n     devotion to duty; and\n       (4) the President should work with the international \n     community and the transitional government of Somalia to \n     develop a comprehensive strategy to address both the \n     burgeoning problem of piracy and its root causes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4586-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 109--COMMENDING THE BRAVERY OF THE GIRLS WHO ATTEND \n         THE MIRWAIS SCHOOL FOR GIRLS IN KANDAHAR, AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Risch) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 109\n\n       Whereas, on November 12, 2008, 15 girls who attend the \n     Mirwais School for Girls in Kandahar, Afghanistan, were \n     attacked by militants and sprayed with acid, causing them \n     varying degrees of disfigurement;\n       Whereas the militants committed the egregious attack to \n     intimidate the girls and their families and to discourage the \n     girls from continuing to attend school;\n       Whereas, less than one week after the attacks, Headmaster \n     Mahmood Qadari asked parents to return the girls to school;\n       Whereas, by January 14, 2009, nearly 1,300 girls, almost \n     all the students, had returned to the 40-room Mirwais School \n     for Girls;\n       Whereas the families of the girls from the Mirwais School \n     for Girls defy threats of personal harm and staunchly assert \n     the right to educate their daughters;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations, educating girls \n     and women reduces the incidence of domestic and community \n     violence and raises the standard of living in a country;\n       Whereas, according to a study published by the Afghanistan \n     Independent Human Rights Commission, it is a ``fact that \n     child marriage takes place in a frequent and pervasive \n     fashion'' in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas, according to that study, of women surveyed for the \n     study, 43.6 percent stated that they married to solve their \n     economic problems, 7.1 percent referred to the resolution of \n     conflicts as the reason for their early marriage, 37 percent \n     said that ``badal'', or the exchange of girls between 2 \n     families, was the reason for their marriage, and 12.3 percent \n     cited other reasons for their marriage, such as local \n     traditional practices and parental interference;\n       Whereas, according to 2007 information from the World \n     Health Organization, the health of women and children in \n     Afghanistan is among the worst in the world;\n       Whereas, according to estimates from the Department of \n     State for 2008, the literacy rate for women in Afghanistan is \n     12 percent;\n       Whereas it is a continuing priority of the United States \n     government to advance the rights of women in Afghanistan by \n     facilitating women's participation in social, political, and \n     economic affairs and by ensuring women's safety and well-\n     being;\n       Whereas the United States Government looks to the \n     government of Afghanistan to proactively support the rights \n     of women and girls, and recognizes that the recently-passed \n     personal security law would severely diminish such rights;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID) has integrated women-focused activities \n     into most of its programs by strategic design, with the goal \n     of increasing women's political participation and access to \n     education, health care, economic opportunities, and roles in \n     civil society;\n       Whereas USAID has noted that, despite women's nearly non-\n     existent access to health, education, and political \n     participation in 2001, there has been a 25 percent decrease \n     in maternal mortality since 2001, due in great part to \n     women's significantly improved access to health and hospital \n     services;\n       Whereas, since 2001, Afghanistan has experienced a surge in \n     school attendance to more than 6,000,000 children enrolled, \n     of which 35 percent are girls, and has greatly increased \n     participation of women in civil society, with women \n     representing 26 percent of the civil service and holding 27 \n     percent of the seats in the national assembly and 29 percent \n     of provincial council seats; and\n       Whereas, despite significant gains made through assistance \n     programs in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban \n     government in 2001, there remains a great deal more work to \n     be done toward achieving reasonable development in still one \n     of the poorest countries in the world, and such development \n     can be achieved only by empowering the 50 percent of the \n     population that is women: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the extraordinary bravery shown \n     by the girls and families of the Mirwais School for Girls in \n     Kandahar, Afghanistan, especially the girls injured in the \n     November 2008 attack, in the decision to return to school in \n     the face of threats of bodily injury, or worse;

which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 18\n\n       Whereas April 25 of each year is recognized internationally \n     as World Malaria Day and in the United States as Malaria \n     Awareness Day;\n       Whereas, despite malaria being completely preventable and \n     treatable and the fact that malaria was eliminated in the \n     United States over 50 years ago, more than 40 percent of the \n     world's population is still at risk of contracting malaria;\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, nearly \n     1,000,000 people die from malaria each year, the vast \n     majority of whom are children under the age of 5 in Africa;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, with a child \n     dying from malaria roughly every 30 seconds and nearly 3,000 \n     children dying from malaria every day;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal health, \n     causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth \n     weights, with estimates by the Center for Disease Control and \n     Prevention that malaria infection causes 400,000 cases of \n     severe maternal anemia and from 75,000 to 200,000 infant \n     deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas HIV infection increases the risk and severity of \n     malarial illness, and malaria increases the viral load in \n     HIV-positive people, which can lead to increased transmission \n     of HIV and more rapid disease progression, with substantial \n     public health implications;\n       Whereas in malarial regions, many people are co-infected \n     with malaria and one or more of the neglected tropical \n     diseases (NTDs) such as hookworm and schistosomiasis, which \n     causes a pronounced exacerbation of anemia and several \n     adverse health consequences;\n       Whereas the malnutrition and chronic illness that result \n     from childhood malaria leads to increased absenteeism in \n     school and perpetuates cycles of poverty;\n       Whereas an estimated 90 percent of deaths from malaria \n     occur in Africa, and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership \n     estimates that malaria costs countries in Africa \n     $12,000,000,000 in lost economic productivity each year;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that \n     malaria accounts for 40 percent of healthcare expenditures in \n     high-burden countries, demonstrating that effective, long-\n     term malaria control is inextricably linked to the strength \n     of health systems;\n       Whereas heightened efforts over recent years to prevent and \n     treat malaria are currently saving lives;\n       Whereas the progress and funding to control malaria has \n     increased ten-fold since 2000, in large part due to funding \n     under the President's Malaria Initiative (a United States \n     Government initiative designed to cut malaria deaths in half \n     in target countries in sub-Saharan Africa), the Global Fund \n     to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank, and \n     new financing by other donors;\n       Whereas the President's Malaria Initiative has purchased \n     almost 13,000,000 artemisinin-based combination therapies \n     (ACT), protected over 17,000,000 people through spraying \n     campaigns, and distributed over 6,000,000 insecticide-treated \n     bed nets, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n     Malaria has distributed 70,000,000 bed nets to protect \n     families from malaria and provided 74,000,000 malaria \n     patients with ACTs, and the World Bank's Booster Program is \n     scheduled to commit approximately $500,000,000 in \n     International Development Association funds for malaria \n     control in Africa;\n       Whereas public and private partners are developing \n     effective and affordable drugs to treat malaria, with more \n     than 23 types of malaria vaccines in development;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, vector control, or the prevention of malaria \n     transmission via anopheles mosquitoes, which includes a \n     combination of methods such as insecticide-treated bed nets, \n     indoor residual spraying, and source reduction (larval \n     control), has been shown to reduce severe morbidity and \n     mortality due to malaria in endemic regions;\n       Whereas the impact of malaria efforts have been documented \n     in numerous regions, such as in Zanzibar, where malaria \n     prevalence among children shrank from 20 percent to less than \n     1 percent between 2005 and 2007, and in Rwanda, where malaria \n     cases and deaths appeared to decline rapidly after a large-\n     scale distribution of bed nets and malaria treatments in \n     2006; and\n       Whereas a malaria-free future will rely on consistent \n     international, national, and local leadership and a \n     comprehensive approach addressing the range of health, \n     development, and economic challenges facing developing \n     countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Malaria Awareness Day, \n     including the achievable target of ending malaria deaths by \n     2015;\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     Malaria Awareness Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, \n     and activities to raise awareness and support to save the \n     lives of those affected by malaria;\n       (3) reaffirms the goals and commitments to combat malaria \n     in the Tom Lantos and Henry J.

GRANTS TO STATES FOR ENHANCED PROTECTION OF SENIORS \n                   FROM BEING MISLEAD BY FALSE DESIGNATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) many seniors are targeted by salespersons and advisers \n     using misleading certifications and professional \n     designations;\n       (2) many certifications and professional designations used \n     by salespersons and advisers represent limited training or \n     expertise, and may in fact be of no value with respect to \n     advising seniors on financial and estate planning matters, \n     and far too often, such designations are obtained simply by \n     attending a weekend seminar and passing an open book, \n     multiple choice test;\n       (3) many seniors have lost their life savings because \n     salespersons and advisers holding a misleading designation \n     have steered them toward products that were unsuitable for \n     them, given their retirement needs and life expectancies;\n       (4) seniors have a right to clearly know whether they are \n     working with a qualified adviser who understands the products \n     and is working in their best interest or a self-interested \n     salesperson or adviser advocating particular products; and\n       (5) many existing State laws and enforcement measures \n     addressing the use of certifications, professional \n     designations, and suitability standards in selling financial \n     products to seniors are inadequate to protect senior \n     investors from salespersons and advisers using such \n     designations.\n       (b) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``misleading designation''--\n       (A) means the use of a purported certification, \n     professional designation, or other credential, that indicates \n     or implies that a salesperson or adviser has special \n     certification or training in advising or servicing seniors; \n     and\n       (B) does not include any legitimate certification, \n     professional designation, license, or other credential, if--\n       (i) it has been offered by an academic institution having \n     regional accreditation; or\n       (ii) it meets the standards for certifications, licenses, \n     and professional designations outlined by the North American \n     Securities Administrators Association (in this section \n     referred to as the ``NASAA'') Model Rule on the Use of \n     Senior-Specific Certifications and Professional Designations, \n     or it was issued by or obtained from any State;\n       (2) the term ``financial product'' means securities, \n     insurance products (including insurance products which pay a \n     return, whether fixed or variable), and bank and loan \n     products;\n       (3) the term ``misleading or fraudulent marketing'' means \n     the use of a misleading\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\n     designation in selling or advising a senior in the sale of a \n     financial product;\n       (4) the term ``senior'' means any individual who has \n     attained the age of 62 or older; and\n       (5) the term ``State'' means each of the 50 States, the \n     District of Columbia, and the unincorporated territories of \n     Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n       (c) Grant Program.--The Attorney General of the United \n     States (in this section referred to as the ``Attorney \n     General'')--\n       (1) shall establish a program in accordance with this \n     section to provide grants to States--\n       (A) to investigate and prosecute misleading and fraudulent \n     marketing practices;

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The United States is currently facing an unprecedented \n     economic crisis, with massive losses of jobs in the United \n     States and an alarming contraction of economic activity in \n     the United States.\n       (2) The United States Government has pledged, committed, or \n     loaned more than $9,000,000,000,000 as of February 2009 in an \n     attempt to mitigate and resolve the economic crisis and \n     trillions of dollars more may well be necessary before the \n     crisis is over.\n       (3) The economic crisis reaches into, and has impacted, \n     almost every aspect of the United States economy and \n     significant parts of the international economy.\n       (4) Any thorough and complete study and investigation of \n     this complex and far-reaching economic crisis will require \n     sustained and singular focus for many months.\n       (5) A study and investigation of this size and scope \n     implicates the jurisdiction of several Standing Committees of \n     the Senate and, if it is to be done correctly and timely, \n     will require a degree of undivided attention and resources \n     beyond the capacity of the Standing Committees of the Senate, \n     which are already overburdened.\n       (6) Adding such a significant study and investigation to \n     the duties of the existing Standing Committees of the Senate \n     would make it difficult for such committees to get their \n     regular required work accomplished, particularly when so much \n     attention and so many resources are appropriately devoted to \n     responding to the ongoing economic crisis.\n       (7) Dozens of important investigations have been conducted \n     with the creation of a select committee of the Senate for a \n     specific purpose and a set time.\n       (8) The American public has a right to get straight answers \n     on how this economic crisis developed and what steps should \n     be taken to make sure that nothing like it happens again.\n\n     SEC. _02.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On October 7, 2008, Congress established the Troubled \n     Assets Relief Program (TARP) as part of the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act (Public 110-343; 122 Stat. 3765) \n     and allocated $700,000,000,000 for the purchase of toxic \n     assets from banks with the goal of restoring liquidity to the \n     financial sector and restarting the flow of credit in our \n     markets.\n       (2) The Department of Treasury, without consultation with \n     Congress, changed the purpose of TARP and began injecting \n     capital into financial institutions through a program called \n     the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) rather than purchasing \n     toxic assets.\n       (3) Lending by financial institutions was not noticeably \n     increased with the implementation of the CPP and the \n     expenditure of $250,000,000,000 of TARP funds, despite the \n     goal of the program.\n       (4) The recipients of amounts under the CPP are now faced \n     with additional restrictions related to accepting those \n     funds.\n       (5) A number of community banks and large financial \n     institutions have expressed their desire to return their CPP \n     funds to the Department of Treasury and the Department has \n     begun the process of accepting receipt of such funds.\n       (6) The Department of the Treasury should not unilaterally \n     determine how these returned funds are spent in the future \n     and the Congress should play a role in any determination of \n     future spending of funds returned through the TARP.\n\n     SEC. 23.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 108, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 108) commending Captain Richard \n     Phillips, the crew of the ``Maersk Alabama,'' and the United \n     States Armed Forces, recognizing the growing problem of \n     piracy off Somalia's coast, and urging the development of a \n     comprehensive strategy to address piracy and its root causes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today I have submitted--along with Senators Gregg of New \nHampshire, Feingold of Wisconsin, Kennedy and Kerry of Massachusetts, \nand, of course, my colleague, Senator Sanders of Vermont--a Senate \nresolution on Captain Richard Phillips, the ship captain from \nUnderhill, VT, who Somali pirates took hostage 2 weeks ago.\n  This resolution praises Captain Phillips for his selfless heroism--he \noffered himself in lieu of his crew as a hostage--his extraordinary \nrescuers, his family, and the Federal agencies that kept close watch on \nthe captain while the pirates held him literally at gunpoint in an 18-\nfoot lifeboat in the middle of the Indian Ocean.\n  This situation was an all too real drama that played out on the high \nseas. With grappling hooks and guns, Somali pirates took control of \nCaptain Phillips' ship, the Maersk Alabama. The 20-member crew of the \n500-foot container ship retook control after a harrowing struggle.\n  But to protect his crew from further danger, Captain Phillips agreed \nto go with the pirates into a lifeboat where he was held hostage at \ngunpoint for 5 days. Displaying a resourcefulness and the indomitable \nspirit that speaks to the best qualities of Vermont, New England, and \nour great Nation, he attempted to escape. He kept his cool and \nconfidence in the most volatile situation where the pirates, in a \nsecond, could have easily killed him.\n  The U.S. Navy arrived, headed up by the guided missile destroyer, USS \nBainbridge, and when the captain faced imminent danger, snipers from \none of our most elite military units, the Navy SEALs, killed his \ncaptors.\n  The entire country has shared feelings of admiration for the courage \nand fortitude of Captain Phillips, relief that he and his crew are \nsafely home, and gratitude for the outstanding performance of the U.S. \nNavy, particularly the Bainbridge crew and the SEALs, for their rescue \nof the captain.\n  The Maersk Alabama incident is part of a troubling pattern of piracy \nthat comes from the anarchy and the poverty plaguing Somalia. Pirates \nhave taken hostage more than 200 crew members in dozens of countries. \nThey have absconded with tens of millions of dollars in ransom, \nreinvesting that money into more advanced equipment and weapons, from \nguns to rocket-propelled grenades to global positioning systems.\n  The scale and intensity of the piracy is only getting worse, as this \nresolution underscores. This piracy has to be addressed.\n  But on that Wednesday, those pirates met their match, from Captain \nPhillips and his crew, to the remarkable Phillips family, to the \nformidable U.S. military, and the wider U.S. Government.\n  The President monitored the situation closely. He gave the necessary \ndirection to the SEALs to use force if required to protect Phillips. \nThe FBI provided guidance to the USS Bainbridge to deal with the \nhostage situation, while the Department of State kept the family \ninformed.\n  Andrea Phillips, Captain Phillips' wife, was incredible throughout \nthis crisis. I was receiving calls from the White House. I was told \nwhat was going on, as were my staff. I was calling Mrs. Phillips and \ntalking with her. And the calmness of this woman, realizing the \nharrowing danger that her husband faced, and her respect for our \nGovernment's efforts to save him were remarkable--she repeatedly \nthanked the Navy personnel, the FBI, and others for keeping such close \ntabs on the situation. Even though this was an especially difficult \nexperience for their two children, Daniel and Mariah, they weathered \nthe crisis and had a happy reunion.\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\n  I look forward to the next time I take the ferry boat across Lake \nChamplain and Daniel is piloting it. I think one of the happiest \nmoments was with several friends at Easter Mass on Easter Sunday. I \ntalked with the White House earlier that morning, and I knew that \nthings may come to a conclusion. But I turned my cell phone off while I \nwas at Mass. I came out and there was a message from the White House: \n``He is safe.'' At the top, ``He is safe.'' Then they filled me in on \nwhat happened.\n  I was telling my friends, my wife, Marcelle, who was with me. We were \nstanding there in the parking lot cheering, laughing, tears. People \nwere kind of looking at us wondering just what was going on. I called \nMrs. Phillips, and she had the same reaction. Later the President \ncalled her, as he called her husband. The reunions last week with the \ncrew arriving at Andrews Air Force Base, Captain Phillips stepping off \nthe plane at the Burlington, VT, airport were moments of joy and \nrelief.\n  The country is so proud of these Americans who certainly did not want \nto be at the center of an international crisis. But when they were, \nthey rose to the occasion with the strength and bravery that represent \nthe best of our country.\n  With this resolution, we commend Captain Phillips and his family, the \ncrew of the Maersk Alabama, the U.S. Armed Forces, and the Navy SEALs \nfor their heroism. This resolution has one message above all others: \nWelcome home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words on this \nresolution commending Captain Richard Phillips, the crew of the Maersk \nAlabama, and the U.S. Navy.\n  The resolution recognizes the growing problem of piracy in \ninternational waters off the coast of Somalia, a country that has been \nwithout a functioning central government since 1991.\n  The resulting lawlessness and the desperate humanitarian situation \nhave turned the area into a base for pirate operations.\n  Earlier this month, Somali pirates used grappling hooks and weapons \nto board the cargo ship captained by Richard Phillips, who lives with \nhis family in Underhill, VT. He led a crew of 19 on the vessel that was \ndelivering food aid to starving people in eastern Africa.\n  Captain Phillips bravely led the crew in retaking control of the ship \nby offering himself as a hostage in exchange for the release of his \ncrew.\n  Four pirates then took Captain Phillips into an 18-foot lifeboat, \nheld him captive at gunpoint, and repeatedly threatened to kill him.\n  On Easter Sunday, Captain Phillips was rescued by Navy SEALs who \ndetermined that Captain Phillips was in imminent danger and took the \nlives of three of his pirate captors.\n  The people of Vermont are proud of the extraordinary courage of \nCaptain Phillips, the dignity of his family under great stress and the \noutstanding performance of the U.S. Navy and other governmental \npersonnel in rescuing Richard and dispatching those who apprehended \nhim.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Captain Phillips of Underhill, VT, held \nhostage by Somalians, where his own courage allowed the release of his \ncrew, and the courage of the U.S. Navy and the courage of our military \nand the courage of our leadership, at the White House, the Department \nof Defense, and elsewhere brought about his release.\n  The Phillips family is a wonderful family. They live in a small and \nbeautiful town in Vermont. There are few things that unite everybody. I \ncan say as a lifelong Vermonter, I know my State is united in pride for \nCaptain Phillips. All of us felt our prayers were answered on Easter \nSunday when we received word that he was safe and was going back home. \nI know how much it meant to me to pick up the phone and call Mrs. \nPhillips, and the day before he arrived back home, to call her up and \nwish her a happy birthday and say: The best birthday present this \nNation can give you is tomorrow afternoon at the Burlington Airport \nwhen your husband will arrive.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 108) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 108\n\n       Whereas Somalia has been without a functioning central \n     government since 1991, resulting in lawlessness and an \n     increasingly desperate humanitarian situation;\n       Whereas according to a Somali human rights group, violence \n     during the period from 2007 to 2009 has killed an estimated \n     16,000 people, wounded more than 28,000 people, and displaced \n     more than 1,000,000 people;\n       Whereas these grim conditions and the absence of a \n     functioning government have made Somalia an ideal base for \n     piracy operations and a fertile ground for terrorist \n     organizations, including the group al-Shabaab, whose leaders \n     have ties to al-Qaeda;\n       Whereas acts of piracy off the coast of Somalia have been \n     on the rise for more than a year, with the International \n     Maritime Bureau reporting an estimated 111 attacks in 2008;\n       Whereas on Wednesday, April 8, 2009, Somali pirates used \n     grappling hooks and weapons to board the Norfolk, Virginia-\n     based container ship Maersk Alabama, which was captained by \n     Richard Phillips, a resident of Underhill, Vermont, and \n     crewed by 19 other citizens of the United States, and which \n     was delivering food aid from the World Food Programme to \n     hungry people in east Africa;\n       Whereas Captain Phillips, a native of Winchester, \n     Massachusetts and a 1979 graduate of the Massachusetts \n     Maritime Academy, bravely led the Maersk Alabama crew in \n     successfully retaking control of the ship by offering himself \n     as a hostage in exchange for the release of the crew;\n       Whereas 4 pirates took Captain Phillips into an 18-foot \n     lifeboat, held him captive at gunpoint, and repeatedly \n     threatened to kill him;\n       Whereas the United States Central Command dispatched to the \n     scene the destroyer U.S.S. Bainbridge, which was joined in \n     subsequent days by the U.S.S. Halyburton and the U.S.S. \n     Boxer, along with Navy SEAL teams, Marine Corps helicopters, \n     and other joint assets of the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas hostage recovery experts from the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigations gave guidance to the crew of the U.S.S. \n     Bainbridge, while the Department of State stayed in contact \n     with Captain Phillips' family, including Phillips' wife \n     Andrea and their 2 children, Daniel and Mariah, in Underhill, \n     Vermont;\n       Whereas Maersk Limited, based in Norfolk, Virginia, worked \n     diligently with the United States Armed Forces to try to \n     obtain the release of Captain Phillips and the Maersk Alabama \n     crew and to move the ship safely to port in Kenya, while \n     sending personal representatives to Vermont to keep the \n     Phillips family informed;\n       Whereas in the late evening of April 9, 2009, Captain \n     Phillips made an escape attempt, jumping into the water of \n     the Indian Ocean to swim for safety, only to be pursued by \n     the pirates and quickly recaptured;\n       Whereas the President received regular briefings on the \n     hostage crisis and provided the authority necessary for the \n     United States Armed Forces to resolve it;\n       Whereas on April 12, 2009, Easter Sunday, Captain Phillips \n     was rescued after the United States Armed Forces, which \n     throughout the crisis spared no effort to defuse the \n     situation and peacefully rescue Phillips, took the lives of 3 \n     of the pirate captors when Phillips was seen to be in \n     imminent danger; and\n       Whereas international commerce remains under threat while \n     Somali pirates continue to hold for ransom more than 200 crew \n     members of many nationalities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Captain Phillips deserves the respect and admiration of \n     all people of the United States for his brave conduct under \n     life-threatening circumstances;\n       (2) the Senate shares the sense of relief and gratitude \n     felt by the family and shipmates of Captain Phillips;\n       (3) all members of the United States Armed Forces involved \n     in the rescue operation, in particular members of the Navy \n     and Navy SEAL teams who rescued Captain Phillips, the \n     officials of other Federal Government departments and \n     agencies who contributed, and the crew of the Maersk Alabama, \n     are to be commended for their exceptional efforts and \n     devotion to duty; and\n       (4) the President should work with the international \n     community and the transitional government of Somalia to \n     develop a comprehensive strategy to address both the \n     burgeoning problem of piracy and its root causes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4597-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4597-S4598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA TAR HEELS\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 18, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 18) supporting the \n     goals and ideals of World Malaria Day, and reaffirming United \n     States leadership and support for efforts to combat malaria.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this Saturday, I will join individuals \nand organizations around the world in marking World Malaria Day. This \nday is an opportunity to celebrate the progress that has been made by \nthe international community in raising awareness of an invisible killer \nand the need to significantly reduce malaria deaths. Over the last \ndecade, there has been a remarkable scaling up of efforts to prevent \nand treat this disease. In some places, such as the island of Zanzibar \nor the country of Rwanda, malaria prevalence has dropped significantly \nin just a few years. These success stories are a testament to the kind \nof positive difference we can make with robust and targeted health \nassistance.\n  I am especially proud of the leadership of the United States in this \nregard, particularly through the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). \nSince its launch in 2005, PMI has purchased almost 13 million \nartemisinin-based combination therapies, protected over 17 million \npeople through spraying campaigns, and distributed over 6 million \ninsecticide-treated bed nets. In addition, the United States has worked \nmultilaterally with international partners to fight this disease, \nthrough the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The \nGlobal Fund has provided roughly 74 million malaria patients with \nartemisinin-based combination therapies and distributed almost 70 \nmillion bed nets.\n  In addition to commemorating how far we have come, World Malaria Day \nis also an opportunity to recognize how far we still need to go. This \ndisease is completely preventable and treatable, and yet more than 40 \npercent of the world's population is still at risk of contracting \nmalaria and nearly 1 million people, the majority of them children, die \nfrom malaria each year. According to the World Health Organization, a \nchild still dies every 30 seconds from malaria. Nearly 90 percent of \nthose deaths occur in Africa. Moreover, malaria often coexists with HIV \nand neglected tropical diseases, and it causes great risks to efforts \nto promote child and maternal health.\n  In light of those realities, we must recommit to sustained \ninternational, national, and local leadership to end malaria deaths. I \nam pleased that Congress last year committed over the next 5 years to \ncombat malaria in the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria Act. We must now deliver on \nthat commitment, including maintaining our support for multilateral \nefforts of the Global Fund. At the same time, we cannot afford to \naddress malaria in isolation; our efforts must be part of a \ncomprehensive, integrated and sustainable approach to global health. In \nparticular, I believe we need to invest more in strengthening local \nhealth systems that can deliver effective, safe, high-quality \ninterventions when and where they are needed and ensure access to \nreliable health information and effective disease surveillance.\n  I commend the thousands of Americans and the many organizations that \nhave taken up this cause and continue to work to fight malaria and save \nlives.\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\nOn Saturday, we should join them in committing to work toward a \nmalaria-free future. To that end and in support of the World Malaria \nDay, I have introduced a resolution with Senators Isakson, Bingaman, \nDurbin, Cardin, Wicker, Brownback, and Cantwell reaffirming U.S. \nleadership for efforts to combat malaria. I hope our colleagues will \nsupport this resolution and, more importantly, join us over the coming \nmonths and years in working toward this year's theme: ``counting \nmalaria out.''\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate, and any statements related to the measure be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 18) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 18\n\n       Whereas April 25 of each year is recognized internationally \n     as World Malaria Day and in the United States as Malaria \n     Awareness Day;\n       Whereas, despite malaria being completely preventable and \n     treatable and the fact that malaria was eliminated in the \n     United States over 50 years ago, more than 40 percent of the \n     world's population is still at risk of contracting malaria;\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, nearly \n     1,000,000 people die from malaria each year, the vast \n     majority of whom are children under the age of 5 in Africa;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, with a child \n     dying from malaria roughly every 30 seconds and nearly 3,000 \n     children dying from malaria every day;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal health, \n     causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth \n     weights, with estimates by the Center for Disease Control and \n     Prevention that malaria infection causes 400,000 cases of \n     severe maternal anemia and from 75,000 to 200,000 infant \n     deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas HIV infection increases the risk and severity of \n     malarial illness, and malaria increases the viral load in \n     HIV-positive people, which can lead to increased transmission \n     of HIV and more rapid disease progression, with substantial \n     public health implications;\n       Whereas in malarial regions, many people are co-infected \n     with malaria and one or more of the neglected tropical \n     diseases (NTDs) such as hookworm and schistosomiasis, which \n     causes a pronounced exacerbation of anemia and several \n     adverse health consequences;\n       Whereas the malnutrition and chronic illness that result \n     from childhood malaria leads to increased absenteeism in \n     school and perpetuates cycles of poverty;\n       Whereas an estimated 90 percent of deaths from malaria \n     occur in Africa, and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership \n     estimates that malaria costs countries in Africa \n     $12,000,000,000 in lost economic productivity each year;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that \n     malaria accounts for 40 percent of healthcare expenditures in \n     high-burden countries, demonstrating that effective, long-\n     term malaria control is inextricably linked to the strength \n     of health systems;\n       Whereas heightened efforts over recent years to prevent and \n     treat malaria are currently saving lives;\n       Whereas the progress and funding to control malaria has \n     increased ten-fold since 2000, in large part due to funding \n     under the President's Malaria Initiative (a United States \n     Government initiative designed to cut malaria deaths in half \n     in target countries in sub-Saharan Africa), the Global Fund \n     to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank, and \n     new financing by other donors;\n       Whereas the President's Malaria Initiative has purchased \n     almost 13,000,000 artemisinin-based combination therapies \n     (ACT), protected over 17,000,000 people through spraying \n     campaigns, and distributed over 6,000,000 insecticide-treated \n     bed nets, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n     Malaria has distributed 70,000,000 bed nets to protect \n     families from malaria and provided 74,000,000 malaria \n     patients with ACTs, and the World Bank's Booster Program is \n     scheduled to commit approximately $500,000,000 in \n     International Development Association funds for malaria \n     control in Africa;\n       Whereas public and private partners are developing \n     effective and affordable drugs to treat malaria, with more \n     than 23 types of malaria vaccines in development;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, vector control, or the prevention of malaria \n     transmission via anopheles mosquitoes, which includes a \n     combination of methods such as insecticide-treated bed nets, \n     indoor residual spraying, and source reduction (larval \n     control), has been shown to reduce severe morbidity and \n     mortality due to malaria in endemic regions;\n       Whereas the impact of malaria efforts have been documented \n     in numerous regions, such as in Zanzibar, where malaria \n     prevalence among children shrank from 20 percent to less than \n     1 percent between 2005 and 2007, and in Rwanda, where malaria \n     cases and deaths appeared to decline rapidly after a large-\n     scale distribution of bed nets and malaria treatments in \n     2006; and\n       Whereas a malaria-free future will rely on consistent \n     international, national, and local leadership and a \n     comprehensive approach addressing the range of health, \n     development, and economic challenges facing developing \n     countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Malaria Awareness Day, \n     including the achievable target of ending malaria deaths by \n     2015;\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     Malaria Awareness Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, \n     and activities to raise awareness and support to save the \n     lives of those affected by malaria;\n       (3) reaffirms the goals and commitments to combat malaria \n     in the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \n     Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-293);\n       (4) commends the progress made by anti-malaria programs, \n     including the President's Malaria Initiative and the Global \n     Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       (5) reaffirms United States support for and contribution \n     toward the achievement of the targets set by the Roll Back \n     Malaria Partnership Global Malaria Action plan;\n       (6) encourages fellow donor nations to maintain their \n     support and honor their funding commitments for malaria \n     programs worldwide;\n       (7) urges greater integration of United States and \n     international health programs targeting malaria, HIV/AIDS, \n     tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases, and basic child \n     and maternal health; and\n       (8) commits to continued United States leadership in \n     efforts to reduce global malaria deaths, especially through \n     strengthening health care systems that can deliver effective, \n     safe, high-quality interventions when and where they are \n     needed and assure access to reliable health information and \n     effective disease surveillance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4599-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nyielding to me and I also thank him for reading into the Record the \napproval of the nomination of Tammy Duckworth as Assistant Secretary of \nPublic and Intergovernmental Affairs for the Veterans' Administration. \nShe is going to have an exceptional responsibility as the chief \ncommunicator for the VA, but I cannot think of a better person to fill \nthat job.\n  Tammy Duckworth's life is one of service to her country. She was born \ninto a military family. The daughter of a marine, she is a second \ngeneration Purple Heart recipient.\n  Tammy started her own military career by joining ROTC in graduate \nschool. She was commissioned in the Army Reserve in 1992. After \ncompleting helicopter flight school, she joined the Illinois National \nGuard in 1996.\n  In 2004, Tammy was a doctoral student when she made a personal \nrequest to be deployed to Iraq. On the afternoon of November 12, 2004, \nshe was on her last mission of the day flying a helicopter for the \nIllinois National Guard in Baghdad. Her Blackhawk helicopter was struck \nby a rocket-propelled grenade that ripped through the cockpit and hit \nTammy in the legs. Not realizing the degree of her injuries, she tried \nto assist her copilot in landing the damaged aircraft.\n  Once on the ground, her crew loaded Tammy onto a second helicopter. \nTammy's next memory was waking up at Walter Reed with her husband, \nBryan Bowlsbey, also a member of the Illinois National Guard, by the \nside of her bed. She learned then that the incident in that helicopter \nhad cost her both of her legs and shattered her right arm.\n  Well, 10 weeks later, after that horrendous experience, I met Tammy \nDuckworth. Each year, the President gives a State of the Union Address, \nand it has been my tradition to invite Illinois soldiers and sailors \nand airmen and marines who are recuperating in local military hospitals \nas my guests. That year, they told me there was a MAJ Tammy Duckworth \nfrom the Illinois National Guard who would join me. I will never forget \nit. She was in a wheelchair and in full dress uniform, with both legs \nmissing, her arm in a sling, and her husband behind the wheelchair, and \nshe had a big smile on her face. She came in and introduced herself. We \ngot to know one another and spoke. We left my office then and went to \nan adjoining office for a press conference, where I introduced my guest \nto the Illinois press.\n  A number of people showed up from the Illinois media, and one was a \nfriend of mine, a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times, Lynn Sweet. Lynn \nasked a hard question--an important one, but a very hard question for \nsomeone who is a disabled veteran having lost both of her legs in \ncombat just a few weeks ago. Lynn asked of Major Duckworth: What do you \nthink of those people who object to this war and complain that we never \nshould have been in this war in the first place? What do you think of \nthose who protest that this war should not have ever started?\n  Tammy paused for a moment and said: Isn't that why we are fighting \nthis war, so that people in America can express their point of view \nregardless of whether they agree with this Government or not?\n  I was breathless at the end of that. I thought I cannot believe that \nanswer from a woman who has been through what she had been through. I \ncaught my breath and said: Are there any other questions? No. \nAfterward, I told Tammy that was the most amazing answer I can ever \nrecall hearing from anybody. We had a good evening. I took her down to \nthe Senate dinner before the State of the Union Address and introduced \nher to many colleagues, including John McCain, Tom Harkin, Danny \nInouye, and many others. She was my guest at the State of the Union \nAddress. I kept in touch with her.\n  Tammy went through rehab. The Walter Reed Military Hospital did an \nextraordinary job fitting her with computer-assisted legs so she could \nwalk with crutches. She made a miraculous recovery. I kept in touch for \nthe next several months, and when I visited Walter Reed, a lot of those \nbuff marines, who had lost a limb, said every time they were grunting \nand groaning and weren't sure they could go forward, somebody would \nsay, ``Come on, Tammy,'' and they would keep pushing forward. She \nbecame an inspiration to everybody. At the time, she was the most \nseriously injured woman veteran in the Iraq war.\n  I kept in touch with her, and a few months later I called her with a \nrather bold suggestion. I said: Tammy, have you ever thought about \nrunning for office? She said: Never. I said: Would you consider it? We \nhave a vacancy in a congressional seat in Illinois where you live. She \ncalled me back and said: Bryan and I have a lot of questions to ask. I \nsaid I would be glad to try to answer them.\n  At the end of the day, she became a candidate for Congress--just 13 \nmonths after she had been shot down over Iraq. She ran a spirited \ncampaign. She did not succeed, but she brought together the most \namazing group of friends and supporters and volunteers I had ever seen. \nShe was asked to head up the Illinois Veterans Affairs Department, \nwhere she did a terrific job. She started several first-in-the-Nation \nprograms in that department: the Illinois Warrior Assistance Program, \nrequiring additional screening for PTSD and traumatic brain injury; the \nGI Loan for Heroes Mortgage Loan Program; the VetsCash grant program, \nwhich provided over $5 million in grants to service organizations; and \nVeterans Adaptive Activities Day, bringing together Illinois \norganizations specializing in adaptive recreations and sports.\n  Tammy is so self-sufficient and independent, it is hard to believe. \nShe has her own pickup truck, which she likes to motor around in, which \nis all set up for her to use. She is so independent that the time came \nwhen her husband was activated to serve in Iraq, and instead of asking \nfor special consideration because she would have been left alone in her \nrehabilitative state, she said: He wants to serve, and he should. He \nleft for a year, and she kept things together while he was gone. She \ndid a great job in the process.\n  When President Obama was elected, he called on Tammy to bring her \nethic and record of public service to Washington. I know she is going \nto do a great job.\n  She was an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran. She knows the \ndifficulties servicemembers can face in the battlefield. As a recipient \nof VA military care at Walter Reed, you can bet the patients won't have \na stronger advocate in the VA and for the VA facilities themselves. She \nuses them today and understands the frustration bureaucracies can \ncreate. She will be a real fighter for veterans. She has the \nperspective of somebody who has worked with and for veterans and is one \nherself.\n  As the spouse of a servicemember who deployed to combat, she \ncertainly\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nknows what families go through when that happens.\n  In nominating Tammy Duckworth, President Obama knew he was getting a \ncommitted veterans advocate. She will be a strong voice for veterans. \nAt the hearing the other day before Senators Akaka and Burr, I know she \nmade a dramatic impression when she gave her testimony. She is the kind \nof person I am proud to count as a friend. I am so honored that she \nserved our country. She has shown extraordinary heroism throughout her \nlife, and she will show it in her record of public service with the VA, \nand she will show that the trust President Obama put in her was well \nplaced.\n  We all look forward to working with Tammy as she enters a new phase \nof service to our Nation and our veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/22/senate-section/article/S4601-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
