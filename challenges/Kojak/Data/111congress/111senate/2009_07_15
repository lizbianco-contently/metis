Schumer, Harry Reid.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Levin will give an explanation as to \nwhy the amendment was withdrawn. But my friend, the Republican leader, \nhas the first right of recognition.\n\n\n                      Health Care Week VI, Day III\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as Republicans and Democrats debate the \nbest way to reform health care, Americans are increasingly concerned \nabout the price tag and about who gets stuck with the bill. The Federal \ndeficit suddenly stands at more than $1 trillion for the first time in \nhistory, and so far this year we are spending about $500 million a day \nin interest alone on the national debt. It is as if every single \nAmerican gets up in the morning, walks over to the window, and tosses \n$2 out into the wind every day for the next 10 years. It is not a bad \nanalogy, but that is what we are doing. And now the advocates of a \ngovernment takeover of health care are talking about spending trillions \nmore.\n  So Americans are worried about cost--and they have good reason to be.\n  Not only are we in a tough situation fiscally, we have no idea how \nmuch this reform will really cost. We know from experience with \ngovernment-run programs like Medicare and Medicaid that early estimates \noften grossly underestimate what they end up costing. We know that some \nof the estimates we are hearing about health care reform are \nmisleading. And we also know that the administration is building up a \nsubstantial track record of its own of dubious predictions that it has \nused to sell its ideas to the public.\n  We saw it with the stimulus. In selling one of the most expensive \npieces of legislation in history, the administration said it had to be \npassed right away, with almost no scrutiny. If we did not pass it right \naway, they said, the economy would collapse.\n  Here is what the President said about the importance of passing the \nstimulus bill as quickly as possible: ``If we don't act immediately, \nthen millions more jobs will disappear, the national unemployment rates \nwill approach double digits, more people will lose their homes and \ntheir health care, and our nation will sink into a crisis that at some \npoint is going to be that much tougher to reverse.''\n  As it turns out, the administration overpromised.\n  They predicted the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate from \napproaching double digits. We passed the stimulus, and unemployment is \nnow approaching double digits. It was supposed to keep millions of jobs \nfrom disappearing. We passed it, and since then we have lost more than \n2 million jobs. It was supposed to save or create between 3 and 4 \nmillion jobs. We passed it, and now the administration is backpedaling \non that prediction too. Now it\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\nsays it is ``very hard to say'' how many jobs have been saved or \ncreated. The stimulus was supposed to have an immediate impact. We \npassed it, and it has not. Despite all the predictions about its effect \non the economy, the administration now says it expects unemployment to \ncontinue to rise in the months ahead.\n  Now, in an attempt to pass an even costlier and far-reaching \ngovernment action, a government takeover of health care, the \nadministration is making similarly aggressive claims about the dangers \nof not approving its plan.\n  The administration says that if we do not pass its health care \nproposal then the economy will get even worse. It says that if we do \nnot approve its health care proposal then the quality of everyone's \nhealth care will be jeopardized. It says that if we do not pass this \ntrillion dollar bill now, then we will miss out on a chance to save \nmoney on health care down the road.\n  I do not know if these claims are accurate, and I do not believe the \nadministration is making these claims in bad faith. But I do know that \nAmericans got burned on the stimulus, and I know that some in the \nadministration have said that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. So \nat the very least, Americans have a right to be skeptical about the \nadministration's latest effort to rush through a major piece of \nlegislation without allowing us to evaluate it. It is a worthwhile \nquestion: Why does the administration say we have to send them a bill \nthat would essentially nationalize one-sixth of the U.S. economy when \nmany parts of the legislation itself would not even go into effect for \nanother 4 years?\n  Americans are right to be skeptical when administration officials say \nwe cannot fix the economy without fixing health care, or that the \nDemocrat plan for health care will not cause people to lose their \ncurrent insurance when the CBO says it will, or that a government-run \ntakeover of health care will not add to the ballooning national debt. \nAfter the stimulus, Americans have a right to be skeptical about all \nthese claims, especially when they are told these reforms have to \nhappen quickly, and especially when our experience with Medicare and \nMedicaid and government health care at the State level shows us that \ninitial estimates and predictions can be way off the mark.\n  Senator Collins, for example, has discussed the problems they have \nhad in Maine as a result of its attempt to create a government-run \nhealth plan, of what a disappointment that has been. Six years ago, \nMaine instituted Dirigo Health as a government option after advocates \nmade the same promises about what it would do to bring down costs and \nincrease access that the advocates of a nationwide government health \nplan are making right now in Washington.\n  Yet 6 years later, the Dirigo experiment has turned out to be a \ncolossal, and extremely costly, failure. Despite initial promises, it \nhas not covered most of the uninsured. And yet it has led to higher \ntaxes on thousands of Maine residents who were already struggling to \npay for private coverage. In short: Dirigo turned out to cause the same \nproblems in Maine that some of us are predicting for all Americans if \nCongress rushes to approve a national government plan.\n  Americans want us to take the time necessary to make health care less \nexpensive and more accessible, while preserving what they like about \nour system. Americans want health care reform, but they do not want to \ngive a green light to a reform that only ends up costing them more for \nworse care than they currently have. The fact that Americans are \nincreasingly concerned about how much health care reform is going to \ncost should not be a reason to rush. It should be a reason for us to \ntake the time to get it right.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, to explain where we are, let me take a few \nminutes, first of all, on the procedures. Then I want to go back and \nmake some comments about the Levin-McCain amendment, which will come \nback. This is temporarily withdrawn because we could not get to a vote.\n  The bottom line is we were here all day yesterday. We attempted \nrepeatedly to obtain an agreement as to when we could vote on the \nLevin-McCain amendment.\n  We had a lot of time yesterday for people to make speeches. We had \ntime the day before. We have time anytime. But we have to get to a vote \non that amendment.\n  The reason we were not able to get to a vote is because of the next \namendment, which the majority leader indicated is going to be taken up \non this bill, the so-called hate crimes amendment. We have a law \nrelative to hate crimes. This had been an important amendment to the \nlaw to add a group who had been left out, two groups previously left \nout of the existing hate crimes law. It would have also had an \nimportant definition of Federal interest in this hate crimes \nlegislation.\n  Hate crimes legislation is not new. This body had approved hate \ncrimes legislation a couple years ago on the Defense authorization \nbill. The argument was made at that time that the hate crimes bill \nshould not be offered on a Defense authorization bill. Senator Kennedy \noffered hate crimes legislation a couple years ago on the Defense \nauthorization bill. The debate was extensive at that time as to why on \nthis bill.\n  The reason it was offered on this bill is obvious. This is \nlegislation. The Senate rules allow for amendments such as hate crimes \nor any other amendment to be offered on legislation that is pending \nbefore the Senate. The minority has offered many nonrelevant amendments \nthis year on legislation. On the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, there was an amendment relative to ACORN. On the DC voting rights \nbill, there were amendments relative to guns and to the fairness \ndoctrine. On and on and on. The Senate rules permit nongermane, \nnonrelevant amendments to be offered to pending legislation. It is not \nat all new. The opportunity to do that has been taken by many of us \nthis year, last year, the year before and, I am sure, next year. First, \nit is not new. It is common in the Senate to offer amendments which are \nnot relevant to a bill that is pending. That is allowed under our \nrules.\n  The hate crimes amendment is an important amendment. I don't think \nanybody would deny the importance of this amendment. With hate crimes \ngoing up in the United States, it is critically important we strengthen \nour hate crimes law. There are Senators who oppose the amendment. That \nis the reason we are here, to debate, to argue for or to argue against. \nBut I don't think one can argue it is uncommon, unusual or improper to \noffer nonrelevant amendments to legislation which is pending. \nRegardless of one's position on hate crimes, it is very difficult to \nargue it is not significant legislation.\n  Thirdly, as Senator Kennedy so powerfully argued--and those of us who \njoined with him a few years ago on this amendment surely agreed--the \nvalues that are involved in this legislation, the effort to make \nAmerica a better place, a place freer of hate crimes, surely is one of \nthe values our men and women put their uniforms on and fight for. The \ncloser we can come to a society which is freer of hate crimes, the \nbetter off we are internally, the closer we will live up to what we \nstand for in our basic fundamental documents and our history. It is \nwhat men and women who fight for the United States and carry out their \nmissions are fighting for--not just physical threats to this country \nbut for the values for which we stand, for freedom from hate, for \ndiversity, for freedom from intimidation and violence based on one's \nreligion, ethnicity or the other attributes listed in the hate crimes \nlegislation.\n  It is important legislation. It relates to the values of this \ncountry, values which our men and women take such risks for when they \ngo into harm's way. The rules of this body allow for it.\n  Somehow or other, the fact that we were going to proceed to a hate \ncrimes amendment on this bill, even whether it was next in line or \nwhether it was down the line in terms of amendments, the fact that it \nwas made clear that, again, on a Defense authorization bill, as we have \nin the past, in the past with 60 Members of this body supporting it, \nthe fact that that was made known in an open and honest way to Members \nof this body apparently precipitated a determination on the part of \nsome that they not allow us to get to a vote on the pending Levin-\nMcCain amendment. That prospect, that open statement\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\nthat there would be a hate crimes amendment offered on this bill became \nthe impediment, apparently, from all we can determine, to our getting \nagreement for a time for a vote on Levin-McCain.\n  The question is, How to remove that impediment. There were two \nchoices: Either agree not to offer the hate crimes amendment or remove \nthe impediment. We have to now remove the impediment. There is not a \nwillingness on the part of a significant number of Senators--and I \nbelieve a majority--not to offer a hate crimes amendment. It is pending \nlegislation that is before us.\n  The amendment is an important amendment. It has been offered before. \nThere is precedent for offering it on the Defense authorization bill. \nThe rules allow for it, so we don't need a precedent, but there is a \nprecedent for doing so. There are dozens of precedents for offering \nnonrelevant amendments to legislation which is pending before the \nSenate.\n  We will come back, obviously, to the Levin-McCain amendment. The \nLevin-McCain amendment is a very important amendment on this bill. We \nhave to deal with the decision of the Armed Services Committee, on a \nclose vote, to add F-22 planes, which uniformed and civilian leaders of \nthe military indicate they do not want and do not need and we cannot \nafford. We have had some debate. We had plenty of time for others to \ndebate it. Everyone who wanted to speak on the subject, I believe, had \nmore than enough opportunity to do so. Last night we heard from the \nSenator from Georgia as to his reasons for offering the amendment in \ncommittee to add the additional F-22s. I compliment the Senator from \nGeorgia for all the hard work he has done on our committee. It is \nanother example of how the Armed Services Committee works together. Our \nPresiding Officer is a distinguished member of the committee so he \nknows this firsthand, how we work together, guided by one basic \nprinciple: for the good of the Nation, for the good of the men and \nwomen in the armed services. We disagree, obviously, on the Levin-\nMcCain amendment. There is surely, however, agreement that our \nintentions are always to adhere to that principle--what is best for our \nNation, what is best for the men and women who put on the uniform of \nthe Nation.\n  So while there was committee disagreement and disagreement on this \nfloor on the question of whether additional F-22s should be produced, \nthe disagreement is not along party lines and rarely, if ever, is along \nparty lines on the Armed Services Committee. I wish to, again, \ncompliment not only the Senator from Georgia but also other members of \nthe committee for sticking to that very important principle.\n  I also agree with something the Senator from Georgia said last night \nrelative to another of our operating principles. We have the right and \nthe duty to challenge assumptions made in the bill sent to us by any \nadministration and to act in accordance with our best judgment about \nwhat is right and what is in the best interests of the Nation. We are \nnot a rubberstamp to every proposal offered by the executive branch. \nThe Congress, hopefully, never will be.\n  The Senator from Georgia pointed out a number of cases where we have \nacted as anything but a rubberstamp to a budget request. We added \nfunds, for instance, in this bill for a larger pay raise than the \nexecutive branch requested to honor the service of the men and women in \nthe military who have been bearing an extraordinarily heavy burden for \nthe country fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. We added $1.2 billion for \na more mobile variant of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, \ncalled the MRAP. This MRAP variant is called the MRAP all-terrain \nvehicle. The reason we did this is because we knew there was an \nemerging requirement for these new vehicles to support our forces in \nAfghanistan that had not been reflected in the budget request. I don't \nbelieve any member of the Armed Services Committee or any Member of \nthis body should act as a rubberstamp for any budget request, and the \nevidence will show over and over again, year after year, that our \ncommittee does not act as a rubberstamp.\n  The question on the Levin-McCain amendment is whether we are right, \nthat the leadership of our military, both civilian and uniformed, made \na sound judgment when they, similar to their predecessors in the Bush \nadministration, determined that we should end production of the F-22. \nThe debate is not about whether we will have the capability of the F-\n22. It is a debate about how many F-22 aircraft we should have and at \nwhat cost.\n\n  We are talking about whether we will accept the recommendation of two \nCommanders in Chief, two Secretaries of Defense, plus the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff and their chairmen, that 187 F-22s is all we need, all we can \nafford, and all we should buy. Senator McCain and I have made a number \nof arguments about why we believe stopping the F-22 program at 187 is \nthe right thing to do. I will not repeat all those arguments now, \nparticularly since we have temporarily withdrawn the amendment. But it \nis important that I clarify promptly a number of points made by the \nSenator from Georgia during the debate yesterday so they do not remain \nuncontested.\n  First, the Senator said that the Air Force had not been involved in \nany of the studies that led to determining that 187 F-22s was the \ncorrect number of aircraft to buy. A few days ago, the committee heard \ncontrary testimony from the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nthat there are at least two studies that support the department's plans \nfor tactical aviation, including stopping F-22 production, including a \nrecently completed study.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       There is a study in the Joint Staff that we just completed \n     and partnered with the Air Force on that, number one, said \n     that proliferating within the United States military fifth-\n     generation fighters to all three services was going to be \n     more significant than having them based solidly in just one \n     service, because of the way we deploy and because of the \n     diversity of our deployments.\n\n  So the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs referred to a recent study \nthat led to the conclusion that Senator McCain and I support. That \nstudy was partnered with the Air Force, unlike what was stated last \nnight by the Senator from Georgia that these studies did not have Air \nForce involvement.\n  There is a strong analytical underpinning for the decision of the \nadministration, including the Air Force. A letter from the Secretary of \nthe Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on this matter is \none underpinning, one of the strong evidences that that conclusion is \ncorrect. The letter is already part of the record so I will quote \nbriefly from it. The Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff \nof the Air Force concluded in part, as follows:\n\n       In summary, we assessed the F-22 decision from all angles, \n     taking into account competing strategic priorities and \n     complementary programs and alternatives, all balanced within \n     the context of available resources. We did not and do not \n     recommended that F-22s be included in the FY10 defense \n     budget. This is a difficult decision, but one with which we \n     are comfortable.\n\n  That is from the letter of the Secretary of the Air Force and the \nChief of Staff of the Air Force, so it should make very clear what the \nAir Force's position is on the matter.\n  On another matter that was raised by the Senator from Georgia last \nnight, listening to his arguments, one might conclude that the F-22 is \nthe only aircraft we have or are planning to have that could operate \neffectively in the presence of very capable enemy surface-to-air \nmissile systems. But the Department has provided contrary evidence. In \nhis letter to myself and Senator McCain on July 13, the Secretary of \nDefense said the following:\n\n       . . . the F-35 is a half generation newer aircraft than the \n     F-22, and more capable in a number of areas such as \n     electronic warfare and combating enemy air defenses. To \n     sustain U.S. overall air dominance, the Department's plan is \n     to buy roughly 500 F-35s over the next five years and more \n     than 2,400 over the life of the program.\n\n  The key words in that sentence by the Secretary of the Defense in his \nletter is that there will be a ``more capable'' aircraft in the F-35 \nthan the F-22 ``in a number of areas such as . . . combating enemy air \ndefenses.''\n  I think we all agree our military needs to maintain air dominance. \nBut as the Secretary's letter points out, the F-22 aircraft is not the \nonly aircraft the Department is relying upon to contribute to making \nthat air dominance a reality. In fact, in certain areas, such as \nelectronic warfare and combating surface-to-air missiles, the \nDepartment of Defense is counting on\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\nthe F-35 fleet to meet those missions with greater effectiveness even \nthan with the F-22.\n  The Senator from Georgia, last night, argued that proposing cuts in a \nnumber of areas--just like the committee 13-to-11 vote indicated and \nhis proposal accomplished--that shifting funds to the F-22 program and \nshifting money from other areas was not doing any harm to other \nprograms within the Defense Department.\n  I have previously talked about the specifics relative to this issue, \nand I wish to summarize the difference on this point very briefly, as, \nagain, we will be coming back to this issue. It is withdrawn \ntemporarily, but, obviously, we will return to this issue and resolve \nthis issue prior to the determination of this bill.\n  First, we did not assume any first-year savings from acquisition \nreform or business process reengineering. Both these initiatives will \nyield savings. The Senator from Arizona and I, and with the support of \nour colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, all unanimously \nsupported acquisition reform.\n  At the time we adopted that, and at the time the President signed our \nbill, we indicated there will be significant savings from reforming the \nacquisition system. But those savings do not occur in 2010. Nobody has \nalleged, and there is no support for any conclusion, that savings from \nacquisition reform are going to occur in the first year it is in \neffect. As a matter of fact, its main thrust is to apply to new weapons \nsystems to make sure their technologies, for instance, are mature so we \ndo not end up producing equipment that has technologies incorporated in \nit that have not been adequately tested.\n  So we are not going to see savings in fiscal year 2010, as the \nSenator from Georgia assumed in his amendment that was adopted barely \nby the committee to fund the F-22 add-on. The result is $500 million he \nassumed from savings ends up as across-the-board real program cuts.\n  I also would point out that the cost estimate of S. 1390 that we just \nreceived from the Congressional Budget Office did not assume any \nsavings from those initiatives. Those, again, were savings which helped \nto fund the additional F-22s--alleged savings. They are phantom savings \nin the first year.\n  Secondly, on the operation and maintenance reductions that were used \nto fund the F-22 add, the original committee position on this matter--\nO, operation and maintenance reductions--was developed consistent \nwith the Government Accountability Office analysis. The reductions, \nhowever, that were taken in operation and maintenance by the Senator \nfrom Georgia when he offered this amendment in committee to add the F-\n22s go far beyond what was indicated by the Government Accountability \nOffice's analysis and far beyond what is prudent.\n  Finally, relative to the offsets that were taken, the $400 million \ncut applied to the military personnel funding top line will greatly \ncomplicate the Department's ability to manage the All-Volunteer Force \nand to provide for bonuses and incentives that will be needed to \nsupport the force. It might even be troublesome enough that the \nDepartment of Defense would be forced to ask for a supplemental \nappropriations--something we wanted to get away from this year and \nfinally have.\n  So one other thing is, there are some who suggest: Well, the F-35 is \njust a paper airplane that is the future. We have the F-22 now. The F-\n35 is not here yet. It is here. There are--in this budget alone, in the \nfiscal year 2010 budget, which is the fourth year, by the way, of \nproduction of the F-35--there are 30 F-35s being produced for the \nmilitary. So this is not a future deal when we talk about F-35s. This \nis a here-and-now deal. We are already into low-rate initial \nproduction. There are already at least five test aircraft flying, and \nwe have 30 F-35s funded in this bill which is before this body now.\n  Let me summarize the situation relative to the Levin-McCain amendment \nthat would strike the additional funding for the F-22s, the additional \nplanes that the military does not want, does not need, and says we \ncannot afford.\n  First, the F-22 is a very capable aircraft. There should be no doubt \nabout it. We have them. We need them. And they are valuable.\n  Next, the Air Force has already bought, and will pay for, 187 F-22 \naircraft. So the debate is not about whether we will have that \ncapability of the F-22 for the next 20 years. We will. We should, and \nwe will. The debate is over how many F-22s are enough to meet the \nNation's requirements. Two Presidents--President Obama and President \nBush--two Secretaries of Defense, three Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, \ncurrent members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff all agree that 187 F-22s \nis all we need to buy and all we should buy.\n  The debate also concerns what damage will be done if we do not \nreverse the cuts that were taken to pay for the additional F-22s--to \npay for the $1.75 billion in the F-22 add. Those cuts are $400 million \nto military personnel accounts, $850 million to operations and \nmaintenance accounts, and $500 million across-the-board reductions to \nthe Department of Defense budget.\n  We received a letter from the President this week saying he will veto \nthe Defense authorization bill if it includes the F-22 production.\n  So our amendment is a critically important amendment. It involves a \nlot of money, and there is a lot of principle involved as to whether we \nshould continue to be building weapons we no longer need and we have \nenough of. We need the F-22. There is no doubt about that. But we have \nenough of the F-22, according to all our military leaders--civilian and \nuniformed leaders alike.\n  But we cannot get to a vote, and that is the fact of the matter. We \nhave waited for an agreement to get to a vote on the Levin-McCain \namendment. Repeatedly, I have asked whether we can set a time for a \nvote, and the answer has come back: We cannot set a time for a vote. It \nis clear that for some reason, which, frankly, I do not fully \nunderstand--the reason we are not permitted to get to a vote on the \nLevin-McCain amendment is because of the prospect, the fact that either \nthe next amendment or somehow down the line on this bill there is going \nto be offered a hate crimes amendment.\n  How that and why that should result in a denial of an opportunity to \nvote on the Levin-McCain amendment escapes me, I must say. Because we \nare going to get to the hate crimes amendment whether we are allowed a \nvote on the F-22 amendment. Not allowing us a vote, not agreeing to a \ntime for a vote on the Levin-McCain amendment does not obviate the fact \nthere is going to be a hate crimes amendment offered. As a matter of \nfact, it is now the actual amendment before us. And everyone knew that.\n\n  So I do not understand the logic behind the refusal to permit a vote \non an amendment--the Levin-McCain amendment--because of objection to \ngoing to a vote on hate crimes, when we are going to that hate crimes \namendment anyway and when we are going to have to come back to the \nLevin-McCain amendment. Everybody knows it. We are going to have to \nresolve both those amendments. So the decision some made to deny us an \nopportunity to vote at this time on Levin-McCain simply stymies this \nbody from doing what it is going to do.\n  There are many people who disagree with the Levin amendment. Fine. \nThere are many people who disagree on the hate crimes amendment. That \nis their right. But what is undeniable is, we are going to resolve \nboth, one way or the other. We are going to resolve both of those and \nhopefully a lot of other material and a lot of other amendments. They \nare both going to be resolved, one way or the other, on this bill. \nArgue both sides, argue neither side, but you cannot argue, it seems to \nme, that we should not allow a vote on the first amendment before us--\nLevin-McCain--because of opposition to another amendment which is going \nto be offered.\n  I know there is strong opposition to hate crimes. I understand it. I \nunderstand why people say it should not be on this bill, despite the \nrules which allow it. I respect the right to disagree with it. But I do \nnot understand the logic or the strategy which denies us the \nopportunity to vote on an amendment which has been thoroughly debated--\nthe Levin-McCain amendment--because there is another amendment down the \nline which is going to be offered which people object to, when they \nknow it is coming up. Despite strong feelings that it should not come \nup, it is coming up. It is now before us. Everyone knew it was going to \ncome up.\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\n  So now we are stymied. We are stymied from resolving an amendment \nwhich has to be resolved, one way or the other--Levin-McCain--because \nof objection to another amendment being offered. I don't get the logic. \nI don't understand the strategy. I understand the feelings and I \nrespect the feelings, although I disagree with people who oppose the \nLevin-McCain amendment and I disagree with people who oppose the hate \ncrimes amendment. So I understand the feelings. I don't share the \nfeelings, but I respect them, and I respect their right to fight \nagainst these amendments. But for the life of me, I do not understand \nwhy we are denied an opportunity to vote on Levin-McCain because of an \nobjection to another amendment. All it does is slow down this body. It \nstymies this body from resolving issues which are going to be resolved. \nAs certain as this body is here, this is going to be resolved. These \nare going to be resolved like a lot of other amendments. I don't know \nhow they will be resolved. That is not certain; it never is. But they \nwill be resolved because that is the nature of the Senate, to resolve \nthese issues.\n\n  Again, I thank my good friend from Arizona. I know there are \ndifferences on the question of whether hate crimes ought to be offered \non this bill. I respect him deeply, and I respect his positions and his \nright to hold them. While I surely disagree with the decision that has \nbeen made to not permit us to move at this time to a resolution of \nLevin-McCain, I nonetheless have a great understanding of the feelings \nhere. I appreciate them and I respect them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know there are a lot of other issues \nthat are consuming the interests of my colleagues and the American \npeople, such as the confirmation hearings of Judge Sotomayor; the HELP \nCommittee, of which I am a member, is reporting out one of the most \nmassive takeovers and expenditures of taxpayer dollars in history; and \nwe have this bill on the floor, and there are other issues. So it has \nprobably gone unnoticed that we have seen another really--if not \nunprecedented, certainly highly unusual action on the part of the \nmajority.\n  Frankly, to my colleagues on this side of the aisle and the American \npeople, elections have consequences. What we have just seen is an \namendment before this body and a piece of legislation before this body \nthat I think one could argue is probably of more importance than any \nother we consider because it authorizes the measures necessary to \npreserve the security of this Nation, care for the men and women who \nare serving in the military, and meet the future threats we will face \nin the 21st century.\n  So what has happened here is that the majority leader, with the \nagreement of my friend from Michigan, whom I highly respect and regard, \nhas made it clear that their highest priority is not that. Their \nhighest priority is a hate crimes bill--a hate crimes bill that has \nnothing to do whatsoever with defending this Nation.\n  My friend from Michigan just complained that we haven't had a time \nfor the vote. Of course we haven't had a time for the vote on the \nLevin-McCain amendment because we have been made aware that a hate \ncrimes bill--and by the way, not an ordinary, small, specific \namendment, but 17 pages, plus 6 additional pages, encompassing a piece \nof legislation that is before this body that has never moved through \nthe Judiciary Committee. It has not moved through the Judiciary \nCommittee, the appropriate committee of oversight.\n  So the majority leader of the Senate comes to the floor, after \nprevailing upon the distinguished chairman to withdraw his amendment--\nan amendment of some consequence, a $1.75 billion expenditure, and, far \nmore important than even the money, a real confrontation between \nspecial interests and the national interests--so that we can move to \nthe hate crimes bill.\n  The hate crimes bill is not without controversy, I say. In fact, it \nis interesting that on June 16, 2009, the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights sent a letter to the Vice President and to the leaders of the \nCongress opposing the hate crimes bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Commission on Civil Rights,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2009.\n     Re S. 909.\n\n     Hon. Joseph Biden, Jr.,\n     President, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     President Pro Tempore, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     Majority Whip, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     Minority Whip, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee.\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution,\n     Hon. Tom Coburn,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the \n         Constitution.\n       Dear Mr. President and Distinguished Senators: We write \n     today to urge you to vote against the proposed Matthew \n     Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act (S. 909) (``MSHCPA'').\n       We believe that MSHCPA will do little good and a great deal \n     of harm. Its most important effect will be to allow federal \n     authorities to re-prosecute a broad category of defendants \n     who have already been acquitted by state juries--as in the \n     Rodney King and Crown Heights cases more than a decade ago. \n     Due to the exception for prosecutions by ``dual sovereigns,'' \n     such double prosecutions are technically not violations of \n     the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. But they \n     are very much a violation of the spirit that drove the \n     framers of the Bill of Rights, who never dreamed that federal \n     criminal jurisdiction would be expanded to the point where an \n     astonishing proportion of crimes are now both state and \n     federal offenses. We regard the broad federalization of crime \n     as a menace to civil liberties. There is no better place to \n     draw the line on that process than with a bill that purports \n     to protect civil rights.\n       While the title of MSHCPA suggests that it will apply only \n     to ``hate crimes,'' the actual criminal prohibitions \n     contained in it do not require that the defendant be inspired \n     by hatred or ill will in order to convict. It is sufficient \n     if he acts ``because of'' someone's actual or perceived race, \n     color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, \n     gender identity or disability. Consider:\n       Rapists are seldom indifferent to the gender of their \n     victims. They are virtually always chosen ``because of'' \n     their gender.\n       A robber might well steal only from women or the disabled \n     because, in general, they are less able to defend themselves. \n     Literally, they are chosen ``because of'' their gender or \n     disability.\n       While Senator Edward Kennedy has written that it was not \n     his intention to cover all rape with MSHCPA, some DOJ \n     officials have declined to disclaim such coverage. Moreover, \n     both the objective meaning of the language and considerable \n     legal scholarship would certainly include such coverage. If \n     all rape and many other crimes that do not rise to the level \n     of a ``hate crime'' in the minds of ordinary Americans are \n     covered by MSHCPA, then prosecutors will have ``two bites at \n     the apple'' for a very large number of crimes.\n       DOJ officials have argued that MSHCPA is needed because \n     state procedures sometimes make it difficult to obtain \n     convictions. They have cited a Texas case from over a decade \n     ago involving an attack on a black man by three white \n     hoodlums. Texas law required the three defendants to be tried \n     separately. By prosecuting them under federal law, however, \n     they could have been tried together. As a result, admissions \n     made by one could be introduced into evidence at the trial of \n     all three without falling foul of the hearsay rule.\n       Such an argument should send up red flags. It is just an \n     end-run around state procedures designed to ensure a fair \n     trial. The citizens of Texas evidently thought that separate \n     trials were necessary to ensure that innocent men and women \n     are not punished. No one was claiming that Texas applies this \n     rule only when the victim is black or female or gay. And \n     surely no one is arguing that Texans are soft on crime. Why \n     interfere with their judgment?\n       We are unimpressed with the arguments in favor of MSHCPA \n     and would be happy to discuss the matter further with you if \n     you so desire. Please do not hesitate to contact any of us \n     with your questions or comments. The Chairman's Counsel and \n     Special Assistant, Dominique Ludvigson, is also available to \n     further direct your inquiries.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gerald A. Reynolds,\n       Chairman.\n     Abigail Thernstrom,\n       Vice Chair.\n     Peter Kirsanow,\n       Commissioner.\n     Ashley Taylor, Jr.,\n       Commissioner.\n     Gail Heriot,\n       Commissioner.\n     Todd Gaziano,\n       Commissioner.\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights sends a letter \nsaying:\n\n       Dear Mr. President and distinguished Senators: We write \n     today to urge you to vote against the Matthew Shepard Hate \n     Crimes Prevention Act.\n\n  That is basically the bill the majority leader has just inserted into \nthe process of legislation designed to defend this Nation's national \nsecurity. Of course there are strong feelings on it. This is a complete \nabdication of the responsibilities of the Judiciary Committee but, more \nimportantly, could hang up this bill for a long period of time. While \nwe have young Americans fighting and dying in two wars, we are going to \ntake up the hate crimes bill because the majority leader thinks that is \nmore important--more important--than legislation concerning the defense \nof this Nation. I am sure the men and women in the military serving in \nhis home State would be interested to know about his priorities.\n  So here we are. Now we will go through--I am sure the majority leader \nwill file cloture, we will go through 30 hours of debate, and we will \nhave another vote. All of this is unnecessary. Why couldn't we move the \nhate crimes bill--remember, this is not a single-shot amendment on a \nspecific small issue; this is a huge issue, the whole issue of hate \ncrimes. It is a huge issue. It deserves hearings and debate and \namendment in the Judiciary Committee. But what are we going to do? For \nreasons that I guess the majority leader can make clear because I don't \nget it, he wants to put it on the national defense authorization bill \nand pass it that way. He will probably succeed, and he will call it \n``bipartisan.'' The last time I checked, it has 44 Democratic \ncosponsors and 2 Republicans. That is the definition, by the way, \naround here of bipartisan bills. That is the way the stimulus package \nwas bipartisan. That is how the omnibus spending bill was bipartisan. \nAnd I am pretty confident that if health care ``reform'' passes, it \nwill probably be in another ``bipartisan'' fashion.\n  So we will have some hours of debate. We will have more exacerbated \nfeelings between this side of the aisle and that side of the aisle. I \nwould imagine that the hate crimes bill, given the makeup of this body, \nmay even be put on a defense authorization bill--a huge issue. A huge \nissue will now be placed on a defense authorization bill and passed \nthrough the Congress and signed by the President. That is a great \ndisservice to the American people. The American people deserve debate \nand discussion and hearings and witnesses on this legislation. They \ndeserve it. They don't deserve to have a hate crimes bill put on this \nlegislation which has no relation whatsoever to hate crimes.\n  I will probably have a lot more to say about this in the hours ahead. \nI have been around this body a fair amount of time. I have watched the \nDefense authorization bill wind its way through Congress, and \noccasionally, including at other times, I have seen amendments put on \nbills which are nongermane, but I haven't seen the majority leader of \nthe Senate--the majority leader of the Senate, whose responsibility is \nto move legislation through the Senate--take a totally nonrelevant, \nall-encompassing, controversial piece of legislation and put it on a \nbill that is as important to the Nation's security as is this \nlegislation. We are breaking new ground here, let's have no doubt about \nit. It is one thing to sometimes have one Member or two or others \npropose amendments that happen to be their pet project or their pet \npeeve. It is an entirely different thing--it is an entirely different \nthing, and I have never seen it before--that the majority leader of the \nSenate comes to the floor and introduces an irrelevant piece of \nlegislation that is controversial, that is fraught with implications \nfor this and future generations, to a bill that is totally nonrelevant. \nAfter 30 hours of debate, we will have a vote on closing that debate \nand including it in the legislation. I am deeply, deeply disappointed, \nand I question anyone's priorities who puts this kind of legislation \nahead of the needs of the men and women who are serving our military \nwith bravery, courage, and distinction.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are currently on the Department of \nDefense authorization bill and an amendment that has been offered by \nthe Democratic majority leader relative to the creation of a new \nFederal crime of hate crimes.\n  Earlier, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, came to the floor to \nquestion the wisdom of adding that kind of legislation to a bill \nrelated to the Department of Defense. Most people, when they hear that \nargument, would say: Why don't they do these bills separately? It turns \nout that under the Senate rules, oftentimes there are few opportunities \nto move a bill forward. It is not at all unusual for Senators to come \nforward and offer what appears to be, and may in fact be, an unrelated \namendment to a bill that is likely to pass and be signed by the \nPresident. Too often, we pass bills that die in transit to the House or \nonce over in the House never see the light of day. They have the same \ncomplaint about the Senate.\n  This is legislation, hate crimes legislation, which we believe is \ntimely, important, and which we want to make part of this debate and \nultimately would like to offer it to the President for signature. It \nhas been debated in the House of Representatives, and it is a bill that \nI think we can quickly come together with the House on and agree on \ncommon terms. So it is an important opportunity.\n  I might say to Senator McCain that I have offered what we would call \nunrelated amendments in the past, and he has as well. Going back many \nyears, in 1993 Senator McCain offered a line-item veto amendment to a \nbill involving voter registration. He also offered that same amendment \nto research bills and to a bill involving the travel rights of blind \nindividuals. He had a supermajority requirement to increase taxes added \nto a bill--unrelated--on the subject of unemployment compensation. So \nit is not unusual. I have done it. Senator McCain has done it.\n  In fact, this year we have seen it happen repeatedly. In fact, most \nof the amendments have come from the other side of the aisle. Senator \nVitter--on a bill that tried to put the economy back on track--offered \nan amendment that was critical of an organization known as ACORN. It \nhad nothing to do with the stimulus package. It was his personal \nfeeling about that organization that led to the amendment. Senator \nEnsign of Nevada offered a controversial amendment which, in fact, \nstalled a bill that was relating to the voting rights of the citizens \nof the District of Columbia. Senator Ensign's amendment dealt with gun \ncontrol, which didn't have a direct bearing on the question of DC \nvoting rights. Senator DeMint raised the question of the fairness \ndoctrine of the Federal Communications Commission--another amendment to \nthe DC voting bill. Senator Thune of South Dakota offered an amendment \nrelative to concealed firearms, again on the DC voting rights bill.\n  The list goes on. To suggest what was done this morning is unusual is \nto ignore the obvious. For the better part of this year, amendments \nhave been coming from the Republican side of the aisle that are \nunrelated to the subject matter of the bill, and that has been a fact \nof Senate life.\n  This amendment being offered by Senator Reid, as well as many others \nrelative to hate crimes, is a very important one. I would like to speak \nto it.\n  I speak in strong support of the passage of this hate crimes \nlegislation. We plan on voting on it as an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill. For several years, the Senate has taken up these \ntwo measures, and for several years both the House and the Senate have \npassed the hate crimes bill only to see it blocked by filibuster \nthreats or veto vows.\n  We are fortunate to have a new President who supports this hate \ncrimes legislation. When the House of Representatives took up this \nlegislation just a couple months ago, President Obama issued a \nstatement which said:\n\n       I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to act on this \n     important civil rights issue by\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\n     passing this legislation to protect all our citizens from \n     violent acts of intolerance.\n\n  What a difference a year has made. When Congress took up the hate \ncrimes bill last Congress, President Bush called it ``unnecessary and \nconstitutionally questionable.'' He promised to veto it.\n  The American people said last November that they wanted a President \nwho will take our country in a different direction. President Obama is \ndoing that, and he is doing it on this issue as well.\n  The hate crimes bill has another important supporter who, sadly, \ncannot be with us on the floor today, and that is Senator Ted Kennedy \nof Massachusetts, who has been our leader on this issue for over 10 \nyears. I wish he were here to make another impassioned speech for its \npassage. Nobody speaks to this issue with more authority and clarity \nthan Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy has been called the heart and \nsoul of the Senate. Passing this bill will honor the great work he has \ngiven in his public career to the cause of civil rights.\n  The Kennedy hate crimes bill now before us is one of the most \nimportant pieces of civil rights legislation of our time. I am proud to \ncosponsor it. I generally believe Congress should be careful in \nfederalizing crime. In the case of hate crimes, there is a demonstrated \nproblem and a carefully crafted solution.\n  Here is the problem--in fact, it is twofold. First, the existing \nFederal hate crimes law, passed in 1968 after the assassination of Dr. \nMartin Luther King, covers only six narrow categories. In order for the \ncurrent law to apply, a person has to be physically assaulted on the \nbasis of race, national origin, or religion, while engaging in one of \nthe following specific activities: using a public accommodation, \nserving as a juror, attending a public school, participating in a \ngovernment program, traveling in interstate commerce, or applying for a \njob.\n  The Kennedy hate crimes bill now being considered would expand \ncoverage so that hate crimes could be prosecuted wherever they took \nplace as long as there is an interstate commerce connection, such as \nthe use of a weapon. Federal prosecutors would no longer be limited to \nthe six narrow areas I mentioned earlier in the bill passed some 41 \nyears ago.\n  Secondly, the bill would expand the categories of people covered \nunder the Federal hate crimes law. The current law provides no coverage \nfor hate crimes based on a victim's sexual orientation, gender, gender \nidentity, or disability. Unfortunately, statistics tell us that hate \ncrimes based on sexual orientation are the third most common after \nthose based on race and religion. About 15 percent of all hate crimes \nare based on sexual orientation. Our laws cannot ignore this reality.\n  Let me address some of the arguments that have been made against this \nhate crimes bill. Some of my constituents--in fact, most of those who \nwrite in opposition to the bill--are writing either personally or on \nbehalf of churches. There are people who believe this bill would be an \ninfringement on religious speech. Their concern is that a minister \ncould be prosecuted if he sermonizes against homosexuality, and after \nthat a member of his congregation assaults someone on the basis of \ntheir sexual orientation. I understand their concern, but it is \nmisplaced.\n  The chair of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, held a \nhearing last month on the hate crimes bill. Attorney General Eric \nHolder was the star witness. I attended the hearing and asked the \nAttorney General pointblank whether a religious leader could be \nprosecuted under the facts I just described. I talked to him about a \nminister in a church who might stand before his or her congregation and \nargue that the Bible states clearly, from their point of view, that \npersons engaged in homosexual conduct are sinners, and if after that \nsermon someone sitting in the congregation, in anger, turns and strikes \nsomeone who is gay, can the minister be held responsible for inciting \nthis person to strike someone of a different sexual orientation. This \nis what the Attorney General said in response to this hypothetical \nquestion I raised:\n\n       This bill seeks to protect people from conduct that is \n     motivated by bias. It has nothing to do with regard to \n     speech. The minister who says negative things about \n     homosexuality, about gay people, this is a person I would not \n     agree with, but is not somebody who would be under the ambit \n     of this statute.\n\n  Based on that representation from the Nation's top law enforcement \nofficer, I hope some from religious communities who have been writing \nto my office will understand that my response to them over the months \nand years that they have been writing is consistent with the \ninterpretation of this hate crimes bill by the Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n\n  It is also important to point out that the Kennedy hate crimes bill \nrequires bodily injury. It does not apply to speech or harassment. It \ndoes not apply to those who would carry signs with messages of their \nreligious beliefs. Attorney General Holder assured the Senate that, \nunless there is bodily injury involved, no hate crimes prosecution \ncould be brought. I don't know how he could have been clearer or more \ndefinitive. I am certain that some who don't want to accept the clear \nmeaning of his words will dispute him, but he was very clear for all of \nthe people of good faith who would listen.\n  And listen to the words of Geoffrey Stone, a first amendment scholar \nat the University of Chicago Law School:\n\n       It is settled First Amendment law that an individual cannot \n     constitutionally be punished for attempting to incite others \n     to commit crimes, unless the speaker expressly incites \n     unlawful conduct and such conduct is likely to occur \n     imminently. The last time the Supreme Court upheld a criminal \n     conviction for incitement was more than a half century ago.\n\n  I also note that 24 States--nearly half of the States in America--\nhave hate crime laws on the books that include sexual orientation, and \nreligious leaders are not being prosecuted in those States. That is \njust not the purpose of the hate crimes laws. Prosecutors aren't going \naround looking to put ministers or people with religious beliefs \ncontrary to certain sexual orientations in jail.\n  Moreover, I think it is time that many people in the religious \ncommunity would come forward and support this legislation. They should \ntake comfort in knowing that if they believe intolerance and hate are \nnot part of their spiritual message, this law is a good law in support \nof their beliefs.\n  This law would go beyond the six narrow areas I covered earlier. It \nwould be an important consideration since 20 percent of all hate crimes \nare committed on the basis of a person's religion. This hate crimes law \nwill actually protect those discriminated against because of their \nreligious belief. That should be another reason for those of faith to \ncome forward and consider supporting it.\n  Another criticism of the Kennedy bill is one that has been around for \na long time. It is an argument about States' rights. They argue there \nis no need to pass a Federal hate crimes law because the States can do \nthe job on their own.\n  This argument is remarkably similar to one we faced almost a century \nago when Congress debated an antilynching law. Between 1881 and 1964 \nthere is evidence that almost 5,000 people--in fact, 4,749--were \nlynched in the United States. Predominantly the victims were African \nAmericans. Yet Congress resisted addressing this problem for \ngenerations.\n  Let me read some quotes from a 1922 Congressional Record when \nCongress debated whether to pass a bill making lynching a Federal \ncrime. One Member of Congress said:\n\n       The great body of the good people of the country know that \n     the Federal Government should let the States solve these \n     purely local questions. They know that peace and confidence \n     cannot come from distrust and suspicion and that this \n     Congress cannot, by statute, change God's eternal laws.\n\n  Another House Member said:\n\n       The question is whether or not we shall duplicate the State \n     function by conferring the same power upon the Federal \n     Government as to this class of crimes. Ours is a government \n     of divided Sovereignties.\n\n  The arguments this year against the hate crimes bill sound very \nsimilar to the arguments in 1922 against the antilynching law.\n  We can all agree that criminal law is primarily a State and local \nfunction. It is estimated 95 percent of prosecutions for crimes occur \nat that level. But there are some areas of criminal law in which we \nhave agreed the Federal Government can and should step in to help.\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\n  There are over 4,000 Federal crimes, 600 of which have been passed in \nthe last 10 years. Hate crimes are a sad and tragic reality in America. \nLast month's horrific shooting, not far from here, at the Holocaust \nMuseum in Washington, DC, was the most recent reminder that hate-\nmotivated violence still plagues our Nation.\n  Earlier this year in my home State of Illinois, two White men in the \ntown of Joliet used a garbage can to beat a 43-year-old Black man \noutside a gas station while yelling racial epithets and stating: ``This \nis for Obama.'' The victim sustained serious injuries, lacerations, and \nbruises to his head.\n  Last year, a University of Illinois student was walking near his \ncollege campus with three friends when an attacker, yelling antigay \nslurs, pushed him so forcefully he was knocked unconscious and suffered \na head injury.\n  These are incidents in my home State, which I am proud to represent, \nbut I am not proud of this conduct, and I do not think America should \nbe proud of this kind of intolerance and assault--physical assault--\nthat has taken place.\n  According to FBI data, which is based on voluntary reporting, \nincidentally, there are about 8,000 hate crimes in America every year. \nSome experts estimate the real number is closer to 50,000.\n  The Kennedy hate crimes bill will not eliminate hate crimes in \nAmerica, but it will help ensure these crimes do not go unpunished.\n  When Senator Kennedy introduced the hate crimes bill in April, here \nis what he said--for Ted, whom I wish could be with us today, I will \nrepeat his words so he is part of the Record in support of this bill. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       It has been over 10 years since Matthew Shepard was left to \n     die on a fence in Wyoming because of who he was. It has also \n     been 10 years since this bill was initially considered by \n     Congress. In those 10 years, we have gained the political and \n     public support that is needed to make this bill become law. \n     Today, we have a President who is prepared to sign hate \n     crimes legislation into law, and a Justice Department that is \n     willing to enforce it. We must not delay the passage of this \n     bill. Now is the time to stand up against hate-motivated \n     violence and recognize the shameful damages it is doing to \n     our Nation.\n\n  In the words of Senator Kennedy, and in my own words as well, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now \non the hate crimes amendment which takes the form of the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act introduced by Senator Kennedy. I wish to speak on that \namendment.\n  I begin by commending and thanking Senator Kennedy for his leadership \nand dedication on this issue for a long time. He has been the leader, \nhe has been persistent, and I know he remains fully supportive.\n  This has been offered as an amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill. The reason is because it is so long overdue.\n  This amendment will expand the Federal definition of a hate crime so \nthat the Federal Government can prosecute crimes committed because of a \nperson's gender, gender identity, disability, or other sexual \norientation.\n  It would increase the Justice Department's authority to prosecute by \nremoving old restrictions that say a hate crime must involve a victim \nwho is attacked because of hate and attacked while voting, attending a \npublic school, serving on a jury or involved in another specially \ndesignated activity. So the application of the existing legislation is \nhighly limited, and this would remove that limitation.\n  It would authorize $5 million in Federal grants to help States, \nlocalities, and Indian tribes investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It \nwould also allow the Federal Government to give important technical, \nforensic, and prosecutorial assistance to States and localities that \nprosecute these kinds of crimes.\n  It would authorize the Department of Justice to begin programs to \ncombat hate crimes committed by children and teenagers. This is \nimportant because this is a rising area of concern.\n  It would allow law enforcement to gather more data about violent hate \ncrimes so we know how big the problem is and can work to fight against \nit.\n  Let me give a little bit of history. I have been working on hate \ncrimes since I joined the Senate and the Judiciary Committee almost 17 \nyears ago. I know the history of this amendment very well. In the 103rd \nCongress, I introduced the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act to \nsubstantially increase criminal sentences whenever a crime was \ncommitted on Federal land that had an element of hatred to it relating \nto race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity or sexual \norientation. The bill was actually enacted into law in 1994, and it was \nan important first step.\n  In the 105th Congress, Senator Kennedy introduced the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act for the first time, and I was one of 33 cosponsors. That \nwas 1997, and this is the bill we are still talking about today, 12 \nyears later. In the 106th Congress, Senator Kennedy reintroduced the \nbill. The bill was bipartisan, it had 43 cosponsors, but it did not \npass.\n  In the 107th Congress, 2 years later, Senator Kennedy reintroduced it \nagain. It was bipartisan, and this time it had 50 cosponsors. In July \nof 2001, it was reported out of the Judiciary Committee, but a cloture \nvote in 2002 failed by a vote of 54 to 43. That was 7 years ago. One-\nhalf of the Senate was cosponsoring this bill, but we lost by six votes \non a cloture vote.\n  Senator Kennedy reintroduced the bill in the 108th, the 109th, and \nthe 110th Congresses. Each time there was broad and bipartisan support, \nbut the bill did not pass. In this Congress, the bill has 45 \ncosponsors. The Attorney General has testified in support of it, and a \nsimilar bill has already passed the House. I believe it is time to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Let me be candid and say I still do not understand the opposition to \nthe bill. It does not criminalize speech. It only applies to violent \nacts. These are acts where the victim is targeted because of who they \nare--because of their race, or national origin, or disability, or \nreligion, or gender, or their sexual orientation. We should have passed \nthis bill many years ago.\n  According to the FBI, hate crimes occur in the United States at a \nrate of approximately one for every single hour of the day. FBI \nstatistics are not complete because they rely on voluntary reporting \nfrom local law enforcement agencies, but they are, nonetheless, I \nthink, chilling and compelling. In 2007, 7,264 hate crimes incidents \nwere reported to the FBI with a total of 9,535 victims. Approximately \n50 percent of the victims were attacked because of their race, 18 \npercent because of their religion, 16 percent because of their sexual \norientation, 13 percent because of their ethnicity or national origin, \nand 1 percent because of a disability.\n  The nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that if we had \ninformation about all the hate crimes that occur in the United States, \nthe total number would be close to 50,000.\n  These crimes come in all sizes and all shapes, but they have one \ncommon theme: They leave people terrified, hurt, even dead, and they \nrip communities apart.\n  I think we all remember the story of James Byrd, Jr., a 50-year-old \nBlack man, who was savagely murdered in Jasper, TX, in 1998, 11 years \nago, while this bill was under consideration. Mr. Byrd was walking home \nfrom his parents' home late one night. He was picked up by three White \nmen in a pickup truck. They took him to the woods, they savagely beat \nhim, they chained him to the back of the truck, and they dragged him 2 \nmiles to his death. His torso was found at the edge of a paved road. \nHis head and arm were found in a ditch a mile away. The three men were \nlater discovered to be Ku Klux Klan supporters, bearing racist tattoos.\n  A crime like this is not just tragic for the victim and his family \nbut it makes an entire group of people terrified to leave their homes \nat night, and\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nit tears communities apart in a potentially irreparable way. This is a \nheinous crime. Hate was the driving motivation and the law and the \npunishment ought to reflect that.\n  Mr. Byrd was killed 11 years ago, and things have not gotten better. \nLet me tell you about three trends I find particularly disturbing. \nFirst, hate crimes targeting Hispanic Americans rose 40 percent between \n2003 and 2007. FBI statistics show these crimes are rising every single \nyear. In 2003, 426 crimes against Latinos; in 2004, 475; 2005, 522;--\nsee it ratcheting up--2006, 576; and 2007, 595. That is a 40-percent \nincrease in 4 years.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has reported that this \nincrease in violence correlates with the heated debate over \ncomprehensive immigration reform, and we have all heard the talk shows \nthat preach hatred. This is part of the result. Regardless of the \nreason, though, for the trend, it is unacceptable for us to stand by \nand let these crimes increase.\n  Another example: In Shenandoah, PA, this year, a 25-year-old Mexican \nimmigrant and father of two was beaten to death by a group of high \nschool football players who yelled ethnic slurs as they punched and \nkicked him. They beat him until he was unconscious and convulsing. He \ndied 2 days later from those injuries.\n  Just last week, a Latina janitor in Ladera Ranch, CA, was doing her \nmaintenance round when two men hit her on the head and stabbed her with \na switchblade while yelling racial slurs at her. Another hate crime \nlast week.\n  These are brutal, and the victims are attacked because of who they \nare--their skin color, their religion, their heritage--and their \nattackers' hate and vengeance.\n  There is a second troubling trend. The FBI reported 1,265 hate crimes \nagainst gay men and lesbians in 2007, and these are only the crimes \nreported. Many more crimes against this particular community are \nbelieved to go unreported to local law enforcement. The FBI has been \nreporting at least 1,000 hate crimes against this community every \nsingle year since 1995.\n  These crimes are equally chilling. Last December, a woman in my \nState, in the San Francisco Bay area--in Richmond, CA--who happened to \nbe lesbian, was attacked by four men when she got out of her car, which \nhad a gay pride sticker on its license plate. They raped her and made \ncomments about her sexual orientation. Then they drove her 7 blocks \naway and raped her over and over again before leaving her naked on the \nground near a burned-out apartment complex.\n  This is the United States of America. In my State, too, in Oxnard, \nCA, a 15-year-old openly gay boy named Larry King was harassed and \nbullied by his classmates for many years. One day, in 2008, he was \nsitting in an English class in school, when a fellow classmate stood, \ntook out a handgun and shot him in the head. Larry King died in the \nhospital a few days later.\n  It is essential we give law enforcement all the resources we need to \ninvestigate, to solve, to prosecute, and to punish these crimes.\n  Finally, there is a third area I am very concerned about. Most of the \nworst of these crimes are being committed today by young people. On \nelection night, just last year, four young men between the ages of 18 \nand 21 drove to a predominantly African-American neighborhood in Staten \nIsland, where they brutally beat a Black teenager who was walking home \nfrom watching the election results. They went on to assault another \nBlack man, and they used their car to run over a third man they \nbelieved to be black. They injured this man so badly he was left in a \ncoma.\n  In Shenandoah, the individuals who savagely beat a 25-year-old \nMexican immigrant to death were all 21 or younger. And in Oxnard, the \nboy who shot Larry King was 14 years old. Imagine being consumed by \nhatred at 14 years old and what that means for the future of your life.\n  Why would anyone oppose giving the Department of Justice more \nresources to fight these crimes? These hate crimes are terrifying. \nThese are the daily lives of Americans we are talking about--innocent \npeople who are walking to work, driving home at night, working or, yes, \nsitting in our Nation's school classrooms.\n  This legislation is important. It will allow the Federal Government \nto prosecute where States or localities are not willing to. It will \nallow the Justice Department to assist States and localities that want \nto prosecute but don't have the resources or expertise they need. It \ndoes not criminalize speech. It only applies to violent acts, not \nexpressive conduct. It is bipartisan and supported by a majority of \nCongress.\n  Twenty-six State attorneys general are advocating for it and so are \nmore than 41 civil rights groups, 55 women's groups, 79 Latino groups, \n16 gay rights groups, 63 religious organizations that represent \nhundreds of individual congregations, by the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, \nthe Major Cities Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of \nPolice Officers, the United States Conference of Mayors, the American \nVeterans Committee, and many others.\n\n  This legislation is long overdue. There is a problem out there. It \ndeserves to be solved. It deserves to be deterred. It deserves to be \npunished. This bill is long overdue.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his long history of leadership on this \nissue. Indeed, if we are able to pass this bill today, or whenever we \nvote, it will, in fact, be a major tribute to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to repeat and emphasize the \nunprecedented fashion that we are now addressing legislation that \nconcerns our Nation's security and the well-being and welfare of the \nmen and women who are serving it.\n  I always thought the job of the majority leader of the Senate was to \nmove legislation through the Senate. Obviously, the majority leader has \ncome to the floor of the Senate and, at the request of the majority \nleader, the chairman of the committee has taken out an amendment that \naddresses a $1.75 billion F-22 amendment that the President has placed \nhis personal stamp on passing, that the Secretary of Defense has viewed \nas one of his highest priorities, as did the Secretary of the Air Force \nand other administration officials. What did we do? We come to the \nfloor and withdraw the amendment, withdraw it so we can take up a major \npiece of legislation.\n  I am reminded that there are amendments proposed by various Members \nof this body who believe their amendments need to be proposed and \nbelieve there is no other avenue but to put them on pending \nlegislation. The majority leader of the Senate can bring up legislation \nwherever he wants to. That is the privilege of the majority. That is \nthe right of the majority.\n  Here we are trying to address an issue of paramount importance to the \nwell-being of the men and women of the United States of America. Here \nwe are trying to address an issue of $1.75 billion, which has far more \nimportance, in many respects, than the actual cost of the F-22s \nthemselves, and without a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, without a \nbill reported out by the Judiciary Committee, which is the committee of \noversight, the majority leader of the Senate has one very important \namendment pulled and then puts in a piece of legislation which is far-\nreaching in the consequences and very controversial.\n  I introduced into the Record a little while ago the U.S. Commission \non Civil Rights opposes this legislation. Doesn't this legislation, the \nhate crimes bill, deserve the amending and debate process that \nlegislation is supposed to go through--committees and then on the floor \nof the Senate, open to amendments? No, it has been inserted now on the \nDefense authorization bill, and within a short time, I am sure the \nmajority leader will come to the floor and file a motion for cloture to \ncut off debate on an issue of significant importance to all Americans \nand railroad it through on a ``bipartisan basis,'' with possibly two \nRepublican votes.\n  That is not the way this body should work. It is an abuse of power. \nIt does not make for comity on both sides of the aisle. In fact, those \nof us who are committed to seeing this authorization bill done as \nquickly as possible because we are worried about the security of this \nNation take great offense when the majority leader of the Senate, whose \njob is to move legislation through the Senate, brings extraneous\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\nand unrelated legislation to a bill as important as this to the men and \nwomen of this country and our Nation's security. To somehow equate that \nwith other amendments that have been proposed, from time to time, by \nMembers on both sides, I think is not an appropriate comparison. I \nresent it a great deal. It is not good for the health of this body, in \nmy view.\n  Perhaps there is precedent for this. Perhaps there is precedent when \na Defense authorization bill, an issue probably, as I say, of the \nhighest criticality, with an amendment on it that the President of the \nUnited States has fully weighed in on and committed on, is taken off \nthe floor, is taken away from consideration in order to put in an \nextraneous and very controversial full package of legislation.\n  The hate crimes bill before us is not an amendment. It is \nlegislation. It is an encompassing bill, 20-some pages long. We are \ngoing to have about 30 hours of debate, a discussion on it, the \nmajority leader will come and cut off debate and we will probably pass \nit, thereby exacerbating a situation where those of us who oppose this \nlegislation--and it is important legislation--will be faced with a \ndilemma of choosing between a bill which will harm, in my view, the \nUnited States of America and its judicial system and defending the \nNation. I do not think that is fair to any Member of this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1521\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Brown and I introduced \nbipartisan and commonsense legislation as both an amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act and as a stand-alone bill. This is \nnot the first time we have worked together on legislation. I would like \nto recognize and thank the junior Senator from Ohio for the bipartisan \nmanner that both he and his staff have worked on this particular issue.\n  In particular, I would also like to thank the Nevada Office of \nVeterans Services and the National Association for State Veterans Homes \nfor bringing this matter to our attention.\n  As stated, our legislation is both bipartisan and common sense. \nCurrently, an individual is allowed into a State veterans home if the \nindividual is, No. 1, an eligible veteran as defined by the U.S. Code; \nNo. 2, the spouse of an eligible veteran; or, No. 3, a Gold Star \nparent.\n  The problem, though, arises in the way that the Veterans Affairs \nDepartment defines a Gold Star parent. Under current regulations, an \neligible parent is one who has lost all of their children while serving \ntheir country. I know it doesn't make sense, but that is the way the \ndefinition is. As a consequence, state veterans homes are forced to \ndeny admissions to Gold Star parents if they have any surviving \nchildren. Losing a child in war is a stunning and life-altering event \nfor anyone. Senator Brown and I believe that for these families, having \none child make the supreme sacrifice in service to our country is \nsacrifice enough to authorize the surviving parent's elder care in a \nState veterans home later in life. Our legislation would change that to \npermit entry into a VA nursing home to any parent who lost a son or \ndaughter in war while fighting to protect our freedoms and our very way \nof life.\n  As most people are aware, State veterans homes were founded for \nservicemembers following the American Civil War. They have become \ninstitutions that our veterans and their dependents have come to rely \non for nearly 150 years. Currently, there are 137 State veterans homes \nin all 50 States and Puerto Rico that, on a daily basis, provide \nhospital, rehabilitation, long-term care, Alzheimer's care, and end-of-\nlife care to approximately 30,000 veterans and dependents.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the Nevada \nState Veterans Home in Boulder City, NV, for the great work they do. \nU.S. News and World Report recently rated this veterans home as a 5-\nstar facility and the top nursing home in my home State of Nevada. I \nthink it is only fair that the parents who have lost a son or a \ndaughter have access to first-class facilities such as this.\n  I thank, once again, the junior Senator from Ohio and ask my other \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise in support of strengthening our \nFederal hate crimes clause to include crimes motivated by a victim's \nsexual orientation, gender, gender identity or whether the victim has a \ndisability. By passing the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, \nwe will take a long-overdue step toward ensuring that our law \nenforcement officials have the resources they need to prevent and \nproperly prosecute some of the most toxic and destructive violent \ncrimes we face. I also thank my colleagues who have worked tirelessly \nto see this important legislation enacted into law. For the better part \nof the last decade, Senator Kennedy, along with Senators Leahy, \nCollins, and Snowe, have shown leadership on this issue, even when the \nodds of success were small. Their diligence is one of the reasons this \nlegislation today enjoys the support of more than 300 law enforcement, \ncivil rights, civic, and religious organizations. As a new Member of \nthe Senate, I am proud to join them this year as an original cosponsor \nof the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. I truly hope my \ncolleagues will join me to pass this amendment.\n  In 1998, Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, was beaten \nand murdered just because he was gay.\n  The brutality of this crime captured the attention of the Nation. It \nwas an attack not just on Matthew and his family but on an entire \ncommunity. I had the opportunity a couple of years ago to meet Judy \nShepard, Matthew's mother.\n  I applaud her willingness to try and make something positive out of \nsuch a terrible tragedy. She has been a tireless advocate to try and \nget hate crimes legislation passed and to point out the impact of these \nviolent acts on families across this country.\n  The Matthew Shepard attack sent a message of hate and intolerance to \nLGBT youths and their families and instilled in countless young \nAmericans a sense of fear simply because of their sexual orientation.\n  Despite this, Matthew's murderers were not charged with a hate crime \nbecause no such law exists in Wyoming or on the Federal level. It is \nimpossible to know for certain the full effect of crimes motivated by \nhate on the communities they target. What is certain is that hate \ncrimes rob the members of these communities of a sense of security, and \nthe impact is real.\n  Among LGBT youth in this country, the suicide rate is four times \nhigher than their straight peers, as many struggle to find their place \nin their families and their communities. While reducing bigotry and \nincreasing tolerance will require a comprehensive effort, it is an \neffort that will take time. But addressing our outdated hate crimes law \nis one very important component.\n  As Governor, I was proud to sign legislation that expanded New \nHampshire's hate crimes to include sexual orientation. Unfortunately, \nmany States still lack such laws, which is why this bill is so \ncritical.\n  By expanding the definition of hate crimes and by easing access to \nresources for local and Federal law enforcement officials to prosecute \nthese crimes, we can hopefully help prevent these crimes and send a \nmessage that hate and bigotry in any form have no place in our society.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pending before the Senate is the \nNational Defense Authorization Act which is an annual bill considered \nby\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\nthe Senate which basically authorizes the spending of money and certain \npolicies for the Department of Defense. There is a lot of work that \ngoes into this bill. It is put in primarily by the chairman of the \ncommittee, Carl Levin of Michigan, and by John McCain of Arizona. This \nbill looks to be over 1,000 pages long. They have put a lot of effort \ninto this bill and are anxious to pass it.\n  An issue came up, an important issue about the F-22 airplane. This is \na fighter plane that the current administration and others have said \nshould be discontinued. Whenever a fighter plane is being built and is \nbeing discontinued, there are people who resist because each one of \nthese Defense projects involves a lot of people, a lot of jobs, a lot \nof contracts that are important to businesses and families and \ncommunities. So there is resistance. But on the F-22 fighter plane, \nPresident Obama has gone so far as to say in writing: If you include \nmore planes beyond the 187 allocated in previous legislation, I will \nveto the bill. That, of course, would call for a supermajority to \noverride the veto, which is not likely to occur. So it is a promise or \na threat from a President we have to take seriously.\n  The bill currently contains an amendment which expands the number of \nF-22 fighter planes that was adopted narrowly in the Armed Services \nCommittee. The chairman and the ranking Republican have the same \nposition as President Obama. They want to reduce or hold fast to the \nnumber of airplanes currently projected to be built and not to expand \nit, as this bill does. So they offered an amendment to stand with \nPresident Obama and delete the section of the bill which would call for \nmore planes. That amendment, No. 1469, was offered on Monday to be \nconsidered by the Senate. A number of Members have come to support the \namendment, and I am one of them. I support the President's position and \nthe position of Senators Levin and McCain. There are others who oppose \nthis amendment, clearly.\n  At one point, Senator Levin said: Let's move this to a vote. Senator \nMcCain agreed, as we should. It had been pending for 2 days. Everyone \nknows what is at issue. It is contentious and clearly controversial, \nbut we deal with those issues. That is part of our job.\n  At that point, the process broke down. The Republican side of the \naisle objected to calling the amendment. That is when the bill came \ngrinding to a halt. That is when Senator Levin said: We know that after \nthis amendment on F-22s, we will go to an amendment on hate crimes \nlegislation on the same bill. So he withdrew this amendment.\n  Clearly, the answer to this--one I hope we can work out at the \nleadership level--is for Republicans to agree that we have a vote on \nthe F-22 airplane. We should. Senator McCain is anxious for that to \nhappen so the bill can move forward. Once that vote is out of the way, \nwe should schedule a reasonable time for debate and a vote on the hate \ncrimes legislation, which is not new. We have considered this before. \nBut we are bogged down.\n  At this point, tempers are flaring a little bit because this \nimportant bill is being held up over those two issues: whether the F-22 \namendment by Senators Levin and McCain will come to a vote and whether \nthe hate crimes legislation offered by Senator Reid will also then be \nconsidered and voted on. I hope both those occur. There is no reason \nwhy they should not. Those who think they might lose the F-22 amendment \nare resistant to calling it for a vote. But there will come a day when \nwe have to face this issue with a vote. That is ultimately what the \nSenate is here for.\n  I might say about nonrelevant amendments, a position made on the \nfloor by my friend from Arizona and others, it is a hard argument to \nunderstand in light of what we have been through.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a long list of \nnonrelevant amendments offered this year by the Republican side of the \naisle to a series of bills considered on the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Republican Non-Relevant Amendments 2009\n\n       Vitter #107 (ACORN) to H.R. 1, The American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act; Ensign #575 (DC Guns) to S. 160, DC Voting \n     Rights; DeMint #573 (Fairness Doctrine) to S. 160, DC Voting \n     Rights; Thune #579 (Concealed Firearms) to S. 160, DC Voting \n     Rights; Cornyn #674 (Union Dues) to H.R. 1105, Emergency \n     Supplemental Omnibus Appropriations; Vitter #621 \n     (Congressional Pay) to H.R. 1105, Emergency Supplemental \n     Omnibus Appropriations; Thune #662 (Fairness Doctrine) to \n     H.R. 1105, Emergency Supplemental Omnibus Appropriations; \n     Thune #716 (Charitable Donations Deduction) to H.R. 1388, \n     National Service; Vitter #705 (ACORN) to H.R. 1388, National \n     Service; Inhofe #996 (National Language) to S. 386, Fraud \n     Enforcement; Vitter #991 (TARP) to S. 386, Fraud Enforcement \n     and Recovery Act; Coburn #982 (TARP) to S. 386, Fraud \n     Enforcement and Recovery Act; Thune #1002 (TARP) to S. 386, \n     Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act; DeMint #994 (TARP) to S. \n     386, Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act; Coburn #983 (IG-\n     Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac) to S. 386, Fraud Enforcement and \n     Recovery Act; Vitter #1016 (TARP) to S. 896, Helping Families \n     Save Their Homes Act; Thune #1030 (TARP) to S. 896, Helping \n     Families Save Their Homes Act; DeMint #1026 (TARP) to S. 896, \n     Helping Families Save Their Homes Act; Coburn #1067 (Guns in \n     National Parks) to H.R. 627, Credit Cardholders; Coburn #1068 \n     (Guns in National Parks) to H.R. 627, Credit Cardholders; \n     Hutchison #1189 (Auto Dealers) to H.R. 2346, Iraq/Afghanistan \n     Supplemental Appropriations; Vitter #1467 (Rx Drug \n     Reimportation) to H.R. 2892, Homeland Security \n     Appropriations.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. They run the range of things. I talked earlier about some \nof these amendments: an amendment relating to the regulation of guns in \nthe District of Columbia put on the voting rights bill; an amendment \nrelating to the fairness doctrine and telecommunications on the same DC \nvoting rights bill; an amendment related to congressional pay on the \nOmnibus appropriations bill. The list goes on and on. I won't go beyond \nincluding it in the Record.\n  What the majority leader did today with the hate crimes legislation \nis not unlike what has been done repeatedly by the Republican side of \nthe aisle over the last several months. Ultimately, these came to a \nvote. They were considered and voted on. That is all the majority \nleader is asking for, to bring the hate crimes legislation to a vote on \nthis legislation.\n  There is clearly a way out of this. It is for the Senate to do its \njob, to vote on the Levin-McCain amendment on the F-22 fighters up or \ndown. Let's see who prevails, understanding that if this provision \nstays in the bill and Levin-McCain fails, the President will veto the \nbill. That is a pretty ominous prospect.\n  Also keep mind that the hate crimes legislation is timely. It has \npassed the House of Representatives and should be considered by us.\n  I would like to say a word on it and ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a publication by an organization known as Third \nWay which consists of statements of support from religious leaders for \nthe Senate hate crimes bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatements of Support From Religious Leaders for the Senate Hate Crimes \n                                  Bill\n\n       Dr. David P. Gushee, Distinguished University, Professor of \n     Christian Ethics, Mercer University: As a Christian, I \n     believe in the immeasurable and sacred worth of every human \n     being as made in the image of God and as the object of God's \n     redeeming love in Jesus Christ. In our sinful and violent \n     world, there are tragically very many ways in which this \n     sacredness is violated. This bill deserves Christian support \n     because its aim is to protect the dignity and basic human \n     rights of all Americans, and especially those Americans whose \n     perceived ``differentness'' makes them vulnerable to physical \n     attacks motivated by bias, hatred and fear. The bill simply \n     strengthens the capacity of our nation's governments to \n     prosecute violent, bias-related crimes. I am persuaded that \n     the bill poses no threat whatsoever to any free speech right \n     for religious communities or their leaders. Its passage will \n     make for a safer and more secure environment in which we and \n     all of our fellow Americans can live our lives. For me, the \n     case for this bill is settled with these words from Jesus: \n     ``As you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to \n     me'' (Mt. 25:40).\n       Rev. Dr. Derrick Harkins, Senior Pastor, Nineteenth Street \n     Baptist Church, Washington, DC: A strong Biblical imperative \n     that I believe stands at the heart of my Christian faith is \n     the preservation and protection of the inherent dignity of \n     all persons. The Scriptures are replete with examples of \n     God's concern and compassion for those seen as ``other'' by \n     many. As an American, I know the protection of personal \n     dignity and human rights is a principle that makes us\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\n     that much stronger as a nation, and certainly does not stand \n     at odds with freedom of expression. Passage of the Hate \n     Crimes Bill will help to ensure the safeguards of the law for \n     those who are victimized by acts of bias and hate. I welcome \n     the opportunity to support this bill as an expression of my \n     Christian witness, and my belief in our nation's highest aims \n     for all its citizens.\n       Dr. Joel C. Hunter, Senior Pastor, Northland--A Church \n     Distributed: I would think that the followers of Jesus would \n     be first in line to protect any group from hate crimes. He \n     was the one who intervened against religious violence aimed \n     at the woman caught in the act of adultery. He protected her \n     while not condoning her behavior. This bill protects both the \n     rights of conservative religious people to voice passionately \n     their interpretations of their scriptures and protects their \n     fellow citizens from physical attack. I strongly endorse this \n     bill.\n       Rev. Gabriel A. Salguero, Executive and Policy Advisor, The \n     Latino Leadership Circle: At the heart of the Christian \n     gospel is the belief in the intrinsic dignity of all \n     humanity. When people are targeted for acts of violence the \n     Church must speak out. I support the Hate Crimes bill because \n     it provides room for free speech and religious conviction \n     while protecting groups of people from acts of violence. As a \n     Christian who values both love and truth I support a bill \n     that protects the vulnerable while allowing ministers to \n     speak freely about their faith and moral convictions. The \n     Hate Crimes bill does not call for the sacrifice of either \n     dignity nor conviction. It is my prayer that we continue to \n     find ways forward that honors both freedom of speech and \n     protection for all our citizens.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, those who spoke in favor of the bill \nshould be noted, their identities should be noted, because there is \nsome argument, at least in the mail I have received from some religious \nleaders against the bill. Dr. David Gushee, distinguished university \nprofessor of Christian ethics at Mercer University, has a well-thought-\nout statement in support of the bill; Rev. Derrick Harkins, senior \npastor of the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, DC, the \nsame; Dr. Joel Hunter, senior pastor at Northland, has also come out in \nsupport; and Rev. Gabriel Salguero, executive and policy adviser of the \nLatino Leadership Circle.\n  The point I tried to make earlier and the one their support makes is \nthat there are religious leaders who believe this bill is necessary to \nprotect those who may be subjected to physical violence because of \nreligious belief--we don't want that to occur--that intolerance is not \nconsistent with American values.\n  Secondly, to those who argue that if we include sexual orientation in \nthis bill, a pastor who sermonizes against homosexuality based on his \ninterpretation of the Bible could be arrested for it, that is not true. \nAs I quoted earlier, the Attorney General said, clearly, hate crimes \nlegislation is focused on physical violence--not words, not harassment, \nbut physical violence. If the religious leader is not engaged in \nphysical violence against someone of a different sexual orientation, \nthey will not be subject to prosecution under this bill. That has been \nmade clear by the Attorney General, and the support of religious \nleaders indicates they understand that as well. We need to protect the \npeople of our country against hate crimes and intolerance, but we also \nneed to honor our constitutional guarantees when it comes to speech and \nreligious belief. Those are consistent.\n  I look forward to the Senate coming to a conclusion, but I think \nthose who have come to the floor and criticized the majority leader for \nthis situation have not told the whole story. The whole story is the F-\n22 amendment by Senators Levin and McCain was ready to be called, \nshould have been called for a vote, and if it is scheduled for a vote, \nit can be dispensed with. I will support it. I have made that clear to \nthe sponsors. Then we can move to the hate crimes legislation which the \nmajority leader has brought before us, not unlike the many different \ninstances this year when Republicans did exactly the same thing on the \nfloor.\n  I urge those who might be off to lunch in a few minutes to use this \nopportunity. I see my friend from Arizona has taken the floor. I hope \nwe can find an opportunity to work these two things out, perhaps bring \nto a vote the F-22 amendment, which I do support, the Levin-McCain \namendment, to remove language in the bill on the expansion of the F-22 \nprogram. The sooner we can get approval from the leadership on the \nother side of the aisle, the sooner we can dispense with it one way or \nthe other, up or down. Secondly, I hope we can then move to the hate \ncrimes legislation which has been debated at length and is not unlike \nmany of the other amendments which have been offered on the Republican \nside of the aisle on a variety of different bills during the course of \nthe last few months. Bringing these two matters to a vote, perhaps we \ncan then take up other pending matters on the Defense authorization \nbill on which I know the Senators from Arizona and Michigan have worked \nso hard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just have a question, while my friend has the floor. I \nhave been waiting to speak on the hate crimes bill. I am wondering if \nit would be possible, because I am not sure if Senator McCain has a \nlengthy statement, for him to work with us so we could get a time \ncertain when I may make that statement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to yield the floor. Is the Senator seeking \nrecognition?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will just take a few minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could I yield to the Senator from Arizona with the \nunderstanding that after he has spoken, the Senator from California \nwould be recognized?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That would be fine with me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could the Senator give an indication of how much time he \nmay require?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am not sure what the Senator's reaction will be to what \nI have to say. I can't give him a specific time agreement. I am sorry. \nThis is a vital issue we are addressing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understand it is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will make my remarks as short as possible. I believe \nthe Senator from Illinois has the floor; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am trying to get a sense for timing's sake. We all have \nobligations in our various committees and with constituents. I am \nwondering if I should speak first. My statement is only about 6 \nminutes. Then I could yield to Senator McCain. I think this hate crimes \nlegislation is landmark legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think Senator McCain has asked to be recognized first. \nIf I have any response to him, I will try to make it very brief. I ask \nunanimous consent that after the Senator from Arizona has spoken, the \nSenator from California be immediately recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to point out again, the \nlegislation which is now pending has replaced the F-22, the Levin-\nMcCain amendment. My argument is that the majority leader has put in \nlegislation which is not relevant to the pending legislation, which is \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill. I am perfectly willing \nfor the hate crimes bill to come up under the regular order. Why it \nshould be put on the Defense authorization bill, which will then not \nallow adequate debate and discussion of amendments, not to mention the \nfact that it hasn't gone through the committee of jurisdiction--\nfrankly, I do not think it is the appropriate way of using the Defense \nauthorization bill. In fact, I think it is highly inappropriate. \nTherefore, why don't we do this, I ask the Senator from Illinois: agree \nthat as soon as the Defense authorization bill is complete, we take up \nthe Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act under the regular \norder and do business the way the Senate should do business?\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 909\n\n  So therefore, Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be immediately withdrawn; that no amendments on the \ntopic of hate crimes be in order to the pending legislation; further, I \nask that when the Senate completes action on the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, it be in order for the Senate to proceed to S. 909, \nthe Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, under the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I would say \nthat the Senator from Arizona knows that on 16 different occasions this \nyear Republican Senators have offered nonrelevant amendments to pending \nlegislation. The Senator has done that himself. I have done it myself. \nIt is not unusual or beyond the custom and rules of the Senate. And I \nbelieve Senator Reid has the right to do it on this critically \nimportant legislation which we can move to with dispatch. Based on \nthat, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So, Mr. President, here are the facts. The fact is, the \nmajority leader, whose job it is to move legislation through the \nSenate, is now blocking progress of Defense authorization--that \nprogress through the Senate--by proposing an unneeded, irrelevant \namendment, which is a large piece of highly controversial legislation.\n  The Senate majority leader will come to the floor and he will file \ncloture. Then, after some hours--with no amendments because he will \nprobably fill up the tree--the Senate will pass a highly controversial, \nhighly explosive piece of legislation to be attached to the \nauthorization for the defense and the security of this Nation. That is \nwrong. And why--I want to put it this way: It is unanswerable that we \ndo not just take up the hate crimes bill in the regular order and allow \nSenate debate and discussion. That is how the Senate is supposed to \nwork--not put it on a major piece of legislation.\n  I will also point out to my friend from Illinois something he knows. \nIt is one thing for someone who sits back there to propose an amendment \nto pending legislation because they feel that is the only way they can \nget their argument heard. The majority leader of the Senate has the \nauthority to move whatever legislation he wants. And the majority \nleader of the Senate should move the hate crimes bill if he wants it \nconsidered rather than give it priority over the legislation that \naccounts for the national security of this country and the men and \nwomen who serve it.\n  So I am sure there will be all kinds of comments about the \nRepublicans blocking a vote, blocking this, blocking that. Why don't we \ntake up legislation in the regular order? Hate crimes has been opposed \nby the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. This is a very controversial \nissue. By putting it on the DOD bill, we are not going to have the \nadequate debate, discussion, and amendment an issue such as this \ndeserves. There is passion on both sides of the aisle.\n  So it is obvious, whether it is the intention or not, what is \nhappening here is the whole process of debate and amendment will be \nshort-circuited, because we on this side of the aisle are more than \nwilling to take up the legislation as a separate piece of legislation, \ndebate, amend, and discuss it, and let the American people decide. \nInstead, the men and women in the military right now today are being \nshortchanged by putting irrelevant legislation that is highly \ncontroversial and highly complex on a bill designed for defense of this \ncountry and for the men and women who serve it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Actually, I will be glad to yield. But if the Senator \nwants to have a colloquy, go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make sure Senator Boxer has her chance.\n  If I could make two points in the nature of a question to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  First, Senator Reid offered this amendment on behalf of Senator \nLeahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who is now presiding over \nthe Sotomayor hearings. I know he supports it, and I support it as \nwell, the hate crimes legislation, but I want to make that a matter of \nrecord.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I respond to that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is one thing to have the chairman of the committee \nsupport it; it is another thing to have the legislation go through the \ncommittee with the proper debate and discussion and amendment. But go \nahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The second point I would like to make to the Senator from \nArizona is, when we asked for unanimous consent from the Republican \nside to move to the hate crimes legislation, there was objection. So it \nis not as if we have not tried to go through regular order. This seems \nto be the only path we can use to bring this matter to a conclusion. \nAnd I think it can be done in a responsible way quickly. It does not \nhave to drag out over a matter of days. The Senator knows that. If we \ncan get agreement on both sides to have a reasonable time for debate \nand a vote on the bill, I think that would meet the needs the Senator \nhas suggested to get back on the substance of the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In deference to the Senator from California, I will make \nmy answer brief, just to say I do not think--as I have said in my \nprevious argument, it does not belong on a defense authorization bill, \nparticularly so moved by the majority leader of the Senate. But, Mr. \nPresident, the Senator from California is waiting, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from California will allow \nme to make a unanimous consent request before she speaks.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon, on Thursday, \nJuly 16, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe Leahy amendment No. 1511, with the time until then equally divided \nand controlled between the leaders or their designees; that if cloture \nis invoked on amendment No. 1511, then all postcloture time be yielded \nback and amendment No. 1539 be agreed to; that amendment No. 1511, as \namended, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that upon disposition of the hate crimes amendment, Senator \nLevin be recognized to offer the Levin-McCain amendment, and that the \ntime until 5 p.m., Thursday, July 16, be for debate with respect to the \namendment, with all time equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Levin and Chambliss or their designees; that at 5 p.m., \nThursday, July 16, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \namendment, with no intervening amendment in order during the pendency \nof the F-22 amendment; further, that the mandatory quorum be waived \nwith respect to rule XXII.\n  The purpose of this unanimous consent request is to achieve just what \nthe Senator from Arizona asked for: a timely consideration of both \namendments. We will be back on the bill on his amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that we accept this schedule and move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, I am not asking that there be a time agreement on hate crimes, \nI am asking that the hate crimes bill be brought up as a standing bill. \nThe Senator has 60 votes. The Senator could bring it up whether this \nside of the aisle objects or not as a freestanding piece of \nlegislation. I object to it being considered on the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. It has no place for it. It should not be \nthere. The longer we wait, the longer the delay is in providing the men \nand women of the military the tools they need. So I do object. And we \nshould take this up. I am sorry my unanimous consent request was not \nagreed to--that we would take it up as a freestanding bill after the \nconsideration of the Department of Defense bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from California \nfor her courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain and Senator Durbin \nfor moving through their debate swiftly so I would have this \nopportunity to speak in support of a landmark piece of legislation that \nhas been offered as an amendment, the hate crimes prevention amendment \nnamed after Matthew Shepard.\n  This bill is a long time coming. I know we could make a process \nargument. We do it well around here. But it seems to me, we can move \nthis Defense bill through quickly. We are doing that. We will do that. \nIt has strong support. But we can also take care of this long-\nneglected, important piece of legislation whose passage will protect \nand defend our citizens from hate crimes.\n  So it is funny, because technically speaking, of course, the Defense \nbill is\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\nabout our military, and we all support doing what we have to do to keep \nit strong and to be prepared. That is why I will support that. But \nthere is no reason why we cannot take a little time to look at the fact \nthat it is time for the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act to \nreally be passed. It will not slow us up really. We have just seen that \nSenator Durbin has asked for a unanimous consent agreement to do this \nquickly. It is not going to delay. My Republican friends do not seem to \nmind it when they offer nonrelevant amendments to bills. They have done \nit 16 times this year. Oh, they do not have a problem. But if it is \nsomething they do not like, suddenly they make this process argument. \nRather than debate process, why don't we just get on with it? We can do \na couple of important things this week--one of them, the Defense bill, \nand the other, protecting our citizens from hate crimes.\n  The importance of the amendment that was offered by Senator Leahy \nthrough our leader is that it would strengthen the ability of Federal, \nState, and local authorities to investigate and prosecute hate crimes.\n  It has been more than 10 long years since the senseless death of \nMatthew Shepard--a tragedy that showed us we have a long way--a long \nway--to go before we can truly say in this country there is equal \njustice for all.\n  Let's look back at what happened to Matthew Shepard 10 long years \nago. Two men offered Matthew Shepard, a gay man, a ride in their car. \nSubsequently, Shepard was robbed. He was pistol whipped. He was \ntortured. He was tied to a fence in a remote rural area. And he was \nleft to die. Mr. President, this was not a robbery. This was not a spur \nof the moment situation. We know from the pair's then-girlfriends, who \ntestified under oath, that the two men plotted beforehand to rob a gay \nman in particular. That crime occurred because Matthew Shepard was a \ngay man. Well, they robbed him. They tortured him. And they killed him.\n  This crime should be a Federal crime. And yes, we have tried to pass \nthat hate crimes legislation for years and years. There is always an \nexcuse: We do not have the time. It is not relevant to the bill. Well, \nMatthew Shepard's family--what happened to them will never go away. The \nloss they carry in their hearts will never disappear. But the one thing \nwe can do to ease their burden is to pass this legislation.\n  Look, we have offered this on Defense bills before. This is not the \nfirst time. We dealt with it and we voted and we moved on. So the only \nthing you can say as to why there is all this objection is because \npeople do not want to vote on this bill, and they are making it more \nand more difficult for us to be able to get to it. I hope we will, in \nfact, stick to it and get this done. Again, it is not going to weigh \ndown the Defense authorization. In my mind, again, it is something we \nneed to do and we can do with no harm to the underlying bill.\n  We should be proud to support this legislation, not afraid to vote on \nit, not trying to postpone a vote on it. Hate crimes are particularly \noffensive because they are propelled by bias and bigotry. They not only \ninflict harm on the victims, but they instill fear in entire \ncommunities.\n  That is why I have--and I ask to put into the Record--a strong letter \nof support from my sheriff from Los Angeles, Lee Baca. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            County of Los Angeles,\n\n\n                            Sheriff's Department Headquarters,\n\n                                 Monterey Park, CA, June 25, 2009.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The Los Angeles County Sheriff's \n     Department is proud to support S-909. This bill would provide \n     federal assistance to state and local jurisdictions for the \n     prosecution of hate crimes.\n       This bill will adopt the definition of ``hate crime'' from \n     the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     which is a crime where the defendant intentionally selects a \n     victim, or in the case of a property crime, the property that \n     is the object of the crime, because of the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, \n     gender, disability, or sexual orientation of any person and \n     additionally include gender identity.\n       This bill will also authorize the Attorney General, at the \n     request of the state or local law enforcement agency, to \n     provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or other \n     assistance in criminal investigations or prosecutions. The \n     Attorney General is additionally authorized to award grants \n     to law enforcement agencies for extraordinary expenses \n     associated with the investigation and prosecution of hate \n     crimes.\n       In 2007, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \n     statistics indicate that 2,025 law enforcement agencies \n     across the country reported 7,624 hate crimes involving 9,006 \n     offenses. Of those, 7,621 were single bias incidents \n     involving 9,527 victims and 6,962 offenders. Of the single \n     bias incidents, 50.8 percent were racially motivated, 18.4 \n     percent motivated by religion, 16.6 percent motivated by \n     sexual orientation, 13.2 percent motivated by ethnicity or \n     national origin, and 1 percent motivated by disability.\n       This bill is, indeed, a civil rights issue, as President \n     Obama said, ``. . . to protect all of our citizens from \n     violent acts of intolerance.'' Hate crimes are a scourge in \n     our society and have no place in humanity.\n       Thank you for sponsoring this important legislation. It is \n     the duty of government to protect all, equally and \n     unequivocally. Should you have any questions, do not hesitate \n     to contact me directly.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                         Lee Baca,\n                                                          Sheriff.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to note that Lee Baca happens to be a Republican. \nI want to note that this law enforcement individual is very strong on \nthis. He says this hate crimes bill deals with a civil rights issue, \nand he quotes President Obama, ``to protect all of our citizens from \nviolent acts of intolerance.'' Lee Baca adds in his own words:\n\n       Hate crimes are a scourge on our society and they have no \n     place in humanity.\n\n  What we are dealing with is not a Republican issue or a Democratic \nissue. There are gay people who are Republicans. There are gay people \nwho are Democrats. There are gay people in the closet. There are gay \npeople out of the closet. But I can tell my colleagues that too many \ngay people live in fear. They live in fear that two people or one \nperson could attack them simply because they are gay, and that is not \nright in this, the greatest country in the world, and we can fix it.\n  I also wish to point out this bill also protects women who are \nattacked simply because of their gender. So this bill is about making \nsure women are protected and gays are protected.\n  I wish there was no need for this law. I wish we lived in a world \nwhere such a law would be unnecessary. We all do. One of our Founders \nsaid, if people were perfect, we wouldn't need a government. People are \nnot perfect. There has to be right and wrong and it has to be spelled \nout. People who are innocent need to be protected.\n  A man gets in a car with two people who claim to be his friends, and \nhe winds up robbed, tortured, and killed, and put on a fence, I might \nadd.\n  So, Attorney General Holder, when he testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, reported that the FBI said there were 7,624 hate \ncrime incidents in 2007. That is the most recent data: 7,624 hate crime \nincidents.\n  If we pass this bill, we send a signal that the Federal Government \nwill not stand by and watch this sort of thing happen. We send a \nmessage that we will be a backup, that we will supply the law \nenforcement personnel, the forensic assistance, anything the local \nprosecutor needs and the local police need to help them.\n  Eric Holder also testified that between 1998 and 2007, more than \n77,000 hate crime incidents were reported by the FBI. That is one hate \ncrime for every hour of every day for a decade, one hate crime every \nhour of every day for a decade.\n  Senator McCain--and I have full respect for him--said: Let's just do \nthis another day.\n  We shouldn't wait another day. This should receive unanimous support \nfrom everyone across party aisles, and I believe it will receive \ntremendous support across party aisles. I do. So let's get to vote on \nit.\n  Statistics are one thing; the individual stories are horrifying. I \nwill give my colleagues another example, the case of Lawrence ``Larry'' \nKing, a 15-year-old boy from Oxnard, CA. Larry, an eighth-grader, was \nshot and killed by a fellow student in the middle of a classroom in \nFebruary of 2008. According to news reports, the shooting occurred the \nday after the students had a verbal altercation about Larry's sexual \norientation. The police and the district attorney classified the murder \nas a hate crime. The district attorney said there had never been a \nviolent shooting like this before in Ventura County in\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\nmy State. A young life ended too soon by a violent act of hate.\n  My State is not immune from these crimes.\n  In Richmond, CA, four men were arrested and charged for brutally \ngang-raping a young lesbian. According to news reports, one of the \nattackers taunted her for being a lesbian during the attack.\n  After that heinous incident, a young Black man in Richmond was \nattacked. According to the young man's police report, his attackers \nyelled racial epithets and slurs as they broke six of his bones.\n  Finally, another example: In 2006, a man walked into an Amish school \nin Pennsylvania. Taking several female students hostage and releasing \nall the male students, he shot 10 of the girls, killing 5--killing 5--\nbefore shooting himself. The age of these girls was from 6 to 13 years \nold. These girls lost their lives because of a despicable act of hate \nbased on their gender.\n  There is no reason to come to the floor and say we can't do this bill \nbecause we have other very important business on our plate. Of course \nwe do. Of course we need to do the Defense bill. Of course we will do \nthe Defense bill. The last I checked, the Defense authorization usually \npasses practically unanimously. This isn't a problem. So we can deal \nwith this. We have done it before.\n  These stories demonstrate if America is to serve as a model for \ntolerance and justice, we must do everything in our power to fight \nhate-motivated violence, and this amendment is an important step in \nthat fight.\n  So to summarize what this amendment does, it would add gender, sexual \norientation, gender identity, or disability as protected categories \nunder our hate crimes laws. Second, the amendment removes the \nrequirement that a victim be engaged in a federally protected activity \nsuch as serving on a jury or attending a public school before the \ngovernment can act. Third, and very important, the amendment provides \nadditional Federal assistance to State and local authorities to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes. I talked about the letter from \nmy sheriff in Los Angeles County. Our law enforcement people need all \nthe help they can get when they are trying to solve a hate crime and \nthen trying to prosecute a hate crime. This bill will give them the \nassistance they deserve to have if they ask for such assistance. If \nthey don't act, this is a backup law. This says it is a Federal crime. \nThere is a nexus with interstate commerce, but as we know, that is not \ntoo hard to make.\n  So this basically says we are going to protect these individuals in \nour society who may be disabled and if they are discriminated against \nbecause they are a woman or a man--gender bias--or because of their \nsexual orientation.\n  Opponents of this amendment will say it punishes free speech and \nthought and that every crime will become a Federal hate crime. That is \npatently untrue. The hate crimes prevention amendment, as I said, is \nnarrow, and we know these crimes do occur. This isn't about punishing \nspeech. This isn't about punishing thoughts. If all that Matthew \nShepard had to deal with were taunts about his sexuality, his sexual \norientation, that would be one thing. He had to deal with murderers who \ntortured him. That is different. If they had said something to him and \nwalked out, that would be one thing. They acted on their hatred, and \nthat is un-American. It is un-American.\n  This amendment doesn't attempt to federalize all crimes, or even hate \ncrimes. The certification provision prevents the Federal Government \nfrom stepping into a case unless it can certify that doing so is \nnecessary to secure justice and is in the public interest. Thus, \nprosecutions that normally take place at the State and local level will \ncontinue to be handled there. The difference is we will then give them \nas a Federal Government all the tools they need from us.\n  This amendment is an important step as we continue to form a more \nperfect union, and we can't rest until we do this--and more. We can't \nrest until we pass laws to create a fair workplace for all. We can't \nrest until we pass a law that repeals ``don't ask, don't tell'' and \nallows our capable Americans and our patriotic Americans to serve our \ncountry. We are losing some of the best and brightest from our military \nbecause they don't want to live a lie. We can't rest until we pass laws \nto end racial profiling in our society. We can't rest until we pass \ncomprehensive laws to protect our children from violent crimes.\n  Years ago I wrote the Violence Against Children Act. I am still \nwaiting to get it passed. When someone takes up a hand against a child \nand injures that child and hurts that child, that is un-American too. \nIf there is a violent crime against a child, I believe the Federal \nGovernment ought to care and ought to help the local governments who \nare trying to solve that crime and punish that crime if they need help.\n  So we have a lot of work to do to form that more perfect union. \nInstead of arguing process today, why don't we have our friends come to \nthe floor and say: This is a wonderful opportunity now to take a step \nforward and pass this Hate Crimes Prevention amendment, which we have \nbeen trying to do for so long, and, of course, not slow down the \nDefense bill. There is no need to slow down the Defense bill. We can do \nboth.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and any kind of \nprocedural vote it takes to make it available to us on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I thank you very much, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly on the hate crimes legislation. The details of the bill have \nbeen explained. The statistics have been enumerated by a number of my \ncolleagues. Perhaps the most impressive statistic is the one from the \nAttorney General on 77,000 hate crimes.\n  I do believe it is time we act. This issue first came before the \nSenate back in 1997, some 12 years ago. Senator Kennedy was the \noriginator. At that time, he searched for cosponsors among Republicans, \nand I believe it is accurate to say that I was the only one who would \nsupport cosponsorship, and we moved the legislation forward by \npublishing an op-ed piece in the Washington Post.\n  I ask unanimous consent that op-ed piece be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am glad to say that since the time this \nissue has come before the Senate, there are now 18 Republican \ncosponsors. My sense is that there will be widespread, if not \nunanimous, support among the Democrats so that there is a very solid \nstatement respectively in the Senate.\n  Ordinarily, matters of criminal prosecution are left to the States. \nThe offense is prosecuted in the jurisdiction where it occurred. I have \na strong bias for local prosecutions as a generalization and developed \nthat concern from my own experience as a district attorney for the city \nand county of Philadelphia. Law enforcement ought to be local. But the \nbrutal fact of life is that when you deal with hate crimes--and there \nare many examples. In 1997 when Senator Kennedy and I first introduced \nthe bill, there was the case of racial matters--dragging an African-\nAmerican through the streets of a Texas town. There has since been many \nother brutal cases, one highly publicized of a gay young man, a victim \nof a hate crime in Wyoming.\n  Regrettably, discrimination for race or national origin continues \nuntil this day. There has recently been a publicized matter that \noccurred in Huntingdon Valley, a suburb of the city of Philadelphia, at \na swim club where the swim club operators negotiated with a group \nrepresenting Hispanic and African-American children, ages 5 to 11, to \noccupy a swimming pool, with the swimming pool's permission. When the \nyoungsters, Hispanics and African Americans, went to swim, there was, \naccording to the media reports--and I have spoken to people on both \nsides personally to find out what went on--there was animus hostility, \nracial comments directed at African Americans and the Hispanics, \nconduct which one would have thought America would have passed long \nago.\n  But it is as current as 2 weeks ago in the suburbs of my hometown of \nPhiladelphia, PA. The matter has moved forward. It has resulted in \nlawsuits being\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\nfiled. It would be my hope that a way could be found to handle the \nmatter to the satisfaction of all parties. But I can understand if the \nparents of the children involved want to pursue remedies. This is a \nmatter that could be handled by the civil rights division, which has \nprosecutorial authority and also has authority for mediation and \nreconciliation.\n  I cite that as an illustration of a matter that is as current as \ntoday's news on animus based on race, whether it be African Americans \nor Hispanics. It is my hope that this matter will receive prompt \nattention in the Senate and will be part of the pending legislation and \nit will go to conference and become the law of the land.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 1, 1997]\n\n             When Combating Hate Should Be a Federal Fight\n\n                (By Edward M. Kennedy and Arlen Specter)\n\n       The Post's Nov. 17 editorial criticizing the measure we \n     have introduced on hate crimes reflects a misunderstanding of \n     our proposal to close the gaps in federal law and a failure \n     to recognize the profound impact of hate crimes.\n       Hate crimes are uniquely destructive and divisive because \n     they injure not only the immediate victim, but the community \n     and sometimes the nation. The Post's conntention that a \n     ``victim of a bias-motivated stabbing is no more dead than \n     someone stabbed during a mugging'' suggests a distressing \n     misunderstanding of hate crimes. Random street crimes don't \n     provoke riots; hate crimes can and sometimes do.\n       The federal government has a role in dealing with these \n     offenses. Although states and local governments have the \n     principal responsibility for prosecuting hate crimes, there \n     are exceptional circumstances in which it is appropriate for \n     the federal government to prosecute such cases.\n       Hate crimes often are committed by individuals with ties to \n     groups that operate across state lines. The Confederate \n     Hammerskins are a skinhead group that began terrorizing \n     minorities and Jews in Tennessee, Texas and Oklahoma a decade \n     ago.\n       Federal law enforcement authorities are well situated to \n     investigate and prosecute criminal activities by such groups, \n     and the federal government has taken the lead in successfully \n     prosecuting these skinheads.\n       Hate crimes disproportionately involve multiple offenders \n     and multiple incidents and in such cases, overriding \n     procedural considerations--including gaps in state laws--may \n     justify federal prosecution.\n       In Lubbock, Tex., three white supremacists attempted to \n     start a local race war in 1994 by shooting three African \n     American victims, one fatally, in three separate incidents in \n     20 minutes. Under Texas law, each defendant would have been \n     entitled to a separate trial in a state court, and each \n     defendant also might have been entitled to a separate trial \n     for each shooting. The result could have been at least three, \n     and perhaps as many as nine trials, in the state courts, and \n     the defendants, if convicted, would have been eligible for \n     parole in 20 years. They faced a mandatory life sentence in \n     federal court.\n       Federal and local prosecutors, working together, decided to \n     deal with these crimes under federal laws. The defendants \n     were tried together in federal court, convicted and are \n     serving mandatory life sentences. The victims and their \n     families were not forced to relive their nightmare in \n     multiple trials.\n       Federal involvement in the prosecutions of hate crimes \n     dates back to the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War. \n     These laws were updated a generation ago in 1968, but they \n     are no longer adequate to meet the current challenge. As a \n     result, the federal government is waging the battle against \n     hate crimes with one hand tied behind its back.\n       Current federal law covers crimes motivated by racial, \n     religious or ethnic prejudice. Our proposal adds violence \n     motivated by prejudice against the sexual orientation, gender \n     or disability of the victim. Our proposal also makes it \n     easier for federal authorities to prosecute racial violence, \n     in the same way that the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 \n     helped federal prosecutors deal with the rash of racially \n     motivated church arsons.\n       The suggestion in the editorial that our bill tramples \n     First Amendment rights is ludicrous. Our proposal applies \n     only to violent acts, not hostile words or threats. Nobody \n     can seriously suggest that the neo-Nazis who murdered Fred \n     Mangione in a Houston nightclub last year because they \n     ``wanted to get a fag'' were engaged in a constitutionally \n     protected freedom of speech.\n       In addition, hate-crimes prosecution under our bill must be \n     approved by the attorney general or another high-ranking \n     Justice Department official, not just by local federal \n     prosecutors. This ensures federal restraint and that states \n     will continue to take the lead in prosecuting hate crimes.\n       From 1990 through 1996, there were 37 federal hate crimes \n     prosecutions nationwide under the law we are amending--fewer \n     than six a year out of more than 10,000 hate crimes \n     nationwide. Our bill should result in a modest increase in \n     the number of federal prosecutions of hate crimes.\n       When Congress passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act in \n     1990, we recognized the need to document the scope of hate \n     crimes. We now know enough about the problem, and it is time \n     to take the next step.\n       As the Lubbock prosecution shows, combating hate crimes is \n     not exclusively a state or local challenge or a federal \n     challenge. It is a challenge best addressed by federal, state \n     and local authorities working together. Our proposal gives \n     all prosecutors another tool in their anti-crime arsenal. The \n     issue is tolerance, and the only losers under our proposal \n     will be the bigots who seek to divide the country through \n     violence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in support of the vital \nlegislation that is long overdue. More than a decade has passed since \nMatthew Shepard was brutally murdered. Yet the bill that bears his name \nis still not law.\n  The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act has broad bipartisan \nsupport here in the Senate, passed handily in the House, and has the \nunequivocal support of the President and the Attorney General. Indeed, \nAttorney General Holder recently told the Senate Judiciary Committee \nthat passage of this legislation is one of ``his highest personal \npriorities.''\n  It is essential that we act now to pass this amendment and make the \nMatthew Shepard Act the law of the land.\n  According to FBI statistics, more than 9,000 violent hate crimes were \nperpetrated in 2007. However, experts tell us that since hate crimes \noften go unreported, the actual number is an order of magnitude higher.\n  Whatever the number--all hate crimes are unacceptable. They are \ncrimes inflicted not merely on individuals, but on entire communities. \nAs Mr. Holder put it, ``perpetrators of hate crimes seek to deny the \nhumanity that we all share, regardless of the color of our skin, the \nGod to whom we pray, or whom we choose to love.''\n  Let me be clear: this legislation does not criminalize speech or \nhateful thoughts. It seeks only to punish action--violent action that \nundermines the core values of our Nation.\n  This legislation strengthens the ability of State and local \ngovernments to prosecute hate crimes by ``'providing grants to help \nthem meet the often onerous expenses involved in investigating these \ncrimes. It also enables the Justice Department to assist State and \nlocal governments in prosecuting hate crimes, or to step in when these \ngovernments fail to act.\n  Even though the aggregate number of hate crimes has slightly \ndecreased nationally over the past decade, the number of crimes against \ncertain groups has risen. Hispanic Americans have increasingly become \nthe target of bigots' rage. And, according to a recent AP story, the \nnumber of fatal hate crimes against LGBT people increased by a shocking \n30 percent last year.\n  Indeed, late last year, there was a particularly chilling hate crime \nperpetrated in New York against an Ecuadorian man named Jose Osvaldo. \nJose, a father of two, was walking home with his arm around his brother \nand was viciously attacked with an aluminum baseball bat while his \nperpetrators yelled anti-gay and anti-immigrant slurs.\n  This legislation sends a clear message to those perpetrators and to \nall others: in America, we do not tolerate acts of violence motivated \nby hatred of vulnerable communities. In America, you are free to be \nyourself, and you should never be attacked for doing so.\n  What message will it send to Americans if we fail to pass this \namendment? I wonder and I worry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to speak in favor of \nthe pending amendment, the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. \nThis is similar to an amendment we considered last year to try to \nadvance the modifications of the Federal hate crimes statute.\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\n  Some have questioned whether we need this act. They claim that the \ninstances of hate crimes in America have diminished. I wish that were \nthe case. I wish we did not need to have a separate law to deal with \nhate-motivated violent acts in America.\n  All we need to look at is what happened at the Holocaust Museum on \nJune 15 of this year, when Stephen Johns, a security guard, was \nmurdered. He was murdered by someone who had extreme views. Look at \nLawrence King, a 15-year-old who died on February 12, 2008, because he \nwas gay; or look at what happened after the last elections, when two \nmen went on a killing spree to find African Americans; or look at what \nhappened in July 2008, when four teenagers were brutally beaten up \nbecause they were immigrants.\n  All we need to look at are the FBI statistics that indicate in 2007 \nthere were 7,600 hate crimes in America. That is the reported hate \ncrimes. We know many of these acts go unreported and the numbers are \nmuch larger. Ethnic communities are reporting an increase in violent \nacts motivated by hate.\n\n  Unfortunately, this law is needed, and we need to strengthen the law \nso it can effectively accomplish its purpose. What do I mean by that? \nThis amendment, this law, builds on federalism. It builds on what our \nStates are already doing to combat these crimes. Forty-five States have \nseparate laws that deal with hate crimes--31 deal with violence against \nsomeone because of their sexual orientation, 27 include gender \nviolence. What we need to do is strengthen our Federal law so \nfederalism, in fact, can work.\n  The Federal Government has resources which the States don't always \nhave to be able to pursue these types of violent acts. This amendment \nwould strengthen the Federal statute so it would apply to acts of \nviolence based upon someone's gender, sexual orientation, or \ndisability. And it would go beyond the current Federal law, which only \nallows Federal involvement if the crime occurs during some protected \nactivity.\n  It also provides the resources to help our States, in that the bill \nprovides grants to State, local, and tribal law enforcement entities \nfor prosecution, programming, and education related to hate crimes \nprosecution and prevention.\n  The bill contains a requirement that the Department of Justice \ncertify that Federal prosecution is necessary because the States cannot \nor will not effectively prosecute the crime. This is to supplement the \nactions of the State, to work with our States, to respect what \nfederalism should be about. Most of these matters will be handled by \nthe State, but the Federal Government may be able to help the State, \nand this bill will allow us to do exactly that.\n  The bill also contains provisions broadening the categories of hate \ncrimes tracked by the FBI. So these are improvements in the law that \nwill maintain our ability to deal with this type of outrageous \nactivity.\n  Some have questioned: Well, isn't every violent crime a hate crime? \nThe answer is no. A hate crime occurs because the perpetrator \nintentionally selects the victim because of who the victim is. Similar \nto actions of terrorism, hate crimes have a greater impact because they \ncannot only affect the victim, they affect our entire community. We are \nall diminished when someone in our community is violated because of his \nor her ethnic background or because of race or sexual orientation.\n  We need to speak to our national priorities. This amendment speaks to \nwhat America should stand for--that we will not permit or tolerate \nsomeone to be victimized because of that person's gender or race or \nbecause of that person's sexual orientation or disability.\n  This is a bill that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support in this \nbody. Many of us have worked for many years in order to improve the \nFederal Government's ability to respond in these areas. This is the \nnext chapter that needs to be done. I hope my colleagues will do what \nwe did in the prior Congress and pass this amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill so we can move forward to strengthen our resolve \nagainst this type of hate activity in America.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, watching the Senate floor \nduring the debate over health care reform, I cannot help but feel that \nsome of my colleagues are a little confused. It is almost as if they \nhave forgotten that this discussion is going on in America, not Canada. \nThey don't want to talk about the 22,000 Americans who died in 2006 \nbecause they do not have insurance. They don't want to talk about the \nmore than half a million Americans who file for bankruptcy after \nincurring unpayable medical bills. They don't want to talk about the \nmillions of other Americans who worry that they are one layoff away \nfrom losing coverage and one heart attack away from losing everything.\n  No, they want to talk about Canada. I am not saying we should not \nsympathize with our neighbors to the north, but I wish to talk about \nhow we can fix the health care system for the American people, for the \npeople of New Mexico, since none of the plans we are considering would \nset up a Canadian system.\n  Let's look at how we can pass an American solution to the problems \nfaced by Americans. If you like the coverage you have, you should be \nable to keep it, and none of the plans we are considering would take \naway the options Americans already have. But the status quo is not \nenough. We need to give consumers another option. We need to give them \nthe freedom to choose a quality, affordable, public health option. \nAfter all, what is more American than competition and choice? Even if \nour private market functioned perfectly, it would make sense to give \nconsumers another choice. But our health care system doesn't function \nperfectly. Our system provides too little choice and too little quality \nat too high a price. Too many of America's health care markets are \neffectively monopolies, or at best duopolies. According to a recent \nstudy by the American Medical Association, most American metropolitan \nareas are dominated by one private insurer, and others are largely \ndominated by just two. In New Mexico, the top two companies have 65 \npercent of the market. To put that in perspective, Dell, Compaq, \nGateway, HP, and IBM combine for less than 54 percent of the U.S. \npersonal computer market. I have to believe we can offer our consumers \nmore than two choices of health plans.\n  My State is a rural State, and in rural areas such as ours consumers \noften have less choice. They get to pay whatever the local health care \nplan wants or go without insurance. Insurance companies have used this \nmonopoly power to offer less and to charge more. As consolidation has \nincreased since 2000, insurers have raised deductibles and copayments \nwithout increasing coverage, and they have continued to make healthy \nprofits while their customers struggle to keep up with rising costs. \nPremiums for employer-sponsored health care have almost doubled since \n1999, but rising costs have not hurt health care company CEOs. The top \n10 CEOs managed to pull down $85.4 million in 2008.\n  Even worse, what competition we have doesn't keep companies honest. \nInstead, they compete to avoid the poor and the sick. In New Mexico, an \ninsurance company can charge a customer more because of a health \nproblem from 5 years ago or because he happens to be 45 years old and \nnot 44. They can even charge a woman more because she might get \npregnant. They have every incentive to do so.\n  When a private insurance company turns down somebody who needs help, \nits profits go up. When it denies needed care, it has more money for \nits shareholders. That is a broken system.\n  In New Mexico, we have seen the impact of unaffordable health care. \nAlmost one in four New Mexicans is uninsured and nearly half our \ncitizens have inadequate coverage. The vast majority of these people \nare employed, but they and their employers simply cannot afford \ncoverage.\n  A constituent of mine from Cedar Crest, NM, wrote me the other day to\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\nexplain she and her husband cannot afford to offer their employees \nhealth care at a small manufacturing company they own. The rates for \nsmall businesses such as theirs are unaffordable.\n  Our high numbers of uninsured citizens cost the rest of us money. The \naverage New Mexico family with insurance pays an additional $2,300 just \nto cover the price of the uninsured--$2,300. You see, if a New Mexican \nwith diabetes has insurance, his insurance company can pay a small \namount to have him receive routine tests and treatments from a \npodiatrist. But if a New Mexican is uninsured, he is less likely to \nreceive checkups. As a result, he is more likely to miss the telltale \nsigns of a circulatory problem and twice as likely to need an \namputation.\n  Diabetes amputations cost almost $39,000, and New Mexico did 366 of \nthese procedures in 2003 for a total of $4.2 million. When a diabetic \nhas a limb amputated, the operation is only the beginning of the \nmedical services he will need. For the uninsured, those costs fall on \nevery family with insurance.\n  Some of my colleagues admit that the status quo does not work, but \nthey claim a government regulator can keep the private HMOs in line; we \nwill not need more regulation if open competition can be more \neffective. Others just claim that a public health care option will not \nwork, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Experts have developed a \nnumber of viable plans to give Americans the choice of a quality, \naffordable public option. More than 30 State governments offer their \nemployees a choice between private insurance and a State-backed public \noption, including my State of New Mexico. These States have not found \nthis strategy unworkable. They have not seen either public or private \ncoverage dominate the market. Their employees just have another choice. \nWhat would be wrong with that?\n  The truth is, this Congress has a very simple decision to make. We \ncan stick with our current system or we can give Americans another \noption that guarantees quality, affordable care. Opponents of reform do \nnot want to talk about that decision so they talk about Canada. But the \ndecision before us has nothing to do with Canada. It is about the \nAmerican people. They have been stuck in a broken system too long, and \nit is time to give them another choice.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            aung san suu kyi\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to address \nthe situation in Burma.\n  Though it has faded from the headlines, the outrageous detention and \ntrial of Aung San Suu Kyi, that astonishingly courageous Burmese \nleader, continues. Ms. Suu Kyi, who has spent the majority of the past \ntwo decades under house arrest, is being held at the notorious Insein \nPrison compound. She was charged with crimes following the arrival at \nher house of an uninvited American man who swam across a nearby lake. \nHe then reportedly stayed on her compound for 2 days, despite requests \nto leave. Based on this occurrence, the regime charged Ms. Suu Kyi with \ncrimes and ordered her to stand trial in late May. Since then, she has \nbeen jailed and awaits possible conviction and up to 5 years in prison.\n  Let us recall that this long-suffering woman is, in fact, the \nlegitimately elected leader of that country. To this day, the generals \nrefuse to recognize the 1990 elections, in which the Ms. Suu Kyi's \nNational League for Democracy was victorious. Instead, they plan to \nproceed with ``elections,'' to be held next year, that they evidently \nbelieve will legitimize their illegitimate rule. The ruling regime \nseeks ways to ensure that Ms. Suu Kyi and other NLD members are not \nfree to participate in these elections, since it is the NLD--and not \nthe military junta--that has the support of the Burmese people. As an \nestimated 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, fill \nBurmese jails, the international community should see this process for \nthe sham that it represents.\n  I once had the great honor of meeting Aung San Suu Kyi. She is a \nwoman of astonishing courage and incredible resolve. Her determination \nin the face of tyranny inspires me, and every individual who holds \ndemocracy dear. Her resilience in the face of untold sufferings, her \ncourage at the hands of a cruel regime, and her composure despite years \nof oppression inspire the world. Burma's rulers fear Aung San Suu Kyi \nbecause of what she represents--peace, freedom and justice for all \nBurmese people. The thugs who run Burma have tried to stifle her voice, \nbut they will never extinguish her moral courage.\n\n  Earlier this month, the United Nations Secretary-General traveled to \nBurma in an attempt to press the regime on its human rights abuses. The \nruling generals reacted in their typical fashion. They stage managed \nBan Ki-moon's visit, even refusing his request to speak before a \ngathering of diplomats and humanitarian groups.\n  Instead, before leaving, he was forced to speak at the regime's drug \nelimination museum. He was also refused a meeting with Aung San Suu \nKyi. Burmese officials stated that their judicial regulations would not \npermit a meeting with an individual currently on trial. Incredible. \nFollowing his visit to Burma, the Secretary-General pointed out that \nallowing a meeting with Ms. Suu Kyi would have been an important symbol \nof the government's willingness to embark on the kind of meaningful \nengagement essential to credible elections in 2010. He is right, and \nthe regime's refusal is simply the latest sign that meaningful \nengagement is not on its list of priorities.\n  It is incumbent on all those in the international community who care \nabout human rights to respond to the junta's outrages. The work of Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and the members of the National League for Democracy must \nbe the world's work. We must continue to press the junta until it is \nwilling to negotiate an irreversible transition to democratic rule.\n  The Burmese people deserve no less. This means renewing the sanctions \nthat will expire this year, and it means vigorous enforcement by our \nTreasury Department of the targeted financial sanctions in place \nagainst regime leaders. And it means being perfectly clear that we \nstand on the side of freedom for the Burmese people and against those \nwho seek to abridge it.\n  The message of solidarity with the Burmese people should come from \nall quarters, and that includes their closest neighbors--the ASEAN \ncountries. The United States, European countries, and others have \ncondemned Ms. Suu Kyi's arrest and called for her immediate release. \nThe countries of Southeast Asia should be at the forefront of this \ncall.\n  ASEAN now has a human rights charter in which member countries have \ncommitted to protect and promote human rights. Now is the time to live \nup to that commitment, and ASEAN could start by dispatching envoys to \nRangoon in order to demand the immediate, unconditional release of Aung \nSan Suu Kyi.\n  Following the visit of the U.N. Secretary-General, the Burmese \nrepresentative to the U.N. stated that the government is planning to \ngrant amnesty to a number of prisoners so they may participate in the \n2010 general elections. ASEAN states should demand the implementation \nof this pledge to include all political prisoners currently in jail, \nincluding Ms. Suu Kyi.\n  Secretary of State Clinton will travel to Thailand later this month \nto participate in the ASEAN Regional Forum. I urge her to take up this \nissue with her Southeast Asian colleagues.\n  Too many years have passed without the smallest improvement in Burma. \nAnd although the situation there is replete with frustration and worse, \nit is not hopeless.\n  We know from history that tyranny will not forever endure, and Burma \nwill be no exception. Aung San Suu Kyi, and all those Burmese who have \nfollowed her lead in pressing for their own inalienable rights, should \nknow: All free peoples stand with you and support you. The world is \nwatching not\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\nonly your brave actions but also those of the military government, \nwhere cruelty and incompetence know no bounds.\n  Burma's future will be one of peace and freedom, not violence and \nrepression. We, as Americans, stand on the side of freedom, not fear; \nof peace, not violence; and of the millions of people in Burma who \naspire to a better life, not those who would keep them isolated and \noppressed.\n  The United States has a critical role to play, in Burma and \nthroughout the world, as the chief voice for the rights and integrity \nof all persons. Nothing can relieve us of the responsibility to stand \nfor those whose human rights are in peril, nor of the knowledge that we \nstand for something in this world greater than self-interest.\n  Should we need inspiration to guide us, we need look no further than \nto that astonishingly courageous leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta's \nlatest actions are, once again, a desperate attempt by a decaying \nregime to stall freedom's inevitable process in Burma and across Asia. \nThey will fail as surely as Aung San Suu Kyi's campaign for a free \nBurma will one day succeed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from BBC News entitled ``Inside Burma's Insein Prison'' and \nan AP article entitled ``Myanmar junta stage-manages visit by UN \nchief.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From BBC NEWS, May 14, 2009]\n\n                      Inside Burma's Insein Prison\n\n       Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is being held \n     in the notorious Insein jail in Rangoon, after being charged \n     with violating the terms of her house arrest.\n       Human rights campaigners say incarceration at the top \n     security prison, which is known as the ``darkest hell-hole in \n     Burma'', could be tantamount to a death sentence--especially \n     as the 63-year-old's health is known to be fragile.\n       Bo Kyi, now joint secretary of Assistance Association for \n     Political Prisoners (Burma), has firsthand experience of life \n     in Insein jail.\n       He was jailed for more than seven years for political \n     dissent, and was kept in solitary confinement for more than a \n     year, in a concrete cell that was about 8ft by 12ft (2.5m by \n     3.5m).\n       There was no toilet in the cell--just a bucket filled with \n     urine and feces. He slept on a mat on the floor.\n       Mr Kyi says he was tortured and beaten by the prison \n     guards. He was shackled in heavy chains, with a metal bar \n     between his legs, which made it difficult to walk.\n       Every morning for about two weeks, he says he was made to \n     ``exercise''--forced to adopt awkward positions and if he \n     failed he was brutally beaten.\n       During this time he was not allowed to shower and was \n     forced to sleep on bare concrete.\n\n\n                              Disease rife\n\n       He was later moved from isolation and shared an overcrowded \n     cell with four other political prisoners.\n       He says the prison has the capacity to house 5,000-6,000 \n     prisoners. He estimates there are currently some 10,000 in \n     detention.\n       Once a week they were able to wash their clothes. But \n     during the stifling summers he said there was no water to \n     bathe.\n       With only three prison doctors to treat 10,000 inmates, he \n     says diseases such as tuberculosis, scabies and dysentery \n     were rife. Mental illness was also widespread.\n       Bo Kyi says Aung San Suu Kyi is most likely being held in a \n     special compound built for her detention in 2003, which has a \n     wooden bed and a toilet.\n       Although the conditions there are probably not as bad as in \n     the rest of the prison, he says he is still extremely \n     concerned for her well-being.\n\n\n                         `Totally unacceptable'\n\n       Ms Suu Kyi has spent more than 11 of the past 19 years in \n     some form of detention under Burma's military government.\n       She was jailed at Insein prison in May 2003, after clashes \n     between opposition activists and supporters of the regime.\n       Her latest period of house arrest was extended last year--a \n     move which analysts say is illegal even under the junta's own \n     rules. It is due to expire on 27 May.\n       Human rights activist Debbie Stothard, from the pressure \n     group Altsean-Burma, has urged the international community to \n     intervene in trying to secure Ms Suu Kyi's release.\n       ``Many people have died when they have been detained in \n     Insein, that's a proven fact.\n       ``The fact that Aung San Suu Kyi . . . now might be subject \n     to a life-threatening detention condition--it's totally \n     unacceptable,'' she said.\n       ``It's totally unjust and it's time that Asean, China and \n     the rest of the international community finally put their \n     foot down.''\n       Many analysts believe that pro-democracy leader's arrest is \n     a pretext by the military regime to keep her detained until \n     elections expected in 2010.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        [From AP, July 6, 2009]\n\n             Myanmar Junta Stage-Manages Visit by UN Chief\n\n                           (By John Heilprin)\n\n       Yangon, Myanmar.--Myanmar's ruling junta wanted Ban Ki-moon \n     to go into a grandiose drug museum through the back door to \n     prevent the U.N. secretary-general from making a rock-star \n     entrance.\n       Ban eventually did walk through the front door--a small \n     victory after he had lost far bigger battles, notably a \n     hoped-for meeting with jailed democracy leader Aung San Suu \n     Kyi (pronounced ong sahn SUE CHEE).\n       After a two-day visit in which the generals tried to stage-\n     manage the world's top diplomat at every step, Ban left the \n     country with few prospects of even slightly loosening the \n     iron grip on power held by military regime and its junta \n     chief, Senior Gen. Than Shwe.\n       If people saw Ban acting independently in Myanmar ``that \n     would cause Than Shwe to lose face,'' said Donald Seekins, a \n     Myanmar expert at Japan's Meio University. ``So they want to \n     manipulate him.''\n       By snubbing Ban, the country's military rulers lost an \n     opportunity to improve its standing among many of the world's \n     nations that view the struggling country with rich reserves \n     of gas and minerals as a pariah.\n       Inside Myanmar, Suu Kyi's opposition party said Than Shwe \n     (pronounced TAHN SHWAY) showed he is unwilling to permit real \n     change ahead of the 2010 elections, which would be the first \n     in two decades.\n       Ban had asked to make his closing speech to diplomats and \n     humanitarian groups Saturday at a hotel, but the junta \n     refused and forced him to instead speak at the government's \n     Drug Elimination Museum.\n       Ban's staff didn't want his presence there--where a wax \n     figure depicts a military intelligence chief chopping opium \n     poppies, which Myanmar views as a scourge introduced by \n     colonialists--to appear like another prop furthering the \n     government's agenda.\n       ``They fought us over every last detail,'' said a U.N. \n     official who took part in organizing the trip, speaking \n     anonymously and out of protocol because of the sensitivity of \n     the matter.\n       Ban--whose mild-mannered facade belies a toughness and \n     occasional temper--would have preferred a tete-a-tete with \n     Than Shwe to having note-taking aides around, an example of \n     his belief in his ability to sway recalcitrant world leaders \n     if only he can get them alone in a room.\n       But Than Shwe's idea of a tete-a-tete was to pit himself \n     and the other four generals who together make up the ruling \n     State Peace and Development Council against Ban and some \n     high-ranking U.N. deputies in the rarely visited capital of \n     Naypyitaw, according to U.N. officials.\n       The 76-year-old Than Shwe suggested that Ban might not be \n     invited back until after the elections.\n       Ban said Than Shwe promised to hand over power to civilians \n     after the elections. But the generals refused to follow U.N. \n     recommendations intended to prevent sham elections, including \n     publishing an election law and freeing Suu Kyi and 2,200 \n     other political prisoners to ensure general participation.\n       ``Only then will the elections be seen as credible and \n     legitimate,'' Ban told reporters Monday in Geneva, \n     Switzerland.\n       The government refused to honor the results of the 1990 \n     elections after Suu Kyi's party won in a landslide. The junta \n     tolerates no dissent and crushed pro-democracy protests led \n     by Buddhist monks in September 2007.\n       At the end of the trip, Ban tried to defuse the notion he \n     was returning empty-handed.\n       He said the visit was an opportunity to plant seeds that \n     could blossom later and that he was dutifully relaying the \n     international community's message the elections must be seen \n     as credible.\n       In the meantime, Ban said he will keep talks alive with \n     Than Shwe through the so-called Group of Friends on Myanmar.\n       That approach hasn't nudged Myanmar on key issues. Nor have \n     eight previous visits by Ibrahim Gambari, Ban's top envoy to \n     Myanmar, produced many results.\n       ``Than Shwe is using the United Nations as a way of buying \n     time or distracting people from the main issues, so it isn't \n     very constructive,'' Seekins said. ``I don't think Than Shwe \n     is willing to make political concessions, especially \n     concerning Aung San Suu Kyi. I think he would really like to \n     put her away in jail and not have to worry about her.''\n       In the absence of Suu Kyi, it was left to Ban to deliver \n     unusually stinging remarks about the government, its \n     pummeling of human rights and the urgent need to set a new \n     course.\n       When he took the stage at the museum, it was a rarity in \n     the military's half-century of dominance--an outside \n     political figure allowed to say what he wants.\n       And after much haggling, Ban's black Mercedes was allowed \n     to pull up to the front door of the museum. There, his \n     motorcade disgorged a small entourage of aides and a half-\n     dozen international journalists. Local press awaited him \n     inside.\n       That also ensured an audience for him in Myanmar and \n     beyond--another small victory.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, from the story of the Burmese prison, let \nme quote:\n\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\n\n       Human rights campaigners say incarceration at the top \n     security prison, which is known as the ``darkest hell-hole in \n     Burma'', could be tantamount to a death sentence--especially \n     as the 63-year-old's health--\n\n  Referring to Aung San Suu Kyi's health----\n\n     is known to be fragile.\n       Bo Kyi, now joint secretary of Assistance Association for \n     Political Prisoners (Burma), has firsthand experience of life \n     in Insein jail.\n       He was jailed for more than seven years for political \n     dissent, and was kept in solitary confinement for more than a \n     year, in a concrete cell that was about 8ft by 12ft. . . .\n       There was no toilet in the cell--just a bucket filled with \n     urine and faeces. He slept on a mat on the floor.\n       Mr. Kyi says he was tortured and beaten by the prison \n     guards. He was shackled in heavy chains, with a metal bar \n     between his legs, which made it difficult to walk.\n       Every morning for about two weeks, he says he was made to \n     ``exercise''--forced to adopt awkward positions and if he \n     failed he was brutally beaten.\n       During this time he was not allowed to shower and was \n     forced to sleep on bare concrete.\n\n  It goes on.\n  So she is there in that prison. I hope and pray the treatment she is \nreceiving is not anywhere along the lines of what this prison is well \nknown for.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague from \nArizona, Senator McCain, for his great leadership and for his important \nwords about Burma. No one would know better than Senator McCain about \nthe human rights violations of someone held in a prison such as that.\n  As he is aware, on a bipartisan basis, the women Senators have come \ntogether to support Aung San Suu Kyi and her fight in Burma.\n  I would also add, I recently met with a Burmese community in my \nState. They are concerned about their relatives there and everything \nthat is happening in that country. We have someone in our office whose \nrelatives are in Burma.\n  So I thank the Senator for his words and also for his leadership on \nthe amendment, the Levin-McCain amendment to strike the $1.75 billion \nadded to the bill that is on the floor to purchase additional F-22 \naircraft that have not been requested by the Pentagon.\n  This is a very difficult issue for many people in this Chamber, \nincluding the Senator from Arizona. But we all know in the end what \ncounts is to do the right thing for our troops and for our national \nsecurity.\n  This amendment truly gives us an important choice: Will we continue \nto pour billions into unproven weapons systems, despite repeated cost \noverruns and program delays or are we going to make the hard choices \nnecessary to ensure that our troops in the field have what they need to \nfight present and future conflicts?\n  These F-22s, we know, possess unique flying capabilities, but not one \nhas ever flown over Iraq or Afghanistan. We have much more pressing \nneeds. Both the past President and the current President support this \namendment. I hope my colleagues will support it as well.\n  I am actually here to speak in support of the Matthew Shepard Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation which will \nhelp us fight hate crimes and make our communities safer.\n  Among other things, the bill would impose criminal penalties for \ntargeting a victim on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation \nor disability.\n  I wish to thank Senator Leahy for his work on this bill and, of \ncourse, Senator Kennedy for his work and leadership on the issue over \nthe years.\n  I have been involved with this piece of legislation for many years. \nIf you go way back to 2000, when I was the county prosecutor for \nMinnesota's largest county, I was actually called to Washington for the \nfirst time to take part in a ceremony in which the bill was introduced.\n  I remember this moment well because there I was with the President at \nthe time, President Clinton, and Attorney General Reno. We were ready \nto walk in for this ceremony to introduce the hate crimes bill. I was \nstanding outside, and the military band struck up ``Hail to the Chief'' \nbecause the President was entering the room. I started to walk, and all \nof a sudden I felt this big hand on my shoulder, and this voice said: I \nknow you are going to do great out there, but when they play that song \nI usually go first.\n  It is something I will never forget.\n  So here I am now, 9 years later, with this same bill. We are working \nvery hard to get this bill passed. I am hopeful we will be able to do \nthat.\n  What I remember most about that day back in 2000, however, was the \nmeeting I had with the investigators in the Matthew Shepard case. They \nwere two burly cops from Wyoming, and they talked about the fact that \nuntil they had investigated that horrible crime, they had not \nconsidered what the victim's, Matthew Shepard's, life was like.\n  When they got to know the family in the case, when they got to know \nthe mom, and they got to know the people surrounding Matthew Shepard, \ntheir own lives changed forever.\n  I hope by passing this bill we can prevent other Matthew Shepards \nfrom being targeted and deter hate crimes.\n  Attorney General Eric Holder recently appeared before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to talk about his support for this bill, and he \ngave us some somber statistics. He reported that ``there have been over \n77,000 hate crime incidents reported to the FBI'' from 1998 to 2007 or \n``nearly one hate crime every hour of every day'' for the past decade.\n  In my State of Minnesota, there were 157 reported offenses in 2007. \nBut when I think about this issue, it is not just about the statistics. \nIt is about the victims of these crimes.\n  When I was county prosecutor, we had a number of cases that were \nclearly motivated by hate. That was one of the reasons, actually, I was \nchosen to go out to Washington. And part of it was we had worked well \nwith the Federal prosecutors on some of the cases.\n  We had the case of a 14-year-old African-American boy who was minding \nhis own business, and a guy who did have some mental health issues told \nhis friends: I am going to go out and--he used a different word--but \nshoot a Black kid on Martin Luther King Day. And he did. And he almost \nkilled this little 14-year-old boy. But he survived, and we prosecuted \nthe case.\n  I also think about a young Hispanic man. He was working in a factory, \nand his boss got mad at him because he did not speak English and he was \nspeaking Spanish at work. His boss took a 2 by 4 and hit him over the \nhead, resulting in bleeding in his brain and brain damage--all for \nspeaking Spanish.\n  I also think about the case we had with a Hindu temple that was \nseverely vandalized by young kids. And I think about the case of a \nKorean church that had all kinds of hateful graffiti written on it. \nSome of these cases, as I said, were major attempted murder cases. Some \nof them were simply graffiti cases. But to the people in that church, \nto the people in that temple, it meant something much more.\n  That is why I was glad, at least in a few of these cases, we were \nable to use our State hate crimes legislation. Those were cases in \nMinnesota--a place where you might not think you would see these kinds \nof cases. But we did.\n  This bill in front of us, the Matthew Shepard hate crimes bill, will \nstrengthen the ability of Federal, State, local, and tribal governments \nto investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It increases the number of \npersonnel at the Treasury Department and the Department of Justice \nworking on hate crimes. It gives grants to State and local law \nenforcement officials investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. It \nauthorizes the Attorney General to provide resources and support to \nState, local, and tribal law enforcement officials for hate crime \ninvestigations and prosecutions.\n\n  In addition, this bill authorizes the Federal Government to step in \nwhen needed and prosecute hate crimes, when needed, after the Justice \nDepartment certifies that a Federal prosecution is necessary. While \nmost of these cases will continue to be handled by State and local \njurisdictions, the bill provides a Federal backstop for State and local \nlaw enforcement to deal with hate crimes that otherwise might not be \neffectively investigated and prosecuted or for when States request \nassistance. It is a backdrop. Think about how many other areas of the \nlaw where we have these kinds of backdrops. In the gun area, as the \nPresiding Officer is aware from his work in the State of\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\nNew Mexico, sometimes we have overlapping jurisdictions. The gun crime \nis a perfect example. State laws can apply, but sometimes the Feds will \ncome in or you will want them to come in and handle the case. The same \nwith drug crimes. It helps to have that Federal backdrop for the \ninvestigating power, for the sentencing power, and for many other \nthings. So this bill won't usurp the role of local law enforcement but, \nrather, supplement it when needed.\n  Finally, I wish to note that this legislation has the support of \nnumerous law enforcement organizations, including the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs, and the \nNational District Attorneys Association.\n  For years we have recognized the need for this legislation. I think \nback to 2000 when I was standing outside of the East Room with \nPresident Clinton when it was first introduced. For years we have known \nwe need this legislation, but year after year the forces of reaction \nhave stalled and blocked and tried to do everything they can to make it \ngo away. This must end.\n  A little over 40 years ago, Robert Kennedy broke the news to a crowd \nin Indianapolis that Martin Luther King, Jr., had just been \nassassinated. During his speech, Kennedy called on the crowd and the \ncountry to make an effort, to understand and to comprehend, and to \nreplace that violence, that stain of bloodshed with an effort to \nunderstand with compassion and love. We should answer his call today.\n  I look forward to the day--and I hope it will be very soon--when the \nHate Crimes Prevention Act becomes law. It is long overdue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the Defense authorization bill, \napparently stranded, unable to vote on an amendment that had been \noffered dealing with the issue of the F-22. The F-22 airplane is a \nremarkable airplane. I have talked to pilots who have flown it. I have \nseen it at Edwards Air Force Base. It is an extraordinary airplane.\n  It costs a lot of money. We have built as many as the Defense \nSecretary wants built at this point. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nthe Defense Secretary, the head of the Air Force, has indicated they \nwant to cap the F-22 at that number--I believe it is 187--and do not \nwish to build more. They say that is all we need. That is all we want.\n  There is a $1.75 billion fund that was put in this bill, now, as an \namendment in the Armed Services Committee, to build more F-22s. So the \namendment by the chairman of the committee and by Senator McCain, the \nranking member, was to take the $1.75 billion out of the bill. I \nsupport the amendment--not because I don't like the airplane, I do; but \nif those who are in charge of the Pentagon, Secretary Gates; Admiral \nMullen; the head of the Air Force, Secretary Donnelly; General Schwartz \nand others say we do not want anymore F-22s, don't need anymore F-22s \nto do the mission that we believe is necessary for that airplane, and \ninstead we want to move toward the Joint Strike Fighter--if that is \ntheir judgment, in my judgment we ought not put another billion back \ninto this bill. Yet that is what happened in the subcommittee.\n  I wish to call attention to the fiscal policy and where we are in \nthis country. President Obama has been in office a relatively short \nperiod of time. He inherited an unbelievable mess. There is no question \nabout that. We are in the deepest recession since the Great Depression. \nThere is a substantial decrease in revenues and increased spending this \nyear as a result of this very steep recession. Social service costs are \ngoing up, and there's more unemployment, more food stamps and so on. I \nbelieve there is close to a 20-percent reduction in revenue for the \ngovernment and close to a 20-percent increase in spending. On top of \nthat, Congress passed a stimulus or economic recovery program. All of \nthis has driven the deficit up in this fiscal year, a very sizable \ndeficit. That deficit will be very sizable next year and the year \nafter.\n  It begins to go down and then goes back up in the outyears. This is a \nfiscal policy that is not sustainable for our country. It just is not. \nIt is not a Democratic or Republican policy that is not sustainable, it \nis a fiscal policy of trillions and trillions of dollars of red ink \nthat we must change.\n  If we cannot even deal with the issue of adding $1.75 billion to \nbuild more planes that the Defense Department says they do not want, we \nwill hardly be able to deal with the more difficult fiscal problems in \nthe future. So I support the amendment offered by the chairman and the \nranking member. I hope we get a chance to vote on that amendment.\n  The issue of spending money we do not have, often on things we do not \nneed, is not new in any committee in this Congress. There are plenty of \nareas where we can take a pretty big slice out of spending. You can do \nit, not with just big programs, you can do it with smaller programs. I \nbrought to the floor a couple charts that show an issue that, in my \njudgment, is flatout total, complete, thorough government waste. I have \ntried, now, about 5 years in a row to get rid of it and have been \nunsuccessful. I finally got an amendment this past week added to an \nappropriations bill that shuts down the funding. But now we will see, \nthere will be a big fight on the floor to restore the funding. Let me \ntell you what this is.\n  Again, we are not talking about a lot of money. In my hometown, this \nwould be a lot of money, but my hometown is 300 people, so $20, $30 \nmillion is a lot of money.\n  This is a picture of Fat Albert, which is an aerostat blimp or \naerostat balloon. This is Fat Albert, purchased by the government. In \nfact, we purchased a couple of them so we can put it way up in the air \non a tether, and it would broadcast television signals into the country \nof Cuba because the Castro brothers run an operation down there that \ndoesn't provide any freedom to the Cuban people, so we are sending them \ntelevision signals to tell them how wonderful things are in the United \nStates and how awful things are in Cuba.\n  Actually, the Cuban people do not need those television signals to \nknow that because they can simply listen to Miami radio, or they can \nlisten to what is called Radio Marti, which actually gets into the \nmarket in Cuba. We broadcast Radio Marti. I don't object to that. It \ncosts a fair amount of money. I don't object to that. We get radio \nsignals into Cuba to tell the Cuban people what is going on in our \ncountry and the problems they face in their country.\n  I have been to Cuba. I think the Cuban people know pretty much the \nproblems they face with the Castro regime, a regime that squeezes the \nfreedom out of the Cuban people.\n  But here is the deal. We have aerostat balloons, first of all, to put \ntelevision signals into Cuba. The problem is we have spent a quarter of \na billion dollars doing it and the Cubans can't get the TV signal. Why? \nBecause the Castro government jams it easily. They jam it just like \nthat. We used to broadcast from 3 in the morning to 7 in the morning a \nsignal no one can see, so we use these balloons on a big tether and \nbroadcast a television signal to people who can't see it. We kept \nspending money thinking it was a great thing to do, broadcasting a \ntelevision signal nobody can see. In fact, one of these balloons got \nloose, got off its mooring, and wound up somewhere in the Everglades. \nThey had a devil of a time trying to catch this balloon; and another \nballoon disappeared in a hurricane, and they have never seen it since.\n  They decided, you know what, we can actually clip the American \ntaxpayer for more than a balloon. What we will do is buy an airplane \nand broadcast the television signal the Cuban people can't see from an \nairplane, so the American taxpayers bought an airplane. It flies, I \nthink, 5 or 6 days a week, broadcasting television signals into Cuba \nthat the Cubans block, that no one can see.\n  You talk about ignorant? At a time when we are deep in debt, spending \nmoney we don't have to broadcast television signals to people who can't \nget it? That is unbelievable to me.\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\n  Here is what the Cuban people see. All of us have seen bad television \nwith snow covering the entire screen. Here is what is broadcast--it is \nprograms with caricatures of the Castro brothers. The Cubans don't need \nto be reminded the Castro brothers are a scourge in that government.\n  Let me describe what John Nichols, who is a professor of \ncommunications and international affairs at Penn State University, has \nsaid:\n\n       TV Marti's response to this succession of failures over a \n     two-decade period has been to resort to ever more expensive \n     technological gimmicks, all richly funded by Congress. And \n     none of these gimmicks, such as the airplane, have worked . . \n     . It's just the laws of physics. In short, TV Marti is a \n     highly wasteful and ineffective operation. . . .\n\n  Even as I speak, I assume our airplane is broadcasting a television \nsignal to the Cuban people who cannot receive it.\n\n       TV Marti's quest to overcome the laws of physics has been a \n     flop.\n\n  John Nichols says, the same witness.\n\n       Aero Marti, the airborne platform for TV Marti, has no \n     audience currently in Cuba, and it is a complete and total \n     waste of $6 million a year in taxpayer dollars. The audience \n     of TV Marti, particularly the Aero platform is probably zero. \n     . . .\n\n  Talking now about the airplane platform.\n  We are talk about the GAO report.\n\n       The best available research indicates that TV Marti's \n     audience size is small . . . telephone surveys have reported \n     less than 1 percent had watched TV Marti over the last week.\n\n  I don't know what 1 percent is. I don't know what less than 1 percent \nis. That is minuscule, right? But I have offered an amendment that \ntakes out about $15 million to support TV Marti, which is a program \nthat has now wasted about a quarter of a billion dollars sending \ntelevision signals to Cuba that no one in Cuba can see. You know what, \nit is very hard to get this kind of thing stopped.\n  The reason I wish to mention it today is we are on the floor talking \nabout $1.75 billion for the F-22. We are, I assume--almost everyone \nhere is supporting the next generation fighter we are building, the \nJoint Strike Fighter. But the Pentagon says they want to stop and not \norder anymore of the F-22s. It is a reasonable thing, to me, that being \ndeep in debt, choking on red ink, at least we might want to accept the \nrecommendation of not building that which they do not want. At least \nwith respect to Aerostat balloons and airplanes and television signals \nto Cuba that no one can see, the very least the taxpayers should expect \nof us is that perhaps we would stop spending money sending television \nsignals to no one. Maybe that is not too much to ask.\n  Let me ask consent to speak in morning business for 5 minutes on a \ndifferent subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today House and Senate leaders appointed \nmembers for a Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. That is the title, \nthe Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. I have been calling for both a \ncommission and also a select committee of the Congress because I think \nthat we have a requirement and responsibility to establish what is the \nnarrative that has caused this economic and financial crisis in this \ncountry. We are in a deep financial crisis and have been for some long \nwhile.\n  This didn't happen as a result of some giant hurricane or some \ntornado or some flood, or some other natural disaster visiting our \ncountry. No, this was not a natural disaster. This happened as a result \nof decisions being made by human beings here among us. The question is \nwho? And what decisions? How did this happen? What is the narrative \nthat has caused the most significant crisis since the Great Depression?\n  Very smart economists have said, you know what, over a long period of \ntime from the Great Depression forward, we created stabilizers in this \ncountry so we would not see steep recessions or certainly not a \ndepression in our future. We are evening things out, they would say, \nand that was probably true for a while, but this recession is deep, \nthis hole is steep. The question is, What caused it? What happened.\n  I support the creation of a commission today. I offered legislation \nin January of this year, called the Taxpayer Protection Act, which \ncalled for the creation of a commission to investigate this financial \ncrisis. My colleagues, Senator Conrad and Senator Isakson, similarly \noffered a commission proposal, a piece of legislation during debate \nearlier this year. I support the notion of going forward. The \nappointments today to this Commission are welcome. I hope the \nCommission does all that is necessary to uncover what has happened \nhere.\n  I still believe we need a Select Committee in the Senate. The New \nYork Times said it in an editorial, nothing can substitute for the work \nthe Senate must do itself. I say that because we now have, in recent \ndays, additional news items in the paper you read. Let me pick one. I \ndon't mean to pick this company out just to be punitive, but it is a \ngood example in recent days: Wells Fargo.\n  Wells Fargo is a FDIC-insured bank. It is one of the biggest banks in \nAmerica:\n\n       Wells Fargo to expand securities business. It plans to grow \n     and invest in securities activities that it largely inherited \n     from Wachovia. The business is to be called Wells Fargo \n     Securities.\n\n  What is Wachovia? Wachovia is a bank that was failing because \nWachovia had all kinds of problems. Wachovia was a bank that had \npurchased Golden West Financial, which had about $120 billion, we are \ntold, in toxic option adjustable rate mortgages.\n  By the way, related to this, I saw in the newspapers the other day \nthat pick-your-payment mortgage plans have actually now had a higher \ndefault rate than other subprime mortgage loans. Think of that. You \nlook at that and think, What was the pick-your-payment plan? That was \nthe plans put out by these mortgage companies--sophisticated, exotic \nplans--saying to people, you know what, pick your own payment. You tell \nus what you will pay and we will write a mortgage around it.\n  So we had all of these strange plans out there, exotic plans, some of \nwhich were creating an unbelievable bubble of speculation. We had bank \nholding companies buying them and we had FDIC-insured banks actually \ntrading them. Pretty soon you got toxic assets lying in the belly or \nthe gut of these financial institutions, and they are going to go \nbelly-up unless somebody else buys them.\n  So Wells Fargo buys Wachovia, and then Wells Fargo announces that, \nwell, our investment banking and our capital markets businesses are now \ngoing to operate under a new name, ``Wells Fargo Securities.''\n  The question is this: With the biggest banks in the country \noperating, in many cases with holding companies engaged in real estate \nand securities issues, having demonstrated now that these holding \ncompanies do not have firewalls that are much thicker or much more \nbeneficial than tissue paper, are we still going to continue to see all \nof this?\n  Are we still going to see FDIC-insured institutions, for which the \ntaxpayers are ultimately responsible for failure, talking about: We are \ngoing to get involved in more risk trading, more securities?\n  Wachovia. Well, Wachovia Bank, I have spoken of them before. Wachovia \nBank was one of those banks buying sewer systems in Germany. Why? \nBecause an American bank wanted to own a sewer in a German city? No. \nThey wanted to avoid paying U.S. taxes, so they did sale-lease back \ntransactions with German sewer systems.\n  That is part of a culture issue with companies, it seems to me, when \nyou do that sort of thing. But now we have Wells Fargo that bought \nWachovia, announcing the best part of what they bought was Wachovia's \nsecurities business. The fact is, Wachovia was not going to make it. \nThat is why Wells Fargo purchased them.\n  We ought to be asking a couple of questions these days about the \nAdministration's announced plans for new financial reform, which I \nwelcome by the way. This President inherited this mess, so he is \ntalking about financial reform, and I welcome that discussion.\n  One, I think we ought to have a healthy and robust discussion about \nwhether the Federal entity that shall become the systemic risk \nregulator in this country should be the Federal Reserve Board.\n  Not me. Not me. The Federal Reserve Board is what has helped cause \nthis\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\nproblem. I mean, the Federal Reserve Board acted blindly for over a \ndecade. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board by itself is almost \ntotally unaccountable to anyone and operates in very substantial \nsecrecy.\n  Why would we decide to have an agency that has failed over the last \ndecade or so in managing and supervising the financial industry in this \ncountry, that watched the creation of these big holding companies, \nwatched what happened with the mortgage companies with unbelievably \nspeculative instruments, watched the advertisements on television \nsaying: If you have been bankrupt, slow pay, no pay, got bad credit, \ncome to us. We will give you a loan--the Federal Reserve watched all of \nthat and did nothing. Now we are going to be told they are the ones to \nsave us with respect to systemic risk in our economy? I do not think \nso. That is No. 1; the Federal Reserve Board is going to be the entity \nto deal with systemic risk? Boy, there is no evidence, at least in \nrecent years, to suggest that makes much sense.\n  No. 2, no discussion yet, and there might be, on this issue of too \nbig to fail. Does it matter that we have allowed the creation of \nentities in the financial sector that are too big to fail? In my \njudgment it matters because if they are too big to fail, then the \nAmerican taxpayer bails them out. That is what happened last fall.\n  The Treasury Secretary leaned over the lectern to us one Friday and \nsaid: Look, if you do not pass a bailout bill in 3 days, a three-page \nbill giving me $700 billion, this economy is going to fall off a cliff.\n  Well, I did not believe it. I did not vote for the bailout. But the \nfact is, all of this was because some of the largest financial \ninstitutions in the country, he said, were in deep trouble.\n  Why were they in trouble? Because they loaded up with substantial \nrisk. Congress, in the last decade, has passed laws that allowed them \nto do that. They said this is modernization. But when we create \ninstitutions that are too big to fail and then they load up with \nsubstantial risk, especially those that are FDIC-insured with holding \ncompanies now, engage in securities, and that is exactly what Wells \nFargo is announcing: We bought Wachovia. Now we will take the \nsecurities on with Wachovia and decide to juice it up.\n  Should we continue with the doctrine of too big to fail? I do not \nbelieve so. Yet in the intervening months, the last 8 months or so, the \nvery institutions that were judged too big to fail and were required to \nget bailouts from the American taxpayer are still engaged in merging \nwith other institutions, making them bigger and even less able to fail.\n  So is there someone willing to intervene to say too big to fail has \nto change? Must we perhaps at least have a discussion about breaking up \nsome institutions that are too big to fail? What about very large \nstrong regional interests that are not too big to fail? I am just \nasking the question because nobody, in talking about financial reform \nthat I am aware of these days, is willing to address the question of \ntoo big to fail. And you cannot address this question of financial \nreform without including it.\n  All of us want the same thing for this country. We want this country \nto recover. We want our economy to expand and grow and create jobs and \nbe healthy again. The fact is--I have talked about this many times. I \ntaught economics briefly in college. The fact is, all of the charts and \ngraphs and indices are irrelevant as compared to the confidence of the \nAmerican people.\n  When the American people are confident about the future of this \ncountry and about their future, about their job, about their family, \nthen they do things that manifest that confidence. They buy some \nclothes, buy a car, take a trip, buy a house. They do the things that \nexpand the economy because they are confident about the future.\n  When they are not, they do exactly the opposite and that contracts \nthe economy. The question is, how do we give the American people \nconfidence going forward that things are going to be better? Month \nafter month, because unemployment has a long tail even past recovery, \nwe see hundreds of thousands of people having lost their jobs. \nObviously, those folks do not have a lot of confidence. They feel \nhelpless and hopeless.\n  How do we give people confidence we are going to fix things that are \nwrong so this will not happen again? That is where this issue of \nfinancial reform comes in. Part of that confidence, it seems to me, can \ncome from this institution, from the Congress and the President. Part \nof it can come from the people watching this institution.\n  Take a look at this amendment, an amendment that says: Let's not \nspend $1.75 billion we do not have on something the Pentagon says they \ndo not want.\n  Confidence can come from affirmative action on that. Part of that \nconfidence could come from 100 or 1,000 of these examples, a little \nprogram called TV Marti, broadcasting television signals to people who \ncannot see it, and doing it for 5, 10, 15 years and spending a quarter \nof a billion dollars. Part of that confidence could come from the \nAmerican people taking a look at our deciding to shut these kinds of \nthings down and trimming back government that has become bloated. So we \ncan do some of this to create confidence.\n  But another part of it, it seems to me, has to come from the \nadministration's judgment about what is real reform in financial \nreform. That must include, in my judgment, the issue of too big to \nfail. It must include effective regulatory oversight so we do not have \nthe kind of activities going on that we saw for the last 10 years: \nfinancial institutions engaged in unbelievable practices with no one \nminding the store and no one watching who were the referees of the \nsystem, wearing striped shirts and whistles and blowing the whistle \nwhen they saw a foul in the market system. We cannot continue that. We \nneed effective regulation. We need effective reform. When we get that, \nthe American people will feel: You know what. They fixed that which \ncaused this serious problem, and we feel better about the future of \nthis country.\n  We have a lot to do in a short time. Some big issues of health care, \nenergy, and climate change, and others. I am going to visit about the \nissue of climate change tomorrow. But we have very big issues that have \ngreat consequences for this country. But at the moment, we stand in a \nvery deep recession.\n  The American people are concerned about the future and want some \nassurance that all of us are doing the things necessary to put the \ncountry back on track.\n  One step today is the amendment that was offered by the chairman and \nthe ranking member of this committee. It is $1.75 billion. That is a \nlot of money. But step after step after step in the right direction can \ngive people confidence about the future of this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Markets Commission\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, almost 7 months ago, Senator Conrad from \nNorth Dakota and myself began an adventure attempting to convince this \nbody and the one across the hall to create a Financial Markets \nCommission to study and do a forensic audit of what happened to our \nfinancial markets in 2007, 2008, and 2009. All of us recognize we have \nbeen through a catastrophic financial collapse with many potential \ncomponents contributing to the gravity. It is not over yet.\n  I commend Leader Reid and Leader McConnell, Leader Boehner in the \nHouse, and Speaker Pelosi and others who had the authority under the \nlegislation for announcing their appointments today to the Commission. \nI particularly commend the majority on the appointment of Ms. Born to \nthe Commission. It was her outspoken words prior to the collapse that \nshould have warned us better, or we should have paid more attention to, \nabout the overleveraging of the economy and the underwriting of risk. \nNonetheless, the\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\ncollapse has happened. The recession is here. Unemployment in Georgia \ntoday topped 10 percent. We are seeing predictions that it will top 10 \npercent for the entire country within the days ahead. It is critically \nimportant that we find out what went wrong, what the contributing \nfactors were, and recommend back to the Congress those actions we need \nto take to ensure this never happens again.\n  For my children and grandchildren, if I have one last legacy, it is \nto say, when it was on my watch, we found out what the problem was, we \ncorrected past errors, and we gave a little more security to their \ninvestments and future in the days to come.\n  I have my opinions as to what went wrong, but I know I am not smart \nenough to have all the answers. There are others who think they know \nwhat has gone wrong. We already have from the White House as well as \nfrom the Senate some who are making recommendations over creating czars \nor authorities or things to address the financial collapse. It would be \na mistake beyond words for us to do that now in the absence of all the \nfacts. This Commission has the authority, the money, and the power to \nget to the bottom of the problem. We gave them a $5 million budget, an \n18-month timetable, and subpoena powers. As evidenced by those who have \nbeen named today, we have some of the best financial minds in the \ncountry--not elected officials, not members of government, some former \nservants, but some of the best minds in the business to begin the \nprocess of studying the collapse that began in 2007, continued through \n2008, and in a protracted way continues today.\n  It is important that we get all the facts. There is plenty of blame \nto go around. Members of the House, in 1999, such as myself, who voted \noverwhelmingly for the repeal of Glass-Steagall--that very well could \nbe one of the things the Commission finds was where we had too much \nderegulation in financial services. We ought to know that and what \ncontribution it may have had. I have grave suspicions over the role \nMoody's and Standard & Poor's, the ratings agencies, played. I wonder, \nwhy should the agency that rates the security be paid by the creator of \nthe security? They ought to be paid by the person buying the security \nif they are looking for a surety. And why were credit default swaps \nunregulated? Why did they fall outside the purview of government? What \nis it about FASB rule 114 that is hurting so bad in the community \nbanking system today because of the devastation of mark-to-market on \nreal estate? And congratulations on the change by FASB of rule 157, \nwhich has lessened some of the pressure on mortgage-backed securities \nand the valuation of those, which has helped some bigger institutions. \nBut there are lots of things that could have gone wrong and some that \ndid. We need to have all of them on the table, the best minds in the \nbusiness looking at it, and we need to have a bipartisan, unfettered, \ncomprehensive recommendation on what we need to do to ensure that it \nnever, ever happens again.\n  I urge the President and our leadership to be cautious in moving \nahead regulatorily without first getting the facts together. We are in \nan environment now where everybody does know what the rules are as they \nexist. In the few months ahead, long before this Commission reports, a \nlot of decisions will be made that will be dependent and predicated \nupon the environment the investment community thinks they are operating \nin or at least knows they are operating in today.\n  We have some bumps ahead. Commercial mortgage-backed securities are \nthe next shoe to drop in this economic compromise we have been through, \nalthough those mortgage-backed securities are not in trouble as much \nbecause of their underwriting as they are from the effects of the poor \nunderwriting of the residential mortgage-backed securities that caused \na collapse of those markets and those securities. That comes ahead of \nus.\n  We have another wave of adjustments in terms of residential \nmortgages. That is not over. We have the pending problem of the number \nof mortgages in foreclosure, more performing, good loans at one time \nthan subprime-originated loans at their beginning, meaning the \nunemployment rate and the protracted decline of the economy is \ncontributing to people who were paying and are falling behind on \npayments on their houses. Now, because values have declined, they \nrecognize they are better off to leave than to try to sell the house \nbecause they can't get anything out of it. We must put an end to this \ndecline. We can best do it by having all the facts necessary at our \ndisposal to know what went wrong when, who did wrong where, and what we \nneed to do as quickly as possible to prohibit this from ever happening \nagain.\n  I spent 33 years of my life in the private sector in the real estate \nbusiness. I know lots of people in that business, and I know how much \nthe families they represent, the customers they have had, and the \nfamilies themselves have suffered in the months past and the pending \nsuffering yet to come.\n  This is the most important thing this Senate and Congress can do, to \ndo a forensic audit and diagnosis. Let the chips fall where they may \nand then make the corrections necessary so it never happens again.\n  I am happy to commend our leadership for their expeditious \nappointment of highly qualified and talented people. I hope all in this \nbody will pay close attention to what they say and do and not rush to \njudgment thinking we know the answer, when all of us really know this \nCommission is essential to finding out what really did happen and what \nwe really do need to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee in the Senate to support this bipartisan bill in front of us \nthat is critically important to our national security.\n  I applaud Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for their \nleadership in guiding this bill to the floor today. They have done a \ntremendous job. I also want to acknowledge the expert staff they have \nbeen ably supported by who serve on the committee the Acting President \npro tempore and I are both so honored to be a part of.\n  I am particularly grateful to them for including provisions important \nfor Colorado, including $560 million in authorized military \nconstruction.\n  I would like to highlight in particular the military construction \ndollars for Fort Carson, which is in the wonderful city of Colorado \nSprings and the County of El Paso. Millions of dollars have been \nallocated to Fort Carson for military construction projects to prepare \nto expand the post so it could house a 47th Brigade Combat Team, and \nmillions more are in the pipeline for fiscal year 2010.\n  But the future of that funding was put in doubt when Defense \nSecretary Gates announced earlier this year that the Army would not \ncreate a new brigade combat team at Fort Carson.\n  I remain disappointed that brigade will not be coming to Fort Carson, \nat least in the near future. But I understand Secretary Gates's concern \nthat we need to fill out the brigades we have, expand the amount of \ndwell time service members have between deployments, and meet readiness \nrequirements before we create new brigades.\n  Still, I wanted to ensure that Fort Carson and the Colorado Springs \ncommunity are not punished because of the Army's decision. Many of the \nsoldiers at Fort Carson live and work in substandard buildings. They \nstill need new barracks, mess halls, vehicle maintenance shops, and \nother infrastructure--even if that new brigade combat team will not be \nlocated there.\n  A number of faculties were scheduled to be replaced in future years \nanyway, so with the dollars we have kept in the bill, the 43rd Brigade \nCombat Team will get its updated facilities a few years early. I am \npleased the committee worked with me to preserve the most important \nconstruction dollars at Fort Carson. This ensures the soldiers at Fort \nCarson will have the quality of life they deserve.\n  The bill also includes language I offered in the committee with \nSenator\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\nLieberman that studies the benefits and risks of reducing the planned \nnumber of BCTs from 48 to 45. The relationship between the number of \nbrigades and dwell time and demands on specific military occupational \nspecialties, so-called MOSs, is complicated. I want to make sure the \nreduction of BCTs results in the upsides we expect and does not present \nunforeseen problems or downsides.\n  Staying on the topic of what is important in the bill to Colorado, \nthere is $246 million in funding to keep the cleanup of the Pueblo \nChemical Depot on track. This will allow the destruction of weapons \nthere and the cleanup at the depot to be completed by the \ncongressionally mandated date of 2017. Significantly, the bill funds \nthe disposal, onsite, of these hazardous wastes left after the chemical \ntreatment of the mustard agent. I worked with the people of Pueblo to \nfight a proposal to ship this waste offsite, so I am glad the bill \nunderscores the DOD's commitment to onsite disposal. It is the safest \nthing to do and makes the most sense.\n  Finally, in regards to Colorado, the committee approved an amendment \nI offered regarding reimbursement for health care providers, such as \nPikes Peak Behavioral Health Group in Colorado Springs. This center, \nand many centers like it, want to help our soldiers and their families, \nbut TRICARE--which is the civilian health care system for military \npersonnel and their dependents--cannot keep up with the high costs of \nmedical care, and sometimes providers are not reimbursed at all for \ntheir necessary services.\n  In particular, TRICARE providers are not reimbursed for providing \ncase management services for soldiers with PTSD and traumatic brain \ninjury, known as TBI. If we help these soldiers stay in treatment, if \nwe make sure they get their medical appointments, and if we generally \ncoordinate their care, we end up reducing costs, and we help those \nsoldiers and their families who are facing these challenges with mental \nhealth function in their communities.\n  So this amendment directs the Defense Secretary to assess the \nefficacy and cost of case management services for those with serious \nmental health problems. My hope is the study will show the benefits of \ncase management and then help further the DOD consider covering this \nimportant service under TRICARE.\n  If I might, let me turn to the broader legislation because it \nincludes many provisions that do not directly relate to Colorado.\n  The bill supports our service members, and it keeps Americans safe. \nIt authorizes $679 billion for defense programs, with $129 billion \ngoing to our ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n  First and foremost, the bill focuses on our military's readiness \nneeds. We need to do all we can to help make sure our men and women in \nuniform--who voluntarily put their lives on the line for us, and who \nhave been stretched to the limit by repeated deployments--have the \ntraining, the equipment, and the facilities necessary.\n  To help our men and women in uniform support themselves and their \nfamilies, the bill provides a 3.4-percent, across-the-board pay raise, \nas well as an extension of stop-loss pay for 2 more years. That is an \nimportant number.\n  Importantly, this bill gives Afghanistan the attention it deserves. I \nhad the great privilege of traveling to that part of the world \nrecently, and I think there is a window of opportunity to try to arrest \ndeteriorating security conditions in both countries and to work with \nthe civilian governments in Afghanistan and Pakistan to achieve \nstability and security in this all-important region.\n  This is not about ``staying the course.'' This is about finally \ncommitting resources and attention to an area that is a critical front \nin the war against Islamic extremism and correcting the mistakes and \nmissteps of recent years.\n  That is what the bill would do. It would refocus our attention on \nthis important region. It would protect our troops in harm's way by \nproviding funds for MRAP all-terrain vehicles to be deployed in \nAfghanistan and additional Blackhawk helicopters to give mobility to \nour troops.\n  Our bill also supports the training and equipping of the Afghan \nSecurity Forces, as well as efforts to help the Pakistani Government \nunderstand and implement a counterinsurgency strategy on the part of \ntheir military forces.\n  Moreover, our bill cares for our wounded warriors. It expands TRICARE \nbenefits for certain military retirees. It requires mental health \nassessments of service members prior to deployment, and it calls for an \nincrease in the number of military and civilian behavioral health \npersonnel.\n  We also include a comprehensive review of the activities of the \nDepartment of Defense for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of \nsubstance abuse disorders among service members. This is particularly \nimportant in light, today, of a report that has been released--the \nEPICON study--that directly focuses on Fort Carson.\n  This is a study that was initiated last year to examine the records \nof Fort Carson soldiers who have been involved in violent crimes since \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army Surgeon General, \nLieutenant General Schoomaker, put together a team of experts to \nidentify any commonalities among the violent crimes.\n  I had a chance to sit down with General Schoomaker yesterday. He and \nhis team have concluded that although risk factors alone do not explain \na ``clustering'' of crime in the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 4th \nInfantry Division--the 4 of the 4--a combination of factors converged \nto increase the risk that these soldiers would be engaged in violent \ncrime.\n  One concern General Schoomaker expressed was that the stigma and lack \nof referral to the Army Substance Referral Program for required \nsubstance abuse screening may have increased the overall risk of \nviolent behavior. The general talked about the need to reduce barriers \nto treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, which is an Army-wide concern. \nHe mentioned pilot projects ongoing at a number of posts where soldiers \nwho ``self-identify'' a substance abuse problem can get treatment \nwithout the knowledge of their commanders, helping them seek treatment \nwithout fear of appearing weak in the eyes of their superiors. I will \nbe urging the Army to establish a similar pilot program at Fort Carson.\n  Mr. President, let me turn to the bill and what is notable for what \nit does not include. There are policies that are difficult to change \nbecause they are antiquated and no longer reflect the reality of our \nsociety. The failed policy, ``don't ask, don't tell,'' is a good \nexample. But the fact that it will be difficult to repeal does not mean \nwe should not try.\n  Since the implementation of this program in 1993, the Armed Forces \nhave discharged over 12,000 brave and qualified combat troops--code-\nbreakers, medical and intelligence specialists, and skilled \ntranslators--simply for being gay. This includes over 300 service \npersonnel who have been discharged since President Obama took office.\n  Mr. President, this is 2009. I believe this discriminatory policy \nundermines the strength of our military and the fairness of our great \nNation. We are engaged in two wars. It is counterproductive to \ndischarge service members who have critical skills to winning these \nwars, even as the military has to spend scarce dollars to replace them. \nIn my opinion, we need to bring the injustice of this policy to the \nforefront now, and I plan to work with my colleagues and with the \nadministration to see that we accomplish, in a timely manner, the full \nrepeal of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''\n\n  There are things this bill doesn't include that it shouldn't include, \nsuch as spending on underperforming, unnecessary, and outdated weapons \nsystems. It took courage for Secretary Gates to make the \nrecommendations he did, since it is never easy to stop spending \nprograms in our Defense budget. But we need to stop funding programs \nthat significantly exceed their budget and we need to stop spending \nlimited dollars to buy more capability than the Nation needs.\n  There are also provisions in this bill that shouldn't be included, \nsuch as additional spending on the F-22. I voted in committee against \nan amendment to add $1.75 billion to the bill to purchase F-22 aircraft \nthat the military does not\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\nwant, does not need, and says we cannot afford. The F-22 is a valuable, \ncapable aircraft, but the question is whether we need more than 187 F-\n22s to meet the Nation's requirements, and there is bipartisan \nagreement that we do not. Presidents Obama and Bush, two Secretaries of \nDefense, three Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, and current members of the \nJoint Chiefs agreed that 187 aircraft are sufficient.\n  So let me conclude by saying that this is a good bill. It is a bill \nthat balances the need to sustain our current war-fighting abilities \nwith the need to prepare for the next threat to our national security. \nIt is critical that we are able to meet the operational needs of our \nmilitary today, even as we continue to prepare our men and women in \nuniform to be the best trained and equipped force in the world.\n  This is a good bill for our Nation and for my home State of Colorado; \nit is a carefully drafted and considered bipartisan bill, and I urge \nits passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado, not just \nfor his statement and for his support for this bill but for his work on \nthis committee. He has made a major contribution already. We look \nforward to his continuing work with us. As he knows and has so well \nexpressed, this is a bipartisan effort on the part of the committee. It \nis important that we continue that way, and his instincts have shown \nalready very dramatically that those are his views as well.\n  So I thank him very much, not just, again, for the support of an \namendment that we plan on getting back to as soon as we dispose of the \nhate crimes bill but also, and even more importantly, for his great \nwork on our committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Norm Coleman\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to pause for a moment. I know we \nare on the bill, and I am most anxious to proceed with the Defense \nauthorization bill, having served on the committee since 1994 and \nbefore then in the House. It is imperative now that we get as robust a \nbill as possible.\n  Before doing that, let me mention one thing because I haven't yet \nspoken about this. I have been watching several of our colleagues who \nhave come to the floor to speak about a great Senator, Norm Coleman, \nwho is no longer seated in the Senate but who is a remarkable \ncharacter.\n  A good friend of mine, Paul Weyrich, who recently died, wrote an op-\ned piece, and it is called ``The Workhorses and the Show Horses.'' He \ntalked about so many of the Members of the House and the Senate who are \nout there just to make themselves look good. They are the ones who are \nshow horses. Then there are the workhorses. We talk about someone such \nas Norm Coleman, who was always there and getting deeply involved in \nissues, many of which are not popular issues if you are using them to \nrun for reelection. I am thinking of a close friend, a mutual friend of \nours named Ward Brehm. Ward Brehm and I have been working together for \na long time on some things in Africa, as the Chair is aware, and he was \ntalking about being from Minnesota and how much involved Norm Coleman \ngot in various international affairs issues that don't have any votes \nbehind them, but he was willing to do it. Every time you turned around, \nhe was willing to do things that other people weren't willing to do.\n  I remember several years ago when he and I met with a delegation from \nBurundi and Rwanda and the DRC. This was a group that was over here in \nconjunction with the National Prayer Breakfast. He and I always worked \ntogether during the time that we had the National Prayer Breakfast. We \nwould get these people to come all the way over here from different \ncountries, but we kind of concentrated on Africa. I remember him \nstanding there talking about, for a long period of time--keep in mind \nhe is a Jew. I was never real clear where in New York he was from--I \nthink the Bronx or someplace. But anyway, he was very strong in the \nJewish community, and I am not. I am on the Christian side. But we \nwould always get together and talk to them about Jesus and talk to them \nabout loving God. And then when he would pray--at the end of these \nthings, we would offer a prayer, and he would end up giving a prayer in \nHebrew--an amazing guy.\n  At the National Prayer Breakfast African dinner 2 years ago--I had \nsponsored the dinner that was for all the Africans who had come over \nfor the Prayer Breakfast and stayed for the African dinner--he was a \nmajor player in that. So these are things people didn't know about Norm \nColeman.\n  The idea is scripturally based; it is Acts 2:42. It is kind of a \ngenesis of these weekly Prayer Breakfasts in the Senate. On Wednesday \nmornings, we had a Prayer Breakfast and about 20, 25 Senators showed up \nevery Wednesday and Norm Coleman was the chairman of that and was \nalways in these groups. But he was also one who was helping us in \nforming these same groups with members of Parliament from all over \nAfrica. He was a tireless worker in that effort, which was not \nsomething out there to get any votes.\n  I talked to him the other day, having gone through this election and \nthen the 8 months or so, whatever it was, in recounting and all of \nthat. I told him that many years ago I was mayor of Tulsa, and I did a \npretty good job, I thought. I was supposed to win hands down. Someone \ncame out of obscurity and because of a set of circumstances that should \nhave gotten votes, not lost votes, I had lost unexpectedly on that \nTuesday.\n  Well, we had scheduled our Tulsa Mayor's Prayer Breakfast the next \nmorning. Bill Bright, who died not too long ago, came by as the \nspeaker. Keep in mind, here he was the speaker at the Mayor's Prayer \nBreakfast the morning after I lost the election. He gave the most \nbrilliant speech. I remember how he said it and the words he used. He \nsaid: A lot of times we think in terms of what is happening to us \ntoday, looking at our own careers, but, he said, God is still up there \nand there is a plan for all of us. He said in a very clear way that I \nthoroughly understood, the day after I lost the election I wasn't \nsupposed to lose, that God opens a window and he closes a door and that \nwindow is going to be bigger. I can tell you right now I wouldn't be \ndoing what I am doing today if it had not been for that.\n  So I would just say about my friend, Norm Coleman, God has a plan in \nmind for you, Norm, and it is one we will look back someday and say \nperhaps this is the best thing that could have happened to you. In the \nmeantime, we love you, Norm, and God bless you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1511\n\n  I wish to also speak in terms of a program that I think a lot of \npeople don't understand, and on which I know there is honest \ndisagreement.\n  The F-22, people have said, is something like a Cold War aircraft. It \nis not. To quote Secretary Donnelly and General Schwartz both, because \nthey both said the same thing, they said the F-22 is unquestionably the \nmost capable fighter in our military inventory, not just air to air, as \nsome on this floor have insinuated, but also precision attack air to \nground, as well as intelligence collection. In contrast, almost every \nother piece of military equipment in our inventory today--air, land, \nand sea--is Cold War equipment that needs to be replaced.\n  I think about the Bradley vehicle. It has been around since the \n1960s. I think about the Abrams tank. It has been around since the \n1970s. I think about the Paladin, even though we have had about five \nmajor upgrades on the Paladin, that is our artillery beast, and that \nwas actually World War II technology where you had to get out of the \nthing after every shot and swab the breach. You hear that and people \ncan't believe it. Well, fortunately, we are going to go through an \nimprovement on that. But the point I am trying to make is most of the \nstuff we have is Cold War stuff and to find that F-22 isn't needed \nbecause it wasn't flown in Iraq and Afghanistan, I think, is pretty \nnarrow-minded. We have a lot of people we have to defend America \nagainst for contingencies that we don't know are out there and we don't \nknow what our needs are going to be. The need certainly wasn't there in \nterms of Afghanistan and Iraq, but we don't know where the next enemy \nis going to be coming from or what the next contingency is. I wish we \ndid. I can remember being on the House Armed Services\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\nCommittee my last year there in 1984. We had people testify. They \nsaid--these are smart people. They said: You know, in 10 years, we will \nno longer need ground capability. And look what has happened since that \ntime.\n  So no matter how smart our people are, there is no way we are going \nto be able to determine where the next guy is going to come from and \nwhat our capability is going to have to be. Is it going to be in the \nair, sea, strike vehicles, lift capacity, cannons? So we need to keep \nthat in mind because the only thing we have in the form of a fifth-\ngeneration fighter is the F-22, and it is uniquely designed and \nequipped to penetrate a hostile environment and be a savage air \ndominance for our ground forces. The F-22, I look at it as an \ninvestment in the future, not just 10 years down the road but 20 years \nand beyond. What we build today is going to have to be able to \ndetermine and deter and defeat adversaries for decades. Just look at \nthe age of our entire military today. We talked about all these \nvehicles, but we have such things as the national security in long \nterm, 40 years. We can't even see what we are going to need 10 years \nfrom now.\n  Now we talk about the F-35. Well, the F-35 is great. I am a strong \nsupporter of the F-35 and working on it and getting it up as fast as \npossible. Its mission requirements are not the same as the F-22. The F-\n22 is out flying today, and we have that capability today. Only five F-\n35s are flying, and it is still in the testing period. It is impossible \nto assess the full capabilities of the F-35 until operational tests are \ncompleted in, I think, 2014. Well, that is 2014. This is 2009. There is \na lot of time between now and 2014.\n  While we discuss cutting the only fifth-generation fighter in \nproduction today, China and Russia are continuing to move forward with \nthe development of their fifth-generation fighters. I think they call \nthe Chinese one the J-12 and the Russian is the T-50. They are out \nthere right now talking about building these things. Today our Legacy, \nour F-15s, F-16s, F-18s are less capable than other fourth-generation \nfighters, such as the SU-27 and the SU-30 series aircraft.\n  I might remind the President that we have--we already know other \ncountries are buying these capable fourth-plus generation aircraft that \nare better than what we have now, except for the F-22. We know of one \nsale, and I remember this--it has been quite awhile ago now--for F-27s \nfrom China, 240 of these. Now they are talking about cutting our number \nof F-22s--and I will talk about the numbers in a minute--down to the \n187 and stopping the amendment that would increase that by seven \nvehicles. I don't want to see our Legacy fighters outmatched by fifth-\ngeneration fighters developed by China and Russia. I have always said \nour pilots are better, our training is better, but they have to have at \nleast comparable equipment to survive.\n  So our air-to-air threat is only one aspect of the threat our Air \nForce faces today. Our surface-to-air threat remains to be a real \nserious problem. You just think about what the Russians are making now, \nthe S-300s and the Chinese 4000s. They are capable of tracking up to \n100 targets and getting as high as 90,000 feet in the air.\n  Now, that is priceless. These systems that make penetrating hostile \nairspace difficult and deadly for a legacy aircraft, including unmanned \nvehicles, such as our Predator, which has performed brilliantly, are \nuncontested facts. Only the F-22, with its advance stealth technology \nand weaponry and supersonic speeds, can successfully penetrate what we \ncall denied airspace, hunt and destroy strategic ground targets during \nthe day or night, and collect and provide battle intelligence and \nawareness, and maintain our superiority in the air.\n  The Air Force officials have repeatedly stated no less than 243 F-22s \nwould be sufficient to maintain a moderate level of risk. We are \ntalking about the deaths of Americans. If that is the goal, that is \nwhat we should have. In the beginning, it was 750 F-22s. We have slowly \ngone down. That is what this amendment is about today.\n  GEN John Corley, Commander of the Air Force Combat Command, said:\n\n       At Air Combat Command, we have held the need for 381 F-22s \n     to deliver a tailored package of air superiority to our \n     Combatant Commanders and provide a potent, globally arrayed \n     asymmetric deterrent against potential adversaries. In my \n     opinion, a fleet of 187 F-22s puts the execution of our \n     current national military strategy at high risk in the near \n     to mid term. To my knowledge, there are no studies that \n     demonstrate that 187 F-22s are adequate to support our \n     national military strategy. Air Combat Commandment analysis, \n     done in concert with the Headquarters Air Forces, shows a \n     moderate risk force can be obtained with an F-22 fleet of \n     approximately 250 aircraft.\n\n  So we are talking about a bare minimum number, and whether it is 243 \nor 250, that should be a bare minimum number.\n  While the F-22 hasn't deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, a theater \nsecurity package of six F-22s are on a continuous rotation to Guam in \nthe Pacific Theater of Operations and have been forward deployed in \nJapan.\n  Why? Because it is the only fighter capable of stealthy penetration \nof North Korea's air defenses.\n  Finally, there continues to be allegations about the costs and \noperations of the F-22--to include an article last week in the \nWashington Post. The bottom line is, these allegations are false or \nintentionally misleading. The F-22 cost per flying hour is $19,750, not \nmore than $44,000, as they were trying to say. The F-22 maintenance \ntrends have improved from 62 percent to 68 percent. The F-22 skin is \nnot vulnerable to rain. Finally, the fly-away cost for F-22s multiyear \nthis Congress approved is $142.6 million, not $350 million.\n  One final point on all of these supposed studies about the F-22: We \nhave been through this before with the approval of the multiyear and \nare going through it again. I have been briefed on both classified and \nunclassified studies, and while the range of numbers varied, each study \nconcluded that 183 F-22s is not enough. So we need to continue to build \nthe F-22s and look at exporting this aircraft to our allies. \nFortunately, some of that is taking place today. Japan, Australia, and \nIsrael have expressed considerable interest in the purchase of F-22s.\n  Nations around the world realize the F-22A Raptor is the only \noperational fighter-bomber available that can successfully defeat and \ndestroy air and ground threats of today and tomorrow.\n  So what we are talking about is--in the markup, we increased the \nnumber by seven aircraft. The chief mover of this, I have to say, was \nSenator Saxby Chambliss. As I told him, this is not enough. He agreed, \nbut it was the most we thought we could do.\n  I believe when the time comes for an amendment to cut that number \ndown, we need to give serious consideration to that amendment and not \nallow it to pass.\n  There is an expectation of the American people--and I have gone \nthrough this before with other airframes and other ground platforms--\nthe American people think we give our kids who go into battle the very \nbest of everything. I can tell you that is not true. I gave an example. \nThere are five countries, including South Africa, that make a better \nnon-line-of-sight cannon than we have today.\n  To me, that is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to the American \npeople when we explain that is the situation. The F-15, F-16, and the \nF-14 have done a great job, but they need to move on to the fourth and \nfifth generation, and the only way to do that is with the F-22, which \nhas been a success story.\n\n\n                             Guantanamo Bay\n\n  I have another interest I want to share today, and that has to do \nwith Gitmo. People are probably tired of hearing me talk about Gitmo, \nbut I think we are about to make a mistake. The administration is \nmaking the demand that we close Gitmo. I have stood on the floor of the \nSenate many times and talked about my experiences there--the fact that \nanybody who wants to close Gitmo, if you ask why, they will say that \nfor some reason people associate that with the types of torture that \nallegedly went on at Abu Ghraib and all of that.\n  This has nothing to do with that. There has not been a documented \ncase of waterboarding at Gitmo. It is a state-of-the-art prison.\n  When President Obama talked about the 17 locations in America where \nwe can take terrorists and relocate them from Gitmo to America, one \nhappened to be Fort Sill in my State of Oklahoma. I went down to Fort \nSill, and there was a lady in charge. She is a young major in charge of \nthe prison where they would put these terrorists.\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\n  She said, ``I don't understand what people are thinking.'' This young \nlady, named SMA Carter, said she had two tours at Gitmo, and it is \ndesigned for terrorists. They have a court system where they can do \ntribunals.\n  We have six classifications of security in Gitmo. It is one of the \nfew good deals the government has. We have had it since 1903. I have \ntold the Presiding Officer this before. We only pay $4,000 a year for \nit. Do you have a better deal than that in government? There isn't one.\n  I have to say the terrorists are still at war with the United States, \nand we are legally entitled to capture and hold enemies and fighters in \nthe hostilities. We detain terrorists and supporters to prevent them \nfrom returning to the battlefield, saving the lives of our service men \nand women and the lives of civilians who are innocent victims. I have \nspent a lot of time there. I am familiar with some of the terrorists \nthere who are really bad people. They want to kill everybody who is \nlistening right now. That is their mission in life.\n  We have had about 800 suspected al-Qaida and Taliban terrorists who \nhave been sent to Gitmo since 9/11--people who are really bad. I looked \nthrough there, and we saw Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He was the architect \nof 9/11. There was also the guy who was the explosives trainer for 9/\n11, who provided information on the September 2001 assassination of the \nNorthern Alliance leader, Masood, and on the al-Qaida organization's \nuse of mines. There was also the terrorist financier who provided \ndetailed information on Osama bin Laden's front companies. There was \nthe Taliban fighter linked to al-Qaida operatives connected to the 1998 \nEast Africa Embassy bombings. Remember that, in Tanzania and Kenya? \nDown there we also had an al-Qaida explosives trainer who designed a \nprototype shoe bomb for destroying airplanes, as well as a magnet mine \nfor attacking ships.\n  These people are unlike the types of prisoners we have had in other \nwars. If we look back during any of our wars, we had soldiers fighting \nfor their countries. These people are not soldiers fighting for a \ncountry. They are fighting for a cause, and that cause is to destroy \nus.\n  To date over 540 prisoners have been transferred or released, leaving \napproximately 230 at Gitmo. They include members of al-Qaida and \nrelated terrorist organizations, planners of major terrorist attacks \nworldwide, including 9/11. These are the types of people there.\n  The intelligence gained from detainees at Gitmo helped the United \nStates and its allies identify, exploit, and disrupt terrorist \noperations worldwide, saving untold lives. There have been a number of \nterrorist attacks. For a long time, they were classified, but most are \nno longer classified.\n  In 2007, the Senate voted 94 to 3 on a nonbinding resolution to block \ndetainees from being transferred to the United States, declaring:\n\n       Detainees housed at Guantanamo should not be released into \n     American society, nor should they be transferred State-side \n     into facilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n\n  On May 20, 2009, the Senate voted 90 to 6 on a bipartisan amendment \nby myself and Senator Inouye to prohibit funding for the transfer of \nGitmo detainees to the United States. Unfortunately, the supplemental \nappropriations conference report deleted that provision, allowing \ndetainees to be transferred to the United States for trial.\n  If we put them into our Federal system--I can speak this way because \nI am not an attorney, so I can stand back and cite the obvious. If we \ndo that, then the rules of evidence are different.\n  There are a lot of these guys who are picked up, and even now they \ntalk about Miranda rights. That blows my mind when I think about it--\nwhen this goes on now and we have the opportunity to get these people \nand extract information from them. Thinking about the idea of trying \nthem in the Federal court system where, if they cannot get a \nconviction--and many times they could not for one reason, which is that \nthe rules of evidence are different.\n  When they were captured, they went by the rules of evidence for \nmilitary tribunals. So we could have some who would be turned free, and \nmany of them in the United States.\n  Recent polls show that a majority of Americans oppose closing Gitmo \nand moving detainees to the United States. By a margin of 2 to 1--which \nis huge in polls--those surveyed said Guantanamo should not be closed, \nand by more than 3 to 1 they oppose moving some of the accused \nterrorists housed there to prisons in the United States.\n  Again, one of the prisons the Obama administration talked about of \nthe 17 prisons happened to be in Oklahoma. It should be obvious to \neverybody if we have 17 locations where we are housing terrorists, that \nbecomes a magnet for terrorism--17 magnets in the United States.\n  A recent Fox News poll said President Obama made a mistake when he \nsigned the order to close Gitmo. Seventy-seven percent of all Americans \nsay that was a mistake, that Gitmo should not be closed, 60 percent of \nall Americans, up from 53 percent in April and 45 percent in January. \nYou can see the trendlines. The vast majority--nearly two-thirds--is \nsaying he should not close Gitmo and Gitmo prisoners should not be \ntransferred into prisons in the United States. Sixty percent of all \nAmericans say that is true. Sixty percent in polling is a huge number, \na vast majority.\n  I encourage Senators who will be voting on this significant amendment \nto keep that in mind. Since President Obama announced he intended to \nclose Gitmo, it has become widely circulated that these detainees could \nbe transferred to American prisons for prosecution in U.S. criminal \ncourts and potentially released in the United States. Moving detainees \nto prisons here would require significant investment in restructuring \nexisting facilities and would cost taxpayers millions of dollars.\n  Currently, the United States only has one Supermax facility located \nin Florence, CO. According to the Bureau of Prisons, as of May 21, \n``only 1 bed was not filled at Supermax.'' So if we want to give \nmaximum security to these people, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, we \nbetter decide who is going to be in that one bed because we don't have \nthe capacity. The capacity of all the high security Bureau of Prison \nfacilities at the beginning of this month was 13,448 inmates, while the \ntotal prison population was approximately 20,000.\n  So what we are talking about is they are overcrowded, and that is \nflat not going to happen. Despite claims by Senator Durbin that the \nSupermax prisons in the United States are ready to receive Gitmo \ndetainees, the Supermax prisons in the United States are at or above \ntheir maximum capacity.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller said there is the very real possibility \nthat the Gitmo detainees will recruit more terrorists from among the \nFederal inmate population and continue al-Qaida operations inside the \nwalls of prison. That cannot happen in Gitmo because they are all \nterrorists there. That is how the New York synagogue bombers were \nrecruited, in our own prison system.\n  In 2002, an entire wing of a jail in Alexandria, VA, was cleared out \nfor the 9/11 ``20th hijacker,'' Zacarias Moussaoui, to be housed for \nhis trial--just for one detainee. Bringing Gitmo detainees to the \nUnited States could also place America and its citizens at risk by \ninevitably creating a new set of targets for the jihadist terrorists. \nGitmo, on the other hand, is a state-of-the-art prison. I cannot find \nanyone who has gone over there, including unfriendly media, media that \nwas bent on closing Gitmo--once they go over there and see it, almost \nall of them change their mind. It is a state-of-the-art facility that \nprovides humane treatment for all detainees. It is fully compliant with \nthe Geneva Conventions and provides treatment and oversight that exceed \nany maximum security prison in the world, as attested to by human \nrights organizations, the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an \nindependent commission led by Admiral Walsh. This is state of the art, \nand this is not a place where torture takes place. It is the only \nfacility of its kind in the world that was specifically designed to \nhouse and try these types of dangerous detainees.\n  If President Obama ever decides to visit Gitmo, I am sure he would \nequally\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\nbe impressed as everyone else, including, I might say, Attorney General \nHolder. He came back and gave a glowing report and said how great this \nwas and, at the same time, said the President still wants to close it.\n  When you look at the Gitmo situation, there are, on average, two \nlawyers for every detainee. There are 127 doctors and nurses. The ratio \nis 1 to 2 in terms of health care specialists to take care of these \nprisoners. Here we are talking about health care in this country. Maybe \nthey want to go to Gitmo. They would be a lot better off. Current \ntreatment and oversight exceeds that of any maximum security prison in \nthe world.\n  There is also a $12 million expeditionary legal complex. This is very \nsignificant because if we are going to do tribunals, we cannot do \ntribunals in our court system in the United States because it is not \nset up for that. Obviously, there are some things in testimony that \ntakes place that have to be private. You cannot have these things go \nout because that would endanger American lives. We spent $12 million on \nthis complex. It is a courtroom at Gitmo to try detainees, and \nspecifically that is what it is there for. It is the only one of its \nkind in the world, and it provides a secure location to try detainees \ncharged by the Federal Government. They have full access to sensitive \nand classified information, full access to defense lawyers, and \nprotection by the full media, access by the press. But it is set up to \ntake care of that specific type of an incarcerated individual.\n  Senator Harry Reid declared, in a press conference after my \nbipartisan amendment was adopted, that ``We will never allow terrorists \nto be released into the United States.'' I applaud Senator Reid for \nthat statement and hope he will stay with that because that is \nsomething the American people are not willing to tolerate.\n  He went on to say he opposes imprisoning detainees on U.S. soil, \nsaying:\n\n       We don't want them around the United States . . . I can't \n     make it any more clear than the statement I have given to \n     you. We will never allow terrorists to be released in the \n     United States.\n\n  Senator Durbin said:\n\n       The feeling was at this point we were defending the \n     unknown. We were being asked to defend a plan that hasn't \n     been announced.\n\n  I think Senator Durbin was correct then and is correct now.\n  There are lots of questions, very few answers. What is the impact? \nLet's say we close Gitmo. What is the impact of placing detainees in \nthe U.S. prison system--pretrial and posttrial? Has an assessment been \ndone to determine the risk of escape, as well as potentially creating \ntargets in the United States for terrorist attacks? Will Gitmo \ndetainees be segregated from the regular prison population? Keep in \nmind, these guys are trained to recruit. That would be a garden spot \nfor them to get into the American prison system to recruit people to \nbecome terrorists. What facilities exist in the United States today \nthat can hold these detainees? We talked about that. They tried to \nlocate 17 facilities, and it will not work.\n  By the way, the State legislatures in each one of those States that \nhave one of these facilities have passed resolutions or some type of a \ndocument saying: We don't want them in our States. That is what they \nare saying from the States, and we need to listen to them. One might \nask, where will the military commissions be held--at Guantanamo or the \nUnited States? Obviously, if you close Guantanamo, you lose that \nfacility. Assuming military commissions are held in Guantanamo, where \nwill detainees who are convicted serve out their sentence, if not \nthere, because there is no other place that has the capability of doing \nthat. There are all these questions.\n  What additional constitutional rights will a detainee gain if they \nare tried in the United State versus Guantanamo?\n  Are there differences in the rights awarded to detainees tried in a \nMilitary Commission versus civilian court? Could location or geography \naffect the right afforded to detainees--somewhere in the U.S. versus \nGitmo?\n  How do we handle protection of classified information during trials?\n  What are the long-term implications on future conflicts of trying \nthese detainees in a civil court versus military commissions?\n  Why is the administration reading Miranda rights to some detainees \ncaptured or held in Iraq and Afghanistan? How many are being read \nMiranda rights? How many have invoked their rights?\n  What is the impact of requiring the reading of Miranda rights to \nterrorists captured on the battlefield and advising them they have the \n``right to remain silent''?\n  What if a detainee is found not guilty--where will he be released?\n  What does the administration plan to do when a Federal judge orders \nthe release of a detainee but the administration knows is too dangerous \nto release of transfer?\n  What do you do with a detainee you cannot try or release due to \nnational security concerns?\n  Despite not having a plan, the administration continues in its quest \nto empty Gitmo regardless of the cost or the risk.\n  The Obama administration initially talked with the small South \nPacific island of Palau, population 20,000, to accept transfer of a \ngroup of 17 Chinese Muslims currently at Gitmo, called Uighurs, at the \ncost of some $200 million. That is $11.7 million per individual. This \nis not a cheap thing he is talking about doing. The total cost to build \nGitmo was only $275 million. As I said, it has been on lease since 1903 \nfor $4,000 a year. The Wall Street Journal just yesterday had a \ngovernment official who said that well over 50 detainees have been \napproved for transfer to other countries and that negotiations are \ncontinuing with Saudi Arabia to take a large group of Yemeni detainees. \nAttorney General Eric Holder has estimated that more than 50 detainees \nmay end up on trial by U.S. authorities. This news comes as more and \nmore Americans are growing opposed to the closure of Gitmo, placing \nthem unnecessarily at risk in order to satisfy political goals.\n  I think we need to stop, sit back, take a deep breath, and look at \nsome of the things that are going on today. The idea that we would have \nMiranda rights for terrorists, people who have killed Americans, is \npretty outrageous.\n  Finally, on June 9, the Obama administration again went against the \nwill of the Congress and the American people by transferring the first \nGitmo detainee to the United States for his trial in New York City.\n  Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani has been indicted for the 1998 al-Qaida U.S. \nEmbassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 224 \npeople, including 12 Americans. Ghailani was later captured in Pakistan \nin 2004 while working for al-Qaida, preparing false documents. \nIntelligence shows he met both bin Laden and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in \nAfghanistan and remained a close associate with al-Qaida until his \ncapture in 2004.\n  This bonafide terrorist will have the privilege of a U.S. civilian \ncourt trial in the United States--I think it is New York. To me, it is \ninconceivable that could happen. The press reported that Ghailani was \nsmiling when the charges were read to him in New York.\n  Despite the Obama administration's intentions, they will find \nthemselves in a position where they cannot even try or safely transfer \nor release Gitmo detainees. As of May 2009, 74 transferred/released \ndetainees have returned to the fight--74. These are the ones we \ncaptured again. We know they returned to the fight. How many more are \nthere out there? If you release these people, they go right back to \ntheir practice of killing Americans. Former Guantanamo Bay inmate \nMullah Zakir, also known as Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul, is leading the \nfight against the U.S. Marines in the Helmand Province in Afghanistan. \nHe surrendered in north Afghanistan in 2001, was transferred to Gitmo \nin 2006, and then released. He is out there killing marines today. That \nis what is happening currently. There is no alternative to Gitmo.\n  I go through all this not to be disagreeable with anyone except to \nsay there is an answer, and there is only one answer.\n  Today, we are considering the Defense authorization bill. I have an \namendment to that bill. I now have, in a matter of 3 hours, 22 \ncosponsors. This is amendment No. 1559 to the Defense authorization \nbill, S. 1390. This does something very simple. I like simple bills \nbecause they cannot be misunderstood. They are not like the health \ninsurance bill with over 1,000 pages no\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\none has read. They are not like the cap-and-trade bill that passed the \nHouse with no one reading it, over 1,000 pages. This is just two pages. \nThat is all. It is easy to read. Let me tell you what it says. I am \nwrong, it is one page. It says an amendment offered by Senator Inhofe:\n\n       Sec. 1059. Prohibition on transfer of Guantanamo Detainees.\n       No department or agency of the United States may\n       (1) transfer any detainee of the United States housed at \n     Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to any facility in the \n     United States or its territories.\n\n  That is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is, we cannot ``construct, improve, modify, or otherwise \nenhance any facility in the United States or its territories for the \npurpose of hous-\ning any detainee described in para-\ngraph (1) . . .''\n  No. 3: We cannot ``permanently or temporarily house or otherwise \nincarcerate any detainee described in paragraph (1) in the United \nStates or its territories.''\n  That is a very simple solution. It is all in three sentences on one \npage.\n  I have a feeling there are going to be many people who know that we \nare on the right side of this issue, know that the American people are \noverwhelmingly, by more than two to one, in support of an amendment \nsuch as this, and are going to offer some amendment full of loopholes \nthat will still allow them to close it. It will sound good. But this is \nthe only one out there.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, if their interest is to really \ndo something about keeping Gitmo open, there is only one vehicle out \nthere. We are on it right now--the Defense authorization bill. That is \namendment No. 1559. All it does is prohibit us from transferring any \ndetainee from Gitmo to any facility in the United States of America or \nits territories; it prohibits us from constructing, improving, \nmodifying, or otherwise enhancing any facility in the United States or \nits territories for the purpose of housing any detainee described in \nparagraph 1 above--that is the terrorist; and No. 3, it prohibits us \nfrom temporarily or otherwise incarcerating any detainee described in \nparagraph 1 in the United States or its territories. Period. That is \nall it does.\n  I say to those two-thirds people of America, there is a vehicle now \nwe can use to make sure that facility, one of the really true state-of-\nthe-art resources we have in this country, stays open and keeping those \ndetainees, those terrorists out of America. If you want to keep them \nout of America, this is the way to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I notice no one else is on the floor right \nnow. I was only going to address those three subjects, but I do want to \nmake a couple of additional comments. If anyone comes in and seeks the \nfloor, I will come to a close.\n  There is one other major issue that we are dealing with right now--we \nhave had a number of hearings--and I would like to kind of put it in \nperspective so people will understand.\n  There are a lot of complaints around the country about the cap and \ntrade bill that was passed by the House of Representatives--\ninterestingly by one vote over the majority--which is 219. Most of the \nbill actually was written at about 3 o'clock in the morning and passed \nthe same day--a thousand pages. I applaud John Boehner over there for \nsaying that we want to establish some kind of a program whereby \nanything we are going to consider on the floor should be on a Web site \nso all of America can read it at least 72 hours before it is voted on. \nI applaud that, and I hope we will be able to do that.\n  I certainly hope we will be able to do that with a bill that I am \nsure will be passed from the Environment and Public Works Committee of \nthe Senate--the cap and trade bill that has yet to be drafted. The \nchairman of that committee, Senator Boxer, has stated it is going to \nbasically be the framework of the Waxman bill from the House that was \npassed by a margin of 219 votes to 212, I think it was.\n  Anyway, that at least gives us something to talk about. I would like \nto go back historically to my first exposure to this whole issue. Back \nabout 10 years ago, when we had the Kyoto Treaty, the Kyoto Treaty was \na treaty the Clinton-Gore administration was trying to get us to ratify \nin the Senate. It was a treaty that would establish a cap-and-trade \ntype of arrangement to limit the number of CO2--and the \nproper term is anthropogenic gases--anthropogenic, man-made gases, \nmethane, CO2.\n  The theory behind that, and I believed it at that time because \neveryone said it was true, was that these man-made gases were causing \nglobal warming. I assumed the science was there and was settled. As I \nsay, everybody thought it was. It was at that time that the Wharton \nSchool of Economics came out with the Wharton econometrics survey. That \nsurvey quantified how much it would cost America in taxes if we in the \nUnited States ratified the treaty and lived by its requirements. The \nresult was in the range between $300 billion and $330 billion a year.\n  Now, I have often said one of the most egregious votes ever taken in \nthe Senate was the vote that took place in October of 2008 when we gave \nan unelected bureaucrat the $700 billion to do with as he wished. It \nwas just unconscionable. I voted against it. I was opposed to it, but \nwe lost. We did it, and now, most of the people who voted for it, are \nsorry. I tried to equate at that time what $700 billion was, and I said \nif you take all of the families who file tax returns and pay taxes and \ndo your math, it is $5,000 a family--$5,000 for every American family, \nnot just the ones in Oklahoma but everywhere. So I thought, as bad as \nthat was, that was a one-shot deal. If we pass cap and trade, we are \ntalking about a $300-plus billion tax increase every year, not just \nonce.\n  So at the time we looked at this, and the Wharton School came out \nwith these figures, I thought, let me be sure in my own mind, as a \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee, that the science \nis there. So I looked into it, only to find out this whole thing came \nfrom the United Nations' IPCC--the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange. All we have seen are just the reports not from scientists but \nfrom politicians on the summaries they give policy donors. So we \nstarted talking to real scientists only to find out that really well-\nestablished scientists--and this is 10 years ago--who looked at this \nsaid: Well, yes, there could be a connection between man-made gases, \nCO2, and global warming. However, it is not a major \nsignificant contribution.\n  Now, to fortify this, then-Vice President Gore was trying to build \nhis case on why we should ratify this convention and he did his own \nstudy. He hired a guy--one of the top scientists in America--named Tom \nWigley to do an analysis. Now, here was his challenge. If all of the \ndeveloped nations in the world--America, France, Western Europe and the \nrest of the developed nations--would ratify this treaty and would live \nby its emission requirements, how much would that lower the temperature \nin 50 years? So if all the countries in the developed nations did this, \nhow much would it lower it in 50 years? The result of the study was \nseven one-hundredths of a degree Celsius. Well, I said that is not even \nmeasurable. And I said, if his own scientist says that, we have to have \na wake-up call here in America. And that is when I made this statement \nthat people have been throwing at me for 10 years--the idea of the \nnotion that man-made gases significantly contribute to global warming \nis probably the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\n  Well, when we stop and look back now at what has happened in the \nscientific community, many members of the community were the recipients \nof grants and had those grants held up unless they would come in and \nsay, yes, we are going to have to do something about CO2 in \norder to stop global warming.\n  By the way, I have to just say that at this time we are in our ninth \nyear of a global cooling. People seem to forget we have been going \nthrough these ups\n\n[[Page S7540]]\n\nand downs all throughout recorded history. God is still up there, and \nwe are going to have warming and cooling periods.\n  The same individuals who are so hysterically behind this idea of \npassing a cap and trade--putting a huge tax on America at this time--\nare the same ones in 1975 that were saying we are going to have to do \nsomething because another ice age is coming. Well, anyway, this has \nbeen going on for a long period of time.\n  So as we have progressed through the years, more and more scientists \nhave come over who were on the other side. And I call to mind now, just \nfrom memory, Claude Allegra, from France. Claude Allegra is a socialist \nover there--very prominent scientist. He was marching through the \naisles with Al Gore 15 years ago, and he has now reversed his position \nand said, wait a minute, everything we thought from the modeling didn't \nhappen. This thing is not real. He is solidly on the skeptic side now, \nsaying I was wrong back then. This Claude Allegra is the guy Sarkozy \nnow is talking about putting in as the environmental minister of the \ncountry of France. Now that is the caliber of people we are talking \nabout.\n  David Bellamy was the top scientist in the U.K. and David Bellamy was \nsolidly on the other side 10, 12 years ago. He is now saying, we have \nlooked at the modeling and we have changed and this is just flat not \ntrue.\n  A guy named Nir Shaviv from Israel, another top scientist, he was on \nthe other side of this issue and he has now come over.\n  And for my colleagues who want to really see the fortification, see \nthe numbers we are talking about in terms of scientists who have \nreversed their position, go to my Web site, Inhofe.Senate.Gov, and look \nit up. There are a lot of speeches I have made from the floor of the \nSenate, but one was about the 700 scientists, most of whom were on the \nother side of the issue and are now saying the same thing as Claude \nAllegra, David Bellamy, Nir Shaviv, and others have said because they \nhave changed their minds on this thing.\n  So clearly the science has turned around, and that gives a sense of \nurgency for some people who want to respond to some of the extremists--\nmostly in California, and mostly in Hollywood--to go ahead and pass \nsomething. Get something passed and get it passed quickly. It is kind \nof like health care. They want to get it passed before people have a \nchance to read it.\n  So now we have a bill that is going to be put together and drafted in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, which was going to be \ncoming to the floor of the Senate prior to the August recess--just a \nfew weeks from now--but Chairman Boxer has now decided to put it off \nuntil after the recess. I applaud her for that, because time is not the \nfriend of the people who are trying to make believe we are going to \nhave to pass an expensive tax to address what they consider to be a \nmore serious problem than I consider it to be. And during the August \nrecess, during those 30 days, you are going to have a lot of Members of \nthis Senate be approached by people--such as people in the agricultural \ncommunity.\n\n  I had the opportunity of going and talking to the National Farm Coop \nthe other day and discussing with them what would happen if we were to \npass a cap-and-trade system and what that would do to the farmers of my \nState of Oklahoma and all throughout America. Stop and think about it. \nSeventy-one percent of the cost of a bushel of wheat is in fertilizer \nand in energy costs. That is what would go up. So you would be talking \nabout doubling the price of wheat, or I could use soybeans or any other \ncommodity. It would be disastrous for our farmers in America.\n  So the years have gone by, and slowly people have caught onto this \nthing, and that is why there is such a sense of urgency by people who \nwant to pass this before the public realizes what it is. Fortunately, \nthe public already understands, and the vast amount of recent polling \nshows that, just like the issue of closing Gitmo, which I talked about \na few minutes ago, they are solidly on the side of not passing a cap-\nand-trade tax which would constitute the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of America to address a problem that people aren't really sure \nexists to start with.\n  So I think we will defeat that in the Senate. It will, of course, \npass out of the committee. It is a very liberal committee. I love \neveryone on that committee, but they will pass anything that has to do \nwith a cap-and-trade package, so it will be on the floor of the Senate. \nBut it will not pass the Senate. And the reason I say that is we have \nhad several votes in the Senate--the House had never had any votes. We \nhave considered this five times, and actually voted three times--2003, \n2005, and 2008.\n  In 2003, it was called the McCain-Lieberman bill. At that time, I was \nthe only one on the floor. For 5 days, 10 hours a day, I talked about \nthis and was trying to defeat that thing. For 50 hours, only two or \nthree Senators came down for a short period of time to help me. Now, \nfast forward from 2003 to 2005 to 2008. The bill was called the Warner-\nLieberman bill. We had 23 Senators who came down, and it didn't take 5 \ndays to defeat it; it was just 2 days.\n  So I think in terms of passing the tax increase called cap and trade, \nthey have about maybe 34, 35 of votes, and it takes 60 votes in the \nSenate to pass it. Really, I am happy our forefathers were divined and \ninspired when they thought of the two Houses so we could have checks \nand balances.\n  So I think that is what will happen. I know there are other names I \ncould mention but cannot because some of the things I know are at a \nlevel of confidence. But some of the new Senators who have been \nelected, they don't really want to go back and say--whether Democrats \nor Republicans, but, in fact, it is the Democrats I have in mind--\nsaying to the people who have just elected them: Aren't I doing a good \njob for you, coming back from my first session and passing the largest \nannual tax increase in the history of America? That isn't going to \nhappen, Mr. President. People are so sensitive right now with the level \nof spending that is going on in this country.\n  I can remember in 1993, it was the first year of the Clinton \nadministration, and I was complaining at that time on the floor--I was \nserving in the House of Representatives--of the huge tax increase he \nwas pushing, and all of the things that were going on--with gun \ncontrol, the Hillary health care, which we all remember. At that time, \nI remember complaining on the floor: He even has a budget of $1.5 \ntrillion. Well, guess what. This one is $3.5 trillion. We can't sustain \nthat. We can't do that in America.\n  So I think one at a time we are going to have to stop these expensive \nprograms, one being the health care program--I know we can't afford \nthat--another being cap and trade. I think we will defeat that, and I \nbelieve America is now going to look a lot more carefully, and they are \ngoing to applaud the efforts being made to make sure any bill that \ncomes up for consideration of this magnitude should be on a Web site, \nas Mr. Boehner suggested, and several other Senators have suggested, \nincluding myself, for at least 72 hours so we and the American people \ncan read and see what it is going to be. I can assure you, if that had \nhappened when the cap-and-trade bill passed the House, it would not \nhave passed the House.\n  With that, I see there is someone else on the floor wanting to have \nthe floor, so I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what is the status of the Senate right \nnow?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in consideration of \nS. 1390.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the pending \namendment. Let's all imagine a situation. You are a 25-year-old, a \nfather of two, it is night and you are walking home across a park. A \ngroup of teenagers come near and they throw a slur at you. When you \nrespond and their verbal attacks escalate, they are nasty. They seek to \ndehumanize you because of where you were born, how you look or how you \nspeak. There is a fight, four on one, in which you are pummeled to the \nground and kicked in the skull repeatedly.\n  As you lie on the pavement in convulsions, foam oozing from your \nmouth, life slipping away, there is one more insult. They yell a \nwarning to anyone who looks like you or talks\n\n[[Page S7541]]\n\nlike you that they will do the same thing.\n  Imagine you are this man's two little children. Your father spends 2 \ndays in intensive care, his face bruised and swollen, his head \nbandaged, tubes everywhere, and then he passes on from this world. You \nwill never remember your father holding you or feeding you or kissing \nyou; you are too young. What you will remember is growing up without a \nfather. He was the victim of a needless death from a senseless beating, \na beating fueled by red-hot hatred for the type of person he was.\n  The one hope for some small measure of fairness so that these two \nyoung children will one day know that justice was served after their \ndaddy was killed would be an appropriate conviction for this \nunthinkable crime. But in the courthouse the verdict is read. The most \nserious charges, the most appropriate charges, are discarded. At most, \ntwo of the four young men who committed this murder in a bigoted rage \nwill spend less than 2 years--less than 2 years--behind bars. But they \ncould be there for as little as 6 months--6 months in jail. But this \nman, this father, he is gone forever.\n  It is as sad and heart wrenching a situation as you can imagine. How \nwe wish it was only that, a horror story we simply imagined. But it is \nnot a figment of our imagination, it is a dose of reality. This \nnightmare scene actually happened, and it did not happen in a society \nless open than ours, nor did it happen 100 or 200 years ago. It \nhappened exactly 1 year ago in Shenandoah, PA, less than 150 miles from \nwhere this Chamber is; less than 50 miles from my home State of New \nJersey.\n  Luis Ramirez was the target of the vitriol and the beating; struck in \nthe chest so hard he bore a bruise in the shape of Jesus Christ from \nthe medallion he wore on a chain around his neck. As he lay, seizing \nfrom the deadly blows, if he had still been conscious what he would \nhave heard were words that, uncensored, do not befit the Senate.\n\n       Tell your [expletive] friends to get the [expletive] out of \n     Shenandoah or you will be [expletive] laying next to him.\n       Tell your [expletive] friends to get the [expletive] out of \n     Shenandoah or you will be [expletive] laying next to him.\n\n  This in the 21st century, in the United States of America, the land \nof the free--all men created equal--life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. Not for Luis Ramirez. He may have been born originally in a \ndifferent country, but he was just as human as you or I. It did not \nmatter. He was cursed and battered and put down like an abused animal \nwould be, in the United States of America.\n  The people who did this, the people who beat their fellow man to \ndeath, treating him as subhuman--this gang gets a veritable slap on the \nwrist.\n  We can change that--no more circumstances such as that, not with this \nlegislation. There is no better prosecutor of hate crimes in our \ncountry than Federal law enforcement. They are tough on these hate \ncriminals and they are determined to serve justice in each and every \none of these cases. If we are to make sure hate crimes are treated with \nthe seriousness they deserve, if we are to make sure would-be \nperpetrators think twice, Federal law enforcement must have a greater \ninvolvement.\n  I can hear opponents of this legislation, this particular amendment: \nThis is 2009. The President is African American. It is a reaction to an \ninsignificant problem.\n  Ask Luis Ramirez, if you could. I would ask them to consider this, \nfrom the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights: Between 2003 and 2007, \nhate crimes reported against Hispanics increased not just a little bit \nbut by 40 percent. In 2007, Hispanics were the target of 60 percent of \nhate crimes committed based on ethnicity, signifying an increasingly \nsharp rise.\n  But this is not just a problem confined to the Hispanic community. \nThe man who packed up his rifle, got in his car, drove to Washington, \nentered a building, opened fire, and claimed the life of a noble \nsecurity guard--he didn't just do that at any building. He did it at \nthe Holocaust Museum, because this murderer hates Jewish people, hates \nthem enough to kill.\n  Let's never forget the namesake of this legislation, Matthew Shepard, \na University of Wyoming student who had his whole life ahead of him \nbefore it was snatched away on an October night in the countryside near \nLaramie. Two men, uneasy with Matthew's sexual orientation, drove off \nfrom a bar with him, only to beat him mercilessly with a pistol and \nrope him to a fence, as if a warning to the gay community. They hated \nMatthew because he was gay. He lost his life because he was gay.\n  I ask those who would argue against this legislation, how many more \ntragic stories do we have to hear before we make our laws tougher? How \nmany more? Do we have to hear another story, such as the one of Jose \nOsvaldo Sucuzhanay, a father of two and native of Ecuador who ran a \nreal estate agency, who was headed home with his brother from a bar \nafter a church party. These brothers walked around the Brooklyn street \nwith arms around each other, like men in Latino cultures often do.\n  Up drove three men, yelling slurs that were both homophobic and \nracist, they belted Jose on the head with a glass bottle. They smashed \nhis head in with a metal bat. They continued to beat him and kick him \nand beat him and kick him. He clung to life for 2 days in a hospital \nand then he died.\n  How many more stories? Do we have to hear another story such as that \nof Marcelo Lucero? He, too, was born in Ecuador and he, too, was a real \nestate professional and he, too, was killed simply for the way he \nlooked and the way he spoke, the innocent victim of a senseless gang of \nteenagers on Long Island, driving around in search of ``some Mexicans \nto [expletive] up.''\n  Here is how the prosecutor described this assault:\n\n       Like a lynch mob, the defendant and his friends got out of \n     a car and surrounded Mr. Lucero.\n\n  Like a lynch mob--in the 21st century in the United States--they beat \nMarcelo and stabbed him to death.\n  How many more of these stories? How many more? Do we have to hear \nanother story such as that of Walter Sanchez? His horrific story \nhappened earlier this year and it happened in my home State of New \nJersey.\n  Walking to a restaurant with his cousin, a car with five men pulled \nup. Calling Walter a Hispanic son of a [expletive], they beat him \nsenseless. He was one of the lucky ones, escaping with his life, but he \nstill underwent hours of reconstructive surgery to put many of the \nbones in his face back together.\n  Again, how many stories do we have to tell? It is time to stop asking \nand it is time to start acting. We can pass this legislation and know, \nwhile there is still a ways to go until we have wiped our society clean \nof bigotry and hatred, we will have made it harder for the perpetrators \nof these evil acts to escape justice. As the law is written now, there \nare too many ways in which those who commit hate crimes can escape the \nkind of justice Federal law enforcement is prepared to bring.\n  Sometimes these loopholes are bewildering, even perverse. Remember \nthe story of Luis Ramirez, whose murderers will serve as little as 6 \nmonths in jail? The cruel irony is that the deadly beating he suffered \noccurred in the street, not in the park 100 feet away, the park where \nLuis had walked minutes, if not seconds, before he was battered. If \nthis murder of a hate crime had taken place in that park, it would have \nbeen Federal law enforcement's business. The delivery of justice may \nhave been different. As it turned out, local law enforcement, some of \nwhom were related to the assailants, took 2 weeks to arrest the four \nmen, and we know how the rest of the process turned out.\n  We can all agree, a hate crime is a hate crime--whether it is in the \npark or in the street, on the grass or on the pavement, 100 feet this \nway or 100 feet that way. A hate crime is a hate crime.\n  I sponsored, when I was back in the New Jersey legislature, the law \nthat became one of the first landmark pieces of legislation on hate \ncrimes in our country. I said then that we cannot eliminate hate with \nthe passage of a law, but we can send a clear societal message that we \ndo not tolerate such crimes against individuals because of their race, \nbecause of their religion, because of their ethnicity or, for that \nmatter, their sexual orientation.\n  Hate crimes are hate crimes. They are all an affront to the set of \nvalues\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\nupon which this great Nation stands, and they all deserve the full \nscrutiny of our Federal law enforcement.\n  It is time to pass this legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of the amendment and make sure each hate crime is met \nappropriately with justice.\n  I ask you to remember, as I started this speech, that father kicked \nto death, with the two children who will never ever know their father \nas so many of us are fortunate to know ours. Remember when you cast \nyour vote. Think that, but for the grace of God, it could be you. That \nis how momentous this decision is. That is how important this \nlegislation is. That is why justice is served with the passage of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the facilities and services located at \nOhana Nui and Camp Catlin, and designated as excess, were established \nat the behest of the U.S. Navy in the 1950s for the benefit of our \nmilitary and their families. Not-for-profit organizations responded to \nthe needs identified by the Navy to assist our military. The \nrelationships formed between the military and surrounding community \nhave grown over the past 50 years at Ohana Nui and Camp Catlin \nincluding schools for children in prekindergarten through high school. \nIt is my hope the Department of the Navy will consider the Federal Real \nProperty Management Regulations regarding adjusted fair market value \nwhen making their determination for the Ohana Nui and Camp Catlin \nproperty.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. president, today I submitted amendment No. 1572 to S. \n1390 that would provide for earned retirement payments to be restored \nto a group of selfless heroes in Alaksa.\n  In 1942, after the Alaska National Guard was called overseas, a group \nof brave Alaska Native men formed a group called the Alaska Territorial \nGuard, ATG. These men helped protect the territory of Alaska during and \nafter World War II by conducting scouting patrols and constructing \nmilitary airstrips. The brave men received no pay or benefits for their \nsacrifices during their time of service in the ATG. After disbanding in \n1947, many of these former ATG members continued their service in the \narmy and Alaska National Guard and other services.\n  Recognizing the heroic and patriotic actions of the ATG members, in \n2000 Congress passed a law that made former members of the ATG eligible \nfor veterans' benefits. In 2008, approximately 25 of these guardsmen, \nmostly Native Alaskans in their mid-to-late eighties, were issued \nmilitary retirement credit for their period of service in the ATG and \nbegan receiving a modest $500 a month in retirement pay.\n  However, in January of this year, the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService abruptly ended these payments based on a finding that a \nmisinterpretation of the law had resulted in erroneously awarding these \npayments. These men, who live in remote areas and rely on this payment \nfor day-to-day needs, were devastated by the unexpected decrease in \ntheir monthly income.\n  Understanding the significant financial impact experienced by these \nheroes and their contributions during World War II, the Secretary of \nthe Army provided them 2 months of pay from the emergency and \nextraordinary expense fund. The Alaska Legislature, further cushioning \nthe economic loss experienced by this courageous group, enacted a bill \nthat temporarily restores the entitlement to the ATG members until the \nearlier of the date that the Federal Government restores the \nentitlement or February 1, 2010.\n  My amendment permanently restores the earned Federal entitlement \nbenefit to members of the ATG for their service. As Members of the \nSenate, it is our responsibility to take care of those who have served \nand sacrificed. Earlier this year, this body supported restoring this \nentitlement to the ATG in the Senate-passed budget resolution, S. Con. \nRes. 13. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment to honor those \nwho have served.\n  Mr. President, amendment No. 1573 to S. 1390 would authorize the \nDepartment of Defense to reimburse military families for costs incurred \nfor transport of a second personally owned vehicle on a change of \npermanent duty station to or from Alaska, Hawaii, or Guam.\n  Current law only authorizes servicemembers to be reimbursed for the \ncost to transport one personally owned vehicle. As with their \ncounterparts in civilian life, many military families today own and \nrely on a second vehicle. For example, a significant number of military \nmembers live off base and commute to work, while their spouses work as \nwell, making ownership of just a single vehicle impractical for most \nfamilies.\n  Some military families ship their second vehicle back to the lower 48 \nStates or Alaska, Hawaii, or Guam at their personal expense. Shipment \nof a second personally owned vehicle to Alaska, Hawaii, or Guam, or to \nthe lower 48 States from these locations can cost our servicemembers as \nmuch as $2,000 out of pocket.\n  Other times, they opt to sell their second vehicle prior to the move \nand repurchase a second personally owned vehicle upon arrival of duty \nstation. This is a costly option resulting in severe financial loss.\n  The current policy of reimbursing military families for only \ntransport of one personally owned vehicle is an outdated policy that \nunfairly impacts the finances of these families who rely on a second \nvehicle to sustain their needs.\n  Authorizing reimbursement for a second privately owned vehicle will \ngreatly enhance the quality of life for our servicemembers and their \nfamilies stationed in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam, and those returning to \nthe lower 48 States and the District of Columbia from those locations, \nand will alleviate the unnecessary financial burdens on these families. \nI ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate all day \nwith regard to the national defense authorization bill, and, frankly, \nit is one of the frustrating aspects of serving in this great body, to \nsit here and debate an issue like we have debated over the last couple \nof days and to think that you are going to come to the floor of the \nSenate and to cast a vote on a very important measure that has been \ncharacterized by Senator McCain earlier as one of the most important \npieces of legislation or amendments that we will have--and I agree with \nhim that is the case--and all of a sudden we are thrown into an \nentirely different atmosphere with regard to what has taken place on \nthe floor.\n  All of a sudden we are not talking about defense, we are not talking \nabout our troops, we are not talking about the national security of the \nUnited States, we are talking about hate crimes.\n  We are in some very difficult times with respect to the national \nsecurity of our country. While Senator McCain and I disagree on the \nissue of the F-22 and this amendment, he and I agree strongly--and it \nis why he is my dear friend and why we agree on most things--about the \nfact that we ought to be here debating defense issues and voting on \ndefense issues.\n  It truly is frustrating. I know our soldiers in the field can't \nunderstand what in the world is going on in the Senate now, when they \nthought we were going to be debating and voting on amendments that \npertained to them--issues such as their pay raise, their quality of \nlife, weapon systems--and all of a sudden we are thrown into doing \nsomething else. So I just want to associate myself with the remarks of \nmy friend, Senator McCain, with respect to why we are here.\n  With regard to what Senator Levin said, frankly, Senator Dodd, on the \nother side of the aisle, who has been working very closely with me on \nthe F-22 amendment, he and I had a meeting with Senator Levin and \nSenator McCain on Monday, and informally--or actually formally agreed \nbetween the four of us--which is an informal agreement--that we would \nhave a vote on the Levin-McCain amendment on Wednesday morning. We \nthought that was kind of a done deal.\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\n  Now, all of a sudden we have debated and we have talked about this, \nwe have debated it again, we have talked about the amendment, and now \nwe are thrown into an entirely different scenario on the Senate floor \nwhen we have been prepared to vote. I would hope we still have the \nopportunity to vote in the short term on the issue of the F-22.\n  On that point, just very briefly, Mr. President, I want to state a \ncouple of things with regard to that issue. I made a very long \nstatement yesterday, and I am not going to go back into all the detail \nwith the reference to the why-fors of the F-22 and its value to the \nnational security of the United States, but there have been some \ncomments made on the Senate floor that I think are important to \naddress.\n  One of those comments made by Senator Levin was that I had made a \nstatement that there had never been a study by the Air Force which \nvalidated the requirement that 187 aircraft be the top line number for \nthe F-22.\n  What I said was there have been dozens of studies out there over the \nyears on the F-22, and there has only been one study--and it was an \ninternal study at the Department of Defense, without the input of the \nAir Force--that said 187 is the number. I want to make sure everybody \nin this body understands every single other study done internally, as \nwell as outside the Pentagon, outside the Air Force, outside the Office \nof the Secretary of Defense, or inside, has concluded that the \nrequirement for the number of F-22s we need far exceeds the number of \n187. The minimum number that has ever been referred to is 243, which is \nsome 56 airplanes more than the 187 we are talking about now.\n  Last week, in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nwe had GEN James Cartwright, who is a Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice \nChairman, and I asked General Cartwright if there was any study or any \nanalysis done at the Pentagon that validated the number 187. General \nCartwright told me:\n\n       There is a study in the Joint Staff that we just completed \n     and partnered with the Air Force which validates the number \n     of 187.\n\n  Well, on Monday afternoon, a reporter asked a Pentagon official, and \nthe top spokesman from the Pentagon, Geoff Morrell, made the statement \nin response to that reporter's inquiry about that study as follows:\n\n       Well, it is not so much a study as work products. What I \n     think General Cartwright was referring to is two different \n     work products, one by the Program Analysis and Evaluation \n     shop and one by the Air Force. Not so much a study.\n\n  So what has happened is there have been discussions within the \nPentagon to attempt to validate the number of 187. It is pretty obvious \nwhat I said on the floor of the Senate remains true, and that is that \nof all the dozens of studies that have been done on the F-22 \nrequirement, the minimum number that has ever been validated is 243. \nThe number goes up from there all the way to 781, which I think was our \noriginal number. The number of 381 is the number that has been used in \nmost of the recent studies as the number we need.\n  Also, with respect to other statements regarding the Secretary of \nDefense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and others who are saying \nthat 187 is the number, that is leadership at the Pentagon. The \nleadership at the Pentagon has the responsibility for sending a budget \nto the Senate and to the House, but it is our obligation as Members of \nthe Senate and the House to review that budget--sometimes to agree with \nit; sometimes to disagree with it. We often disagree with it.\n  In this case, a number of us disagree with the number of 187 as being \nthe top line for the F-22. That is not unusual. But with respect to \nwhat the leadership at the Pentagon has said, let me go back to a \nletter I talked about yesterday, and it is a letter that has been \nreceived from Rebecca Grant, the Director of the Mitchell Institute for \nAirpower Studies. What she says in her letter to me is: In the letter \nof July 13 from Admiral Mullen and Secretary Gates, the \ncharacterization of F-35 as a ``half-generation newer aircraft than the \nF-22 and more capable in a number of areas such as electronic warfare \nand combating enemy air defenses'' is incorrect and misleading.\n  Air Force Secretary Donley and General Schwartz have repeatedly \nstated: ``The F-22 is, unquestionably, the most capable fighter in our \nmilitary inventory.''\n  The F-22 was designed with twice the fighting speed and altitude of \nthe F-35 to preserve U.S. advantages in the air even if adversaries \ncontest our electronic countermeasures or reach parity with us.\n  She also States in that letter:\n\n       If electronic jamming fails, the speed, altitude and \n     maneuverability advantages of F-22 remain. The F-35 was \n     designed to operate after F-22s secure the airspace and does \n     not have the inherent altitude and speed advantages to \n     survive every time against peers with counter electronic \n     measures. Only five F-35s are flying today. The F-35 has \n     completed less than half its testing. Developmental tests \n     will not be completed until 2013. It is impossible to assess \n     the full capabilities of the F-35 until operational test is \n     complete in 2014.\n\n  The Secretary of Defense and others in the administration are putting \nall of their tactical air eggs in one basket, Mr. President. That is a \nvery dangerous road down which we should not travel with respect to the \nnational security of the United States and the safety and security of \nour men and women.\n\n\n                   Appointment to the HELP Committee\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under an order of May 5 and under the \nauspices of S. Res. 18, I made a temporary appointment of Sheldon \nWhitehouse to serve on the HELP Committee, while retaining my authority \nto make a permanent appointment to the HELP Committee. I now announce \nthat as of today, Senator Al Franken is appointed to serve on a \npermanent basis to the slot that was occupied by Senator Sheldon \nWhitehouse.\n\n\n                           Senator Whitehouse\n\n  Mr. President, Sheldon Whitehouse, since coming to the Senate, has \ntruly been a workhorse. There isn't anything I have asked this fine man \nto do that he has not come forward with enthusiasm to do it. We have \nseen the brilliant work he has done on so many different occasions as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee.\n  His other assignments in the Senate have been just as auspicious as \nhis work on the Judiciary Committee. His background is significant. He \nhas a real interest in health care. His work on the bill that was \nreported out of the HELP Committee today was essential. All members of \nthe committee, Democrats and Republicans, are astounded at how good he \nwas.\n  I repeat, he enthusiastically accepted this temporary assignment \nwhile we waited for the long, never-ending situation in Minnesota to \ncome to a close. Senator Whitehouse was far from just a seat-warmer. He \ndove into the issues and, to no one's surprise, was a substantive \ncontributor to one of the most important bills the committee has ever \nmarked up in the history of this country.\n  Without belaboring the point, on behalf of the entire Senate, I \ngreatly appreciate his service on the committee, and I personally thank \nhim, as does the entire Democratic caucus. I bet if a poll were taken \nof those who serve as Republicans on the HELP Committee, they would \nacknowledge his brilliance and hard work. I know Senator Kennedy, whom \nwe have missed on that committee and the vital work he has done for \ndecades in the Senate, is someone who has watched from afar and \napplauded Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. President, I came to the House of Representatives in 1982. In \nthat class of 1982 was a young man from Arizona, someone who came with \na certain degree of fame. His name is John McCain. He had served our \ncountry valiantly during the Vietnam conflict and spent 5 years in a \nprisoner-of-war camp in Vietnam. I have great admiration and respect \nfor him. I want the record to reflect that my respect for John McCain \nis very deep. Not only did we come to the House together, but we also \ncame to the Senate together. We were elected together in 1986. Our \nseniority is as close as it can get. We both have the same amount of \nservice in the House of Representatives, so seniority is determined by \nhow many people are in the State of Nevada and the State of Arizona. \nThere are more people in the State of Arizona than in the State of \nNevada, so he is one up on me in overall seniority in the Senate.\n  Having said that, recognizing who this man is, he was proudly the \nnominee for Republicans in the last election. I watched his campaign \nand admired his courage, the stands he took. While I may not have \nagreed with him,\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\nI recognize he has strong feelings. But so do I.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona today said he was ``deeply, deeply \ndisappointed'' that what he considers an unrelated amendment; that is, \nthe Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes bill, has been added to this bill, the \nDefense authorization bill. I wonder on which recent morning did the \nSenator from Arizona wake up and suddenly feel so strongly. Where has \nhe been in the past? Let me make a couple of comments about the remarks \nof my friend from Arizona.\n  First, his is a new outrage over a very old issue. The hate crimes \nbill was first added to the Defense authorization bill in a previous \nCongress. I didn't do it. The amendment today was an amendment I \noffered on behalf of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and other \nsponsors of this legislation. Senator Leahy would have been here, but \nhe is a little busy with the Supreme Court nomination. The hate crimes \nbill was first added to the Defense authorization bill when George Bush \nwas President, a Republican. Where was the Senator's disappointment \nthen? I heard no big statements at that time, and no one else did.\n  Second, the Senator from Arizona has evidently not always held the \nbelief he discussed today. This is a new conversion. He has evidently \nnot always believed that bills must only contain amendments that relate \ndirectly to the underlying legislation.\n  It was just a while ago a bill came before the Senate known as the \nmotor-voter bill, a bill to make it easier for people to register to \nvote. When they got their registration changed on their car, they would \nat the same time have the opportunity to register to vote. It was a \nunique and good idea, and it has allowed millions of people to register \nto vote who ordinarily would not register.\n  On that legislation, motor-voter, Senator McCain offered a line-item \nveto amendment. It had nothing to do with registration to vote. So it \nis hard to understand how his was the kind of related amendment he \ndemands today. In fact, that issue went to the Supreme Court, where the \nSupreme Court declared it illegal, unconstitutional.\n  It was a year before that that Senator McCain offered the same \namendment to a research bill. Again, it is hard to understand how his \nwas the kind of related amendment he demands today.\n  Additionally, Senator McCain offered an amendment that would change \nSenate rules about tax increases to a bill about unemployment \ncompensation. It is hard to understand how his was the kind of related \namendment that he suddenly today demands.\n  He also offered his line-item veto amendment to a bill that would \ngive more rights to blind Americans. It is hard to understand how the \nline-item veto had anything to do with the visually impaired. But it \nappears this was the kind of amendment he demands today.\n  Again, Senator McCain offered an amendment about Medicare to a bill \nfunding energy and water development, having no relation, obviously. It \nis hard to understand how his was a kind of related amendment that he \ndemands today.\n\n  The third point I want to make is that the Senator from Arizona is \nnot alone in offering such unrelated amendments. His Republican \ncolleagues do it all the time. In fact, they are quite fond of doing \nit.\n  Where has his outrage been when that has happened, Mr. President? \nWhere has the outrage been from the Senator from Arizona when, for \nexample, one of his Republican Senator friends twice offered an \namendment about the ACORN group? This is an organization around the \ncountry that is involved in a lot of different things. But he wanted to \ndo an amendment on the economic recovery package related to the ACORN \norganization. That was a bill, of course, that had nothing to do with \nvoting registration.\n  Another Republican Senator offered an amendment about prescription \ndrugs to a bill that funds homeland security--no relation whatsoever. \nWhere was the outrage of my friend from Arizona about that?\n  Another Republican Senator offered an amendment about the fairness \ndoctrine--a fake issue meant exclusively to excite a very small segment \nof our population--to a bill that would give DC residents, finally, the \nright to vote. Where was the outrage of my friend from Arizona about \nthat?\n  Another Republican Senator offered the same amendment; that is, the \nfairness doctrine; another Senator, same amendment, on the same \nconjured issue to the Omnibus appropriations bill. That is the bill we \npassed to keep our government running and complete unfinished business \nfrom the Bush administration. Where was my friend's outrage about that?\n  Another Republican Senator offered an amendment about union dues to \nthat same Omnibus appropriations bill, having nothing to do with what \nwe were trying to accomplish here.\n  Another Republican Senator offered an amendment about congressional \npay to another appropriations bill, having no relationship whatsoever.\n  Another Republican Senator offered an amendment about rules \nsurrounding charitable donations to the national service bill--no \nrelationship whatsoever. I did not hear my friend say one word about \nthat. The Senator from Arizona did not complain 1 minute about that.\n  Another Republican Senator offered an amendment about national \nlanguage to a bill that helps us crack down on mortgage fraud. Now try \nthat one. That is something that might stir up a little outrage but not \nfrom my friend from Arizona.\n  Another Republican Senator offered an amendment on auto dealers to a \nbill that funds our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Where was the \noutrage on that--an amendment on auto dealers on a bill that funds our \ntroops in Iraq and Afghanistan, the supplemental appropriations bill?\n  Mr. President, there are lots of other examples. Those are just a \nfew. It is hard to understand how any of these amendments were the kind \nof related amendment Senator McCain demands today. But it is even \nharder to understand why the Senator from Arizona did not feel the need \nto express, as I have said, the outrage he did this morning.\n  Finally, I want to say that I would gladly, as a matter of principle, \nkeep each of these bills separate; that is, hate crimes, Defense \nauthorization. But the reality is, the Republicans' relentless and \nreckless strategy of slowing, stopping, and stalling has made it \nimpossible for us to do so. My friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, \nknows the most recent example of this all too well. His Republican \ncolleagues refuse to let us vote on his amendment, which I support. I \nsupport the F-22 amendment. I support that. Why can't we vote on that? \nThis could have been done yesterday, the day before, today, but for the \nstubbornness of the Senate Republicans.\n  We have lots of work to do, a lot of priorities to fulfill, and a lot \nof mistakes in the last 8 years to correct. And we are trying to do \nthat. The bottom line is, we would not have to take the time for such \nsteps if the Republican minority would not waste the American people's \ntime and money by making us jump through procedural hoop after \nprocedural hoop just to do our jobs. Last Congress, 100 filibusters; \nthis Congress, I think we are at 21 already this year--21.\n  To my knowledge, Senator McCain has never supported hate crimes \nlegislation. If I am mistaken, it certainly would not be the first \ntime, but that is the information I have. It is my understanding he \ndoes not think there probably is ever a good time to pass this \nimportant and overdue bill.\n  This is an issue here, a very important issue. And that is the real \nreason the Republicans, I assume, do not like to talk about the Matthew \nShepard hate crimes bill. But I am not afraid to talk about the issue.\n  A man by the name of Luis Ramirez was picking strawberries and \ncherries to support his three children and a woman he wanted to marry. \nWhen he was not working the fields, he worked a second job in a local \nfactory in Shenandoah, PA. It is a coal town of only 5,000 people.\n  As he was walking home one Saturday night, six high schoolers jumped \nhim in a park. They taunted and screamed racial slurs at Luis, who came \nto this small town in the middle of Pennsylvania from a small town in \nthe middle of Mexico. But the boys did not stop with the taunting and \nscreaming racial slurs. That was not enough.\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\nThey punched, beat, and kicked him. When Luis's friend pleaded with the \nteenagers to stop, one yelled back: Tell your Mexican friends to get \nout of town, or you'll be lying next to him.\n  These boys stomped on Luis so hard that an imprint of the necklace he \nwas wearing was embedded into his chest. They beat him so badly and so \nbrutally that Luis never regained consciousness. He is dead. On July \n14, 2008--2 days after the beating and exactly 1 year ago yesterday--\nLuis Ramirez died. He was 25 years old.\n  Hate crimes embody a unique brand of evil, and that is why the \nlegislation is so important. It is terrorism; it is just a different \nkind than we normally see or think of. A violent act may physically \nhurt just a single victim and cause grief for loved ones. But hate \ncrimes do more. They distress entire communities, entire groups of \npeople, and our country.\n  Our friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, has for many years courageously \nfought for the legislation Senator Leahy and I offered as an amendment \ntoday to the Defense authorization bill. Senator Kennedy has correctly \ncalled hate crimes a form, I repeat, of domestic terrorism. It is our \nobligation to protect Americans from this domestic terror.\n  The hate crimes bill will help bring justice to those who \nintentionally choose their victims based on race, color, religion, \nnationality, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, sexual identity, or \ndisability. Disability--there are examples all the time of someone who \nmay not be what ``normal'' may be; maybe they are mentally challenged. \nThere are all kinds of examples of people for that reason taking \nadvantage and hurting them. That is a hate crime.\n\n  Hate crimes are rampant and the numbers are rising. The Department of \nJustice estimates that hundreds happen every day. Now State and local \ngovernments are on their own when it comes to prosecuting even the most \nviolent crimes and conducting the most extensive and expensive \ninvestigations. State and local governments will always come first, as \nthey should, but if those governments are unwilling or unable to \nprosecute hate crimes--and if the Justice Department believes that may \nmean justice will not be served--this law will let the Federal \nauthorities lend a hand to State and local authorities.\n  I spent some time yesterday with Judy Shepard. I have five children. \nI have four boys. I had never met Judy Shepard until yesterday. My \nwife, within the past few months, had lunch with her and a number of \nother people and sat next to her. She told me what a wonderful person \nshe is. When I met with her yesterday, the thing she said that was so \ntraumatic to me was: I only have one boy left. Two children; Matthew is \ndead.\n  The bill we have is named after Matthew Shepard, Judy's son. He was a \n21-year-old college student when he was tortured and killed for being \ngay--and did they torture, did they torture. And that was not good \nenough for them. In the cold Wyoming night, they took him, before he \nwas dead, and hung him on a barbed-wire fence.\n  When Wyoming police pursued justice in Matthew's murder, they needed \nresources they did not have. Laramie, WY, is where it is. Police could \nnot call in Federal law enforcement for help--the law would not allow \nit--and their expensive investigation devastated that small police \ndepartment. It was a police department of 40 people--not all police \nofficers. As all police officers, some of them took care of the little \njail, did jail duty, and they were responding to phone calls. Out of \nthis 40-person police department, they had to lay off 5 people so they \ncould prosecute this crime, this vicious crime, this hate crime. But it \ncost that little town a lot. When this bill becomes law, that will \nnever happen again in Laramie, WY, or anyplace else in the country.\n  We must not be afraid to call these crimes what they are. The \nAmerican people know this is the right thing to do. Hundreds of legal, \nlaw enforcement, civil rights, and human rights groups know this is the \nright thing to do. The U.S. Senate knows this is the right thing to do.\n  This bill simply recognizes that there is a difference between \nassaulting someone to steal his money or doing so because he is gay or \ndisabled or Latino or Jewish; that there is a difference between \nsetting fire to an office building and setting fire to a church, a \nsynagogue, or a mosque; that there is a difference, as we learned so \ntragically last month, between shooting a security guard and shooting \nhim because he works at the Holocaust Museum.\n  It is a shame that we often do not discuss our responsibility to do \nsomething about horrific hate crimes until after another one has been \ncommitted. It means we always tend to act too late. But does this mean \nwe should not act now? Of course not. It means, in fact, the opposite: \nit means we must act before another one of our sons or daughters or \nfriends or partners is attacked or killed merely because of who they \nare.\n  We must act in the name of people such as Thomas Lahey, who, in 2007, \nwas beaten unconscious in Las Vegas. Why? Because he was gay.\n  Not far from my hometown of Searchlight, NV, is a place called \nLaughlin, NV--25 miles away. It is on the river, a little resort \ncommunity. We must act in the name of Jammie Ingle, who, in 2002, was \nbeaten and bludgeoned to death in Laughlin, NV. Why? They thought he \nwas gay.\n  We must act in the name of Tony Montgomery, who was shot and killed \nin Reno. Why? Because he was an African American.\n  We must act in the name of those who worship at Temple Emanu-El in \nReno, a synagogue that has been firebombed time and time again by \nskinheads. We must act in the name of Luis Ramirez, whom I already \ntalked about who died 1 year ago this week. We must act in the name of \nJudy Shepard, of her son, Matthew Shepard, whose family has fought \ntirelessly since his brutal death, his brutal murder, so others may \nknow justice. If their country doesn't stand for them, if we don't \nstand for them, who will?\n\n  The F-22 is an airplane I have seen. A number of them are stationed \nat Nellis Air Force Base. Nellis Air Force Base has almost 15,000 \npeople who are involved in that air base, civilian and military \npersonnel. We are so proud of that. Nellis Air Force Base is named \nafter Bill Nellis from Searchlight, NV. Bill Nellis was a war hero in \nWorld War II. He joined then the Army Air Corps, already having two \nchildren, was way beyond the age when he would be drafted, but he \nvolunteered. He served 69 missions before a dive bomber went down in \nBelgium where he is now buried. We are proud of Nellis. We are proud \nthe F-22s are there. But we have had enough F-22s at Nellis Air Force \nBase. We have enough F-22s anyplace else.\n  The F-22 is a Cold War weapon that has not flown a single mission \nover Iraq or Afghanistan--not one; not a training mission, not any kind \nof a mission. It is a powerful plane built to fight superpowers. But as \nwe all know, the wars we fight today are not against superpowers. This \ngeneration of our military bravely fights a new generation of warfare \nagainst terrorists and insurgents. For today's national security needs, \nthe F-22 is an overpriced and underperforming tool. And the nearly 200 \nwe already have in our fleet is sufficient. It is a sufficient \ndeterrent to the potential of conventional war. But some want us to \nspend at least $2 billion to keep making more of them. That is only the \nfirst step. Actually, it is $1.75 billion. I rounded it off to $2 \nbillion. It is a very expensive plane to build and a very expensive \nplane to fly. It costs taxpayers $42,000 an hour to operate.\n  This technology is not suited for today's warfare. The radar in the \nF-22 means that when it flies over heavily populated cities such as the \nones in Iraq and Afghanistan, its position is easily given away. We \nhave at Nellis Air Force Base in the ranges there what we call red flag \nactivities.\n  A couple times a year, we bring our fighting forces there, our air \nfighting forces, and they do mock exercises. It is a wonderful place, \none of the few places in the world this can take place. They do all \nkinds of good things. Aircraft from all over the world come there to \nparticipate in these war games. If the F-22's radar is turned off to \navoid being so easily detected, its agility is significantly \ncompromised. We know that. This was proven recently in a recent \nexercise at Nellis Air Force Base, when an F-16 brought down in a war \ngame an F-22 that simply had turned its radar off in a test fight.\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\n  There is broad bipartisan consensus that ending the F-22's production \nis in our national security interests. Here is a list of some who \nagree: Chairman Levin; Ranking Member McCain; Commander in Chief Barack \nObama; the previous Commander in Chief, President Bush; the Secretary \nof Defense; the previous Secretary of Defense; the chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I repeat; the ranking member, I \nrepeat, of the Senate Armed Services Committee; the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff; the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; \nthe Secretary of the Air Force; the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. \nCan you believe that? And we are going to try to move forward in doing \nthis, and no one wants it in the military. All of those have prudently \npointed out that buying more F-22s that we don't need means doing less \nof something we do need.\n  Some have encouraged us to continue making this Cold War-era plane \nbecause it creates jobs for those who build them. Being a little bit \npersonal here, the stealth airplane was developed in the deserts of \nTonopah, NV. It was a wonderful thing our country did. Each of these \nairplanes had its own hangar up in the desert because the Soviet \nsatellites came over, and they couldn't come out in the daytime. These \npilots were trained so efficiently; everything they did was in pitch \ndarkness, but that is where these airplanes were developed and flown.\n  There came a time after it became public that we had these stealth \naircraft that they had to put them someplace. They put most of them at \nNellis Air Force Base. The Pentagon, after they had been stationed \nthere for a matter of months, made a decision: That is not good. We \nneed to move them to New Mexico to an airbase. Pete Domenici, my \nfriend, was concerned about whether they should go to New Mexico or \nNevada. I said: Pete, I got a deal for you. I, personally, don't \nbelieve that what we do for the military is a jobs program. I think it \nis to make our Nation more secure. Let's have the General Accounting \nOffice do a study, and if they come back and say it will save the \ncountry money and it will make our country more secure if they move \nthem to New Mexico, I am not going to say a word about it. It took the \nGeneral Accounting Office a matter of a few months to do this. They \ncame back and said these stealth aircraft would be better off in New \nMexico, and it will make our country more secure; they can train better \nthere because of how much activity there is at Nellis, and it will save \nthe country money.\n  That is how I feel about the military. I think we have to have the \nmost sophisticated, secure weapons systems that exist, but it has to be \nsomething that is good for our country. It is obvious--with all these \npeople from President Obama to President Bush to the Secretaries of \nDefense in the past to now--these airplanes are not necessary. They \nprudently point out that buying more F-22s that we don't need means \ndoing less of something else that we do need.\n  I repeat: Some have encouraged us to continue making this airplane \nbecause it creates jobs for those who build it. I don't believe that is \nthe purpose of why we are here. I understand the importance of jobs, \nbut a more advanced jet, the F-35, which can be used by all branches of \nthe military service, would create similar jobs--jobs that actually \nwill enhance our national security. That is what this is all about. \nThat is what this bill is about, the Defense authorization bill.\n  Finally, President Obama has pledged to veto this Defense \nauthorization bill if it includes continuing to build this obsolete \nairplane. And he will veto it. That is a risk, and why would anyone \nwant to take it? I spoke to the President's Chief of Staff yesterday. \nThe President is going to veto this bill. This is kind of an: Oh, he \nwill never do that. He will.\n  Cutting funding for wasteful programs is good for our economy, good \nfor our workers, and good for the continued military dominance of our \ncountry. I oppose continuing to build a weapon that will compromise our \nnational security. I oppose continuing to fund a program that will \njeopardize our economy. I oppose wasting billions of dollars of \ntaxpayer money on a plane that doesn't defend us in our wars that we \nfight today and will not defend us in tomorrow's wars. I support moving \nour military into today's century the 21st century, not go back to the \nlast century.\n\n  Now, finally, let me say this: I have called my friend, the \nRepublican leader, and he will call in just a minute when he has some \ntime because I didn't call him while he was in a meeting. I wanted to \nspeak to him before I came to the floor, but I have something else I \nhave to do tonight. We are going to vote on invoking cloture. We will \nsee if we can get 60 votes on this hate crimes amendment that is on \nthis bill. I would like to work it out so we can do it conveniently for \neveryone, sometime tomorrow. What I would like to do is set aside some \nmore time if we want to debate more the hate crimes, set aside more \ntime to do that, and if people want to do the F-22, let's do that. \nLet's get these two out of the way. I can't force an amendment vote on \nthe F-22, but I can force a vote on cloture, and we are going to do \nthat. We will do that tomorrow. Tomorrow may spill over until a little \nafter midnight Friday morning, but we are going to do this. So everyone \nshould understand the hate crimes bill is going to be voted on either \ntomorrow or very early Friday morning. I have said Friday there will be \nno votes, and that is by day. This will be in the middle of the night. \nI hope we don't have to do that, but that is when time runs out on \nthis.\n  I think these two amendments are important. I understand the anxiety \nof those who would rather not have hate crimes legislation on this \nbill. I accept that. But I spent a lot of my time here on the floor, as \nI have outlined, wondering why in the world other people don't complain \nwhen they offer these ridiculous amendments on legislation that is so \nimportant. I have indicated that we are going to go back to the way we \nused to do business in the Senate. I have done that during the time I \nhave had this job. We have this--this year we have had an open \namendment process except on rare occasions. I have stood here when we \nhave done abortion amendments, gun amendments, you name it. I have told \nSenator McConnell I wish this were not the case, but that is why we are \nhere, to make tough votes and easy votes both.\n  So I hope we can work something out, where we can resolve this matter \ntomorrow during the daylight hours; otherwise, we will do it tomorrow \nnight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his words \nconcerning the parliamentary situation we are in. Of course, I am very \nappreciative of his words about the long service we have shared \ntogether, both in the other body and in the Senate. Since I have \nreturned from the campaign trail, I have appreciated his kind words \nabout my service to the country. I must say, while the majority leader \nis still on the floor, I might point out that they are dramatically \ndifferent from the comments he made about me during the campaign--not \njust our political differences but my qualifications to serve and other \nstatements about my character. All those things are said in political \ncampaigns, but I am certainly glad to see sort of a significant change \nin his comments concerning me, and I am always very grateful.\n  Can I also say that the distinguished leader said he couldn't \nunderstand that I couldn't understand. Well, the thing I can't \nunderstand is the fact that the majority leader can, by virtue of being \nmajority leader, put legislation at any time before this body. I have \nnever been majority leader, and in all candor I never want to be \nmajority leader. I think the majority leader in the Senate has a very \ntough job. I appreciate the hard work he does in trying to move \nlegislation through the Senate. My former colleague and one-time \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, once said that being majority leader of \nthe Senate was like herding cats, and I certainly agree with that \nassessment.\n  So let me say I appreciate the work the majority leader does, but if \nI had been majority leader, I would never have had to do any of those \namendments. The majority leader sets the agenda for the Senate. All he \nhas to do if he wants the hate crimes bill up is to schedule it to be \ntaken up and debated and discussed and amended--but in the\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\nregular order of the Senate. Instead, he chooses to put it on the \nDefense authorization bill, a bill that is vital to the future of the \nsecurity of this Nation.\n  I understand his passion concerning hate crimes. I have heard \nspeakers come to the Senate floor all day, and they, in very graphic \nand moving terms, described events, as I am sure the next speaker \nwill--about the terrible crimes committed in this country by some of \nthe worst of the worst people who have ever inhabited this country.\n  But the question remains: Why should a bill of this importance--the \nhate crimes legislation--not have been, at the majority leader's \ndirection, moved through the Judiciary Committee, reported out, and \nreported to the floor of the Senate? We have been in session since \nJanuary. I am sure the Judiciary Committee has a lot to do. This has \nbeen described by proponents, as they come to the floor, as one of the \nmost important issues of our time. If it is, why not move it through \nthe Judiciary Committee, move it to the floor, and allow us to amend, \ndebate, and discuss the issue? Instead, it is put, as an amendment, on \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  That is not right, Mr. President. The fact is, the amendment the \nmajority leader just, very rightfully, extolled, the Levin-McCain \namendment--and I appreciate his strong remarks about the importance of \nit--is the one he wanted withdrawn. The reason we are not debating it \nnow is because the majority leader told the chairman of the committee \nto withdraw the amendment.\n  I appreciate his passionate advocacy of this issue. I also want to \nreemphasize this isn't just about $1.75 billion. This amendment is \nabout whether we are going to change, fundamentally, the way we do \nbusiness.\n  If the opponents of the amendment succeed, and we fund additional F-\n22 aircraft, which as the majority leader pointed out has never flown \nin Iraq or Afghanistan, that signal to the military industrial complex, \nwhich President Eisenhower warned us about is business as usual in our \nNation's Capitol.\n  So this is an amendment that has transcendent importance. The \nPresident has guaranteed a veto. The Secretary of Defense came out and \nstaked his reputation on succeeding here and eliminating, bringing to \nan end the F-22 production line and moving forward with the F-35 \nproduction line.\n  A lot of my friends ought to understand this is not just about \ncutting or eliminating or ending production of the F-22. It is also \nabout the F-35 aircraft. If I had been majority leader, I would have--\nwhen he described those amendments I put on bills that were before the \nSenate, it was because I could not get them up in any other way.\n  Let me say this: Hate crimes legislation deserves the attention of \nthe Senate in the normal legislative process with amendments, debate, \nand discussion. If it is so important, and speaker after speaker, \nincluding the majority leader, came to the Senate floor talking about \nhow important and vital it is and all of the terrible things that have \nhappened as a result of, in their view, not having this bill--although \nthat is not in agreement with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. But \nthe fact is, then you would think we would want to take it up in the \nregular fashion and debate it, and that we would want to improve it and \nmake it more effective through the amending process. But, no, we are \nnot going to do that. We are going to take down the pending amendment \nthat is probably one of the most significant amendments we have had in \nrecent history of the Senate--at least as far as defense is concerned--\nand replace it with a piece of legislation that is complex, certainly \ncontroversial, and certainly deserves the full attention of the Senate.\n  I proposed earlier a unanimous-consent request, which was rejected by \nthe majority, that we move back to the F-22 amendment, that we dispose \nof this legislation, and then that we move to the hate crimes bill, the \nMatthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, even bypassing the \nJudiciary Committee, which is not a normal thing to do given the \ncomplexity of the issue.\n  I am deeply moved by the stories the majority leader told, and both \nSenators from California came to the floor, and many others have given \nvery graphic and dramatic and compelling stories recounting terrible \nthings that have happened to our citizens--horrible, awful, horrifying \nthings. I understand that and my sympathies and thoughts and prayers go \nout to their families. We must do everything in our power to make sure \nthese kinds of horrendous acts are never repeated.\n  Let me point out another thing, if I could. There are also men and \nwomen in the military who are in harm's way now and who have been \ngravely wounded. The sooner we enact this legislation, we will make \npreparation and be able to better care for them.\n  Mr. President, I don't usually tell these anecdotes. I heard a lot \ntoday, and I sympathize with them. Before the majority leader took the \nfloor, I was outside the Senate Chamber. There was a young man there \nwho said he wanted to meet me--a young marine in a wheelchair, badly \nwounded. He was there with his family. He was escorted by Congressman \nKennedy. I was gratified and moved that he wanted to meet me.\n  Do you know what. That made me want to come back here and pass this \nlegislation as quickly as possible because this legislation, No. 1, \nprovides fair compensation and first-rate health care and addresses the \nneeds of the injured and improves the quality of life of the men and \nwomen of the All-Volunteer Force--Active Duty, National Guard, Reserve, \nand their families. That is the No. 1 priority of this legislation.\n  Instead of moving this legislation as quickly as possible through the \nSenate, we have now withdrawn the amendment and moved on to a piece of \nlegislation that has nothing to do with the purpose and our obligation \nto the men and women serving this country.\n  I understand what numbers are, and I understand what the outcome of \nelections is. I understand there is a majority on the other side of the \naisle. But what is being done by withdrawing an amendment that has \ntranscendent importance and putting another totally unrelated piece of \nlegislation in--it may set a dangerous precedent for this body.\n  This is not a one-shot deal; this the hate crimes bill. This is not \nan amendment to say you can carry a gun in a national park. This is not \na single specific issue bill--hate crimes. We are talking about a very \nlarge, encompassing piece of legislation that, by any rational \nobservation, demands to be considered through the proper committee and \non the floor through the proper process.\n  We are now holding up the progress of legislation that is important \nto the future security of this country and the men and women who serve \nit, to give them the resources, training, technology, equipment, force \nprotections, and authorities they need to succeed in combat and \nstability operations.\n  I understand and appreciate the passion of the advocates of hate \ncrime legislation. They have made it very clear and told compelling \nstories on the Senate floor. I believe we must take it up and enact it \nas immediately as possible. What we should be doing is taking up the \nhate crimes bill in the Senate for full debate and discussion as soon \nas we finish the Defense authorization bill. There is no connection \nbetween the Defense authorization bill and hate crimes. It is a complex \nand detailed--26 pages, as I recall--piece of legislation.\n  Again, I appreciate the kind comments of the majority leader, who \ncame to the floor and said he couldn't understand certain things I have \ndone. I hope the majority leader understands better now. If he doesn't, \nI will be glad to come to the floor again and point out that what we \nare doing is wrong. It is wrong for us to get off the legislation that \nprovides for the defense and security of this Nation. It is wrong to \ntake up a piece of legislation that should go through the appropriate \ncommittee.\n  This is what we teach kids in school in Civics 101--that a bill is \nproposed and goes through the proper committee, is reported out, and \nthen it comes to the floor of the Senate for debate and amendment. \nInstead, we are violating the fundamental rules of procedure of the \nSenate.\n  As we continue and vote at 2 a.m.--or whatever it is that we are \ngoing to do--\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\nall we will have done is delay the responsibility we have, which is to \nprovide for the security of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my \nremarks, which will be no more than 5 minutes, Senator Brown be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes, and then Senator Chambliss be \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, my dear friend from Arizona has \nspoken very eloquently about the transcendent importance of the Levin-\nMcCain amendment. I could not agree with him more. We tried for 2 days \nto get an agreement to vote on that amendment. It is a critically \nimportant amendment for the reasons he has given and for the reasons I \nhopefully have given persuasively around here, and others have as well.\n  We have this President, the previous President, this Secretary of \nDefense, the previous Secretary of Defense, this Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, the previous Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Vice Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the \nSecretary of the Air Force saying we have enough F-22s. We have to move \non to the F-35, which is under production, by the way. We have 30 F-35s \nfunded in this bill.\n  We have tried to get the Levin-McCain amendment to a vote. We tried \nto reach an agreement and a time. We could not get an agreement on the \ntime. That is what has then precipitated the decision of the majority \nleader to move on to the hate crimes amendment. We have simply tried, \nday after day, to get a vote, without success.\n  I could not agree more that this is a critically important amendment, \nand we have to end production of a weapon system that we no longer \nneed, according to top civilian and military experts, and focus more on \nthe F-35, which is going to be used by all three of the services, not \njust one. It will have greater capabilities in very critical areas than \nthe F-22, and it will cost significantly less than the F-22. But we \ncould not achieve that.\n  I don't understand the logic or the strategies involved that say we \ncannot have a vote on the amendment that is pending--Levin-McCain \namendment--and then when faced with the majority leader's amendment on \nhate crimes, forces that to a cloture vote, which is going to be held--\nin other words, everybody understands both of these amendments are \ngoing to be addressed on this bill one way or the other. Nobody can \nguarantee the outcome on these amendments. But what can be guaranteed \nis that these amendments are going to be debated on this bill because \nthe majority leader has made that clear for a long time. The procedures \nof this body allow for it.\n  The precedents of this body are full of amendments such as this. As a \nmatter of fact, the hate crimes amendment was adopted on the Senate \nDefense authorization bill 2 years ago, after the same kind of debate. \nDebate is fair. Debate is important. Every one of us should protect the \nright of everyone else to debate. Whether it should go on this bill or \nanother, we can debate that. But it is offered on this bill, as was \nnoticed by the majority leader days ago. It is what we have done years \nago. It is totally consistent with the rules of the Senate. As a matter \nof fact, it has been done repeatedly in the Senate.\n  Maybe we should adopt a new rule that says you have to be relevant or \ngermane to offer an amendment to a pending bill. We don't have that \nrule, never had that rule, and probably never will have that rule.\n  But that is the way the Senate operates. These are important \namendments. Again--and I am going to close with this--I don't get the \nlogic of not allowing us to proceed to the Levin-McCain amendment \nbecause another amendment that some people don't like and don't think \nshould be offered is going to be offered on this bill, when what is \ncertain is that both amendments are going to be offered on this bill. \nNothing is accomplished by refusing that vote on the Levin-McCain \namendment except delay. That is the only thing accomplished by the \nrefusal of whoever it was who refused to agree to a time to vote on \nLevin-McCain, nothing was accomplished except delay. And that, I don't \nthink, is in anybody's interest, for the reasons Senator McCain gave.\n  We want to get this bill passed. We want to get it conferenced. We \nwant to get it to the President, hopefully, by the time this fiscal \nyear is over because the troops deserve us to act.\n  I am going to vote for the hate crimes amendment. I believe it is \nvery appropriate that it be on this bill. I spoke 2 years ago to this \neffect, and I will speak again at the right time, perhaps tomorrow if \nthere is time, as to why the hate crimes amendment belongs on this \nbill. It is an important amendment. It involves acts, as the leader and \nothers have said, of domestic terrorism. The values reflected in the \nhate crimes legislation are values which our men and women who put on \nthe uniform of this country fight for and put their lives on the line \nfor, a country which believes in diversity, a country that believes you \nought to be able to have whatever religion you want, be whatever ethnic \ngroup, whatever religious group, whatever racial group you are part of, \nwhatever your sexual orientation, whether you are disabled, regardless \nof your gender, that you should be free from terror and physical abuse.\n  That is what the hate crimes law does now, except it does not include \nsome groups who should be included, including the disabled and \nincluding people who are gay. That is what is involved here.\n  It is not a new debate. We debated it 2 years ago. It is not new on \nthis bill. It was added in the Senate 2 years ago.\n  I hope we can reach an agreement to get to a vote on both these \namendments. They are both going to be resolved on this bill. That is a \ncertainty. Again, how they are going to be resolved no one knows. We \ncan guess as to what the outcome will be. They will both be close \nvotes, I believe. Let's get on it and get through those votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Affordable Health Choices Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I grew up in Mansfield, OH, a middle-class \ntown of about 50,000 people, halfway between Cleveland and Columbus, in \nnorth central Ohio. It is a town similar to thousands of other cities \nin Ohio such as Marion, Zanesville, Xenia, Springfield, Portsmouth, \nChilcote, and Ravenna. It is a town not much different from dozens of \ncities around our Nation.\n  My dad was a family doctor. He practiced into his late seventies. He \nlived to be 89 and died about 9 years ago. My dad for years made house \ncalls, caring for his friends and neighbors, regardless of their \nability to pay. One patient, I remember, gave my dad a little arrowhead \ncollection after my dad had done very important work for his health.\n  Today the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee passed \nhistoric health reform legislation that restores my dad's sense of \nquality and compassion in our health care system.\n  This legislation was not written for the insurance industry. It was \nnot drafted by the drug industry or any other segment of the health \ncare industry. We remember not that long ago in this Chamber--I \nremember it more intensely at the other end of the Hall in the House of \nRepresentatives where I sat on the Health Committee--we remember in \nthose days the drug companies wrote the Medicare laws, and the health \ninsurance industry wrote health care legislation. Those days are gone. \nThis bill is not for them; it is for the American people.\n  The health care industry does not like this bill that much. That is \nbecause they did not get their way on issue after issue. They did \nsometimes. They did dramatically on occasion in our committee. But, by \nand large, this bill is not for them. This bill is for the American \npeople. It is for American families who are afraid that unaffordable \nhealth care costs will deny their children a chance for a healthy life.\n  Everybody in this Chamber has met dozens of children such as that who\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\nneeded the Children's Health Insurance Program to keep their families \nfrom going bankrupt and to keep their health care going. Children who \nneed this health care legislation, families who need this bill too \noften choose between medicine and food, between heating their homes in \nthe winter and cooling their homes in the summer on the one hand and \ngoing to the doctor on the other.\n  This bill is for American families that do not have health insurance \nat all. Maybe they work for an employer who cannot afford to provide \nhealth insurance. Maybe they lost their job. Maybe they cannot afford \ntheir share of the premium for employer-sponsored coverage. Maybe they \nhave a preexisting condition that makes them undesirable to the \ninsurance industry. Maybe they cannot pay their mortgage, feed their \nchildren, and pay for nongroup health coverage. Unfortunately, for many \nAmericans, something had to give. But not anymore. This bill is for \nthem.\n  Two weeks ago in Columbus, I was having breakfast with my daughter \nand a friend--a young woman who teaches voice lessons. She just \ngraduated from college. She is working at this restaurant part time \nwhile she finds more and more students to teach voice lessons as she \nbegins her business. She does not have health insurance. She came up \nand said: Are you going to give me health insurance this year?\n  I said: Yes. It is a commitment of the President of the United \nStates. We are going to finish this bill this year.\n  I am going to send her a note tonight telling her what we did today.\n  Not too long ago, I was at a grocery store in Avon, OH, near my home. \nMy wife asked me to find water crackers. I didn't know what water \ncrackers were. I was standing in the aisle, and I asked a guy: Do you \nknow what water crackers are?\n  He said: They are right there. This is a gentleman who is self-\nemployed and sells food products, mostly crackers and cookies, for a \nnational company. He sells them to local grocery stores in Lorain \nCounty. He said to me: I am self-employed. Are you going to pass the \npublic option I need to make sure you can keep the health insurance \nindustry honest and I can get decent health coverage?\n  I said: Yes, we are--because we are.\n  This bill is for them. It is for the young woman in Columbus, it is \nfor the younger man in Avon, the man approaching middle age, it is for \nhim.\n  This bill was developed with a few core principles in mind. First, \nAmericans who like their current health coverage should be able to keep \nit. If you have good insurance, if you like your employer-based \ninsurance, by all means keep that insurance. Keep what you have. This \nbill is designed to protect existing coverage while putting downward \npressure on health insurance premiums. What is going to happen to those \npeople who now have insurance? Right now if you have decent insurance, \nyou are also paying the cost; when you go to the emergency room with \nyour insurance, you are also paying the cost of somebody who goes to \nthe emergency room without insurance. You are paying the cost that \ndoctors and hospitals and, frankly, taxpayers provide for those people \nwithout insurance. You are absorbing those costs.\n\n  So when this bill passes, when the President signs this bill in \nOctober or November, there is a reasonably good chance that the cost of \nyour insurance, whether you are the employer, whether you are the \nemployee, will stabilize. The costs will stabilize and maybe go down.\n  I mentioned this bill was developed with a few core principles in \nmind. No. 1, people who like their current insurance can keep it. No. \n2, people underinsured or uninsured should be able to find good \ncoverage and pay a reasonable premium for it. They will have full \nchoice of private insurance or, the third point is, Americans should \nhave choices they want. This bill includes a strong public health \ninsurance option designed to increase price competition in the health \ninsurance industry and to help keep private insurers honest.\n  And speaking of honest, another principle behind this bill is that \nhealth insurers should do what they are paid to do. This bill includes \nnew rules to prevent insurers from denying you coverage for preexisting \nconditions, terminating your coverage just to save money or excluding \nyou from coverage because of your age or health history.\n  There are two things going on here: One, we are putting rules on the \ninsurance industry so they cannot keep gaming the community rating \nsystem, can't keep imposing preexisting conditions on potential people \nthey insure, can't lock people out who are too sick and they don't want \nto cover.\n  First is the rules. Second is creation of a public option, which will \nmean competition. We make sure insurance companies are doing the right \nthing by the rules, but we also inject competition, so public option \nwill compete with private insurance companies.\n  This bill was written for American families, for American patients, \nfor American businesses, and for American taxpayers. This bill is a \nvictory for the thousands of Ohioans who shared with me their struggle \nfor our health care system. It is about retiree Christopher from \nCincinnati. He is worried his shattered retirement savings and small \npension won't keep up with rising insurance premiums.\n  This bill is about breast cancer survivor Michelle from Willoughby, \nOH, Lake County, east of Cleveland, who should no longer live, in her \nwords, ``for the sum of my work is to pay for insurance.''\n  It is about the children that Darlene, a school nurse from Cleveland, \ntreats each day who struggle in school because they are worried about a \nsick parent or grandparent who cannot get the health care they need.\n  It is about small business owner Kathleen from Rocky River, who is \ntrying to do right for her employees but whose small business is being \ncrushed by exorbitant health insurance costs.\n  It is about Karen from Toledo, whose adult son has advanced MS, and \nfor 5 years she has seen her savings drained, forcing her to drop out \nof college.\n  It is about these Ohioans. It is about Ohioans in Lima, Springfield, \nVolare, St. Clairsville, Pickaway, and Troy. It is about people around \nthis country, the millions who work hard, play by the rules, who still \nstruggle each day with disease and despair. It is about their stories, \nthose who have inspired us to stand with them and not be intimidated by \nthe special interests that are spending $1 million every single day \nlobbying to try to write this bill--the insurance companies, the drug \ncompanies that have had such a huge influence in the Halls of Congress \nover the last several years but this time did not have the kind of \ninfluence they wanted.\n  Because of this bill, more Americans will be able to afford health \ncare. Crucial national priorities will not be crowded out by health \ncare spending. No longer will exploding health care costs cut into \nfamily budgets, wear down businesses, drain tax dollars from local \ngovernments, from State governments or from Federal budgets.\n  This bill uses market competition and common sense to squeeze out an \nefficiency, to maximize quality to ensure every American has access to \nquality, affordable coverage.\n  More work is yet to be done. We have taken a long step toward the day \nthat generations before us have prepared us for, that pushed this \ngovernment to do more and do better.\n  This started in the 1930s when Harry Truman wanted to include \nMedicare or some version of national health care with Social Security \nbut thought he could not get it passed and settled for Social Security. \nHarry Truman tried in the late 1940s. Lyndon Johnson successfully \npushed through Congress, with strong Democratic majorities in each \nHouse, to create Medicare. We have tried ever since. This is the time.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership of the HELP Committee over \nthe last few weeks. It was an impressive and productive process from \nbeginning to end. We worked in a deliberate, bipartisan manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. We worked in a deliberate, bipartisan manner, spanning 13 \ndays, 287 amendments were debated, and 161 Republican amendments were \nincluded in this bill. We worked hard to make sure this bill reflects \nbroad\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\nranges of views and best serves the American people.\n  A special thank you to my friend and colleague, Chairman Kennedy, \nwhose Senate career has been dedicated to providing health care to \nthose in need. Senator Kennedy's activism and determination made this \nday possible. My Senate colleagues and I and millions of Americans who \nmay finally see the day when there is quality affordable health care \nowe him our gratitude and thanks.\n  In closing, of all injustices, Martin Luther King once observed: \n``Injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.''\n  This day is a victory for Ohio families, it is a victory for seniors \nand middle-class families around the Nation who deserve the humane \njustice of an affordable health care system that works for all of them.\n  We have a historic opportunity to make fundamental improvements to \nour Nation's health care system. We must not squander it--not in this \nNation, not at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7550-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize an inspiring group of World War II veterans from the \nCommonwealth who visited our Nation's Capitol on the 65th anniversary \nof the D-day invasion. The noble work of the Honor Flight Program and \nthe leaders at its Bluegrass Chapter made it possible for these World \nWar II veterans to visit their memorial on the National Mall free of \ncharge. I have been privileged to participate in previous Honor Flights \nfrom Kentucky, and I very much regret that my schedule prevented me \nfrom attending the one that took place on June 6, 2009. I hope to have \nthe opportunity to join participants from my home State on Honor Flight \ntrips in the near future.\n  I wish to express my tremendous gratitude to the 66 Kentucky veterans \nwho were here that day for having served to protect our great Nation's \nprinciples from the enemies of freedom. As Americans, we are forever \nindebted to the heroic men and women of the U.S. military who defend \nthis great Nation and all it represents. In fighting for prosperity and \nfreedom around the world, the veterans of World War II risked \neverything, earning the title of the ``greatest generation.''\n  As General Eisenhower said in his message to the troops just before \nthe invasion at Normandy: ``The eyes of the world are upon you. The \nhopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you.'' \nThese words ring true, even after 65 years, as our military continues \nto challenge threats to freedom, democracy and the American way of \nlife.\n  Our country continues to do its best to honor the incredible bravery \nand sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. The Honor Flight Program \nis a reflection of the admiration and appreciation that all Americans \nhave for the military. I take great pride in representing many brave \nveterans from Kentucky and in doing what I can to show our Nation's \nreverence for them.\n  The names of the 66 World War II veterans from the Commonwealth are \nas follows:\n\n       Richard Straub; George Hoffman; Robert Willman; Charles \n     Junkins; Norman Reiss; William Taylor; Mary Phillips; Walter \n     Brumfield, Sr.; Raymond Bumann; Lawrence Mayfield; Thomas \n     Crump; Albert Tomassetti; Eugene Heimerdinger; Fletcher \n     Williams; Paul Lawson; Millard Allen; Paul Jordan; Joseph \n     McConnell; Harry Greavesl; Robert Bohan.\n       John McCord, Jr.; Louis Stafford; Walter Martin; Stanley \n     Adkins; James Thomas; William Wilson; Harold Hoover; Kenneth \n     Elliott; Johnie Hayes; Peter Johnson, Sr.; Robert O'Bryan; \n     Frank Rose; Norbert Gnadinger; Martin Lambright; Robert \n     Zangmeister, Sr.; Walter Jewell, Jr.; James Keene; George \n     Pope; Richard Thompson; Orland Warth.\n       Raymond Ludwick; Arthur Lowe; Ralph Hammerle; Roy Six; \n     Arthur Wissing; Louis Guettzow; Howard Mather; Allen Kessler; \n     Harold Finnell; William Boyd; Wilbert Block; Claude Decker; \n     George Garth; Joseph Wilson; Lloyd Hoagland; William Zeitz; \n     Vincent Heuser; Oscar Disney, Jr.; Nat Bailen; George \n     Keltner; Richard Zogg; Taylor Davidson; Pauline Thompson; \n     Henry Hardy, Jr.; Abner McMaster; Stanley Fischer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7550-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7550-S7551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HIV TRAVEL AND IMMIGRATION BAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Department of Health and Human \nServices has taken an important and overdue step toward ending our \nNation's discriminatory ban on HIV-positive visitors and immigrants.\n  On July 2, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services \npublished proposed regulations that would lift the HIV travel and \nimmigration ban. This policy change would remove HIV from the list of \n``communicable diseases of public health significance.''\n  While we all know that HIV infection is a serious health condition, \nit does not represent a communicable disease that is a significant \nthreat for transmission and spread to the U.S. population through \ncasual contact. Officially ending this long-standing ban will help \nremove the stigma and discrimination often associated with HIV.\n  The United States is one of 12 countries in the world that ban HIV-\npositive visitors, nonimmigrants and immigrants. It seems illogical \nthat the United States, a country that is a leader in the fight against \nthe global HIV/AIDS epidemic, should legally ban all non-Americans who \nare HIV-positive.\n  The current travel and immigration ban prohibits HIV-positive foreign \nnationals from entering the United States unless they obtain a special \nwaiver. This waiver is difficult to obtain and only allows for short-\nterm travel. Immigrants who want to become legal permanent residents by \napplying for a green card are subject to a medical exam. Many \nindividuals who have been denied a green card because of their HIV \nstatus confront a dilemma--either they go home where they might not \nhave access to effective treatment or violate American law by remaining \nin the United States.\n  The ban undermines public health efforts by keeping researchers, \nadvocates and experts from even entering the country. The current \nregulation stigmatizes and discriminates against people living with HIV \nand AIDS without justification and has serious consequences on \nindividuals, families and our Nation. It separates loved ones, denies \nAmerican businesses access to talented workers, and bars students and \ntourists from accessing opportunities and supporting our economy. Due \nto the ban, there have not been any international conferences on HIV/\nAIDS in the United States since 1990.\n  The ban originated in 1987, and was explicitly codified by Congress \nin 1993, despite efforts in the public health community to remove the \nban when Congress reformed U.S. immigration law in the early 1990s. \nWhile immigration law excludes foreigners with any ``communicable \ndisease of public health significance'' from entering the U.S., only \nHIV was ever explicitly singled out in the Immigration and Nationality \nAct. For all other communicable diseases, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services determines whether a particular disease is of public \nhealth significance and should therefore constitute a ground for \nexcluding noncitizens from entering or immigrating to the United \nStates.\n  Last year, I strongly supported the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United \nStates Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nReauthorization Act of 2008, which Congress passed and the President \nsigned into law. Included was a provision that removed the language \nfrom the Immigration and Nationality Act mandating that HIV be on the \nlist of diseases that bar entry to the United States. This provision \nreturned regulatory authority to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to determine whether HIV should remain on a list of \ncommunicable diseases that bar foreign nationals from entering the \nUnited States.\n  By proposing this regulation the administration is making a clear \nstatement that the United States does not discriminate against people \nwith HIV and does not endorse misconceptions of the past. I look \nforward to seeing the proposed regulation finalized in the coming \nmonths.\n\n[[Page S7551]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7551-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     COMBATING CORRUPTION IN AFRICA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the world goes through this difficult \neconomic period it is important that we continue efforts that began \nwhen times were better.\n  A June 10, 2009 article in the New York Times entitled ``Battle to \nHalt Graft Scourge in Africa Ebbs'' notes that because of a series of \nassassinations, dismissals, and changes in power across the African \nContinent, some of Africa's previous efforts to fight corruption are \nweakening. It is estimated that a trillion dollars obtained through \ncorrupt practices changes hands every year around the world, and a \nlarge part of it in Africa. This staggering amount is often the \nrevenues from the extraction of natural resources like oil or diamonds, \nbut instead of going to help the impoverished people of the country \nwhere the resources are located, it too often goes to line the pockets \nof corrupt officials. If it were possible to reduce by just one-quarter \nthe amount of money stolen, the amount saved would be five times as \nmuch as we spend annually on foreign aid.\n  On his recent visit to Accra, Ghana, President Obama made it clear \nthat the responsibility for good government and with it, development, \nin Africa ultimately rests on the shoulders of Africans. He said \n``repression can take many forms, and too many nations, even those that \nhave elections, are plagued by problems that condemn their people to \npoverty. No country is going to create wealth if its leaders exploit \nthe economy to enrich themselves . . . or if police can be bought off \nby drug traffickers. No business wants to invest in a place where the \ngovernment skims twenty percent off the top . . . or the head of the \nport authority is corrupt. No person wants to live in a society where \nthe rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery. That is \nnot democracy, that is tyranny, even if occasionally you sprinkle an \nelection in there. And now is the time for that style of governance to \nend.''\n  I wholeheartedly agree with the President, and I also know that \nbribery depends on at least two parties--those who get paid and those \nwho pay. Halliburton/KBR, a name we have all become familiar with for \nbrazenly overcharging American taxpayers in Iraq, is reportedly under \ninvestigation for allegedly paying over $100 million in bribes in \nNigeria in order to secure oilfield contracts. Although we do our best \nto investigate terrorist financing, U.S. banks are not required to \nfully investigate the sources of their funds, and the proceeds of \ncorruption can sometimes get through. Offshore shell companies and bank \naccounts, and lax rules for identification of account holders, make it \nrelatively easy to launder illicit money. The lack of information \nacross borders hampers investigations and prosecution efforts and slows \nthe return of stolen money.\n  The New York Times article tells the story of Nuhu Ribadu, the former \ndirector of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria, \nwho led a courageous effort to begin to rid Nigeria of its endemic \ncorruption problem but barely avoided an assassination attempt and was \ndismissed last year after reportedly refusing a $15 million bribe from \na state official he was investigating. In testimony before the House \nFinancial Services Committee earlier this year, Mr. Ribadu pleaded that \nthis country do all that it can to fight this global problem saying, \n``What can you do as a country, as a good people of the world, as \nleaders, to help be on the side of the 140 million desperately poor \nNigerians?''\n  While there is no question that this is a problem that requires the \nhard work and sacrifice of citizens of the countries where these crimes \nare taking place, we also need to do what we can in the United States \nto stand with those people who are taking risks to rid their countries \nof the corruption that destroys governments and whole societies.\n  There are a few things we can start doing now. We can do more to hold \nour domestic banks accountable for the money they have. We can put \nregulations in place that will make the holding of illegal \ninternational money no longer a profitable enterprise. We can open up \ninternational channels of communication to make sure that, while \nmaintaining appropriate levels of privacy, we provide investigators \noverseas access to the records they need to track down and prosecute \ncases of graft in their countries. We should do all we can to prosecute \nthose who receive bribes by cutting off funds and, as much is possible, \nexpanding our courts' jurisdictions to prosecute those who extort \nmoney. And finally, we can come down hard on companies in the United \nStates that are using bribery to increase their profitability in third \nworld markets.\n  This is a problem that many brave Africans have tried to tackle head \non, and it has cost some of them their lives. Let us make sure that we \nare doing all we can to help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7551-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7551-S7552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING TOM AND MAGGIE RYAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to salute Tom Ryan and his \ndaughter, Maggie, of Shelburne, VT, for their goodwill gesture at a \nrecent Boston Red Sox game.\n  Last week, Tom and Maggie were at Fenway Park cheering on the Red \nSox, and they ended up with the baseball David Ortiz--better known in \nRed Sox Nation as Big Papi--hit over the Green Monster for the 300th \nhome run of his career.\n  I had the good fortune to meet Big Papi last year at the White House \ncelebration honoring the 2007 Red Sox World Series championship, and I \nwas delighted to learn Tom and Maggie had the opportunity to meet Big \nPapi too and present him with the historic ball.\n  In honor of the Ryans, and this important moment in Red Sox history, \nI ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Burlington Free Press's \nstory, Vermont Man, Daughter Make Big Papi's Day, by Sam Hemingway be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 12, 2009]\n\n               Vermont Man, Daughter Make Big Papi's Day\n\n                           (By Sam Hemingway)\n\n       Shelburne.--Going to Fenway Park is akin to going to church \n     for die-hard Boston Red Sox fan Tom Ryan.\n       So imagine what it was like for the 46 year-old Shelburne \n     resident to meet David ``Big Papi'' Ortiz, Boston's beloved \n     slugger--inside the team clubhouse and within sight of the \n     locker room.\n       Ryan and his daughter, Maggie, had that Red Sox dream-come-\n     true moment Thursday night when Ryan ended up in possession \n     of the baseball that Ortiz ripped for his 300th homer in the \n     first inning of what ended in an 8-6 loss to the Kansas City \n     Royals.\n       ``It didn't get out by much,'' Ryan said, recalling the \n     moment the ball zoomed off Ortiz's bat and hit the top ledge \n     of the Green Monster wall in left field.\n       The ball ricocheted off the wall and fell to the ground \n     below Section 33, Box 165, Row LL, a spot that overlooks left \n     field half way between third base and the Green Monster.\n       That's where Ryan and Maggie were, in Seats 5 and 6, when \n     Royals' leftfielder Jose Guillen picked up the ball and, \n     acknowledging the appeals in the seats above, tossed the ball \n     into the stands--and into Ryan's hands.\n       ``We were just excited because it was a Big Papi home \n     run,'' Ryan said. ``People around us were all charged up, \n     too.''\n       Moments later, a security guard approached Ryan and asked \n     him to come with him. Ryan thought perhaps he had done \n     something wrong and that maybe he and Maggie were going to \n     get kicked out of Fenway Park.\n       Instead, the guard told him the homer was Ortiz's 300th and \n     that Big Papi had asked for someone to find out if he could \n     get the ball back. Ryan said he was glad to comply with \n     Ortiz's request.\n       ``To me, it was the right thing to do,'' he said.\n       So he, Maggie and the security guard walked over to the \n     team's clubhouse.\n       Along the way, a representative of Major League Baseball \n     approached them and questioned Ryan about how he got the \n     ball, just to make sure it really was the one that Ortiz had \n     just hit. Only 19 active baseball players have hit 300 or \n     more homers.\n       When the group entered the clubhouse to make the ball \n     exchange, a door across the room opened and in walked Ortiz, \n     grinning from ear to ear.\n       He's a mountain of a man,'' Ryan said. ``Big smile, big \n     hands, big heart. He was genuinely very grateful, kind of \n     giddy, kind of excited.''\n       Ryan said he asked Ortiz what he was going to do with the \n     ball and said Ortiz told him and Maggie that he had talked to \n     his dad that morning and was going to give the ball to his \n     father while visiting him during the upcoming All Star break.\n       In return for the ball, Ortiz gave Ryan and Maggie one of \n     his bats and signed it. Maggie,\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n     17 and an incoming Champlain Valley Union High School senior, \n     was with her dad in Boston to check out colleges, and \n     happened to be wearing an Ortiz Red Sox T-shirt.\n       So Ortiz signed that, too.\n       ``It was just luck,'' Maggie said of the shirt she chose to \n     wear that day. ``I also have a (Jason) Varitek and a (Jacoby) \n     Ellsbury shirt.'' Varitek is the Red Sox catcher, Ellsbury \n     the team's center fielder.\n       Dad and daughter eventually returned to their seats and \n     passed the Ortiz bat around among their seatmates.\n       Later in the game, the Major League Baseball person again \n     asked to speak to them, questioning them some more in order \n     to make sure the ball Ryan gave Ortiz wasn't one slugged into \n     the stands during batting practice.\n       The Ortiz bat now sits on a shelf in the Ryan living room. \n     Maggie has her signed Ortiz T-shirt, but it's unlikely she'll \n     be wearing--or washing--it much more in the future.\n       Ryan said he asked the Red Sox for one last favor on \n     Thursday night.\n       Would it be possible, he queried, for him to bring his wife \n     Lucia, and the family's other two children all of them \n     passionate Sox fans--back to Fenway Park sometime this summer \n     and visit with Ortiz again?\n       ``They told me they did not think it would be a problem.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7552-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUILD AMERICA BONDS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, these days the country's attention has \nrightly been focused on turning its financial fortunes around and \ngetting people back to work. The President, his advisers, folks in the \nagencies, and in Congress have been working night and day to find the \nsolutions that will help the nation climb out of the financial hole it \nis in.\n  I would like to point out that there is one portion of the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act that is doing just that, but it is not \ngetting a lot of attention. It is a creative solution. It is putting \njobs back in our economy. And, most importantly, it is working.\n  The Build America Bonds portion of the Recovery Act has been a great \nsuccess, allowing State and local governments to issue more than $9.5 \nbillion worth of these innovative bonds. They have already begun \nshoring up our infrastructure and putting jobs back in communities \nwhere times are tough. That $9.5 billion of investment supports more \nthan 3,000 jobs.\n  Build America Bonds have been such a quiet success, so some of you \nmight not be familiar with what they do. The provision that ended up in \nthe Recovery Act is based on a bill that, first Senator Talent, and now \nSenator Thune and I have been working on for a number of years.\n  As included in the economic recovery package, the Build America Bonds \nprovision allows any State or local government that can issue tax \nexempt bonds to issue what are called Build America Bonds. These bonds \ncan offer either a tax credit for investors or a Federal subsidy to \nissuers, of 35 percent of the interest earned over the life of the \nbond.\n  The bonds can only be issued through the end of 2010, but during that \ntime there is no limit on the number or amount of Build America Bonds \nthat can be issued. One of the reasons I am talking to my colleagues \ntoday about them is that the clock is ticking on that deadline, and I \nwant to make sure every Senator here knows how much Build America Bonds \ncan benefit the folks back home. The end of 2010 will be here before \nyou know it.\n  As communities deal with the recession, they need new tools to \nfinance essential construction projects. Build America Bonds has put a \nnew tool in their toolbox.\n  Before these bonds started being issued, the market for normal \nmunicipal bonds was frozen. It was very hard to sell municipal bonds, \nbut that didn't mean the need for financing infrastructure wasn't still \nthere.\n  Tax credit bonds, in the form of Build America Bonds, were designed \nto help thaw the bond markets.\n  And it has worked. They are selling like hotcakes.\n  Tax-exempt or tax-deferred investors, such as pension funds and IRAs, \naren't usually interested in municipal bonds. But by providing the \noption of a direct payment instead of tax-exempt interest, Build \nAmerica Bonds have opened up new markets for State and local \ngovernments.\n  I am not surprised that Build America Bonds are proving to be very \nattractive to investors. They are a good deal for both the investors \nand our communities. They have freed up financing for badly needed \ninfrastructure construction and created jobs and a foundation for long-\nterm economic growth.\n  So far, more than $9.5 billion worth of Build America Bonds have been \nissued, making it easier and cheaper for cash-strapped State and local \ngovernments to access capital and grow jobs. The State of California, \nthe New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the University of Virginia, and the \nMilan Area School District in Michigan are just some of the issuers of \nBuild America Bonds since the passage of ARRA.\n  Build America Bonds have earned support from organizations across the \ncountry that understand how the urgent need is to shore up our \ninfrastructure and create jobs: the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials, the Chamber of Commerce, and the \nNational Association of Manufacturers. I appreciate that support.\n  We recently had another positive milestone in the story of Build \nAmerica Bonds. The Treasury Department gave cities and counties around \nthe country the authority to issue $10 billion worth of Recovery Zone \nBuild America Bonds.\n  Recovery Zone Bonds are like Build America Bonds. They provide a \nFederal tax credit to the buyer or a subsidy to the issuer, but with an \neven more generous subsidy of 45 percent of the interest.\n  Only areas hurt by the weakened economy can issue these bonds. They \nare very targeted to the places they can do the most good. Treasury \nallocated them based on employment declines in 2008. So the harder an \narea has been hit, the more Recovery Zone Build America Bonds it can \nissue, creating jobs where they are needed most.\n  In some cases, these bonds will make the difference between whether \nthese projects come to fruition or not. In other cases, they will lower \nthe cost of projects and allow the community to reinvest those savings \nin other projects.\n  As with the regular Build America Bonds, Recovery Zone bonds are only \nauthorized under current law through the end of 2010.\n  That is why I am encouraging State and local governments that are \ngoing to issue bonds to sit down and do the math so they can see if \nBuild America Bonds will work for them. And if they do, I encourage \nthose governments to take advantage of them while they are available. \nThere is no time like the present to strengthen the Nation's \ninfrastructure and our communities with the jobs folks back home need.\n  I also encourage my colleagues in Congress to begin working now to \ncontinue the success of Build America Bonds. As Congress struggles to \nfind funding for a new transportation bill, innovative approaches like \nBuild America Bonds should be part of the solution. Recently, the Obama \nadministration has proposed delaying the Transportation reauthorization \nbill for 18 months. If that were to happen, and I hope it doesn't, \nBuild America Bonds could provide additional funding to bridge the gap \nbetween our Nation's transportation needs and current funding levels.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues in Congress will also look into \nthe benefits of Build America Bonds and ensure these unsung financial \ntools will continue to work helping their constituents and their \ncommunities from coast to coast. They are effective. They give benefits \nto both those who issue them and those who buy them. And most of all, \nthey solve the kinds of problems that affect the daily lives of every \nAmerican.\n  Build America Bonds are an example of the creative solutions people \nare looking for Congress to implement during these uncertain economic \ntimes. I urge my colleagues and your constituents to use them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7552-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7552-S7553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HARRIET TUBMAN\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 227, the \nHarriet Tubman National Historical Park and Harriet Tubman Underground \nRailroad National Historical Park Act. This legislation, which will \ncreate the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park as a part of the \nNational Park System, will preserve one of Upstate New York's most \nimportant historic sites.\n  Harriet Tubman entered American life as a runaway slave from Maryland\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\nwho made history by leading hundreds of slaves to freedom through the \nUnderground Railroad. Although her courageous actions before and during \nthe Civil War are well known to many Americans, Tubman's dedication to \nbettering the lives of former slaves after the war has been largely \nunrecognized in American History. In 1857, Tubman moved from Canada to \nAuburn, NY, where her close friend and U.S. Senator, William Seward, \nbravely broke the law by selling her a modest, two-story brick house. \nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, Harriet Tubman returned to Auburn \nwhere she continued her humanitarian efforts by aiding aged African \nAmericans and eventually opening a group home in 1908. Before her death \n5 years later, the house provided refuge for 12 to 15 people. Harriet \nTubman was also an active suffragist during the later years of her \nlife. Her close proximity to Seneca Falls kept the city of Auburn a \nfocal point in the women's rights movement. Harriet Tubman died in 1913 \nand is buried in the Fort Hill Cemetery overlooking the city of Auburn.\n  Whether it is the American Revolution, the War of 1812, or the \nwomen's rights movement, Upstate New York has been home to many of our \nNation's most historic figures. Harriet Tubman's legacy is an important \npart of Upstate New York's history. The Harriet Tubman National \nHistorical Park and Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National \nHistorical Park Act will establish the Harriet Tubman National \nHistorical Park to preserve many significant sites relating to her life \nin Auburn, such as the Tubman Home, the Tubman Home for the Aged, the \nThompson Memorial AME Zion Church, and her gravesite in the Fort Hill \nCemetery.\n  I am committed to preserving Upstate New York's historic treasures so \nthat future generations can learn the lessons of the past by visiting \nthe homes of the people who changed American history. Preserving \nTubman's home, gravesite, and other buildings where she lived her life \nare essential to protecting her legacy. Harriet Tubman's impressive \nlife story is an example of how one should fight against injustice and \nwork to alleviate the suffering of those around them. Her courageous \nspirit and compassion towards others still makes her a role model \nnearly 100 years after her death. I am proud that Harriet Tubman made \nUpstate New York her home, and I will continue to support the \npreservation of New York's numerous historic sites.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7553-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING LORRAINE PERONA ROONEY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with the heaviest of hearts that \nI rise to remember a dear friend and committed public servant, Lorraine \nPerona Rooney, who passed away early this morning. I am deeply saddened \nby Lorraine's death and will keep her friends and family in my thoughts \nand prayers during this difficult time.\n  Lorraine, who served the U.S. Senate for over 27 years, was one of a \nsmall group of staff members I assembled to assist me when I first took \noffice as a U.S. Senator from the State of Connecticut on January 3, \n1989. I was tremendously fortunate to have a person of Lorraine's \nextensive knowledge and years of Senate staff experience to set up my \noffice. She did a wonderful job and kept my office running smoothly for \nmore than 15 years--as office manager and financial director--and did \nso with style and grace. Many staff members and interns passed through \nmy office during her tenure, and all benefitted from Lorraine's caring \nguidance, common sense, and expertise. Those who worked with her recall \nher willingness to go the extra mile to help her coworkers. One member \nof my staff remembers that Lorraine worked to secure her a parking \nspace closer to the office so that she wouldn't have very far to walk \nto get to her car after dark.\n  After graduating from American University with a degree in \ninternational relations, Lorraine subsequently worked at Dartmouth \nCollege in charge of foreign study programs. Through a contact there, \nshe learned of an opening in the office of Senator John Durkin, \nDemocrat from New Hampshire, and thus began her Senate career in March \n1977. Following her work in Senator Durkin's office, Lorraine built her \ncareer in the Senate setting up offices for newly elected Members, \nincluding Senator Carl Levin, Democrat from Michigan, in 1979, Senator \nFrank Lautenberg, Democrat from New Jersey, in 1982, and, of course, \nmyself in 1989. Throughout her time with the Senate, Lorraine \ndemonstrated an expertise in creating attractive, functional and \ncomfortable work spaces, not an easy task given our limited space and \nresources then.\n  During Lorraine's last few years at my office, she was faced with \nmany serious health problems. Despite her suffering and hardship, she \ncontinued to do her utmost in service to me and the citizens of \nConnecticut. The courage she demonstrated as she faced these personal \nchallenges served as an inspiration for me and my staff.\n  Those of us who were lucky enough to know Lorraine could not help but \nbe touched by her kindness and warmth. She formed many lasting \nfriendships in the Senate community; she often spoke of the Senate as \n``home.'' She was widely respected and beloved among her Senate \ncolleagues for her character, judgment, and professionalism. It is no \nwonder that after her retirement she continued to stay in touch with so \nmany with whom she had worked.\n  Lorraine was a dedicated public servant who enriched this \ninstitution. I extend my deepest condolences to Lorraine's husband \nBernie Rooney and daughter Shannon for their irreplaceable loss.\n  Mr. President, we honor Lorraine Perona's memory and we cherish her \ndecency and her friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7553-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              CONTRA COSTA COUNTY VOLUNTEER SERVICES UNIT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

These brave men and women have repeatedly demonstrated their \ndedication to their community during a time when budget cuts are \nparalyzing our State and local law enforcement forces.\n  Since its founding in 1850, the Contra Costa County Volunteer \nServices Unit has grown to coordinate the activities of several \nSheriff's Volunteer Groups, including an Air Squadron, Amateur Radio \nCommunications, Cadet Explore Post 2406, Chaplains Program, Deputy \nSheriff Reservers, Dive Team, Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service, \nRACES, Sheriff's All Volunteer Extended Services, SAVES, Program, and \nSearch and Rescue Unit.\n  The Contra Costa Sheriff's Volunteer Services Unit has the largest \nvolunteer search and rescue team of any county north of San Bernardino. \nWith over 700 volunteers, the unit contributes the same amount of \nservice hours as approximately 50 full-time, paid positions. This unit \nhas also assisted in several missing persons cases both within Contra \nCosta County and beyond, including the heartbreaking search earlier \nthis year for 8-year-old Sandra Cantu of Tracy.\n  The hard work and dedication of those involved with the Sheriff's \nVolunteer Services Unit not only helps save lives throughout Contra \nCosta County, but also saves the county the equivalent of $5 million in \nsalaries and benefits at a time when funding for such programs has been \nreduced.\n  The dedicated men and women of the Contra Costa County Office of the \nSheriff's Volunteer Services Unit are the embodiment of community \nservice and involvement. For over 150 years, these volunteers have, \noften without question for their own safety or comfort, taken heroic \nactions throughout the County and beyond while assisting with a variety \nof programs.\n  I commend the men and women of the Contra Costa County Office of the \nSheriff's Volunteer Services Unit for their inspiring dedication to \ntheir community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7553-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7553-S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING LUCERNE INN\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, summer is finally upon us, and as \npeople travel to Maine to discover and explore the pristine beauty of \nour State's outdoors,\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\nI rise to recognize a historic Maine lodging establishment that has \nhosted these travelers and adventurers for nearly two centuries. \nLocated conveniently between Bangor and Bar Harbor in the small town of \nDedham, the Lucerne Inn boasts fine dining and accommodations and a \npicturesque golf course complemented by a stunning view of beautiful \nPhillips Lake.\n  Listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June of \n1982, the inn is a legendary business with an impressive history. \nIndeed, Dedham's first family, the Phillips, built a family home called \nthe Lake House in the early 1800s. John Phillips had been granted the \nland for his service in the American Revolution. Soon thereafter, in \n1814, the building became a halfway house, operating as a stagecoach \nstop between Bangor and Ellsworth, with guests partaking in food, \nspirits, and lodging. Indeed, today's Lucerne Inn is still housed in \nthe original building built by the Phillips family. Later, during the \n1920s, the inn and the 5,000 acres around it were designed to be one of \nAmerica's first planned communities. As such, the Maine Legislature \ncreated the village of Lucerne in 1927 to bring people to this \nbeautiful region, but the economic troubles of the 1930s forced the \nidea to be scrapped.\n  Given its prime location--less than an hour from the beautiful waters \nof Bar Harbor and the hiking trails of Acadia National Park--the \nLucerne Inn offers visitors a true Maine get-away. A recipient of the \n2009 Bride's Choice Award, the inn offers professional service for a \nvariety of occasions from weddings to business meetings and banquets, \nand provides a variety of travel packages to accommodate all budgets.\n  Owners Steve and Rhonda Jones purchased the inn in August 2005. Steve \nhad operated a convenience store and catering business in the \nFarmington area for 23 years, while Rhonda worked at the University of \nMaine at Farmington. Depending on the season, the inn employs between \n40 and 65 people. The inn has 26 rooms, plus an additional 5 guest \nrooms in a newer building. The banquet and conference center, built in \n1999, has become tremendously popular, hosting approximately 100 \nweddings each year.\n  The Lucerne Inn also makes dining out an event with a four-course \nmeal in an elegant room with a scenic view from every window. Chef \nDouglas Winslow serves quality cuisine that encompasses brunch, a full \ndinner menu, and a seafood buffet, as well as a traditional broiled \nMaine lobster dinner, adding to the authentic Maine experience. The inn \nalso hosts special wine dinners each month to showcase a diverse array \nof the world's greatest wines. In fact, just last Thursday evening, the \ninn hosted an Argentine-themed wine dinner, with a full five-course \nmeal complemented by special wine from Argentina.\n  The inn maintains a historical ambiance by furnishing every room with \nantiques. Most accommodations at the inn boast a view of the lake and a \ngas burning fireplace. That said, fine dining and accommodations are \nonly a fraction of the Lucerne Inn experience. The inn also boasts a 9-\nhole golf course conceived by famed course designer Donald Ross, as \nwell as a large outdoor swimming pool and picturesque outdoor patios.\n  At the Lucerne Inn, visitors and Mainers alike are afforded the \nchance to escape their daily routines and relax by enjoying the \nserenity of Maine's natural beauty. Whether for pleasure or business, \nthe Lucerne Inn offers an authentic taste of Maine, something that is \ntruly irreplaceable. I congratulate Steve and Rhonda Jones and all of \nthe employees at the Lucerne Inn for exquisitely maintaining this gem \nof our State, and I offer my best wishes for their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7554-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7554-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7554-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 402.

Mr. President, I want to speak on the nomination of \nCass R. Sunstein to be the Administrator of the Office of Information \nand Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I placed a hold on the consideration of Professor Sunstein's \nconfirmation after his hearing in the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs. I chose to do this because Professor \nSunstein has written, lectured, and made recommendations on animal \nrights issues that are very troubling to me and to folks who make their \nliving in agriculture and those who enjoy our Nation's great hunting \nand fishing heritage.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, it is extremely unusual for this \nMember of the Senate to place a hold on anybody. It is not something I \nnormally do.\n  Professor Sunstein has theorized that animals--he has theorized in \nwriting as well as in speeches--that animals should be permitted to \nbring suit against their owners and others with human beings being \ntheir representatives. Let me say that again. Professor Sunstein has \ntheorized in writing and in speeches that animals should be permitted \nto bring lawsuits against their owners and others with human beings as \ntheir representatives.\n  That is a very radical and strange position, and it not only got my \nattention but it got the attention of any number of other folks around \nthe country, both within and without the agricultural sector of our \ncountry. The devastating effect this would have on animal agriculture \nis incalculable. Mistreated livestock do not perform well. American \nfarmers and ranchers work every day to make sure their stock is cared \nfor in a humane manner, and yet they would still face a tremendous \nthreat from frivolous lawsuits under this misguided theory. Even though \nclaims would be baseless, they would still bear the financial costs of \nreckless litigation. That is a cost that would put most family farming \nand ranching operations out of business.\n  Professor Sunstein also made offhand remarks during lectures that \n``perhaps hunting ought to be banned.'' While he offered assurances \nduring his nomination hearing that his personal view supported hunting, \nI am not a member of that committee and thus was not able to question \nProfessor Sunstein personally during his confirmation hearing.\n  I greatly enjoy the time I spend hunting with my friends and family, \nand I was also very disturbed by this statement.\n  The Administrator of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs must have a firm foundation in common sense, and we owe it to \nthe American public to ensure that regulators are properly vetted by \nthe Senate. That is why I held up Professor Sunstein's nomination in \norder to provide him an opportunity to explain his views on animal \nrights as well as the second amendment.\n  Since his original hearing, Professor Sunstein has met with people \ninvolved in agriculture, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, \nthe Farm Animal Welfare Coalition, the National Pork Producers Council, \nand the United Egg Producers. He has heard their point of view and \nexactly how devastating some of his theories would be to the reality of \nearning a living in rural America. He has satisfied some of them, and \nsome are still decidedly wary of his ideas.\n  I have also had the opportunity to meet personally with Professor \nSunstein to let him explain, and me explain to him how detrimental his \ntheories would be to the folks working so hard to feed this country and \nto hopefully obtain from Professor Sunstein assurances that he does not \noppose hunting or the right to bear arms. I tried to figure out what he \nmeant by saying that animals ought to have the right to sue \nindividuals.\n  Let me say, Professor Sunstein comes highly recommended by a number \nof folks from the conservative side of the philosophical divide in this \ncountry. His ability to look at regulatory measures and to provide \ncost-benefit analysis is very intriguing. He is obviously a very \ncompetent person when it comes to that side of the business community. \nI have a great appreciation for that.\n  I had a very good meeting with Professor Sunstein yesterday, and \nafter our meeting I received a letter from Professor Sunstein wherein \nhe explained some of his statements and inflammatory ideas. In that \nletter, he stated that he ``would not take any steps to promote \nlitigation on behalf of animals'' and that Federal ``law does not \ncreate an individual right to bring lawsuits on behalf of animals \nagainst agriculture.'' He also stated that he believes ``the second \namendment creates\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\nan individual right to possess guns for purposes of both hunting and \nself-defense.''\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to me from \nProfessor Sunstein dated July 14, 2009, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    July 14, 2009.\n     Senator Saxby Chambliss,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: Thanks so much for the meeting \n     today, which I greatly enjoyed.\n       You requested my views on three subjects. Before commenting \n     on the details, let me emphasize that if confirmed as \n     Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs, my primary concern would be to ensure that \n     regulations are consistent with the Constitution, the law as \n     enacted by Congress, and the principles reflected in \n     governing Executive Orders.\n       Your first question involved the Second Amendment. I \n     strongly believe that the Second Amendment creates an \n     individual right to possess and use guns for purposes of both \n     hunting and self-defense. I agree with the Supreme Court's \n     decision in the Heller case, clearly recognizing the \n     individual right to have guns for hunting and self-defense. \n     If confirmed, I would respect the Second Amendment and the \n     individual right that it recognizes.\n       You also asked about litigation, by individuals, on behalf \n     of animals. Let me be very clear: If confirmed, I would not \n     take any steps to promote litigation on behalf of animals. In \n     particular, federal law does not create an individual right \n     to bring lawsuits, on behalf of animals, against agriculture. \n     I do not favor and would not promote such a right.\n       Finally, you inquired about private enforcement of the law. \n     Such private enforcement can in some cases be a useful way of \n     ensuring compliance with legislative requirements, but it can \n     also create serious harm, by imposing significant costs and \n     burdens on those who are already obeying the law. Sometimes \n     Congress concludes that the balance favors private actions; \n     sometimes it decides against such actions. If confirmed, I \n     would consult, and follow, congressional instructions on the \n     question of whether private rights of action are available.\n       I hope that these answers are helpful, and I would be happy \n     to address these or other issues at any time. All best \n     wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Cass R. Sunstein.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Administration nominees deserve a fair hearing by the \nSenate, and Professor Sunstein is no different. While I cannot agree \nwith his ideas, his legal theories, or his views, now that he has been \neducated about the toll they would take on hard-working farmers and \nranchers in America, I am not going to keep him from any further \nconsideration. I intend to lift my hold on Professor Sunstein.\n  I understand from Professor Sunstein now that he has a much better \nunderstanding of animal agriculture and our country's sporting \ntradition. I am optimistic that this open dialog with animal \nagriculture will continue. I obviously look forward to working with him \nto ensure he continues to carry out exactly what he stated to me in his \nletter of July 14.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7575-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7575-S7577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAXES AND HEALTH REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the high rate of \ntaxation that is about to take place if the House of Representatives \npasses its health reform bill. I would also raise the issue about the \neffect the same level of taxation--not quite as high--would have under \nthe budget adopted by this body back in March. I wish to address the \ntax hikes, particularly as they apply to small business, that President \nObama and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have proposed.\n  The latest tax hike proposal is the House Democrats' graduated surtax \nof up to 5.4 percent on those making more than $280,000. For those \nAmericans who are married but file separate returns, this surtax \nincreases taxes for those making over $175,000.\n  I refer to this surtax as a small business surtax because it hits \nsmall business particularly hard. Here is how the House's small \nbusiness surtax works. In 2011 and 2012, singles making between \n$280,000 and $400,000 will pay an extra 1 percent, those singles making \nbetween $400,000 and $800,000 will pay an extra 1.5 percent, and those \nsingles making more than $800,000 will pay an extra 5.4 percent. Then \nin 2013 and after, these rates go to 2 percent, 3 percent, and 5.4 \npercent, respectively. The only way the rates do not go up to these \nlevels is if one of the President's advisers, the Director of OMB, says \nin 2012 that there will be more than $675 billion in health care \nsavings by the year 2019 in the bill the House has recently written. \nThat is right, in addition to the tax questions, we have the House \nleaving up to a partisan Presidential adviser--not the President \nhimself or a nonpartisan organization such as CBO--that taxes stay up \nor can go down.\n  Another troubling aspect of this charade is that this does not deal \nonly with actual savings achieved but instead calls for a partisan's \n2012 estimate of savings to be achieved through the year 2019. The \nJoint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan professional group here on \nthe Hill that advises Congress, correctly ignores this charade in its \nestimate of the House small business surtax and correctly assumes that \nthe rates are actually going to go up after 2013.\n  In 2011 and 2012, then, for married couples, the small business \nsurtax kicks in at 1 percent for those making $350,000 to $500,000, it \nrises to 1.5 percent for married couples making between $500,000 and $1 \nmillion, and it goes up to 5.4 percent for those making over $1 \nmillion. Then in 2013 and later, the rates go up to 2 percent, 3 \npercent, 5.4 percent, respectively. As discussed above, the only way \nthese rates do not go up in 2013 is if the OMB Director decides they \nshould not go up.\n  Let's look at this tax increase from the venue of small business. I \nknow people listening, as well as my colleagues, think: You talk about \npeople making $1 million or half a million dollars, why can't they pay \nanother 2, 3, or even 5 percent? It is a situation where small business \nin America creates 70 percent of the jobs. It is a case of where most \nsmall business operates on cash flow, not investment from the outside \nas normal corporations would. So we are talking about the health of our \neconomy, and we are talking about getting the economy out of this \nrecession we are in.\n  By the way, the President and I agree that 70 percent of the new \nprivate sector jobs are, in fact, created by the small businesses I \nhave just described. However, where the President and I differ is that \nI believe small businesses' taxes should be lowered, not raised during \nthis time of getting the economy back on track--particularly when you \nlook at the stimulus bill that was passed back in February. It doesn't \nappear to anybody as if it is doing any good yet, like creating the \njobs it was supposed to do, like keeping unemployment under 8 percent, \nwhich is now 9.5 percent, and only one-half of 1 percent of that $787 \nbillion stimulus package was to help small business. We ought to be \ndoing something, if we want to revitalize the economy, that helps small \nbusiness, and increasing taxes on small business will not do that.\n  In 2001 and 2003, Congress enacted bipartisan tax relief designed to \ntrigger economic growth and to create jobs by reducing the tax burden \non individuals as well as small businesses. This included the across-\nthe-board income tax reduction which reduced marginal tax rates for \nincome earners at all levels. I know people do not believe this, but if \nyou look at the allocation of the tax by the highest 1 percent of the \npeople, even after the 2001 tax cut, you saw that highest 1 percent \nstill paying a larger proportion into the Federal Treasury, of income \ntax, than they were doing prior to that. So even with tax reduction, \nyou end up with a more progressive Tax Code--which nobody is willing to \nadmit, but we can back that up by figures. It also, in 2001, included a \nreduction of the top dividends and capital gains tax rate to 15 percent \nand a gradual phaseout of the estate tax.\n  Unfortunately, the way you have to write tax bills under the \nreconciliation process around here, those tax bills enacted in 2001 and \n2003 will expire December 31, 2010, and automatically we are going to \nget the biggest tax increase in the history of the country without even \na vote of Congress because of sunset.\n  Some have referred to this bipartisan tax relief as ``the Bush tax \ncuts for the wealthy.'' However, it seems to be easily forgotten around \nhere, but this tax relief was bipartisan tax relief and provided tax \nrelief for all taxpayers. They\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nhave also suggested that the tax relief provided for higher income \nearners, including many small businesses, should be allowed to expire. \nThe President has proposed increasing the top marginal tax rates from \n33 to 36 percent and the other one from 35 to 39.6 percent.\n  We have a chart here you can refer to, so all these numbers I am \ngiving, you have a reference point for them.\n  The President has also proposed increasing the tax rates on capital \ngains and dividends to 20 percent and providing for an estate tax rate \nas high as 45 percent and an exemption of only $3.5 million.\n  Also, the President and allies on the Hill have called for fully \nreinstating the personal exemption phaseouts--we call them PEP, for \nshort--personal exemption phaseouts for those making over $200,000. \nThen there is another phaseout called the Pease phaseout, named after a \nformer Congressman from Ohio, for those making more than $200,000. So, \nunder the 2001 tax law, when these phaseouts come back in after 2010, \nyou actually end up with higher marginal tax rates of almost 2 percent. \nIt is not 39.6 as the high marginal tax rate; it is something much \nhigher--41 or 42 percent.\n  You know what you do, you get the smokescreen of saying you don't \nquite have a 40-percent marginal tax rate, but in fact you do have \nhigher than 40 percent. There seems to be something magical about not \nexceeding that 40 percent for the benefit of public relations, but it \nwill be exceeded greatly with this 5.4 percent the House is putting in, \nin their health care bill.\n  However, like other provisions in the law, PEP and Pease are \nscheduled to come back in full force, as I just said, in 2011--again, \nwithout a vote of Congress. With PEP and Pease fully reinstated, \nindividuals in the top two rates could see their marginal effective tax \nrates increase by 24 percent or more.\n  Once again, I refer my colleagues to the chart. For example, a family \nof four who is in the 33-percent tax bracket in 2010 could pay a \nmarginal effective tax rate of 41 percent after 2010 because of PEP and \nPease. This rate would go higher if that family had more children, and \nthis is before the small business surtax is even factored in.\n  Some of my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, \nhave defended this proposal by claiming that they will only raise taxes \non wealthy taxpayers who make more than $200,000 a year. For the vast \nmajority of people who earn less than $200,000, raising taxes on higher \nearners might not sound so bad. However, there are consequences for \nwhat we do around here. That means many small businesses will be hit \nwith a higher tax bill. These small businesses create 70 percent of all \nnew private sector jobs. These small businesses that are sole \nproprietors, S corporations, partnerships, and limited law corporations \nwould get hit with the President's proposal to raise the top two \nmarginal tax rates, if their owners make more than $200,000.\n  In addition, there is just under 2 million small C corporations that \nare subject to double taxation. To the extent that these C corporation \nowners make over $200,000 and pay themselves a salary, they would get \nhit with a tax increase on the top two marginal tax rates proposed by \nthe President. Also, owners of small C corporations who receive \ndividends or realize capital gains and make over $200,000 would pay a \n20-percent rate on these dividends and capital gains after 2010, under \nthese tax-hike proposals. Currently, these pay a rate of 15 percent.\n  All of this wasn't bad enough for small business. Why emphasize small \nbusiness? It is the job creation machine of the economy. Why emphasize \nsmall business? They operate cash flow, generally. They don't have \noutside investors. And why emphasize small business? Because it takes \nentrepreneurs to create jobs. I had the opportunity for 10 years, from \n1961 to 1971, to be a union assembly line worker at a little company \ncalled Waterloo Register in Cedar Falls, IA. We made furnace registers. \nI use that company--locally owned, people who got together to create \njobs--as an example. They gave me an opportunity to earn a small \nlivelihood for 10 years of my life. It takes people who have means to \ncreate jobs. I have never worked for anybody who was low income or in \npoverty. You have to have the incentive of people in this country to \nput resources together to create income for themselves and, in the \nprocess of expanding, increase jobs for everybody else. So you \nunderstand where I am coming from, from the standpoint of small \nbusiness.\n  The House of Representatives has proposed a graduated surtax of up to \n5.4 percent on those making over $280,000. To people listening, \n$280,000 is a lot of money, probably the top 3 or 4 percent of the \npeople. But if they are a small business and they are operating with \ncash flow, cutting into that cash flow is a job killer. With this small \nbusiness surtax, a family of four in the top two brackets will pay a \nmarginal tax rate in the range of 43 and 46.4 percent in 2013. I am not \nprepared to say this right now, but maybe when I end I will say \nsomething about the State income tax on top of that, to show how high \nare the taxes these ideas are taking us to.\n  When you go to 43 and 46.4 by 2013, this would result in an increase \nof the marginal tax rates by a minimum of 23 percent and a maximum of \n33 percent.\n  Candidate Obama pledged that ``Everyone in America--everyone--will \npay lower taxes than they would under the rates Bill Clinton had in the \n1990s.'' I am going to show you, if this goes into effect, it is \nprobably the highest rates, going back to the time Carter was \nPresident. The small business surtax proposed by House Democrats would \nviolate President Obama's pledge. Therefore, I stand with President \nObama in opposing the small business surtax proposed by House \nDemocrats.\n  According to National Federation of Independent Businesses survey \ndata, 50 percent of the owners of small businesses that employ 20 \nworkers to 249 workers would fall into the top two brackets, backing up \nwhat I have continuously said during my dialog with the people. \nAccording to the Small Business Administration, about two-thirds of the \nNation's small business workers are employed by small businesses with \n20 to 500 employees. Do we want to raise taxes on these small \nbusinesses that create new jobs and employ two-thirds of all small \nbusiness workers?\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses recently came out \nwith its June report that showed that small businesses continue to have \nnet job losses as well as reduced compensation for those who are still \non the payroll; in other words, not part of the 9.5 percent \nunemployment we have since the stimulus bill passed. With these small \nbusinesses already suffering from the credit crunch, do we think it is \nwise to hit them with the double whammy of up to a 33-percent increase \nin marginal tax rates.\n  Newly developed data from the Joint Committee on Taxation \ndemonstrates that 55 percent of the tax from the higher rates will be \nborne by small business owners with incomes over $250,000. This is a \nconservative number because it doesn't include flow through business \nowners making between $200,000 and $250,000 that will also be hit by \nthe Democratic budget's proposed tax hikes. If the proponents of the \nmarginal rate increase on small business owners agree that a 23-percent \nto 33-percent tax increase for half the small businesses that employ \ntwo-thirds of all small business workers is not wise, then they should \neither oppose these tax increases or present data that show a different \nresult. I wish to fight for lower State tax rates and higher estate tax \nexemption amounts to protect successful small businesses so people who \nwork a lifetime can pass on without liquidation at the time of death.\n  In a time when many businesses are struggling to stay afloat, it does \nnot make sense to impose additional burdens on them by raising taxes. \nOdds are they do nothing then but cut spending. And when their cash \nflow goes down, probably layoffs happen. They will cancel orders for \nnew equipment as well, cut insurance for their employees, and stop \nhiring. Instead of seeking to raise taxes on those who create jobs in \nour economy, our policies need to focus on reducing excessive tax and \nregulatory barriers that stand in the way of small businesses and the \nprivate sector making investments, expanding production, and creating \nsustainable jobs. We should continue to fight to prevent a dramatic tax \nincrease on our Nation's job machine, the small businesses of\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\nAmerica. This includes working to protect small businesses from higher \nmarginal tax rates, an increase in capital gains and dividend tax rates \nand an increase in the unfair estate tax rate that will penalize the \nsuccess of small businesses.\n  In fact, I have recently introduced S. 1381, the Small Business Tax \nRelief Act of 2009, to lower taxes on these job-creating small \nbusinesses. My bill contains a number of provisions that will leave \nmore money in the hands of these small businesses so these businesses \ncan hire more workers, continue to pay the salary of their current \nemployees, and make additional investments in these businesses. The \nNational Federation of Business has written a letter supporting my \nbill.\n  Quoting from the letter:\n\n       To get the small business economy moving again, small \n     business needs the tools and incentives to expand and grow \n     their business. S. 1381 provides the kind of tools and \n     incentives that small businesses need.\n\n  We all want to see the job numbers from the Department of Labor \nmoving in positive directions. We all want to see the unemployment rate \nplummet. I firmly believe the best way for us to do that is to prime \nthe job-creating engine of our economy by focusing on small businesses. \nMy small business bill, if enacted, will lead to new jobs. This is in \nthe right direction. The House health care reform bill, with the 5.4-\npercent tax increase, is taking us in the wrong direction. These will \nbe real, countable, verifiable jobs that will be created.\n  In contrast, President Obama has proposed tax increases that will \ncause small business jobs to be lost. The newest tax hike proposed is \nthe small business surtax. As with other tax hikes on small business, I \noppose the small business surtax. I urge my colleagues on both aisles \nto do the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the NFIB letter from \nwhich I quoted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2009.\n     Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf of the National \n     Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's \n     leading small business advocacy organization, I am writing to \n     thank you for introducing S. 1381, the Small Business Tax \n     Relief Act of 2009.\n       Small business is the source of economic growth and job \n     creation, but the NFIB Small Business Economic Trends (SBET) \n     survey has been near historic lows since September, with \n     plans to hire and make capital expenditures showing little \n     sign of improvement. To get the small business economy moving \n     again, small businesses need the tools and incentives to \n     expand and grow their businesses.\n       S. 1381 provides the kinds of tools and incentives that \n     small businesses need. Specifically, increasing and making \n     permanent section 179 expensing will provide small businesses \n     with the incentives and certainty to make new investments in \n     their business. Providing a 20 percent deduction for smaller \n     flow-through businesses and reducing the tax rate on smaller \n     C corps will allow all small businesses to keep more of their \n     income to invest back into the business. Finally, providing \n     full deductibility of health insurance for the self employed \n     provides tax equity, lowers the cost of health insurance, and \n     improves an important deduction for these business owners.\n       These and other provisions in the bill will reduce the tax \n     burden on small businesses. This is especially important in \n     the current economic environment with many small businesses \n     struggling to find access to credit. Allowing business owners \n     to keep more of the money they earn provides an immediate \n     source of capital that will be invested back into the \n     business.\n       Thank you again for your continued efforts to support small \n     business owners and to reduce their tax burden. I look \n     forward to working with you to see that this bill becomes \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Eckerly,\n                             Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to executive session and that the Commerce Committee \nbe discharged en bloc from further consideration of PN638 and PN639 and \nthat the Senate proceed en bloc to their consideration; that the \nnominations be confirmed and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable en bloc; that no further motions be in order; that any statements \nrelating to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed are as follows:\n\n\n             national aeronautics and space administration\n\n       Charles F. Bolden, Jr., of Texas, to be Administrator of \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n       Lori Garver, of Virginia, to be Deputy Administrator of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, by this action, it concludes a \nvery happy chapter for what I think will be the future of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration. PN638 is Presidential No. 638, \nand that is the nomination of GEN Charles F. Bolden to be the NASA \nAdministrator, whom we have just confirmed, and PN639 is Presidential \nNo. 639, which is the nomination of Lori Garver to be Deputy \nAdministrator for NASA which we have just confirmed. My congratulations \nto the two of them.\n  I will make one personal comment. General Bolden is someone who has \nknown adversity but has always been an overcomer.\n  This was certainly true in South Carolina, in 1964, when, as an \nAfrican American, he could not get an appointment from his \ncongressional delegation to Annapolis. The Defense Department found \nCharlie and arranged for a Chicago Congressman to nominate him. When \nCharlie arrived as a freshman at Annapolis, he was promptly elected \npresident of the freshman class. So you can see the progression of \nbeing an overcomer.\n  Upon graduation from Annapolis, choosing the Marines, choosing to \nfly, becoming a marine test pilot, applying to the astronaut office, \nbecoming an astronaut, flying twice as shuttle pilot and twice as \ncommander--four times--returning to active duty in the Marine Corps, \nand rising to the level of major general, after having commanded \nseveral Marine wings; and now the dream is fulfilled that Charlie has \nnow been confirmed as head of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration.\n  I think it is interesting that at 6:03 this evening the space shuttle \nlifted off into a successful mission. This space shuttle holds the \nsecond record for the most delays--six. It is exceeded by the first \nspace flight that General Bolden took, of which I had the privilege of \nbeing a member of that crew in January of 1986. We were delayed seven \ntimes--scrubbed four times on the pad before launching on the fifth try \ninto an almost flawless 6-day mission.\n  General Bolden takes over NASA at a critical time. NASA is in drift. \nIt needs a leader. But also for General Bolden to be successful as the \nleader of NASA, he has to have the backing of the President of the \nUnited States, who is the one who can give the ultimate leadership to \nour Nation's space program.\n  So it was such a privilege for me, Mr. President, to come and \npropound this unanimous consent request and to see the Senate confirm, \nby your order, unanimously, the nominations of the Administrator and \nthe Deputy Administrator of NASA. Needless to say, there are a lot of \nsmiles that are going to be across America as a result of this action.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am in support of President Obama's \nnomination of Charles Bolden as the next Administrator of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, and Lori Garver as the \nDeputy Administrator of NASA.\n  We are at a critical point in NASA's history, and our space agency \nneeds a leadership team devoted to the core mission of the agency.\n  Mr. Bolden has a compelling story. He transcended barriers and \nestablished himself at the forefront of our Nation's scientific policy. \nA career marine and true leader, Mr. Bolden is deeply committed to \nfostering a balanced space program focused on safe,\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\nreliable human space exploration, and robust scientific research and \ninnovation. A seasoned astronaut, Mr. Bolden has experienced first hand \nthe significance of space exploration, traveling into orbit four times \nbetween 1986 and 1994, including a mission to deploy the Hubble space \ntelescope.\n  From commanding missions in space to serving our Nation in the U.S. \nMarine Corps, Mr. Bolden has displayed the experience, leadership \nskills, and know-how to successfully guide NASA into the future.\n  In addition, Lori Garver is a leader in the aerospace industry and \nhas displayed tremendous management ability and intellect. Her \nknowledge of our space program will be key to NASA's leadership team.\n  Again, I fully support the nomination of Charles Bolden and Lori \nGarver as the next Administrator and Deputy Administrator of NASA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7578-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7578-S7579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AFFORDABLE HEALTH CHOICES ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today, I proudly cast my vote to pass \nout of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nlandmark legislation that will fundamentally change the direction of \nour dysfunctional health care system.\n  The committee approval of the Affordable Health Choices Act is truly \na tremendous victory for millions of Americans who struggle with a \nsystem that has continually failed to provide quality, affordable \nhealth care options for them, their families, their loved ones, and \ntheir businesses.\n  It has been a special privilege to temporarily serve on the HELP \nCommittee, in particular, with my distinguished senior Senator, Jack \nReed. I do not think there is a formal rule against it, but it is a \nrarity in the Senate for two Members from the same State of the same \nparty to serve on the same committee. My brief tenure on the HELP \nCommittee gave me the chance to witness firsthand the resolve and \ncaring leadership that is Jack Reed's hallmark and that was shown \nthroughout this historic debate.\n  I also applaud the unwavering commitment and leadership of President \nObama, and the tireless efforts of my Senate colleagues, in the pursuit \nof meaningful, comprehensive reform.\n  I feel really very privileged to have served with Chairman Dodd and \nRanking Member Enzi. Chairman Dodd had this responsibility fall upon \nhim when illness overtook probably his best friend in the Senate, \nChairman Kennedy. And he gave me, at least, as a junior Senator, an \neducation in Senate chairmanship.\n  Ranking Member Enzi presented an unforgettable model of graciousness \nand civility. And all of the members of the committee worked hard and \nsincerely.\n  I particularly thank our esteemed chairman, Senator Kennedy, for his \nlongstanding leadership and dedication. He truly is the champion of \nhealth care reform. For decades, Chairman Kennedy has worked \npassionately on this important cause. And while he could not attend the \nmarkup, we felt his presence daily in the hearing room. And it is to \nhis very great credit that we had this success today.\n  I am pleased that the final legislation reflects the principles \noutlined by President Obama, who called for a new system to control \nskyrocketing health costs, expand coverage to the tens of millions left \nuninsured in our country, and ensure high quality, affordable health \ncare for every American family.\n  The bill also focuses on the priorities of Americans, from all \ncorners of our country, whose powerful and often heart-wrenching \nstories underscore the urgent need for reform.\n  Behind all the statistics and all the numbers and all the projections \nand all the demographics, as we all know in this Chamber, are a legion \nof personal and family tragedies and sorrows and frustrations that we \nhave to address.\n  The Affordable Health Choices Act invests heavily in the delivery \nsystem reforms that will drive down costs and bring our current \noutmoded, broken system into the 21st century. These changes are long \npast due and are essential if we are to protect our ship of state from \nthe tidal wave of health care costs now bearing down on us.\n  This legislation also upholds President Obama's promise: If you like \nthe health care you have, you can keep it. But for the many Americans \nwho want different choices or who do not have health insurance at all, \nwe also offer a new public health insurance option that can and must \ncompete in an open market with private insurance.\n  As I have traveled throughout Rhode Island, at community dinners and \nsenior centers, at coffees and on our main streets, I have heard \nstories of frustration and heartache at our broken health care system. \nEarlier this year, I launched a health care storyboard on my Web site \nwhere Rhode Islanders can share their experiences and ideas for health \nreform. In just a few short months, hundreds of Rhode Islanders have \nwritten to share their ideas and experiences. These are just a few of \nthem.\n  Paul and Marcela from Newport told me about the health complications \nthat Paul and his son have endured from type 1 diabetes. The related \nmedical conditions Paul has suffered from the diabetes have left him \nunable to work.\n  To compensate for the family's loss of income, Marcela works \ntirelessly, taking on a full-time and part-time job to pay the bills. \nLike so many hard-working Americans, they fall just short of income \neligibility cutoffs for State assistance programs, forcing them to bear \nthe brunt of expensive medical cos, premiums, and prescription costs. \nOn a stretched budget, balancing their medical expenses is a constant \nchallenge, and Paul and Marcela keep hoping they will catch a break \nsoon.\n  I heard from Ben, a medical student in Providence, who, even at such \nan early stage in his medical career, has witnessed the devastating \neffect of being uninsured on the health and well-being of his patients.\n  Ben shared the story of one of his patients who delayed treatment \nbecause he was unable to afford the medical bills. Only a few days \nlater, this patient was rushed to the emergency room with a life-\nthreatening infection.\n  The treatment to save this man's life resulted in much higher costs \nfor the patient and the hospital--costs that Ben knows may have easily \nbeen prevented if the patient was treated when the condition was in its \nearly stages. Ben writes:\n\n       It's these day-to-day decisions to postpone treatment that \n     really hurt the uninsured.\n\n  Mike from Riverside shared his experience of surviving cancer that \nwas misdiagnosed and left untreated for several years. When he sought a \nsecond opinion, the final diagnosis was delayed for weeks as his paper \nmedical records were shuttled from hospital to hospital.\n  On top of this frustration, Mike received the devastating news that \nhis leg had to be removed to prevent the cancer from spreading further. \nAfter his amputation surgery, Mike is thankful to be cancer free, but \nnow his financial struggles have begun. With medical bills and health \ncare premiums that exceed his monthly mortgage payments, Mike is \nwondering how he will make ends meet.\n  I had coffee with Shirley, a Middletown resident who described her \nrelief at turning 65. For the past 20 years, she and her husband did \nnot have insurance. As self-employed business owners in their fifties, \nfinding affordable insurance options was impossible, so they went \nwithout. They took their chances.\n  Now 65 and eligible for Medicare, they finally have peace of mind. \nShirley admits she and her husband were lucky to make it through those \n20 years without serious health problems. During our meeting, she urged \nus to pass health care reform for the millions of hard-working \nAmericans--hard-working, middle-class Americans--who are not as \nfortunate as she and her husband.\n  For these Rhode Islanders--and for millions more Americans all over \nthe country--there has to be a better way. We have to do better than 47 \nmillion uninsured and millions more teetering on the brink. We have to \ndo better than 100,000 people dying each year from avoidable medical \nerrors. We have to do better than health care outcomes for Americans \nwho are at the bottom of all our industrialized competitors. America \ncan do better than this. With this legislation, we believe the process\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\nhas begun for America to do better than this.\n  The work accomplished today by the HELP Committee is, of course, a \nfirst step in a long journey toward restructuring our health care \nsystem. The path to meaningful reform will not be easy. We have many \nrivers to cross, and our efforts to implement change will still face \nchallenges. Certain stakeholders, invested in the status quo, will \nfight back against change; they will drag their feet; they will \nmisinform; and they will mobilize--all with the singular purpose of \ndefeating our progress toward comprehensive health care reform.\n  I know the fight to secure final passage of our reform will be \ncontentious, but I welcome a vigorous debate on the Senate floor \nbecause I also know our current system has reached a state of disrepair \nthat is putting us at risk--as patients, as families, as competitive \nbusinesses, and as a nation. And failing to change the status quo is \nboth unsustainable and irresponsible.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/15/senate-section/article/S7579-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
