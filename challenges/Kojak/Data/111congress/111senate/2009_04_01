Mr. President, throughout this debate, Republicans \nhave shown that this budget spends too much, taxes too much, and \nborrows too much. At a time when many are struggling just to get by, \nDemocrats in Congress want to enact the largest tax increase in \nhistory, including a national energy tax that could cost every American \nhousehold up to $3,100 a year. They want to double the national debt in \n5 years and triple it in 10. And they want to increase nondefense \nspending so much that the Government would have to hire up to 250,000 \nbureaucrats just to get the money out the door. Let me say that again. \nThe Government would have to hire up to a quarter of a million \nbureaucrats just to get the money out the door. This is not the type of \njob creation Americans have been hoping for, and this was not the \nbudget Americans wanted. Rather, they are demanding that Republicans \nand Democrats work together to craft a budget that lets them keep their \nhard-earned wages, spend their tax dollars wisely, and does not saddle \ntheir children and grandchildren with mountains of debt.\n  Republicans have tried to work with Democrats to pass such a budget \nby offering amendments that reflect the views of most Americans and \nsoon will sponsor a series of amendments to prevent tax increases on \nindividuals, families, and businesses. The junior Senator from Texas, \nfor example, has an amendment that would make it significantly harder \nto raise taxes on small businesses. The President has noted repeatedly \nthat small businesses are at the heart of the American economy, are \nresponsible for half of all private sector jobs, and have created \nroughly 70 percent of all new jobs in the past decade. Republicans will \npropose an amendment by the junior Senator from Nevada which would make \nit significantly harder to raise taxes on couples making less than \n$250,000 a year.\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\n  Americans are worried about tax hikes. They are also worried about \nthe colossal amount of debt this budget would leave to our children. \nThis budget proposes to borrow an equivalent amount of money in the \nnext 5 years to all of the money the Government has borrowed from 1789 \nto January 20, 2009. So the senior Senator from New Hampshire sponsored \nan amendment to require a supermajority to adopt any budget resolution \nthat would more than double the entire public debt cumulated from 1789 \nto January 20, 2009. The Democrats rejected that amendment.\n  In other efforts to control debt and curb Federal spending, \nRepublicans will offer a number of additional amendments, including \nanother amendment from the senior Senator from New Hampshire that would \ntake the first step toward the creation of a bipartisan task force to \nconfront the Nation's long-term deficits; an amendment from the senior \nSenator from South Carolina that would help to ensure that Social \nSecurity remains a self-sustaining, solvent program; an amendment from \nthe senior Senator from Idaho that would take the Democratic spending \nlevels and try to ensure spending does not exceed those levels. \nRepublicans will sponsor further amendments that would correct many of \nthe other problems with this budget.\n  Additionally, Republicans have resisted efforts to fast track major \npolicy changes through reconciliation. The junior Senator from Nebraska \nhas offered an amendment that would prohibit the use of this rule in \nconnection with a national energy tax. Some Democrats said they do not \nsupport using reconciliation for this legislation. We will insist on \nhaving a vote on the Johanns amendment.\n  These Republican proposals should have the support of Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. We should all want to cut the massive taxing, \nborrowing, and spending in this budget.\n  The budget debate is always one of the most clarifying weeks of the \nyear. Rarely do the American people get to see the differences between \nthe two parties as clearly as they do during this debate. Rarely has \nthe difference been so stark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4112-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE LADY CARDS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in the ongoing debate about the fiscal \ncondition of the country, we have heard once again the finger pointed \nat President Obama. President Obama did not create this economic \ncollapse. He has only been President about 3 months--less than 3 \nmonths. This is not his concoction, nor are the deficits and debt piled \nup by the previous administration his responsibility.\n  President Obama inherited a colossal mess--a debt that was doubled \nduring the previous administration, foreign holdings of U.S. debt that \nwere tripled during the previous administration, and an economic \ncollapse unparalleled since the Great Depression. In addition to that, \nhe inherited two wars.\n  President Obama is striving mightily to get us moving back in the \nright direction. His budget, especially the first 5 years of his \nbudget, which emphasizes reducing our dependence on foreign energy, a \nfocus on excellence in education, fundamental health care reform, all \nthe while cutting the deficit by more than half and extending the \nmiddle-class tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, has exactly the right \npriorities for the country.\n  When I hear criticism of President Obama, I must say it is badly \nmisplaced. Our friends on the other side who complain about the fiscal \ncondition of the United States should look in the mirror because they \nwere there as silent sentinels when the previous administration stacked \nup this record debt, these record deficits, and plunged this country \ninto a deep economic decline. That is their responsibility. President \nObama is in on the cleanup crew, and a remarkable job he is doing.\n  We now are prepared to enter into an order for the next several \namendments: Senator Casey to be recognized for 10 minutes; then Senator \nGregg or his designee for 1 minute; Senator Ensign for an amendment, 15 \nminutes on his side, 15 minutes for the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee or his designee;\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\nthen we will go to an amendment by Senator Kerry, who is seeking 15 \nminutes and will reserve just 1 minute in opposition or to comment. Is \nthat OK with the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we are prepared to move forward on those three at \nthis point.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we still have to work on this, but I would \nlike to be recognized to offer an amendment after Senator Kerry \ncompletes his amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It will be our intention--we need to work out times and \nhave a chance to look at the amendment--that Senator Gregg would go \nafter that. Our intention is to have a tranche of votes at 2:30 this \nafternoon. So far, that would involve a vote on the Alexander amendment \noffered yesterday, the Lieberman-Collins amendment offered yesterday, \nthe Sessions amendment offered yesterday, and then, of course, the \npending amendments--Casey, Ensign, Kerry, a potential for Johanns, and \na side-by-side from yesterday. We still have that to resolve. And \npotentially Senator Gregg as well.\n  With that, Senator Casey is up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 783\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise for two purposes: the first on an \namendment, and then I want to speak on the budget as well.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment and \ncall up amendment No. 783, the Casey amendment on funding the Long-Term \nStability/Housing for Victims Program under the Violence Against Women \nAct.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Casey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 783.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the \nreading of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund to fully fund the Long-Term \n                 Stability/Housing for Victims Program)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO FULLY FUND THE \n                   LONG-TERM STABILITY/HOUSING FOR VICTIMS \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other levels and limits in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     motions, or conference reports that would fully fund the \n     Long-Term Stability/Housing for Victims Program under the \n     Violence Against Women Act which builds collaborations \n     between domestic violence service providers and housing \n     providers and developers to leverage existing resources and \n     create housing solutions that meet victims' need for long-\n     term housing at the authorized level, by the amounts provided \n     in that legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2019.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, earlier this month I had the honor of \nchairing the advisory board and participating in the release of a \nreport by the National Center on Family Homelessness that focused on \nthe increasing number of children that are homeless in our country.\n  The report is titled ``America's Youngest Outcasts''--a very \nappropriate title and a heartbreakingly accurate one.\n  There are many very harmful consequences of homelessness for \nchildren. But first I want to emphasize the nexus between domestic \nviolence and homelessness--and the reason why I am offering this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, this budget amendment creates a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund for the Long-Term Stability/Housing for Victims Program, \nwhich is authorized under the Violence Against Women Act, and I am \noffering this amendment because I wanted to highlight two very serious \nproblems in this country. First of all, the relationship between \ndomestic violence and homelessness and the obvious impact that both of \nthese issues have on women and children in America; and in particular \nthe high number of women and children who are fleeing abusive \nsituations who then become homeless.\n  This program, under the Violence Against Women Act, will help \nsubstantially to improve the lives of women and children in America who \nbecome both victims of domestic violence and then become victims \nbecause they are homeless as a result of that.\n  I want to defer further review of that for now because I want to move \nto the second part of my remarks which focus on the budget, and in \nparticular the issue of health care.\n  As we know from the budget offered by President Obama, these are his \npriorities in that budget: First of all, the creation of jobs, the \nfocus on health care--which I will speak of in a moment--energy \nindependence, and education. Two items not on that list are deficit \nreduction, to cut the deficit in half over the next couple of years, \nand, secondly, tax cuts--over $800 billion in tax cuts set forth in the \nresolution that we are considering before the Senate.\n  At this point I will go to a second chart that very simply puts forth \na headline from the Reading Eagle newspaper in Reading, PA, dated \nFebruary 9 of this year: ``Tilden Township Woman Tends To Baby Born \nHours After Her Husband's Death,'' and then there is a very brief \nintroduction:\n\n       Just after noon on Thursday, Trisha Urban's husband, Andrew \n     D. Urban, died. Less than nine hours later, she gave birth to \n     their first child, Cora Catherine.\n\n  Andrew Urban was just 30 years old, Mr. President. It is hard to \ndescribe the situation Trisha Urban was facing that day. Literally, at \nthe same time she was watching her husband die, she was being rushed to \nthe hospital to have their first child.\n  Let me read one excerpt from a letter she sent to me. Here is how her \nfirst paragraph concludes:\n\n       Two ambulances were in my driveway. As the paramedics were \n     assessing the health of my baby and me, the paramedic from \n     the other ambulance told me that my husband could not be \n     revived.\n\n  She goes on to say in the letter:\n\n       Because of preexisting conditions, neither my husband's \n     health issues nor my pregnancy would be covered under private \n     insurance. I worked four part-time jobs and was not eligible \n     for health benefits.\n\n  Later in the letter she talks about the insurance company dropping \nthe coverage for her family.\n\n       We were left with close to $100,000 worth of medical bills. \n     Concerned with the upcoming financial responsibility of the \n     birth of our daughter and the burden of current medical \n     expenses, my husband missed his last doctor's appointment \n     less than 1 month ago.\n\n  And, of course, we know what happened next--her husband died and her \nbaby was born.\n  Those words and this story tell us all we need to know about the \nchallenge of health care--the challenge that is presented to the \nSenate, the Congress, and the country. We cannot fail to do something \nabout this issue this year; not 2010, not 2011, or down the road. We \nhave to address this issue this year. I am glad the President has made \nthis a priority, and I am glad that Chairman Conrad has as well.\n  I want to read Chairman Conrad's words, the chairman of our Budget \nCommittee, when he talked about not just the importance of health care \nbut the connection between health care and fiscal responsibility in our \nbudget. When he was releasing the budget resolution, Chairman Conrad \nsaid, in part:\n\n       Reforming our Nation's health care system is essential to \n     ensuring our long-term fiscal stability and economic \n     strength, in addition to the well-being of our citizenry. \n     Soaring health care costs are the biggest source of the \n     projected explosion in Federal debt in our long-term budget \n     outlook. Rapidly rising health care costs make it harder for \n     our businesses to compete globally, while putting a \n     tremendous strain on family budgets.\n\n  That is the challenge we have from a fiscal point of view if we don't \ndo anything about health care. But let's talk about costs and \nfamilies--rising costs and struggling families.\n  This chart is very simple. The orange line, of course, is the rise in \nhealth insurance premiums from 1999 to 2008, a very dramatic and \nunambiguous upward spike. The two lower lines, the light blue and the \nred, depict workers' earnings, which have been, at best, near flat in \nthat time period. Then overall inflation is at about the same level, so \na 34-percent increase in wages at the same time health care premiums \nare up 119 percent.\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\n  Going to the next chart, the insurance status of Americans under the \nage of 65, you can see from that number we have 86 million Americans, \naccording to a recent report, who at some period of time in 2007 and \n2008 had no health insurance. I might add those 86 million people, most \nof them, almost 70 percent of them, didn't have health care for at \nleast 6 months.\n  Finally, we go to the employment status of people in Pennsylvania--\nthose who are uninsured. As you can see from this chart, more than \nthree-quarters of the people in Pennsylvania who are uninsured are \nemployed. So we are talking about working families not having health \ninsurance. That won't come as news to people across the country.\n  This really, when you get down to it, is not about these charts or \nnumbers. In the end, it is about people. It is about Trisha Urban and \nher family and the horror they faced when her husband, the father of \nher child, died at the very moment of birth of that child, but it is \nalso the horror of people who face a health insurance crisis that is \nliterally, in some cases, about life and death and about whether they \nwill survive.\n  Just consider this: Consider the costs we are talking about in terms \nof the causes of death. The leading cause of death for Americans \nbetween the ages of 55 and 64 are, No. 1, heart disease; No. 2, cancer; \nbut No. 3, in that age category, no insurance--the cause of death, not \njust a problem, not just a crisis, but literally the third leading \ncause of death in that age category. So that is what we are talking \nabout.\n  Finally, when we consider the challenges that families face, this is \nalso about a lot of small businesses. I am noting that in Pennsylvania \nwe have a strong tradition of making sure we support our small \nbusinesses. One of the companies our office worked with is Bingaman & \nSon Lumber Company. They have been in business 40 years, with 250 \npeople employed, and they prided themselves on covering 80 percent of \ntheir employees' medical and prescription drug costs. In December, \nBingaman & Son Lumber was notified that due to high medical bills the \ncompany would have to increase their premiums by 37 percent.\n  We were able to work with them to provide some relief. But, again, \nthis points to the crisis in families but also the crisis in small \nbusinesses--a 37-percent increase in their premiums.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to highlight President Obama's \nprinciples for health care reform. They are very simple, and I will go \nthrough them quickly. We know what they are: protecting families' \nfinancial health, just as we spoke of today; making health care \naffordable; aiming for universality, or covering everyone, which has to \nbe our objective; portability of coverage, so in the case of the Urban \nfamily moving or changing jobs, it would not lead to a problem with \nhealth insurance which could have been prevented; guaranteed choice; \ninvestment in prevention and wellness, and we know the importance of \nthat; improving patient safety and quality care; and, finally, \nmaintaining long-term fiscal sustainability, or stability, as our \nchairman has made a major priority of the budget resolution.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would ask that we stay focused on \nthis issue, not just in this budget resolution but well beyond the \ndebate on the budget. And I want to come back to Trisha Urban. At the \nend of her letter to me, she said the following:\n\n       I am a working class American and do not have the money or \n     the insight to legally fight the insurance company. I will \n     probably lose my home, my car, and everything we worked so \n     hard to accumulate in our life will be gone in an instant. I \n     am willing to pay the price of losing everything.\n\n  So, Mr. President, as I conclude, I would ask all of us in the Senate \nwho are debating this budget and wondering what is going to happen on \nthe issue of health care this question: What price will we be willing \nto pay to make sure health care reform becomes a reality? The first \nstep in that goal is passing a budget resolution which makes health \ncare a priority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 804\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 804, an amendment to \nprotect middle-income taxpayers from tax increases.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 804.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect middle-income taxpayers from tax increases by \n providing a point of order against legislation that increase taxes on \nthem, including taxes that arise, directly or indirectly, from Federal \n      revenues derived from climate change or similar legislation)\n\n       On page 68, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT RAISES TAXES \n                   ON MIDDLE-INCOME TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--After a concurrent resolution on the \n     budget is agreed to, it shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, resolution, amendment between Houses, \n     motion, or conference report that--\n       (1) would cause revenues to be more than the level of \n     revenues set forth for that first fiscal year or for the \n     total of that fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years in the \n     applicable resolution for which allocations are provided \n     under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \n     and\n       (2) includes a Federal tax increase which would have \n     widespread applicability on middle-income taxpayers.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       (1) Middle-income taxpayers.--The term ``middle-income \n     taxpayers'' means single individuals with $200,000 or less in \n     adjusted gross income (as defined in section 62 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986) and married couples filing \n     jointly with $250,000 or less in adjusted gross income (as so \n     defined).\n       (2) Widespread applicability.--The term ``widespread \n     applicability'' includes the definition with respect to \n     individual income taxpayers in section 4022 (b)(1) of the \n     Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n     1998.\n       (3) Federal tax increase.--The term ``Federal tax \n     increase'' means--\n       (A) any amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     that, directly or indirectly, increases the amount of Federal \n     tax; or\n       (B) any legislation that the Congressional Budget Office \n     would score as an increase in Federal revenues.\n       (c) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--\n       (1) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, would he yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I apologize to the Senator. We thought we had entered a \nunanimous consent request. It was taken as more of a statement of times \nrather than a unanimous consent request. We need to get that fixed; \notherwise, we could have a long delay here.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent the Ensign amendment we are on now--I \nask unanimous consent Senator Ensign have 15 minutes and it be 15 \nminutes for the chairman of the Budget Committee or his designee; then \nwe would go to the Kerry amendment, 15 minutes for Senator Kerry, 5 \nminutes for time in opposition; then the Cornyn amendment, 15 minutes \nfor Senator Cornyn, 15 minutes for the chairman of the committee or his \ndesignee; then the Lincoln amendment on National Guard, 10 minutes for \nSenator Lincoln and 5 minutes in opposition; then we would go to the \nGregg amendment, 15 minutes for Senator Gregg and 15 minutes for the \nchairman of the committee or his designee. I ask unanimous consent that \nwe agree to that order.\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, if I tried to imagine the worst policy we \ncould pursue during this time of economic duress, when jobs are being \nshed from the economy, the worst policy would be to raise taxes on \nindividuals and businesses.\n  Every single day, we are buried in the news of our economic turmoil. \nThousands more are laid off, home foreclosures are reaching new highs, \nproperty values are dipping to new lows, more businesses are shutting \ntheir doors, and Americans are struggling to pay for life's essentials. \nTherefore, what we should be discussing is extending tax relief for \nindividuals and families, and even going further to encourage savings \nand investment that generates jobs and security.\n  Framed within this context, President Obama has promised not to raise \ntaxes on individuals making up to $200,000 and for families who make up \nto $250,000. In his address to Congress, he said:\n\n       But let me [be] perfectly clear, . . . if your family earns \n     less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes \n     increased a single dime. I repeat, not one single dime.\n\n  That was the quote from the President of the United States. The \nPresident did not say I will not raise income taxes one single dime. He \nsaid ``taxes,'' period. He did not define direct, indirect--he said \n``not one single dime will be raised in taxes.''\n  That promise does not go far enough, in my view because, as we have \ndiscussed, many middle-income families could be hit by increased energy \ncosts and other potential tax increases under this budget resolution. \nStill, the promise was made by the President and by other Democrats \nthat those who make up to $250,000 will not have their taxes raised, \n``not one single dime.'' I will be frank with my Democratic colleagues \nwhen I say that many people doubt they will live up to this promise. \nMany people making less than $250,000 fear tax increases on them in the \nimmediate future.\n  I believe we need to take action on this budget resolution that locks \nin place a commitment that Congress will not raise taxes on middle-\nincome families. My amendment ensures that Congress and the President \nwill keep this promise not to raise taxes on individuals making \n$200,000 a year or families making $250,000. If they decide to violate \nthis promise, then they will be held accountable.\n  To achieve this objective, my amendment would create a new budget \npoint of order against any legislation that would raise taxes on \nmiddle-income taxpayers, those individuals making less than $200,000, \nand families making less than $250,000. If the Democrats mean what they \nsay about not raising taxes on families making up to $250,000, then \nthey should embrace my amendment as a way of accomplishing it.\n  I define tax increase broadly because I think families were promised \n``no tax increases'' and they don't care whether those tax increases \ncome directly or indirectly. My amendment would protect taxpayers \nagainst indirect tax hikes yet to be forced upon the public.\n  Under the budget proposals, Americans, even those married couples \nwith incomes under $250,000 and singles under $200,000, would see \nhigher electricity, gas, heating oil, and other energy prices. \nAmericans would also see higher prices for other goods and services \nthat are themselves affected by higher energy costs.\n  This is the Trojan horse--the national sales tax on energy. This is \nthe indirect tax on people making less than $250,000 a year. A recent \nMIT study, which modeled a national energy tax regime similar to \nPresident Obama's budget proposal, estimated that annual revenues as \nhigh as $366 billion would come to the Federal Government. This equals \ntax increases of over $3,100 per household per year in the United \nStates. Higher energy costs under a national energy tax is not \nspeculation. Candidate Obama acknowledged his plan would lead to higher \nenergy prices. He said last year:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket.\n\n  The OMB Director, the President's OMB Director, Director Orszag, said \nin prepared testimony that ``[u]nder a cap-and-trade program, firms \nwould not ultimately bear most of the cost of the allowances but \ninstead would pass them along to their customers in the form of higher \nprices . . . [T]he price increases would be essential to the success of \na cap-and-trade program.''\n  That was a direct quote from President Obama's OMB Director, \nadmitting that these higher prices are going to get passed on to the \nAmerican consumer. If you are raising cap-and-trade taxes, and that is \nnot an indirect tax, I don't know what is. More than anything else in \nthis budget, an energy tax poses perhaps the greatest risk to our \neconomy and to middle income livelihoods. In addition, this amendment \nwould also protect taxpayers against tax hikes yet to be developed by \nthose who want to expand the role of the Federal Government.\n  Now is the time to protect middle-income Americans who are at risk \nfrom direct and indirect taxes. This amendment would be a good first \nstep in locking the budget into a direction in which middle-income \nfamilies are protected. Then we should work toward providing new tax \nrelief instead of raising taxes. With the economy in such bad state, we \nshould all be able to agree not to raise taxes. I urge all Members of \nthis body to support this important amendment.\n  In conclusion, the energy tax that has been proposed, this cap-and-\ntrade system, this national sales tax on energy. We did a hearing on \nthis the other night. What people do not realize is that not only do \nthe electricity rates skyrocket as the President said, but gasoline and \ndiesel prices go up significantly. That means transportation costs on \nyour food go up significantly. That means you have to raise the price \nof food.\n  We had the fertilizer companies testifying before our committee. I \ndidn't know that much about fertilizer before the testimony in front of \nthe committee. It is amazing what a world commodity fertilizer is. The \nenergy tax is going to destroy jobs in the fertilizer industry, but it \nwill also raise prices of fertilizers in the United States. Guess what, \nto grow food you need fertilizer. If you pay more for fertilizer, you \nare going to pay more for food. That cost either has to be borne by \nhard-working farmers and their families or it is going to be borne by \nthe consumer at the end.\n  The worst part of all this is that a national energy tax is the most \nregressive form of taxation there is because it hits those in the low- \nand middle-income categories much more severely as a percentage of \ntheir income than it does people at the top.\n  My amendment is critical for the President to keep his word on not \nraising taxes on individuals making up to $200,000 a year or families \nmaking up to $250,000 a year. My amendment will ensure that the \nPresident keeps not only his campaign pledge, but also what he pledged \nin his first address to Congress and to the American people when he \ntook office after Inauguration Day.\n  I urge adoption of my amendment by all the Senators in this body. \nLet's move forward and protect middle-class, middle-income taxpayers in \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could get the attention of my \ncolleague, I would be willing to take the amendment on a voice vote--\noh, I am sorry. I have been advised that because of the way the \namendment is structured, it gives specific instructions to the Finance \nCommittee that we cannot do so in a budget resolution or the whole \nbudget resolution is no longer privileged. We went through this last \nyear, you may recall, with the Cornyn amendment. The same thing applies \nhere.\n  I will be required to raise the defense of germaneness against the \namendment. Let me say this, I support the amendment. I think it is the \nright signal to send. But the Parliamentarian has advised us that if I \ndo not raise the defense of germaneness against the amendment, then the \nentire privileged nature of the budget resolution is at risk. I hope \nthe Senator understands. It has nothing to do with the message the \nSenator is trying to send. What it has to do with is, as I understand \nit, the specific instructions to the Finance Committee that are \ncontained in this amendment. That is beyond the power of the Budget \nCommittee. We don't\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\nhave the authority to tell the committees of jurisdictions with \nspecificity what they are to do with the allocations they are given. \nThe power of the Budget Committee is to tell the committees what \nnumbers they have to hit. We don't have the ability to tell them how to \ndo it.\n  It is just like appropriators. We tell them how much money they have \nto spend. We do not have the authority to tell them how to spend it.\n  If I were able to make a parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Has the Parliamentarian had a chance to review the Ensign \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is this amendment defective in the way that I have \ndescribed; that is, is it too prescriptive in terms of its language \nwith respect to the Finance Committee and therefore would it put at \nrisk the privileged status of the budget resolution itself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me inquire further. If I fail to raise the defense of \ngermaneness against this amendment, that would put the budget \nresolution's privileged status at risk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the amendment were to be adopted, it would \nput the privileged status at risk.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So if I raise the defense of germaneness and I were to \nlose, that would put the privileged status of the budget resolution at \nrisk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate his inquiry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Excuse me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator restate his inquiry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I were to raise a point of order that the amendment is \nnot germane for the reason we have discussed, and I were to lose that \npoint of order, would the resolution be at risk in terms of its \nprivileged status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would.\n  Mr. GREGG. Only if it passes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it would only be at risk if it passes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the amendment were adopted, it would be at \nrisk.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So let's be very clear. If I raise--first of all, I have \nto raise a point of order or the privileged status of the resolution is \nat risk; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I lose the point of order, the privileged status of \nthe resolution is at risk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, only if it is adopted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Wait. I have the floor.\n  I would ask the Senator from Nevada if it would not be possible for \nus to work together on alternative language that would capture the \nintent of the Senator from Nevada but that would not put the budget \nresolution at risk.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would say to the Senator from North Dakota, we have \nworked on language with the Parliamentarian, trying to overcome this \nproblem the Chairman is raising. The bottom line is, the intent of what \nwe are trying to do is to make sure taxes are not raised on people \nmaking up to $250,000 a year.\n  From what we understand from the Parliamentarian, there was not \nlanguage we could draft that would fit the conforming factor with the \nbudget resolution. So we were going to have to have a vote on waiving \nthe germaneness.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well the problem is, if the Senator proceeds, I am \nrequired to raise the point of order. If I fail to do so, the entire \nprivileged status of the budget resolution is at risk. If I raise it \nand I lose, the privileged status of the budget resolution is at risk.\n  This, in effect--I do not think this is the Senator's intention, to \nthreaten the entire budget resolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield on this point? If I might inquire \nof the Chair, ``at risk'' does not mean the resolution has necessarily \ngone over the level of being--of losing its privileged status?\n  This is, by the Chair's definition, a corrosive amendment. There \nwould have to be a series of corrosive amendments to meet the point \nwhere the bill loses its status as privileged. One single amendment \nthat is corrosive does not necessarily mean the bill has lost its \nprivileged status. It simply means it is moving in the direction of \nbeing at risk of losing its privileged status; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct with respect to this \nstage of the proceedings on this matter.\n  Mr. GREGG. So it is possible this amendment could pass. If passed, it \nwould be--could be deemed corrosive but would not be deemed fatal to \nthe privileged status of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. During this initial phase of consideration of \nthe resolution, that is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, further parliamentary inquiry: So let's \nreview because at least this Senator is getting a mixed message. Let's \nrevisit this. If I fail to raise a point of order against the Ensign \namendment, that threatens the privileged status of the resolution; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The adoption of the Ensign amendment would \nhave a corrosive effect on the privilege of the resolution on the floor \nat this time. It would have a fatal effect if the language were to be \nretained in the conference report.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So let's revisit this once again. If I did not raise the \npoint of order, in fact, supported the Ensign amendment, and it passed, \nas long as it did not come back from conference committee, the \nprivileged status of the budget resolution would be preserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, it would be corrosive. The \ncumulative effect of the adoption of such amendments could prove fatal.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I might inquire. But the amendment \nitself is not fatal?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not if it is adopted to the resolution at this \nphase.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to try and clarify that now because \nthis has gone back and forth. What I understood you to say is--I wish \nto have this clear--if it passes now, it has a corrosive effect, but if \nit does not come back--if it comes back from conference committee, it \nwould be fatal?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. If it does not come back from the conference committee, \nthen the corrosive--whatever effect--is eliminated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right. I think it is clear to all of us. I hope that \nis clear. Let me make one further parliamentary inquiry because I wish \nto make certain: If I fail to raise the point of order at this point \nagainst Senator Ensign's amendment, that has a corrosive effect, \npotentially corrosive effect, but it is not fatal?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It would only be fatal if it came back from conference \ncommittee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wish to indicate it would be my intention to support \nthe Ensign amendment. We will have a vote later on it. I would not \noppose it. But I wish to make clear to my colleagues this exchange. \nSenator Ensign needs to know, I cannot bring this amendment back from \nconference because that would be fatal to the privileged status of the \nbudget resolution. The Senator needs to offer this amendment knowing \nthat full well.\n  I also wish to say to others who might have similarly crafted \namendments, and I would ask the Parliamentarian at this time: If there \nwere a series of amendments such as this one that were adopted here but \ndid come back from the conference committee, would just the fact that a \nseries of amendments such as this were adopted be potentially fatal to \nthe privileged status of the budget resolution, even if they did not \ncome back from conference committee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is impossible to predict the ultimate \ncorrosive effect. But there is a theoretical possibility it could \nexist.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is not theoretical in the sense that we have another \namendment coming very soon after this one that is the same. The Cornyn \namendment, as I understand, has exactly the\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\nsame flaw. So we are going to have to go through this exercise again.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Another parliamentary inquiry: It is true that when you \nsay ``fatal,'' that just requires 60 votes instead of 51 votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If a measures loses its privileged status, \nwhen it is considered, it is fully debatable and could require 60 votes \nto invoke cloture.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Further parliamentary inquiry: That would indicate, if \nthey had 60 votes, they could pass the budget resolution even with this \namendment in it? So it actually is not fatal, it requires a higher \nlevel of support from the Senate to pass it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is fatal to the privileged status.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. But it does not kill the bill? The bill still could be \npassed with 60 votes, passing the other hurdles that are in the way; is \nthat not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, what is very clear is it is fatal to the \nprivileged status of the budget resolution. Requiring 60 votes on a \nbudget resolution, that is fatal. Let's be clear. We all know what this \nmeans.\n  I would ask to make a further parliamentary inquiry: Does it make a \ndifference whether I offer the point of order against the Ensign \namendment to the risk of the budget resolution, even if it does not \ncome back in conference?\n  Am I clear? Let me restate this. If the Ensign amendment does not \ncome back from conference committee, does the fact that I raise a point \nof order make a difference?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not if this does not come back from the \nconference committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I wish to say this to Senator Ensign straight from \nthe shoulder. I intend to support the amendment. I ask other colleagues \nto support the amendment because it is clear to me it will not be fatal \nto the privileged status of the budget resolution if it does not come \nback from conference committee.\n  But let me say this to the Senator very clearly: There is no way it \nis coming back from conference committee. I am not going to put the \nentire budget resolution at risk for that.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, one last comment. We clearly established \nthat even if it was in the budget resolution, coming back from \nconference it would require 60 votes at that point if somebody raised \nthe question of its privileged status. If that was the case, it would \nrequire 60 votes, and there it would require bipartisan participation.\n  I guess bipartisanship around here means it is fatal.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I would say this. Let's deal with the reality. The \nreality is, I do not remember a budget resolution around here that has \ngotten 60 votes. So to make the privileged status fatal, to be fatal to \nthe privileged status is to be fatal to a budget resolution. That is \nthe reality.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as an aside, I think it is important to \nnote the chairman has said this will not come back from the conference \ncommittee, which is interesting and informative. I think it is fair \nthat he has said that. It reflects the influence the chairman has on \nthe conference committee.\n  Therefore, I presume, since the chairman has said, relative to \nreconciliation, it should not occur in the Senate on the issue of \nhealth care or the carbon tax, national sales tax, that the chairman \nwill use the same influence to assure us we will not see those matters \ncome out of the conference committee.\n  In addition, I wish to ask a parliamentary inquiry: I understand \nthere is a wall, not a wall of debt--although that also is involved in \nthis bill--but there is a wall being built of corrosive activity, \npotentially, with a series of amendments that might be adopted on the \nfloor that the Parliamentarian deems to be corrosive. At some point, \nthere is the theoretical possibility, as the Chair has said, that you \nmight even bring the budget resolution's privilege into issue on the \nfloor.\n  I guess my question is: Why, if this is just one element of that \nwall, on the resolution as it reaches the floor, would it be definitive \nrelative to the conference report?\n  In other words, why doesn't there have to be a series of amendments \nthat are corrosive in order to make the conference report privilege \nfatal? Why would one amendment make the conference report fatal if it \ndoes not make the budget on the floor fatal, if the Chair understands \nthe question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conferees would have the opportunity, upon \nreflection, to remove corrosive matter from the conference report.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think my question was, to make it more succinct, if this \nwere the only corrosive matter in the conference report and since it \nwas not fatal to the budget resolution as a single corrosive matter on \nthe floor, why would it be fatal to the conference report? Why isn't \nthe conference report something that is subject to the same test of \ncorrosiveness as the budget resolution is on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conferees would have the ability to \nreflect on the appropriateness of the matters sent to them.\n  Mr. GREGG. So is the Chair saying that it is possible--more than \ntheoretical but possible--that this amendment in the conference report \nwould not be fatal to the conference report's privilege but would \nsimply be corrosive of that privilege and that the conference report \ncould retain its privilege with this amendment in it, that that is a \npossibility?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A very remote possibility.\n  Mr. GREGG. But not theoretical?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is there any possibility that the resolution could be \nchallenged prior to going to conference on the basis of its privilege \nand that it could lose its privilege prior to going to conference?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only on the accumulative effect of corrosive \namendments.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his confidence in \nmy ability to influence the outcome of the conference committee. I \ndon't think it may extend as far as he may wish or as far as I might \nwish.\n  On a matter such as this, I don't see that there is any option. Many \nof us support the intent of the amendment of the Senator from Nevada. \nUnfortunately, it is drafted in a way that the Parliamentarian has \ndescribed to us clearly. If it comes back from conference committee, in \nall likelihood that is fatal to the privileged status of the budget \nresolution. That is not a risk we can afford to take as conferees. I am \nconfident the conferees will not permit that. At the same time, I don't \nwant people voting against the amendment of the Senator on a \ntechnicality that then is misrepresented as their position on the \nunderlying position contained in this amendment.\n  With that, we have used as much time as we need on this amendment. \nSenator Kerry is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 732\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  That was one of the more intriguing half hours we have spent in the \nSenate in a long time. I might add, it is sort of interesting that we \nare haggling about an amendment which raises one of those great red \nherrings on the subject of global climate change and cap and trade \nbecause we already have a cap-and-trade system in America. It is not an \nautomatic tax increase. It is not going to, if properly structured, \nresult in a tax increase. We like to tilt against goblins around here \nsometimes. This is one of those amendments that do that in a very \npolitical way.\n  I ask that amendment No. 732 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Lugar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kaufman, \n     Mr. Menendez, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n     Sanders, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Corker, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 732.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\n (Purpose: To restore full funding for the President's request for the \n  international affairs budget, in support of development programs in \nPakistan and Afghanistan, nuclear nonproliferation, foreign assistance, \n  fighting global AIDS, promoting sustainable development, and other \n                        efforts, with an offset)\n\n       On page 10, line 20, increase the amount by $4,000,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 21, increase the amount by $1,896,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 25, increase the amount by $1,104,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 4, increase the amount by $476,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 8, increase the amount by $272,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 12, increase the amount by $116,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $4,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $1,896,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 3, decrease the amount by $1,104,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 7, decrease the amount by $476,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 11, decrease the amount by $272,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 15, decrease the amount by $116,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, over the first 9 years of this new century, \nwe have learned a lot about national security. We learned the hard way \nin 2001. Since then, with two wars, one in Afghanistan and one in \nPakistan, and also with the global economic crisis we face today, we \nunderstand the degree to which in a globalized world our problems are \ninterconnected. Ultimately, our security is interconnected. We are \ncurrently endangered by weak states and failed states as well as by \nstrong states because those weak and failed states become places where \nterrorism can flourish. We are endangered also by diseases that know no \nborders, by climate change half a world away. We are endangered when we \nallow chaos and crisis to create conditions for ideologies of radical \nhatred and violence to take root.\n  It is clear to all Members, who are, all of them, no matter what \ncommittee on which they serve, forced to think hard about how to \nprotect our country, that it requires a lot more than just a strong \nmilitary in order to provide that protection. It requires, above all, \nin this new world in which we live, a strengthened commitment to \ndiplomacy and to development. To put this as simply and as bluntly as \npossible, that is why passing a robust foreign affairs budget is a \nmatter not only of America's world leadership but also of our practical \nnational security at home.\n  I call to the attention of my colleagues the words of Secretary of \nDefense Bob Gates spoken almost a year and a half ago in Kansas where \nhe gave a speech while serving as President Bush's Secretary of \nDefense. What he said there is the following:\n\n       What is clear to me is that there is a need for a dramatic \n     increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national \n     security--diplomacy, strategic communication, foreign \n     assistance, civic action, and economic reconstruction and \n     development.\n\n  The other day, I was told the story of our National Security Adviser, \nformer Marine Commandant Jim Jones, who was commenting how we have \npowerful, enormous ships off the shores of Lebanon, but Hezbollah is \nbuilding schools and building homes and winning the hearts and minds of \npeople in that divided and volatile country by doing so. In effect, he \ndescribed a situation where, as powerful as our military is, we are not \nable to win the contest for ideas at the center of security issues \ntoday.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, our former colleague, testified \nin her confirmation the following:\n\n       The relatively small but important amount of money we do \n     spend on foreign aid is in the best interests of the American \n     people and promotes our national security and advances our \n     interests and reflects our values.\n\n  When our soldiers and generals join our top diplomats in demanding \nincreased civilian capacity and increased civilian funding, even in the \nmidst of this economic crisis, that is when you know there is not only \na growing consensus, there is a sense of urgency behind the \nstrengthening of our civilian mission.\n  We just had an elaborate, long period where I think three studies \nwere commissioned by President Bush, and then President Obama \nrecommissioned another evaluation of what is happening in Afghanistan \nand Pakistan. It is clear that we cannot achieve our objectives unless \nwe have the kind of robust budget in the foreign affairs account \nPresident Obama asked for. Regrettably, that is not what the budget \nresolution currently calls for, even when we add the supplemental \nbudgets to it. It falls about $4 billion short from the $53.8 billion \nthe President asked for.\n  I believe that returning diplomacy and development to their rightful \nplace is not going to be achieved by talking about it. It is going to \ntake money to drive civilian foreign policy. If it keeps us safer, and \nit is the consensus of our military and our diplomats that it does \nthat, then that is money well spent. Full funding of the President's \ninternational affairs budget is a vital step toward greater civilian \ncapacity.\n  I urge colleagues to support this amendment. Senator Lugar, Senators \nLeahy, Voinovich, Durbin, Kaufman, Menendez, Dodd, Feinstein, Brown, \nSanders, Lieberman, Casey, and Corker have all joined together to \ncosponsor this amendment. We ask for the approval of the Senate to add \n$4 billion worth of funding to the President's fiscal year 2010 \ninternational affairs budget request for the function 150 account. \nThere is an offset. The offset that would pay for this transfer would \ncome from the function 920 account.\n  The reality is that we are just not doing enough today to invest in \nthe vital components of both diplomacy and development. I was recently \nin the Middle East, in Egypt and Jordan and in the West Bank and Israel \nand Syria, Lebanon. I saw firsthand the degree to which people we \nsupport in many ways are struggling to push back against enormous \nspending by Iran and other actors who seek to destabilize the region. \nIf the United States talks about democracy and doesn't support people \nin the same way the people trying to disrupt it do, we lose our \ncredibility and, more importantly, we walk away from people who are \nliterally putting their lives on the line to live up to the standards \nwe have set and the beliefs we have espoused so powerfully.\n  It is extraordinary to me that the funding for the Department of \nDefense today, with all of these restraints we see on its ability to \nachieve our goals, as powerful as we know it is and as much as we \nadmire the sacrifices and the extraordinary capability of our modern \nmilitary--the fact is, we spent over half a trillion dollars on it. \nThen in 2008, the Army added about 7,000 soldiers to the total. I \nsupported that. I believed we needed to do that to relieve pressure on \nthe current deployments. But 7,000 soldiers is more people than serve \nin the entire Foreign Service every year all the time. The fact is, \n1,100 Foreign Service officers could be hired for the cost of a single \nC-17 military cargo plane, and $4 billion, which is what we are looking \nfor here, is less than 2 percent of what the Government has given to \nAIG over the course of the last year and a half.\n  This is a vital context to put this discussion into. We have to \ndecide around here what is really important to us. What really makes a \ndifference to the security and safety of the American people? The \nPresident requested $53.8 billion in this year to fund next year's \nbudget. That is an increase of 8 percent over last year's funding level \nof 49.8.\n  Why is this so important? Well, first of all, let me put this in \ncontext, if I can. The total request of the President for this entire \ncontext of America's security comes to about 1.4 percent of our whole \nbudget. In fact, if you break out the entire national security budget, \nwhich is our defense, homeland security, all the components of \nsecurity, you are only talking about 6.8 percent of the entire national \nsecurity budget of our country for some of the most important things \nthat prevent people from becoming terrorists or from being able to \nengage in their terrorist acts with impunity.\n  Some people try to assert that the President's request has increased \n41 percent from last year's total of $38 billion. Let me say very \nclearly, right now, that is not accurate. The figure of $38 billion \ndoes not include last year's supplemental appropriations. And those \nsupplemental appropriations raised the total to about $50 billion.\n  What President Obama did was break the practice of past Presidents of \nsending in a phony half budget or a three-quarter budget and then we do \nthe rest of it through the supplementals. He decided the American \npeople ought to see\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\nit as it is, they ought to know what we are doing, we ought to make the \nrequest we need. So he put in the request for the $53 billion because \nthat is, in fact, reflecting what we actually spent last year, plus \nwhat we need to do for Afghanistan and Pakistan in this year. This is a \nmore straightforward way of doing business, frankly. Rather than hiding \nthe amount of money or massaging the spending figures by tucking extra \nspending into the supplemental bills, President Obama has been up front \nand open, and he has put it into one bill and says: Here is what I \nneed. That is why my colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nwho labors unbelievably hard under these difficult circumstances to \nmake all this work--and I respect him enormously in those efforts--has \npraised President Obama's approach in this openness.\n  So the real question is sort of, What is this $4 billion going to get \nus? What is the difference it is going to make? First of all, we have a \nvital new package the President announced yesterday that Senator Lugar \nand I will be introducing in a few days to provide additional \nassistance for Pakistan and Afghanistan. The $4 billion is going to \nhelp build civilian capacity and put our diplomats back on the front \nlines of American foreign policy. It will provide lifesaving treatment \nfor people with HIV/AIDS and continue the program that was perhaps the \nsingle most successful program of the Bush administration, which is the \nPEPFAR efforts in Africa. This $4 billion will help make people all \nover the world safer and in the process help keep America safer.\n  Ultimately, these kinds of efforts are the key to the strategy in \nAfghanistan. Our on-the-ground ability to be able to win, hold, and \nbuild is the whole strategy to be able to win people back over to us \nand prevent the Taliban from supplanting or filling the vacuum that \ncurrently exists.\n  We need to reverse years of neglect in those two countries. Pakistan \nhas nuclear weapons. We just saw the other day an attack on police \nrecruits in the heart of Pakistan itself--not out in the Fatah or in \nBaluchistan or the areas we know are harder to control. So we see that \ninsurgency with a message clearly sent that they can act with impunity. \nSo it is critical for the United States to step up and show President \nZardari and the Government of Pakistan, who are courageously trying to \nforge forward with their youthful democracy, that, in fact, we are \nsupportive and we are there to help them.\n  I ask my colleagues to imagine a nation as populous as Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and North Korea combined, a nation with a full arsenal of \nnuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of delivering them \nanywhere in a 1,000-kilometer range. Imagine a nation with a population \nthat is overwhelmingly moderate, overwhelmingly committed to democracy \nand the rule of law, but deeply suspicious of its leadership and of \nAmerica's friendship. Imagine a nation in which Osama bin Laden and the \nleadership of al-Qaida have found sanctuary for the past 7 years--a \nhaven from which they and their confederates have plotted and carried \nout attacks on their host country, on neighboring countries, and on \nsites around the globe. That nation can serve as a keystone for a new, \ncooperative relationship between the Western and Muslim worlds, or, if \nwe do not do our job, it could become an epicenter for radicalism and \nviolence on a cataclysmic scale.\n  So I believe we are at a critical crossroads, and we need a bold new \nstrategy for Pakistan. Our current path has not brought success, and \ntinkering around the margins is absolutely guaranteed to fail. That is \nwhy President Obama has called on Congress to pass the Enhanced \nPartnership With Pakistan Act that Senator Lugar and I will introduce \nvery soon that authorizes up to $1.5 billion annually in order to help \nshape this new relationship with Pakistan.\n  We also might mention again the importance of standing up with \nrespect to Iran. When you look back at what happened in the war with \nIsrael and Lebanon, the southern part of the country of Lebanon was \nsignificantly damaged. Iran, using its surrogate Hezbollah, immediately \npainted flags on the houses--their flags, Hezbollah flags--and \nessentially asserted: Don't worry, we are here, and we are going to \nrebuild this.\n  So last year both parties came together. We had 73 votes to pull \ntogether, in addition to the budget, to provide $48 billion over 5 \nyears. Today, it is imperative that we fund these programs, and I ask \nmy colleagues for their support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition to the \namendment?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when the Senator approached me about this \nyesterday, I told him I would strongly oppose this amendment. I told \nhim that because this has been hard to put together, and we have tried \nto have an equal sharing of sacrifice between all of the spending \nelements of a budget. We have tried to do it with respect to domestic \nspending, defense spending. We have tried to do it with mandatory \nspending. And international is a component of the discretionary side of \nthe budget, so we thought it would only be fair that they be asked to \nmake a contribution.\n  When I told the Senator yesterday that I would strongly resist this \namendment, I did not know, I was not aware, he had an offset for that \namendment, and that does alter the situation. That makes it more \npalatable because we maintain the same bottom line.\n  But it does concern me that we are upsetting the balance of what I \nthink is a fair distribution of the pain of the cutbacks we have had to \nmake. I want to be very clear about that. I am concerned that other \nparts of the budget are being asked to take reductions from the \nPresident's request and now international will not. So I want to say I \nfind that troubling.\n  I understand absolutely the substance of the argument the Senator is \nmaking, and he is right to make it. He is chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. But I do hope colleagues think carefully about \nkind of the equity of the burden here--the equity of the burden.\n  The second thing I want to say with respect to this amendment is that \nit uses a 920 offset. We came out of the committee with about $7 \nbillion in savings in 920. That is general overhead of all of the \nagencies; in other words, it is across the board, goes to their travel \naccounts, goes to their overhead accounts. Could we take somewhat more \nin 920? Yes, but not much more.\n  We came out of the committee at $7 billion. I have always tried to \nstay at about $10 billion in 920. This would take us to $11 billion. So \nI am troubled by that as well.\n  With that said, I do not intend to oppose this amendment, but I do \nfind it troubling on those two grounds: One, it does affect the \nfairness of the distribution of the pain, if you will, of the cutbacks \nwe have had to make; and No. 2, it adds to the section 920 offsets in a \nway that, to me, takes it a little past the realm of what is \nreasonable. But with that said, I do not intend to oppose this \namendment or ask colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, Senator Cornyn is next. Senator Cornyn has another one \nof these corrosive amendments. I told Senator Cornyn, this is the third \nyear he has offered a corrosive amendment, that he is very much in \ndanger of being dubbed ``Corrosive Cornyn.'' I hope he takes that with \nthe good humor it was intended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the new moniker the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee is trying to confer on \nme, but I would say it is not warranted for a number of reasons. The \nchairman has a great sense of humor, which I appreciate sometimes and \nnot as much on other occasions.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 806\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and to call up my amendment No. 806 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 806.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To protect small businesses from higher taxes)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. . POINT OF ORDER ON LEGISLATION THAT RAISES INCOME TAX \n                   RATES ON SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, it shall not be in order, \n     to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report that includes any provision which increases \n     Federal income tax rates.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Federal income \n     tax rates'' means any rate of tax imposed under subsection \n     (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of section 1, 11(b), or 55(b) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, dully chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my colleagues, when they listen to what my \namendment does, are going to experience a sense of deja vu. As the \nchairman says, we have been here before. As a matter of fact, 2 years \nago, when I offered this amendment, which would create a budget point \nof order requiring 60 votes for any legislation that would raise taxes \non small businesses--a couple years ago--we got 63 votes for that \namendment, including these Democrats, as shown on this chart, folks on \nthe other side of the aisle, making this a truly bipartisan proposal. \nTwo years ago, when we had the same amendment offered, we had a little \nbit different group, but 58 Senators, representing a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate, believed it was a correct move to limit this \nCongress's ability to raise taxes on small businesses.\n  I know the chairman has raised this issue of corrosive but not fatal \nto the privileged status of the budget resolution, and I have some \nanswers. We have corresponded with the Parliamentarian, and he has been \ngood to give us some guidance, and I think there is a pathway for us to \nmove forward for the conference committee to consider this amendment \nand to perhaps modify it in the conference and yet sustain its \nviability as a budget point of order for a tax increase on small \nbusinesses.\n  Why are we focusing on small businesses? Well, almost 400,000 small \nbusinesses in Texas, my State, employ about 4 million people. Frankly, \nas the chief job-creation engine of our country, small businesses \ndisproportionately add to the job creation in our country, and I think \nit would do nothing but destroy or certainly impair their ability to \ncontinue to create jobs in this country by raising taxes on small \nbusinesses. So I think it is appropriate, before we do, that we have an \nextra hurdle--at least 60 votes--to waive any budget point of order to \nmake us consider the seriousness of our decision and also the \nramifications of any tax increase on small businesses.\n  Last month, I visited Tyler, TX. That is in East Texas, a midsized \ncity of over 100,000 people, where I had the chance to sit down and \nvisit with local business leaders, community leaders, about how the \neconomy is going, unemployment rates--the things we could do here in \nWashington to perhaps make those businesses' job-creation capability a \nlittle easier. I met with Don Thedford, who 30 years ago opened a \nbusiness called Don's TV and Appliance. He did that 30 years ago with \njust one other employee; in other words, there were just two of them. \nToday, Don's business has 50 employees who sell and service appliances \nand electronics.\n\n  Don was able to grow his business early in this decade in part \nbecause of the tax relief we passed in 2001 and 2003. Since 2000, Don \nhas hired eight additional workers to install and deliver appliances, \nseven more service technicians, six more clerical workers, four more \nsales people, and two more in management. So this is the kind of job \ncreation we love to see: 30 years ago, two people; now 50 people \nworking productively in this small business. Don has also added a new \nretirement plan for all of his employees, in addition to the health \nbenefits he has offered to his employees for years.\n  As have many small businesses in this recession, he has seen his \nsales fall off. Of course, when families aren't buying and selling as \nmany homes, there is less demand for appliances and electronics. Higher \ntaxes would force Don, as well as other small businesses, to lay off \nsome employees he has hired and scale back on some of the benefits he \nhas offered, including health care.\n  We know more than half of the small businesses with 20 or more \nemployees will get hit with a tax increase under President Obama's \nbudget proposal. We also know, as I indicated earlier, small businesses \ncreate a majority of the net new jobs we have seen over the past \ndecade, and two-thirds of those jobs were created by businesses similar \nto those that are now threatened by a proposed tax increase. Given the \nadministration's stated goal and, indeed, our stated goal--I don't know \nany Member of the Senate who doesn't come to the floor and say we need \nto help our employers create and certainly, at least, retain the jobs \nthey have in this down cycle--I am left wondering why anyone would \noppose this budget point of order that would make it harder to raise \ntaxes on small businesses because I know we all appreciate, intuitively \nand otherwise, that raising taxes on small businesses would be \ncounterproductive to our ultimate goal of job creation.\n  I have said this every time I have offered this amendment--and now it \nis the third time--that this point of order is an insurance policy when \nCongress decides to look at the pocketbook of small business owners \nsuch as Don for more money instead of looking for ways to eliminate \nwaste and fraud and abuse in Government programs. We know the Office of \nManagement and Budget has reviewed more than 1,000 Government programs \nand found 20 percent of them to be nonperforming. Why don't we look for \nways to save money by eliminating that waste and nonperforming programs \nas opposed to raising taxes on the chief job creators in our economy? \nRaising taxes before we eliminate wasteful spending or fix the ones \nthat are broken is the wrong signal to our No. 1 job creators.\n  I share the chairman's concern, of course, about the debt. In fact, I \noffered an amendment in the Budget Committee that would have reduced it \nby more than $55 billion but, unfortunately, it was defeated by a \nparty-line vote. But with concerns that families and small businesses \nhave about the economy, now is not the time to increase taxes.\n  As former Chief Justice John Marshall noted, ``The power to tax is \nthe power to destroy.'' We should not use this power to destroy small \nbusinesses such as Don's.\n  For this reason, I ask my colleagues once again to sign on to this \namendment and to join me in voting with the same sort of bipartisan \nsupport that we have enjoyed the past two times this amendment has been \noffered and pass it as a statement of this body that we are going to be \nextra careful and take extra precautions and look for alternatives \nbefore we end up raising taxes on small businesses because that would \nbe exactly the wrong prescription for what ails this economy.\n  Finally, let me say I know the concerns the Budget chairman, the bill \nmanager, has on the privileged nature of this budget resolution. But I \nsuggest to him that this is something that if the amendment is passed, \nhe can take up, and the conference committee can take up and modify the \namendment while retaining its essential core principles and eliminate \nthe concerns the Parliamentarian has voiced about this being corrosive, \nif not fatal, to the privileged nature of the budget resolution.\n  So it is my hope, when we have an opportunity to vote on this, that \nwe will get a strong bipartisan statement out of the Senate that we are \nnot going to raise taxes on small businesses without at least the \ndeliberation required and the overwhelming vote of 60 Senators to do so \nbecause it would be exactly the wrong thing to do in this economic \ndownturn.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment creates the same issue the \nprevious amendment created, the Ensign amendment, and that is because \nit is overly prescriptive in terms of the Finance Committee, it puts at \nrisk the privileged status of the budget resolution. So I wish to make \na parliamentary inquiry.\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state the inquiry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry: If this amendment were adopted but \nnot brought back from conference committee, would the privileged status \nof the budget resolution remain intact?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank the Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. President, we have Senator Lincoln who will be on her way \nmomentarily, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 775\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I will soon call up amendment No. 775, \nwhich is one of the amendments I filed on the budget.\n  This is a simple amendment. It is to ask that we make an investment \nthat would reflect our Nation's commitment to the men and women serving \nin our Nation's Selected Reserve.\n  The amendment I offer with Senators Crapo and Klobuchar would create \nroom in the budget to ``enhance future GI Bill benefits for members of \nthe National Guard and Reserve by ensuring those benefits keep pace \nwith the national average cost of tuition.''\n  Since its inception in 1984, the Selected Reserve GI bill has served \nas an important tool for recruiting young men and women into the \nNational Guard and Reserves. Those who initially join for 6 years are \nautomatically entitled to these benefits and the current monthly rate \nof $329 for full-time study and training.\n  Unfortunately, however, Selected Reserve GI bill benefit rates are \nsimply not reflective of the critical role guardsmen and reservists \nplay in today's military. Since September 11, 2001, these benefits have \nincreased an average of less than 3 percent each year.\n  As so many people know, the Guard, Reserve, and Selected Reserve are \ndoing a tremendous duty now that is much different than what it was \npre-\n9/11.\n  They have also not kept pace with the Active-Duty GI bill benefit \nincreases--plunging in value from the historic benchmark of 48 percent \nof the Active-Duty GI bill to just 25 percent today.\n  By failing to make an appropriate investment in the men and women of \nour National Guard and Reserves, this trend sends a very poor message \nthat the Reserve component is being devalued.\n  Given the current economic climate, it is imperative we make a \ngreater investment in these fabulous men and women who serve us from \neach of our States in the Guard and Reserves. The rising price of \nhigher education, increases in the interest rates on student loans, and \nthe limited earnings ability of those with only high school credentials \nmake educational benefits a primary means of investing in our future. \nDuring tough economic times, they may also face increased competition \nfor financial aid dollars as our colleges and universities see more \napplicants.\n  As we know, an increasingly competitive job market encourages more \nhigh school graduates to pursue higher education rather than risk \nfinding stable employment. At the same time, more working adults are \ngoing back to school to gain additional skills to make them more \nmarketable. We want to encourage our Guard and Reserves, and we want to \nencourage our Selected Reservists to take advantage of educational \nopportunities to further their positions in the Guard and Reserves but \nalso to be able to further their positions in business and in industry \nand where they are going to be working in our communities.\n  Last year, Congress made a tremendous investment in our men and women \nin uniform by passing a 21st century GI bill that greatly expanded GI \nbill benefits and made college more affordable for servicemembers and \nveterans.\n  Senators Webb, Akaka, and others deserve our gratitude for their \ntremendous leadership on that issue.\n  For Active-Duty servicemembers and Reservists called to Active Duty \nfor more than 90 days, these benefits will be absolutely critical.\n  My State of Arkansas has recently welcomed home over 3,000 National \nGuardsmen from a 1-year tour in Iraq. For many of them, it was their \nsecond tour in just 3 years. I am proud we will be providing them with \neducation benefits that are more commensurate with their increased \nservice to our great Nation.\n  One of the provisions of the newly enhanced GI bill will tie the \nActive-Duty GI bill rate to the national average cost of tuition.\n  My amendment would simply create budget room to do the same thing for \nthe Selected Reserve GI bill. Therefore, when the national average cost \nof tuition increases, Selected Reserve GI bill rates would increase by \nthe same percentage, making sure they keep up as we move forward, as \nopposed to continually falling behind in their percentage rate toward \neducational benefits for the Selected Reserve.\n  This required increase is very modest. Yet it would send a powerful \nmessage to the men and women serving in our Nation's Selected Reserve.\n  Our military simply could not function without them--particularly in \ntoday's world. While those who are activated and sent overseas deserve \nour utmost respect and gratitude, we must also not forget the thousands \nof men and women at armories and bases all across our States who serve \na critical role in making sure other members of their units are \nqualified and ready to deploy.\n  They are the police officers, the doctors, the schoolteachers, the \nmayors, and the neighborhood pharmacists in communities across our \nNation.\n  Providing enhanced Selected Service GI bill benefits makes an \ninvestment in these men and women who are not only holding up the \neconomies in our local small communities across the States in this \ngreat Nation, but they are also willing to serve in a military fashion \nthat is much needed to back up those men and women who are deployed. It \nalso enhances the GI bill to more effectively serve as a recruitment \nand retention tool for our Armed Forces.\n  Ultimately, it enhances our Nation's competitiveness through the \ndevelopment of a more highly educated and productive workforce.\n  As the daughter of a Korean war veteran, who was an infantryman, I \nwas taught from an early age about the sacrifices our troops have to \nmake to keep our Nation free. I have been grateful all my life, and \ncontinue to be, as my colleagues are, for the service of so many of our \nbrave men and women, particularly from Arkansas and certainly across \nthe Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is the least we \ncan do for those to whom we owe so much and to reassure future \ngenerations that a grateful nation will provide for them should they \ndevote themselves to serving our Nation in uniform.\n  I appreciate the time I have had today to bring up this amendment. I \nlook forward to being able to talk on other amendments when the time is \navailable.\n  Mr. President, at this point, under the previous order, I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside in order to \ncall up my amendment No. 775.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] on behalf of \n     herself, Mr. Crapo, and Ms. Klobuchar, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 775.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To enhance future GI Bill benefits for members of the \n National Guard and Reserve by ensuring those benefits keep pace with \n                 the national average cost of tuition)\n\n       On page 41, line 24, insert after ``Indemnity \n     Compensation,'' the following: ``enhance servicemember \n     education benefits for members of the National Guard and \n     Reserve by ensuring those benefits keep pace with the \n     national average cost of tuition,''.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her amendment. It \nis a very well-thought-out amendment. We appreciate her raising it and \nit will be in order.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Arkansas has a \nsecond amendment. It is not formally in the queue, but she is free to \ntalk about it at this time. I am happy to yield her time to do that--to \ntalk about it at this time but not call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \nBudget Committee and the ranking member, Senator Gregg, for being so \nthoughtful in this debate. I continue to especially compliment the \nchairman on coming up with an incredible balance in the budget, having \nworked so hard to reflect what so many of us want to see and the \nPresident's priorities. I think he has has done a remarkable job \nfocusing on the priorities that many of us and the President feel are \nvery important to focus on now and to do it with such a fiscally \nresponsible as well as a very balanced approach. I think he has reached \na tremendous balance. I applaud him and his staff and all those who \nhave worked on this budget. I do believe they have come up with a good, \nsound proposal, something that reflects so much of what we want to see \nhappening in this great country.\n  I rise to support an amendment that I will be offering, which is \nfiled, but I will bring it up later. It will be offered on behalf of \napproximately 500,000 foster children across our Nation, and the \nfoster, kinship, and adoptive parents who play such a crucial role in \ntheir lives.\n  My amendment would create room in the budget for making improvements \nto our child welfare system and specifically for additional efforts to \nrecruit and retain more foster families.\n  I am so grateful to be joined in this effort by Senator Collins from \nMaine and Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, who have long been \ntremendous advocates on behalf of our Nation's foster children.\n  As we all know, our States face ongoing challenges in recruiting and \nretaining families to care for children in our foster care system. \nTragically, while the number of children coming into the system has \nincreased in recent years, the number of foster families has steadily \ndecreased. All anybody has to do is look at the economy around us. \nWorking families are struggling. Unfortunately, those hard-working \nfamilies, who are the diligent, giving souls who open their homes to \nfoster children to embrace and love them and to give them a home, are \nstruggling as much, if not more than, anybody else, and their ability \nto open their hearts and homes is being restricted by this economy.\n  With nearly 25 percent of families leaving the system each year, we \nsimply cannot sustain these losses. In my State of Arkansas, we are \ngrateful for our 1,200 foster families, but we desperately need more to \ncover the number of children in need.\n  Given the current economic climate, many of these parents, most of \nwhom are low- to middle-income families, have experienced tremendous \ndifficulties maintaining employment and providing for their families. \nThat makes them even more hesitant to take on the additional \nresponsibilities of caring for a foster child. This problem will only \nexacerbate unless we do something to stem the tide.\n  My amendment would allow for initiatives, such as the grant program \nprovided under the Resource Family Recruitment and Retention Act, a \nbipartisan bill I have introduced with six of my Senate colleagues.\n  Specifically, this grant program would provide States more \nopportunities to develop innovative methods of education and support \nfor resource families.\n  Among other demonstration projects, it would also allow States to \nestablish peer-to-peer support and mentoring groups; programs to \nprovide foster families with reliable and accessible respite care to \nhelp them avoid burnout. We are seeing, as they put more and more of \ntheir resources and energies and more and more of their hearts and \nsouls into wanting to reach out to foster children and bring them into \ntheir homes, a tremendous amount of burnout. We also want to train them \nto care for children with special needs, which is, again, a growing \nneed among foster children.\n  As lawmakers, it is our role to honor the critical role that foster \nfamilies play in the lives of foster youth and provide them with the \nservices and the support they need. Foster children seek nothing more \nthan a safe, loving, and permanent home, and resource families often \nhelp address this need. By strengthening efforts to recruit and retain \nthese families, we also enhance our best tool to recruit other families \nand retain prospective adoptive resources.\n  As Members of this body, we have an obligation to do right by those \nwe represent each and every day. We also have a moral obligation to do \neverything we can on behalf of the most vulnerable in our society.\n  For the over 500,000 children who are in foster care today, and many \nmore who are headed into the foster care system, the many thousands of \nfamilies who have provided them with the love and support they \ndesperately need, it is the least we can do.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in this effort to make sure we \nrecognize that in these difficult economic times, we have multitudes of \ngood American families, hard-working families who want to do what is \nright, who want to reach out and help these children who need a loving \nhome. We need to provide the help in order for them to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, we \nwould be amenable to taking both of the Senator's amendments by \nunanimous consent if she is amenable to that.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Absolutely. How grateful.\n  Mr. GREGG. Has the Senator called up her second amendment? I suggest \nshe call it up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 774\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I believe under the previous order I \nneed to also ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside in order to call up my second amendment, which is amendment No. \n774.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Ms. \n     Collins, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered \n     774.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a deficit-neutral reserve fund for improving child \n                                welfare)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, just to clarify the procedure, as I \nunderstand it, we will go to my amendment which deals with a task force \non how we deal with entitlement reform, tax reform, and the amendment \nafter that will be Senator Kyl's amendment on health care rationing. \nThen I think we take a break. I am not sure about that, but I believe \nthere will be a break. Then there will be a series of votes on the \npending amendments. After the votes--this is not in the form of a \nrequest; it is a statement of where we are--we will be going to Senator \nMcCain, who has an amendment. From there we still have not decided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I note that we also have a Shaheen \namendment after the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Should we lock that in? Can I get the chairman's \nattention? Can we lock in that order?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, why doesn't the Senator proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 835\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask the clerk to report my amendment. I \nask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. GREGG], for himself, \n     Mr. McConnell, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Martinez, \n     Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     835.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to address our \n                   Nations long term fiscal problems)\n\n       On page 49, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO ADDRESS OUR NATIONS \n                   LONG TERM FISCAL PROBLEMS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in this \n     resolution for one or more bills, joint resolutions, \n     amendments, motions, or conference reports that would \n     authorize the creation of a bipartisan task force to examine \n     the long term fiscal imbalances facing our Nation and directs \n     the bipartisan task force to report, with the majority \n     approval of each participating party, legislative \n     recommendations to address those imbalances, and provides \n     legislative fast track procedures to ensure a vote on the \n     legislative recommendations, by the amount provided in that \n     legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2019.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is actually a pretty significant \namendment. In fact, it is a very significant amendment if we are able \nto follow through on its purposes. It is something the chairman and I \nhave worked on a great deal for a number of years. I believe, and I \nthink I speak correctly that the chairman believes, our problems in \nthis Nation relative to the cost of the Government in the years to \ncome, especially as we move into the full retirement of the baby boom \npopulation, are extraordinary; that we are facing massive amounts of \nexpenditures to support the baby boom generation in retirement.\n  As we know, the baby boom generation essentially doubles from 35 \nmillion to 70 million. The cost of the entitlement programs that \nsupport that generation and others simply overwhelm the ability of the \nGovernment to pay those programs and forces us into a situation where \nthe debt of the Government will overwhelm our children.\n  The discussion on this issue has been broad and extensive in our \nNation, carried forward in large part by a number of citizen groups \nwhich are totally dedicated to trying to address constructive action in \nthis area, especially the Peterson Group, which is headed by the former \nComptroller General, David Walker.\n  This amendment is an attempt to start addressing that issue sooner \nrather than later through a task force procedure. But it is not your \ntypical task force. We have all seen commissions and task forces. In \nfact, on these specific issues--Medicare reform, Social Security \nreform, and tax reform--we have seen a lot of task forces. This is a \nlittle different--substantially very different.\n  Essentially, what this does is create a task force which is \nbipartisan so there can be no question about everybody being at the \ntable and everybody having a fair hearing of their views, which \ninvolves the players who are involved in the decision process--Members \nof Congress and members of the administration.\n  The idea is to set up a procedure where that task force reaches \nagreements, hopefully, on issues such as reforming Social Security, so \nwe continue to deliver high-quality Social Security benefits to our \nretirees, reforming Medicare along the same lines so people continue to \nget high-quality Medicare and health care who are retired, reforming \nour tax laws so we basically have the opportunity to make sure we have \na tax law that works for the Nation and produces the revenues we need.\n  It moves down the road, coming forward with policy in all those areas \nso those programs, specifically the entitlement side--Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid--become either solvent over their actuarial life \nor move dramatically down the road toward solvency.\n  The problem we have is those three programs alone--Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid--presently have an unfunded liability of $60 \ntrillion over their actuarial life. Mr. President, $60 trillion is a \nmassive amount. The goal is to try to reduce that unfunded liability in \na constructive way that allows the benefits to still be robust and \nreasonable, while the cost is affordable to the younger generation that \nhas to pay those benefits through their tax burden.\n  The reason we have chosen this procedure is that we have concluded \nthat if you put policy on the table initially, if you say, OK, we are \ngoing to change this element of Social Security or this element of \nMedicare or this element of tax law, there are constituencies in this \ncity who immediately surround you and start shooting at you for a \nvariety of reasons. Some genuinely disagree with the policy. Much of it \nis essentially the way Washington works. There are a lot of \nconstituency groups in the city that basically generate their revenues \nfrom the fact that they are able to create concern amongst the people \nwho participate in their group. And as a result of our putting a policy \non the table--somebody putting a policy on the table--they try to use \nthat as a mechanism to generate concern and raise money for their \norganization.\n  It has never worked. A lot of different people tried putting the \npolicy on the table first. All that happens is everybody goes to their \ncorners and starts shooting away. What we have concluded is we should \nhave a procedure that drives the policy, and it is a procedure that \nleads to policy action.\n  So this task force, which will be absolutely bipartisan in its \nmakeup, would be required to report in a way that is absolutely \nbipartisan, which is what is critical, so their report would be seen \nand would be actually fair and bipartisan. We would have a series of \ninitiatives, of policies, which would then come to the Congress and \nhave to be voted on with supermajorities. It would have to be voted on \nwhat is known as fast track around here, where there is no way to avoid \nvoting on it and where you cannot hide behind amendments. You actually \nhave to vote up or down on the various policies proposed by this task \nforce. Then, of course, it would go to the President. He would have the \nright to veto it if he did not like it, but it would get to the \nPresident because it would be a fast-track event. It would lead to \naction on these core issues that are really at the essence of our \nproblems as a society relative to going forward and being fiscally \nsound as a nation and also being able to take care of people who are \nretired and make sure our children have a nation they can afford and a \ngovernment they can afford. It is a pretty significant step if we were \nable to pursue this course.\n  I congratulate the chairman for being a force on this issue for many \nyears.\n  That is basically the amendment, which essentially says we want to \npursue that course of action. It, unfortunately, does not legally \ncreate this\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nevent because that type of an action would require legislation, and as \nthose who follow the budget process know, the budget is not signed by \nthe President. It is a resolution; it is not a bill. In order to \nexecute on this, it would require an actual piece of legislation signed \nby the President. But this amendment makes a fairly definitive \nstatement that this is the course of action we need to get about doing. \nWe do need to get about doing it. We do need to.\n  I think it is a positive statement on a very critical issue. If we \nwere to do this, if we were to actually pursue this initiative on a \ntask force as the chairman and I have talked about for a while, my \ngoodness, we would be doing good work for the American people. We \nreally would. We would be taking on what is so critical to making sure \nwe pass on to our kids a better nation.\n  I hope it will be supported. It has bipartisan support. My primary \ncosponsors are Senators Lieberman and Voinovich. I have been working \nwith the chairman. Hopefully, he is reasonably comfortable with it. As \nwe move down the road, hopefully we can accomplish this.\n  Mr. President, I ask of my time--not at this point, but at some point \ndown the road that is convenient to the chairman and myself in the \ndebate--that 5 minutes be reserved for the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nVoinovich, so he can speak on this matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a painful moment for me because I \nsubscribe to virtually every element of what Senator Gregg is \nproposing, with one exception. The exception is on page 2, this \nreference ``in this resolution for one or more bills, joint \nresolutions, amendments, motions, or conference reports that would \nauthorize the creation of a bipartisan task force to examine the long \nterm fiscal imbalances facing our Nation and directs the bipartisan \ntask force to report, with the majority approval of each participating \nparty. . . .''\n  That is something to which I have not agreed, could not agree. I \nthink that alters in a very significant way the dynamic.\n  Senator Gregg and I embarked on this effort several years ago. At \nthat point, with Republicans in control of the White House and \nDemocrats in control of the House and the Senate, we agreed to a \nformulation that the majority in the House would get four Members, the \nminority three, the same in the Senate, four and three, and there be \ntwo representatives of the administration. That is 16 in total, and it \nwould have been eight Democrats and eight Republicans.\n  The problem that has happened since--and it would take 12 of the 16 \nto report. That means you could have all the Democrats and half the \nRepublicans or vice versa. You could have all the Republicans and half \nthe Democrats, and with that number, you could bring the matter to the \nSenate for a vote.\n  What has happened in the interval? Democrats have captured control of \nthe White House, as well as increased the numbers in the House and the \nSenate. So now to have a requirement to have a majority approval of \neach participating party I think is unreasonable. I think it is \nunreasonable and is not in keeping with the formula to which we had \noriginally agreed.\n  Why is it unreasonable? Because Republicans don't have a majority in \nthe House or the Senate and don't control the White House, yet all of a \nsudden it takes a majority of them to agree on a solution for our long-\nterm fiscal problems. That just gives disproportionate power to the \nminority, and a minority that is not only a minority in the House and \nthe Senate but a party that does not control the White House either. So \nI could not support that. If that were not part of this, I would have a \ndifferent view because then it would be very much in line with what we \nhave talked about for several years.\n  Let me go to the basic concept because the basic concept I do \nsupport, the basic concept being that we have to have some special \nprocess in order to address these long-term fiscal imbalances. You are \nnever going to do it in a 5-year budget resolution. You can make a \ndownpayment there and you can certainly get going in the right \ndirection, which I think we do in this budget resolution, but Senator \nGregg, when he says you have to have a process to get to a policy, I \nbelieve, is exactly right. I don't believe anybody who leads with a \npolicy is going to get an answer here. I believe it is going to take a \nprocess to get there. But I think it has to be a process that \nrecognizes the political reality of this moment in time. At this moment \nin time, Democrats are in control of the White House as well as the \nHouse and the Senate. So to put in a clause that the bipartisan task \nforce, in order to report, has to have majority approval of each \nparticipating party simply goes beyond what I have agreed to in the \npast or what I could agree to now. So I would be constrained to object \nto the passage of this proposal as written.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would just note on this number--because \nthe number is important--that I disagree with the logic here that the \nchairman has put forth because the purpose is bipartisanship. It is not \nthat one party controls the Government or the other party controls the \nGovernment; the whole purpose here is to get bipartisanship so that the \nAmerican people are confident that whatever this task force reports is \nfair because this task force is going to have very significant \nauthority and extra legislative authority, and it is not going to work \nunless people are comfortable.\n  Regrettably, under the format the chairman is talking about, you \nwould only need two of the six Republicans. There would only be 6 of \nthe 16 who would be Republicans, and only 2 would have to vote with the \nmajority in order to report it, and that means that doesn't work. You \ndon't end up with bipartisanship that way, I don't think. That is why a \nmajority vote means you would have to have four of the six Republicans \nvote with it, and one presumes that is not going to be the problem. \nHopefully, all 6 and all 10--all 16--will be voting for whatever the \nproposal is.\n  You can't create a situation where one side will be viewed as having \nthe capacity to roll the other side within this task force. That is the \nopposite of the purpose of a task force. That is why we went to this \nproposal. In fact, the original concept was 16--8 and 8--back when the \nDemocratic Party controlled the Congress and we controlled the \nadministration, and with the 8 and 8 split, it took 4 members of either \nparty--half of either party's membership on the task force--to vote for \nit. So that concept of having a commitment of the membership from both \nsides to the bill--at least the majority of both sides--is something we \nhave actually had in the past.\n  In any event, I would regret it if the chairman opposes this because \nI think it will undermine our ability to move forward. But I see \nSenator Kyl is here, and he has the next amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just to review the history, because I \ndon't agree with what was just described, in our original formulation \nit was 16, and 14 were Members of Congress, with the majority in the \nSenate getting 4 Members, the minority 3; the same in the House, the \nmajority 4, the minority 3; two representatives of the administration, \nwhich was then the Bush administration. That meant 16 in total--8 \nDemocrats and 8 Republicans--and it would take 12 to issue a report, 12 \nof the 16. That meant, at that time, that you could have all Democrats \nand half the Republicans or all the Republicans and half the Democrats.\n  Now fast-forward to this year. In our negotiations, despite the fact \nthat our previous formula, instead of producing an 8-8, would now \nproduce 10-6 Democrats to Republicans because the Democrats have just \nwon the White House and the White House was to have two \nrepresentatives, I agreed to alter that and to go from 10-6 Democrats \nto Republicans to 9-6 Democrats to Republicans but still have 12 to \nreport. That would still mean you would have to have at least half of \nthe Republicans. If you had all the Democrats, you would still have to \nhave half of the Republicans. That, to me, is absolutely in keeping \nwith what we had agreed to previously, where there were 16, it would \ntake 12 to report, and since there were 8 Democrats and 8 Republicans, \nyou would have to have at least half the Republicans, or if you had all \nthe Republicans, you would have to have at least half the Democrats.\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\n  So I could not agree, and I just think, look, Democrats are never \ngoing to agree on a formulation, when they control the Senate, they \ncontrol the House of Representatives, and they control the White House, \nDemocrats are never going to agree that each party has to have a \nmajority approval. I would never agree to that. I don't think it \nreflects the political reality that exists today. So I would \nreluctantly oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I think we are now at the time that we could go to \nSenator Kyl.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the chairman, and I ask unanimous consent to lay \naside the pending amendment for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 793\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, at this time, I call up amendment No. 793, \nrelating to comparative effectiveness research.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 793.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To protect all patients by prohibiting the use of data \n obtained from comparative effectiveness research to deny coverage of \nitems or services under Federal health care programs and to ensure that \n    comparative effectiveness research accounts for advancements in \n    genomics and personalized medicine, the unique needs of health \n disparity populations, and differences in the treatment response and \n                 the treatment preferences of patients)\n\n       On page 31, line 9, insert ``does not curb growth in health \n     care spending by using data obtained from comparative \n     effectiveness research to deny coverage of items or services \n     under Federal health care programs, ensures that comparative \n     effectiveness research accounts for advancements in genomics \n     and personalized medicine, the unique needs of health \n     disparity populations, and differences in the treatment \n     response and the treatment preferences of patients, and'' \n     after legislation.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Actually, Mr. President, the amendment is about as long as \nit took me to say that, but I will describe it nonetheless.\n  I hope this amendment will receive very strong bipartisan support \nbecause the entire essence of it is to ensure that nothing we have done \nso far here will allow health care in the United States to be rationed \nby the Federal Government. There is a reason for the concern, and I \nwould like to discuss it.\n  First, of course, I would note that protecting the doctor-patient \nrelationship and ensuring access to the highest quality medical care is \nfundamental to any health care reform effort. Comparative effectiveness \nresearch can be used to provide patients and doctors with information \nso that they may make informed health care decisions. For example, a \nstudy might compare a drug versus a surgery and determine that the drug \nis just as effective or even better at improving a patient's quality of \nlife. But without appropriate safeguards, the Government may misuse \ncomparative effectiveness research as a tool to ration or deny health \ncare, and since private insurers tend to follow the Federal \nGovernment's lead, this has significant implications for all patients.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009--more commonly \nknown as the stimulus bill--included $1.1 billion for comparative \neffectiveness research, and it created a national board called the \nFederal Coordinating Council to oversee that research. We all know the \nstimulus bill was written quickly and passed quickly and unfortunately, \nbecause of the phrasing there, we believe, could lead to unintended \nconsequences. For example, nothing in the stimulus bill prevents the \nGovernment from using the $1.1 billion to compare the cost of health \ncare treatments, even though the chairman of the Finance Committee \ntried to prevent that, nor would it prevent the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services from using the research to deny coverage of a health \ncare treatment, or reject a one-size-fits-all approach to medicine, or \nprotect advancements in genomics and personalized medicine, or require \nthe Government to consider differences in patient treatment response or \npreferences, or account for the unique needs of health disparity \npopulations--frequently minority populations.\n  Some may say: Oh, we will never ration health care in America. Well, \ndon't take my word; take the word of our former colleague, Tom Daschle, \nwho wrote a book. In his book, ``Critical: What We Can Do About the \nHealth Care Crisis,'' he recommends that the United States follow the \nlead of other countries and use this cost-based research--the very \nresearch funded by the stimulus bill--to limit patients' access to \ncare. And here is what he acknowledges in his book:\n\n       Doctors and patients might resent any encroachment on their \n     ability to choose certain treatments, even if they are \n     expensive or ineffective compared to alternatives.\n\n  Well, you are darned right they might resent it. Think about this a \nmoment: Do you want Washington bureaucrats, such as those who brought \nyou the AIG mess, making your health care decisions for you and your \nfamily? The answer, of course, is no, no rationing of health care.\n  Well, what is the real issue here? In February, the Wall Street \nJournal ran a story that chronicled patients' experiences with Canadian \nhealth care, which is a good comparison of what happens when government \nmakes these kinds of decisions I am talking about. Let me share one of \nthose stories:\n\n       In March 2005, Shona Holmes began losing her vision and \n     experiencing headaches, anxiety attacks, extreme fatigue, and \n     weight gain. An MRI showed that she had a brain tumor. The \n     government told her that she would need to wait months before \n     she could see a specialist about the brain tumor. By June, \n     her vision had deteriorated so severely that she traveled to \n     the Mayo Clinic in Arizona. The doctors told her that she \n     needed immediate surgery to prevent permanent vision loss and \n     potentially death. But the Canadian Government's solution was \n     more doctors' appointments, more tests, more waiting time. \n     Left with very few options, Ms. Holmes traveled back to \n     Arizona and paid for her surgery out of her own pocket and \n     had the necessary surgery.\n\n  In the British health care system, we have heard similar stories. \nThey have an entity called NICE, which actually does the rationing, but \nit is not so nice. Take the word of the British Government Web site \nthat describes the rationale for their rationing of health care:\n\n       With the rapid advancements in modern medicine, most people \n     accept that no publicly funded health care system can \n     possibly pay for every new medical treatment which becomes \n     available. The enormous costs involved mean that choices have \n     to be made. It makes sense to focus on treatments that \n     improve the quality and/or length of someone's life and,--\n\n  And I stress this part, Mr. President----\n\n     at the same time, are an effective use of NHS resources.\n\n  That is the national health care service resources. They go on:\n\n       Each drug is considered on a case-by-case basis. Generally, \n     however, if a treatment costs more than 20,000 to 30,000 \n     pounds--\n\n  And that is an equivalent of 28,000 to 43,000 in U.S. dollars----\n\n     per quality adjusted life year, then it would not be \n     considered cost effective.\n\n  So in other words, the British Government, not physicians and \npatients, sets the rules and makes health care decisions. And the \nBritish formula, in U.S. dollars, is that an extra year of your life is \nestimated to be worth no more than $28,000 to $43,000. So if the \ntreatment exceeds that, you are out of luck. The Government decides \nwhether your treatment is an effective use of its resources and puts a \nprice tag on what an extra year of your life is worth.\n  This budget lays the foundation for doing precisely the same thing in \nthe United States. Our view and the public's view is that the \nGovernment should not make these decisions. Only patients, in \nconsultation with their physicians, should make these kinds of health \ncare decisions about their lives.\n  Those decisions should not be dictated by a formula based upon \nGovernment research.\n  I would also just add this point. Cost-based research applied this \nway can be very shortsighted. It leads to a one-size-fits-all approach \nto medicine that\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\nstandardizes care for diverse patients who may have the same medical \ncondition, which is completely contradictory to the efforts of today's \nleading scientists. Scientists--for example those at TGen in my home \nState of Arizona--are exploring exciting advancements in genomics and \npersonalized medicine; in other words, the right drug for the right \npatient at the right time.\n  Personalized medicine will offer an entirely new approach to \nmedicine, including more accurate assessments of disease risk, better \npredictions of response to treatment, and safe, more effective \ntreatments. This research will lead to better health care for all \npatients and long-term savings in the cost of health care.\n  Unfortunately, the stimulus bill was written in such a way that it \ndoes not incorporate targeting therapies, and it could stall \ninnovation. I believe this is our opportunity to act to ensure that no \nWashington bureaucrat makes health care decisions for patients or \nundermines the sacred doctor-patient relationship. Already our own U.S. \nGovernment is taking steps toward this result.\n  Last Thursday, the acting National Institutes of Health Director \nannounced that the NIH may use the stimulus money to compare the cost \nof health care treatments. In fact, NIH released a list of research \ntopic areas, many of which include a cost component. One of the topics \nis entitled ``Integrating Cost-Effectiveness Analysis into Clinical \nResearch.'' Here is how the description reads. This should be chilling.\n\n       [T]his initiative calls for the inclusion of rigorous cost-\n     effectiveness analysis in the design and testing of new and \n     innovative interventions. . . . Cost-effectiveness research \n     will provide accurate and objective information to guide \n     future policies that support the allocation of health \n     resources for the treatment of acute and chronic diseases.\n\n  The allocation of health resources is, of course, a euphemism for \nrationing. So this is not hypothetical. This is what our own Government \nproposes to do with this research. For some of the sickest patients \nsuffering from chronic diseases, the Government wants to decide if \ntheir treatment is a good allocation of resources. It is clear that if \nCongress fails to protect patients, then comparative research will be \nused as a tool to ration care.\n  For this reason I have offered this pro-patient amendment that would \nsend a clear message to the administration and clarify the Senate's \nintent regarding the stimulus funding. My amendment States two \nprinciples: No. 1, the Federal Government shall not use the data \nobtained from comparative effectiveness research to deny coverage of a \nhealth care treatment under a Federal health care program--very \nsimple--and, No. 2, the Federal Government shall ensure that such \nresearch accounts for advancements in genomics and personalized \nmedicine, the unique needs of health disparity populations, and \ndifferences in the treatment response and treatment preferences of \npatients.\n  We all agree with that. My amendment puts patients first. It is a \nnonpartisan issue. I do not know of anyone in this body who wants the \nGovernment to ration care or stifle innovation. I believe in the right \nof every American to choose the doctor, hospital, or health plan of \ntheir choice. No Washington bureaucrat should interfere with that right \nor substitute the Government's judgment for that of a physician.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in standing for patients--all of us \nin America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today as a cosponsor and in \nsupport of the amendment offered by my friend from Arizona, Senator \nKyl. I thank the Senator for introducing the amendment on behalf of \nhealth care providers not only in Arizona and Kansas but all across the \ncountry, and, as a result, the patients they serve.\n  I think we all know we have marching orders, if I can describe it \nthat way, from the administration and from others to complete health \ncare reform this year. But the President has been a little vague about \nwhat he envisions, stating that he will leave the details to the \nCongress, and the devil is, indeed, in those details. Senator Kyl has \ncertainly pointed out one of the details that has to be fixed.\n  Let me be clear. I am not opposed to health care reform. I don't know \nwho would be opposed to health care reform. But we must beware of what \nlurks under the banner of reform. I do support, as do many others, a \nsystem of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans. But I \ndo not support a system that replaces the judgment of your doctor with \nthat of a government agency, as described so ably by Senator Kyl. For \nthis reason I share the concern of the Senator regarding the \nimplementation of something called comparative effectiveness research. \nI wish more of my colleagues were in the Chamber to listen to this--\nlisten to the description of what could happen in regards to something \ncalled comparative effectiveness research. The acronym for that, by the \nway, is CER.\n  This gets in the woods of health care reform. Comparative \neffectiveness research, or CER, is simply research that compares the \neffectiveness of two or more health care services or treatments. CER is \nnot necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it has the potential to provide \nbenefits to medical science and also, obviously, to patients. However, \nwith CER policy--again, the devil is in the details. When discussing \nthe details of comparative effectiveness research, we need to focus on \nanother term, ``least costly alternative.'' This is where comparative \neffectiveness research has the potential to have a huge and negative \nimpact on patient and doctor choice.\n  If comparative effectiveness research is used to deem two health care \nservices or treatments to be interchangeable, then CMS, within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, will be able to invoke the \nleast costly alternative to only reimburse the health care provider \nbased on the cost of the cheapest treatment.\n  One need not look any further than the Congressional Budget Office's \nBudget Options, Volume I, Health Care, written under the direction of \nOMB Director Orszag, to see that the use of least costly alternative \nauthority to restrict doctors' decisions and ration health care is \nclearly on the table.\n  Here is a good example. One of the CBO health care budget options \ndiscussed the savings that could be realized if CMS applied Medicare's \nleast costly alternative policy to include something called \nviscosupplements. You use viscosupplements to treat a degenerative \njoint disease of the knees called osteoarthritis. A lot of Senators \nhave knee problems--not only weak knees but sometimes knees that need a \nlittle help. So even though CBO recognizes that there may be \njustifiable reasons your doctor would choose to provide one \nviscosupplement over another to help your knees, this option would \nallow the Government to use least costly alternative authority to \ninterfere with and restrict your doctors's decision. This is very \ndangerous territory.\n  Rather than having to depend on the rigorous clinical trials \nconducted by the Food and Drug Administration, the CMS could use the \nmuch lower bar of comparative effectiveness research to declare that \nthe two treatments are interchangeable and thus can be subject to the \nleast costly alternative policy.\n  This type of Government interference in the doctor-patient \ndecisionmaking process ignores the very large and important differences \nthat exist among people, among patients--I think that should be \nobvious--in favor of a one-size-fits-all health care solution that \ncould and would lead to rationing of health care.\n  Let this be a warning to all patients, all doctors, all hospitals, \nall nurses, all ambulance providers, all pharmacists, all home health \ncare providers--all of the people who provide health care throughout \nAmerica, rural and urban. You are on notice that this policy \ncombination--comparative effectiveness research and least costly \nalternative--may be the Holy Grail of cost containment at the expense \nof patient care. That is what Senator Kyl's amendment gets at.\n  My colleague's amendment prohibits the use of comparative \neffectiveness research to deny coverage of health care treatments under \na Federal health program. It requires that comparative effectiveness \nresearch take into account\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\nthe individuals and their treatment responses and their preferences, \nand it does protect doctor and patient sovereignty over health care \ndecisions.\n  For these reasons I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Kyl \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, when I hear the description of this \namendment given by our colleagues on the other side, and then I read \nit--to me, there is a bit of a disconnect. I don't see comparative \neffectiveness. I have been involved in writing comparative \neffectiveness legislation with the chairman of the Finance Committee. I \ndon't see that as having anything to do with rationing. I don't see \nthat has having anything to do with rationing.\n  Comparative effectiveness research is really to determine what works \nin health care. It helps ascertain what are the treatment regimes that \nare most effective at treating different disease states. It is the \nscientific process.\n  It is exactly what happened in the revolution of modern medicine at \nJohns Hopkins back in the early 1900s, in the 19-teens, with respect to \nthe application of the scientific method to medicine, to test what \nactually works because one of the things we know in medicine today is \nthat we are using many strategies that simply are not effective--and \nthat is in no one's interest. That is certainly not in the patient's \ninterest. It is not in a hospital's interest or a clinic's interest.\n  What comparative effectiveness research is designed to do, at least \nthat which the chairman of the Finance Committee and I have been \ninvolved in, is to get the research done and then get the information \nin the hands of caregivers and patients so they can make a \ndetermination as to what is the best course for treatment. It has \nnothing to do with our efforts in rationing health care--nothing at \nall.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee is here, and I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we in Congress this year are embarked on \nmajor efforts to enact health care reform. It is very much in the \nPresident's budget. President Obama very much wants to enact health \ncare reform this year. There are provisions in the budget resolution to \nencourage us as a body, a Congress, to enact health care reform.\n  The basic reason is because it is so needed. It is incredibly \nimportant that our Nation enact health care reform this year. I am not \ngoing to get into all the details and the various provisions that we \nmust enact in order to get meaningful health care reform. By meaningful \nhealth care reform, I mean controlling costs. I remind my colleague, we \nin America spend about $2.5, $2.6 trillion on health care. That is this \nyear. If we do not do anything, those costs are going to almost double \nin 6 to 8 years.\n  We can't continue to spend what we do on health care. We spend almost \ntwice as much as the next most expensive country. It is a huge cost of \nbusiness. It is a very big cost to American business. American \ncompanies are becoming less competitive. Why? Because health care costs \nare too high; business costs are too high.\n  In addition, look at our Medicare budget. It is going out of sight. \nIf we do nothing, if we don't curb our underlying Medicare budget \ncosts, our budget, along with Medicaid, will probably double in another \n8 or 9 or 10 years. That is unsustainable, to say nothing about \nindividual costs to individual Americans, the personal costs, the \nfamily costs, the premium costs. We don't have a system in this \ncountry. We have a hodgepodge of lots of different functions--doctors, \nnurses, insurance companies, medical equipment suppliers, PMDs--\neverything is part of the system, and they are all trying to help \nsupply health care, but because it is so disjointed we have a nonsystem \nwhere costs are just rising exponentially. We also have a nonsystem \nwhere 46 million Americans don't have health insurance, and about 25 \nmillion additional Americans are underinsured. It is ridiculous. This \nis the only industrialized country without health insurance. What we \nneed is a solution which is uniquely an American solution.\n  We are not Canada, we are not Great Britain, we are not France, we \nare not Sweden, we are the United States of America. By ``uniquely \nAmerican,'' I mean it should be a combination of public and private. \nThat $2.6 trillion we spend today is divided half in private and half \nin public. We must find a way to curb costs, to get coverage to \nAmericans retaining that uniquely American approach of private and \npublic coverage.\n  We are working hard to try to find that solution. Part of the \nsolution is reducing unnecessary costs and waste in our system. There \nis immense waste in the American health care system--immense waste. \nBasically, it is because of practice patterns, it is because of the way \nwe reimburse on volume and quantity, not quality.\n  We have to move much more toward reimbursement; that is, paying \ndoctors and hospitals on the basis of quality, not volume, and concepts \nsuch as bundling and medical home and health IT, which is in the \nbudget, so we have information technology assistance to help, in \nseveral years, get to the point where we reduce health care cost.\n  But another is, frankly, comparative effectiveness. We need to know \nthe comparative effectiveness of drugs, procedures, medical equipment, \net cetera, so we get the best, highest quality, and we, therefore, will \nprobably know which ones will tend to cost more than others. Doctors \ncan make choices, patients can make choices, and insurance companies \ncan make choices as to which procedure, which drug makes more sense. \nBasically, it is up to the doctor to decide which way makes the most \nsense.\n  Now, the effect of the Kyl amendment, as I understand, is, frankly, \nto say that you have to pay for a very costly procedure that somebody \ndeems to be not only ineffective, it may be harmful, and you have to \npay for it. That does not make sense. Rather, I think the Senator from \nArizona agrees with me, we are trying to figure out a way to use \ncomparative effectiveness to help doctors have more information, and \nhospitals more information, as to which works better, has higher \nquality, and works better when compared to something else.\n  We are going to have to get into issues such as evidence-based \nmedicine to help determine quality. Lots of concepts here that make a \nlot of sense. But I wished to say that whereas the intention--I \nsomewhat understand the intention of the amendment, somewhat. I do not \nentirely understand the intention of the amendment.\n  But the effect of the amendment is to say that a procedure--let me \nget this straight. The language does not curb growth in health care \nspending by using data obtained by comparative effectiveness. It says \nthere can be a procedure determined to be totally ineffective or may be \nharmful, but it has to be used. The doctor has to use it. That does not \nmake sense.\n  I think it is a doctor's choice as to whether, by looking at the \nvarious procedures, what makes more sense compared to something else, \nusing the data we provide by this process. But that is still a doctor's \nchoice. That doctor, he or she, that doctor should decide which of \nthese makes the most sense.\n  Therefore, I think it makes much more sense, frankly, that this not \nbe approved. It is not necessary. It kind of gets in the way.\n  Senator Hatch and I and Senators Grassley and Enzi are introducing a \ncomparative effectiveness amendment. It gets to what I think the \nSenator from Arizona wants us to move toward; that is, comparative \neffectiveness, where we look at comparative quality of procedures, \nwhich is what we are trying to do--not cost but quality.\n  There was a big dustup in the stimulus debate about comparative \neffectiveness because somebody thought we were putting a cost-benefit \nanalysis in it. We are not. We took that out. I must say to my friends, \nI went to the mat, frankly, to make sure cost was taken out. We took it \nout. It is just comparing quality.\n  The bill I hope to introduce--working to get support from Senators \nGrassley, Hatch, and Enzi--would take cost out. It is just looking at \nquality. That is what we want to do. It is based on quality.\n  I think the Senator from Arizona will be very happy with that bill we \nare going to be introducing because it gets\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nat what I think the Senator wants: Let's compare quality, but let's not \nput the cost component into it because that would not be appropriate at \nthis time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, if I might, what we would like to do is \nget a unanimous consent agreement. Would Senator Baucus want more time \non this matter?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl have an \nadditional minute, that Senator Coburn have an additional 5 minutes. \nThat would take us to close to 1 o'clock. I ask Senator Isakson, how \nmuch time would he need to call up his amendment? One minute. Then we \nwould go to Senator Isakson for 1 minute to call up his amendment. Then \nwe would go to Senator Shaheen. Senator Shaheen would have 20 minutes \nequally divided. Then we will make a further determination at that \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. The chairman of the Finance Committee raised two points. I \nwish to make very clear that nothing in this amendment deals with the \nquestion of patient safety. For example, if FDA says a drug is not \nefficacious, then obviously you do not prescribe the drug. The doctor \nmakes that decision. As the chairman said, it is the doctor's choice. \nThat is precisely where we want to leave it.\n  The other question was, though: It is not necessary, it will just get \nin the way, nobody is intending to do that.\n  There are two responses to that. First of all, if nobody is intending \nto do it, then there is no problem in saying you cannot do it.\n  But, secondly, they are intending to do it. Here is a direct \nquotation from the Acting Director of the NIH less than 1 week ago.\n  Cost effectiveness research will provide accurate and objective \ninformation to guide future policies that support the allocation of \nhealth resources for the treatment of acute and chronic diseases.\n  That is the purpose of it. It is not merely to decide what works, \nwhich is the good side of cost-effectiveness research, but to allocate \nhealth care resources. Allocating health care resources is another way \nof saying rationing of health care. If we all agree we do not want \nthat, and we do not think anybody is going to try to do it, then what \nis the harm in having an amendment that says we are not going to do it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, as somebody who is still practicing \nmedicine, I wish to tell you, we see comparative effectiveness every \nday. We cannot even get recertified unless we know comparative \neffectiveness.\n  The NIH last year spent $267 million on comparative effectiveness \nresearch, not associated with cost but based on quality outcomes. What \nis in this bill is a short-term look to say who is going to cookie-\ncutter cut a way to practice medicine that a bureaucrat will say is the \nbest way, rather than what the science says.\n  There is no question we have tons of waste. The biggest inhibition \nfor anybody getting into the health care system today is cost. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee is right, there is tons of waste. The \nreason there is tons of waste is 61 percent of the health care in this \ncountry is controlled by the Government today.\n  I can document it fully, each component of it, 61 percent. It is \ndesigned to create the mess we are in. If you want to change this \nsystem to where we get better value for the dollars we put into health \ncare, let's create a clear, transparent, competitive market where you \nknow quality and you know cost before you ever enter it. That is a goal \nwe can all agree on.\n  We should know what it costs, and we know what the quality parameters \nshould be. What comparative effectiveness as outlined by the acting \nhead of the NIH is, what is the cheapest treatment we can do to get it \nthere? Not what is best for the patient in consideration of that \npatient's particular needs and what is the best thing the doctor could \nrecommend.\n  There are conflicts of interest. I do not deny that. Here is the No. \n1 thing that comparative effectiveness fails to remember: Everybody \nthinks we can take the science over here and we can fix everybody. \nWell, I have news for you. Medicine is 40 percent art. Since we will \nnot pay for physicians and providers to take the time to listen to \ntheir patients, to actually know what is going on with them, we have \ncreated a system where we spend a ton of money that does not have \nanything to do with a better outcome for the patients.\n  Two examples. Two patients in the last 4 years in my own practice, \ndenied, under comparative effectiveness, MRIs; did not have a hard sign \nat all, had soft signs. Both of them had cancer of the brain. Both \ninsurance companies and Medicare denied that they needed an MRI because \nit did not match with the guidelines.\n  That goes to show you that when you just use guidelines, you are not \ngoing to really care for the patients. The art of medicine has to be \nincluded. Comparative effectiveness never considers the art of \nmedicine. That is 40 percent of taking care of people and giving them \ngreat health care and great outcomes. This amendment is a good \namendment. The reason it should be there is we seek comparative \neffectiveness. You cannot get reboard certified unless you know \ncomparative effectiveness, at every chance, at every corner, for every \ndisease.\n  Do we need more? Yes. But we are spending billions every year on \ncomparative effectiveness research. We finished a 7-year study on the \nheart. You know what it told us after we spent $100 million on that \nstudy? We do not have the answer on which is the best. A double-blind, \nprogressive, controlled study, and we do not have the answer. What \nmakes us think some bureaucrats can take less research and come to a \nbetter conclusion than the best scientists in this country? What we are \nlooking for is an answer in the wrong place.\n  The way we fix health care in this country is to truly allow doctor \nand patient relationships that will take advantage of the scientific \nadvances that are out there and do so in a transparent way, where you \nknow quality and you know price.\n  It is called performance for pay, rather than pay for performance. If \nyou perform, you get paid more. If you do not perform, you do not. We \napply market forces to everything we are doing, much less so since the \nnew administration came in, but if we would apply that, we would have a \ntremendous advantage in terms of quality outcomes in this country.\n  I support the amendment and yield back the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 762\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and the clerk report amendment No. 762.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 762.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 762) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for providing a \nnonrefundable Federal income tax credit for the purchase of a principal \n                   residence during a 1-year period)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. --.

Madam President, I have 1 minute. I spoke last night at \nlength about this amendment, so I will not take the Senate's time \nagain. I know Senator Shaheen is about to offer her amendment.\n  But this is an amendment that carves out a deficit-neutral reserve in \nthe budget in order to fund a $15,000 tax credit for the purchase of a \nsingle-family home in America.\n  That is an amendment the Senate passed, the House rejected but is a \npending bill before the Senate. This would reserve that money in the \naccount, so that if the bill is passed, it can be paid for, and it is a \ndeficit-neutral amount.\n  At an appropriate time, I will ask for the support of the Members.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 835\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise to support Senator Gregg's \namendment to create a deficit-neutral reserve fund for the creation of \na task force to address tax entitlement reform and reduce our Nation's \nlong-term fiscal gap.\n  The amendment would fund a vehicle to examine our tax and entitlement \nsystems and present long-term solutions to place the Senate on a \nfiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of our entitlement \nprograms for future generations.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have introduced a very similar amendment, and \nI understand that Senator Lieberman is going to be willing to support \nthis amendment. I am not going to go into detail. The chairman and the \nranking member of the Budget Committee have laid out in very \nfrightening terms where we are in terms of our deficits and our \nnational debt.\n  Frankly, I have been talking about this since I have come to the \nSenate in 1999. I said we have to do something about this growing debt \nthat is blossoming. Now we are talking about the possibility of it \ndoubling in the next 5 years. So we have to get at entitlements and tax \nreform.\n  The thing that is encouraging to me is, there is legislation I am \nintroducing in the Senate that has been introduced in the House. It is \ncalled the SAFE Commission. It is sponsored by 52 House Members, 26 \nRepublicans, 26 Democrats. It has the support of the Business \nRoundtable, the Heritage Foundation, the Concord Coalition, the \nPeterson Foundation. They have all voiced support.\n  What we are trying to do with this amendment to the budget is to have \nan acknowledgement of the fact that money is set aside to fund a \ncommission that will be set up.\n  I am hoping my colleagues don't get involved in one of these, ``Well, \nI don't like the language of this,'' because we haven't gotten to the \nlanguage yet. I am saying to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle and on my side that we have to negotiate the kind of vehicle we \nare going to use. Two years ago, the vehicle we had had more \nRepublicans than Democrats because we controlled the Presidency, the \nHouse, and the Senate. The new legislation coming out, that I will \nsupport, will have more Democrats because the Democrats have the \nPresidency and the Senate and the House. It does provide that in order \nto get something, it be fast-tracked. They spend, say, 6 months looking \nat it and come up with tax and entitlement reform. They send it on an \nexpedited procedure to the House and Senate. Before they do that, they \nhave to have 75 percent of the people supporting it, and you have to \nhave at least two Republicans. That does bring in minority \nparticipation.\n  What I am afraid of is that I have heard Senator Conrad say: I don't \nlike the idea that it has to be even-steven. The main thing is, I would \nlike the Senate to go on record that we will create a fund that will \nfund a commission that will finally get to the entitlement problem we \nhave had now for a long time. The bottom line is, we have this \navalanche that has hit us. We are in trouble. But at the same time, \nunderlying that, we have the problem of this long-term national debt. \nEverybody is aware of the challenge.\n  Recently, Premier Wen pointed out that he is concerned about what we \nare doing. Europe is concerned about what we are doing. Canada is \nworried about it. They are saying: You folks haven't been willing to \ntake on your entitlement and tax reform. What bothers me is that if we \ndon't deal with this and our neighbors start to get leery of what we \nare doing, we could see interest rates skyrocket because everybody \nacknowledges that as long as we are getting money from China, Japan, \nand the OPEC nations, we will be able to borrow money at a cheap rate. \nBut if they lose confidence that we have not been willing to stand and \ndo what we are supposed to, that could change dramatically.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this not as we are drafting the \nlegislation. What we are saying is, we acknowledge there is a problem \nthat needs to be dealt with. Peter Orszag understands there is a \nproblem. He was with this effort 2 years ago. Now he has been ``I am \nnot sure how we want to do this.'' All I would like to do is to come in \nwith a bipartisan commission that says: We are willing to tackle this. \nGive it to the administration and say: If you don't like it, what is \nbetter than what we have?\n  We have to get going on this. We cannot keep putting it under the \nrug. We need to deal with it.\n  I have a lot of other words to speak today, but I hope I get the \nmessage across to everyone that all we are basically doing is setting \naside money to pay for a commission, the complexity of which and the \nrules of which are something we will have to try and come up with a \ncompromise on. We have an amendment, Senator Lieberman and I, that is \nless restrictive than Senator Gregg's. Apparently, that language \nbothers Senator Conrad. All I know is, I would like us to go on record \nthat we know there is a problem. We know we can't get it done in the \nregular order doing tax reform and entitlement reform. We need a \ncommission to take it on as we did with Social Security. They took it \non. We got together, came back with a recommendation, and got it done.\n  I urge colleagues to look at the big picture and not get tied in with \nthis is a Republican thing or a Democratic thing. It is a problem for \nAmerica. It is a Republican and Democratic problem. It is America's \nproblem. We have to do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nKaufman and Mikulski be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, my amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. It would establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to \nmonitor FHA-approved loans. The Federal Housing Administration, the \nFHA, plays an increasingly critical role in promoting home ownership \nduring these tough economic times. The FHA insures one-third of all new \nmortgages. The number of FHA-approved lenders has doubled in the past 2 \nyears. However, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has not \nreceived additional resources to expand its efforts to investigate \nclaims of fraud.\n  Recent reports of a rise in borrowers who haven't made even one \npayment suggest that fraudulent activity has increased among FHA-backed \nloans. Should that activity continue to increase, FHA and its critical \nwork could be put at risk. As we all know, in the runup to the subprime \ncrisis, many fraudulent lenders pushed borrowers into mortgages and \nrefinancings that they could not afford just to collect the commissions \nand fees. We need to make sure we prevent that activity from migrating \nto federally insured loans which would put taxpayers at risk for \nfooting the bill of another bailout. This amendment addresses the need \nfor HUD to properly investigate and remove fraudulent lenders from the \nprogram wherever appropriate. It creates a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund--a deficit-neutral fund--to increase the capacity of the inspector \ngeneral of Housing and Urban Development to investigate cases of fraud \nof FHA loans.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will join in this effort and support my \namendment. As we all know, at this critical time when we are trying to \nmake sure there are stimulus funds available and that we are doing all \nwe can in Government to support the ability of the private sector to \nrespond to this economic decline we are in, we need to make sure we \nhave the oversight capability to run programs as effectively and \nefficiently as possible. That is what this amendment would help \naccomplish.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 844\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in a few moments I am going to send an \namendment to the desk. It is on its way over here right now. I would \nlike to speak about it for a few minutes until it arrives, at which \npoint I will ask to set aside the pending amendment and offer the \namendment.\n  The amendment I wish to offer is very critical. We debate budgets \nevery year in Congress, and most of the years I have served here--I was \nelected in 1993 and served 6 years in the House, and now I am in my \nsecond term in the Senate--most of those years we have adopted a budget \nresolution. Some of those years we were not able to get the necessary \nvotes to adopt one. But as we proceeded and moved forward in the \ndeliberations of these budgets, I noted an interesting thing: Some \nyears we would have a 10-year budget we looked at. We would have the \nyear we were actually working on--and in this case, we are working on \nthe 2010 budget--and then we would project out 9 more years and say: We \nexpect, in the next 10 years following the year we are working on, to \nsee the following budget numbers be honored with regard to defense \nspending or nondefense discretionary spending or the like. Sometimes we \nonly look out 5 years.\n  This year, the President submitted a budget that looked out 10 years. \nThe Budget Committee, however, took that budget window and reduced it \nto 5 years. The reason I point this out is because as we talk about \nwhat the budget is going to do and what the fiscal impact of the \ndecisions we are debating today is going to be, we always talk about \nwhether the budget is going to get us on a glide path to balancing our \nFederal budget, what kinds of deficits are going to mount in the \noutyears, what kinds of tax increases or tax reductions are going to be \naccomplished in the budget. Yet, if you look closely at these budget \ndocuments and if you look closely at this budget document, all the \ntough decisions are always in the outyears. I should not say that is \nalways the case because I have to say that occasionally Congress has \nstepped up to the plate and has made some tough decisions. But it is \nnot the commonplace occurrence.\n  Let me give you an example. The amendment I am going to offer would \ncap the first 3 years of this proposed budget in terms of nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. In other words, it would say this budget \nproposes the following spending in nondefense discretionary categories \nfor 2010, 2011, and 2012, and thereafter, and my amendment would say \nthat the numbers that are proposed in this budget will be binding on \nCongress. In other words, if we adopt this budget, we will follow it. \nAnd I am only saying for 3 years. I am not even saying for the full 5-\nyear window the Budget Committee has put forward or for the full 10-\nyear window the President has put forward.\n  Why is this so important? Sometimes I jokingly say that during the \ntime I have served in Congress, I have never made it to year 2 of any \nbudget because every time we do a budget--whether it is a 10-year \nbudget or a 5-year budget--we always implement the first year of that \nbudget and then next year, when we come back, we seem to forget about \nwhat the budget projections were and what our promises to the American \npublic were, and we start all over again and we do another 5-year \nbudget. And year 1 of the next 5-year budget does not even look like \nwhat year 2 of the last budget was.\n  Let me give you an example. I was going to have some charts ready, \nbut the opportunity to speak came before the charts got here. If I \ncould show you those charts, I would show you that for the 2010 budget \nyear we are working on today, if you had looked at what Congress said \nit was going to do this year 3 or 4 years ago, and then you looked at \nwhat Congress said it was going to do this year 2 years ago, and then \nyou looked at what Congress said it was going to do this year 1 year \nago, and then you looked at what Congress is proposing to do this year, \nthey are not at all similar. As you might guess, the proposed spending \nin this year's budget for this year is far in excess of what the \nprojections were in the previous budgets which we debated and voted on.\n  Let me put it another way. This year, we are looking at a 5-year \nwindow. The increase in nondefense discretionary spending in the first \nyear of this budget we are talking about is approximately 7.3 percent--\nwell over double the rate of the growth of the economy.\n  Just as a note, last year, the budget that we adopted finally in the \nOmnibus appropriations bill increased nondefense discretionary spending \nby about 10 percent. So in just 2 years, we have seen nondefense \ndiscretionary spending increase by about 15 to 17 or maybe even more \npercent.\n  Well, back to the budget. The proposed increase in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending for this year in this budget is about 7.3 \npercent. But the promise is: OK, we have to spend that much this year, \nbut we are going to be better in the outyears. So in the second year of \nthis budget, the proposed increase is down, I believe, around 1 \npercent. In the third year, I believe that proposed increase is about \n1.5 to 2 percent.\n  But my point is, we are not going to get to those years. We never \nadopt the next year--the second year and the third year and the fourth \nyear and the fifth year in these budgets we debate.\n  So all my amendment will do is this: If we are telling the American \npublic we have to increase our discretionary spending by 15 to 20 \npercent over the last 2 years--7 percent alone in this budget year--but \nthat we are going to be fiscally more conservative and responsible in \nthe outyears, let's make that binding. Let's at least say for the next \ncouple of years we have to follow the budget we are debating. All we \nwould need to do in order to accomplish that is to put some caps on \nthat nondefense discretionary spending as we move into it in the \noutyears.\n  Every time we look at this, the spending goes up. If you look at the \nactual rate of growth in our budget, it is unsustainable. What we need \nto do is to be straightforward with the American people as we approach \nthis. Anything else is just window dressing. All of the numbers we are \ntalking about today\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nand all of the projections we are talking about--how we are going to \ntry to bring the deficit under control or reduce the national debt--are \nsimply window dressing if we do not make them binding, other than the \nfirst year of this budget. That is what will really be binding.\n  I will say it again: The only thing that will really be binding in \nthis budget, if we adopt this budget resolution, is the first year. \nThis amendment would make, in the nondefense discretionary spending \nportion of the budget, the second and the third year numbers binding. \nBy doing so, Congress would actually be setting some parameters for \nitself so we could have a firm confidence that as we move forward, we \nwill be able to have the kind of deficit reduction and spending \nrestraint we always talk about.\n  Madam President, at this time, I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 844.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: to protect the fiscal discipline on discretionary spending \n     exercised by the reported budget resolution by extending the \nresolution's discretionary spending limits to exactly the same level as \n    already assumed in the resolution to make sure that debt is not \n  increased further than contemplated by this budget resolution as a \n    result of subsequent budget resolutions or appropriation bills)\n\n       On page 50, line 12, strike ``and''.\n       On page 50, insert after line 15:\n       ``(3) for fiscal year 2011, $1,092,921,000 in new budget \n     authority;\n       (4) for fiscal year 2012, $1,112,047,000 in new budget \n     authority; and''.\n       On page 49, insert on line 12 after the word ``bill'':\n       ``, concurrent resolution,''.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, as I have said, the amendment is very \nsimple, and it really speaks for itself. It simply says that instead of \ndebating numbers that do not mean anything, let's put some meaning and \nsome authority behind the numbers we are debating. Let's not continue \nthe game Congress continues to play year after year whereby we adopt a \nbudget with no hard decisions in the first year, which is the only \nbinding year, and all the tough decisions in the outyears are not \nbinding and never reached. And let's say we are serious about it.\n  I have even agreed in my amendment to accept the high numbers in the \nfirst year. I personally would prefer to have some restraint now in the \nfirst year of this budget, and instead of increasing spending in this \nGovernment by 7.3 percent, I would rather reduce it to the rate of the \ngrowth of the economy or below that, and let's start catching up a \nlittle bit with regard to the spending we are engaged in.\n  Many people have said on this floor that this budget spends too much, \nit taxes too much, and it borrows too much. The most significant \nportion of all of that occurs in this first year. Let's get to some of \nthe restraint that is promised in the second and third years by \nadopting this amendment, putting the caps on the nondefense \ndiscretionary spending categories, and make sure Congress, like the \nhouseholds and businesses across this Nation, tightens its belt and \nfollows a budget.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank the \nSenator for his amendment and especially thank him for the contribution \nhe makes on budget issues. He is a thoughtful and responsible Member. I \nthank him for his service.\n  With respect to the amendment he has offered, we have a difference on \nthis issue, and the difference is this: What he said is exactly right \nin the sense that we have a budget which is really effective for 1 year \nbecause we have caps for 1 year. But more than that, we are going to be \nback doing another budget resolution next year, so, frankly, having \noutyear caps doesn't mean very much. What matters are the caps for this \nyear, and the caps we have in this budget pertain to this year. The \noutyear caps he is referencing--we will have another budget next year, \nand we will deal with that next year.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened in the past on these caps is people \nhave found a way to game them, and especially in the outyears. How do \nthey do that? They come up with all of these advanced funding schemes \nto get around the outyear caps. What else do they do? They label as \n``emergencies'' things that are really not. For example, we saw war \nfunding in the third year of the war in Iraq and in the fourth year of \nthe war in Iraq labeled as emergency by the previous administration as \nif we didn't know the war was still going on.\n  So I say to our colleagues, the budget resolution before us has a cap \nfor 2010, and the outyear caps, to me, are superfluous because we are \ngoing to have another budget resolution next year.\n  I wish to also point out that the budget that is before us, in fact, \nhas reduced the President's request on domestic spending by over $160 \nbillion, and $15 billion in this year alone.\n  I say to my colleagues, anybody who doesn't understand the magnitude \nof those cuts, come and join me in my office, or come and join me at \nthe meetings, such as the meeting I had yesterday with certain of my \ncolleagues who were very upset because for the next 5 years, the \naverage annual increase in non-defense discretionary spending is 2.5 \npercent--2.5 percent. The Senator says, fairly, that you can have a \nbudget that says that, but if it is not enforced by caps, it will be \nrevised.\n  The truth is, that is the case whether you have outyear caps or not. \nIt is just the reality because we will be doing a budget next year, and \nmore than that, because there is nothing quite so creative as the mind \nof man.\n  I will tell my colleagues, in my 22 years on the Budget Committee, I \nhave seen every conceivable dodge to get around caps. I think I have \nlearned them all. I just hope very much that we get about the business \nof putting together a longer-term plan that deals with reforming the \nentitlements, reforming the tax structure, so we can get on a much more \nsustainable, long-term base.\n  With that, could the Chair inform me how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has used 4 \nminutes, and the Senator from Idaho has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 56 minutes remaining for the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and 58 minutes for the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, could I just have a couple of minutes \nbefore we move on to the next item?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much more time would the Senator like on this?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Two or three minutes is all.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Idaho have an additional 3 minutes, that I have an additional \nminute on this matter, and then--what is the next order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment to follow.\n  Mr. CONRAD. OK. I think we have been trying to go back and forth. \nSenator Tester, I see, is here. How much time does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. TESTER. Five or ten minutes. I will probably use 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. OK. Would it be OK if we ask for 7 minutes?\n  Mr. TESTER. That is perfect.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Seven minutes for the Senator from Montana, and then who \nis up next, Senator Bunning?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I have about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And will the Senator want to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I am going to talk about two amendments, but I am going \nto wait to offer them through the vote-a-rama tomorrow.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator deserves a special place. What a good example \nfor other colleagues.\n  So we go to Senator Bunning, then, for 15 minutes after Senator \nTester. Is Senator Ensign seeking time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I need about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have Senator Reed coming at 1:45. He would be next for \nhow long? Well, maybe we could allocate 10 minutes to Senator Reed, and \nthen Senator Ensign, how much time?\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would need just 10 minutes. If I could just get my \namendment pending then I could speak later in the day.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have not seen the amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. This is the Medicare prescription Part D, means testing \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If we could then do Senator Ensign for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Would you allow me to offer it to get it pending and then \nI can come back later?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am not going to speak now; I just wish to get it \npending at this point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, they have another Senator coming. The problem is, \nwe have now allocated time that is going to go way past what is in this \nconsent agreement.\n  If Senator Ensign just called up his amendment, would that be----\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is all I want to do.\n  Mr. CONRAD. OK. Let's go then in the order we had. Senator Crapo had \na couple of more minutes, and then I would take some time and then we \nwould go back to Senator Tester and then to Senator Bunning.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Should we let Senator Ensign go right now?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If you would just call it up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 805\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up amendment No. \n805.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 805.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require certain higher-income beneficiaries enrolled in \n the Medicare prescription drug benefit to pay higher premiums, as is \n currently required for physicians' services and outpatient services, \n  and as proposed in the budget of the United States Government most \n                  recently submitted by the President)\n\n       On page 4, line 15, decrease the amount by $303,420,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, decrease the amount by $475,732,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, decrease the amount by $599,908,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, decrease the amount by $755,924,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, decrease the amount by $303,420,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, decrease the amount by $475,732,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, decrease the amount by $599,908,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, decrease the amount by $755,924,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $303,420,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $475,732,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $599,908,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $755,924,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $303,420,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $779,152,000.\n       On page 5, line 20, decrease the amount by $1,379,060,000.\n       On page 5, line 21, decrease the amount by $2,134,984,000.\n       On page 6, line 1, decrease the amount by $303,420,000.\n       On page 6, line 2, decrease the amount by $779,152,000.\n       On page 6, line 3, decrease the amount by $1,379,060,000.\n       On page 6, line 4, decrease the amount by $2,134,984,000.\n       On page 21, line 3, decrease the amount by $300,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 4, decrease the amount by $300,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 7, decrease the amount by $460,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 8, decrease the amount by $460,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 11, decrease the amount by $560,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 12, decrease the amount by $560,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 15, decrease the amount by $680,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 16, decrease the amount by $680,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 3, decrease the amount by $3,420,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, decrease the amount by $3,420,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, decrease the amount by $15,732,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, decrease the amount by $15,732,000.\n       On page 27, line 11, decrease the amount by $39,908,000.\n       On page 27, line 12, decrease the amount by $39,908,000.\n       On page 27, line 15, decrease the amount by $75,924,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $75,924,000.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we return to \nthe previous amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 844\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I will be brief. I do appreciate Senator \nConrad and the service he provides to us as the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. He makes some very good points. It is true that Congress can \ncome back at any time and change the caps that we might put on today, \nbut at least the Congress would have to debate that and would have to \nmake a conscious decision that America could watch, and Congress would \nhave to say to America: You know what. We are not going to do what we \nsaid we would do. If we don't put caps on this budget, then there is \nnothing the Congress has to do but adopt another budget resolution.\n  By the way, I also appreciate the fact that some of the emergency \nspending and the other games that are used in Congress to get around \ncaps are identified by the chairman as difficult problems. We need to \nhave much less of that gamesmanship and much more following of the \nrules in our budget so that Americans can truly see how much is spent \nand how much is being taxed as we move into these budgets.\n  I wish to give a couple of examples to show what I am talking about \nbefore I conclude. If we were to look at the fiscal year budget \nauthority for 2009; that is, the budget year we have just finished with \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill a few weeks back--in 2006, we said in \n2009 we were going to spend $409-plus billion. In 2007, we didn't get a \nbudget report because we couldn't reach agreement on one. In 2008, we \nsaid that number was going to be $465 billion. In 2009, we actually \nsaid it was going to be about $480 billion--or $488 billion. The real \nnumber ended up being almost $800 billion.\n  I realize there was some stimulus package money in there, some TARP \nspending, and so forth. The point is, it went up from the projection in \n2006 of $409 billion to a reality, even without the TARP and other \ndollars, of around $500 billion.\n  What about this year we are talking about right now? The proposed \nbudget for this year, I think, is around $525 million for nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. That is what we are debating on the floor \ntoday. Well, in 2006 when we debated the budget and set our \nprojections, that number was around $409 billion; in 2008, $476 \nbillion; in 2009, $492 billion; now, as we move forward to the final \nprojection, $525 billion.\n  The point I make is that every year Congress says this is what we are \ngoing to spend in the outyears, and every time we come back to it we \nnever follow those requirements. We should put caps on at least the \nfirst 2 outyears so that when Congress comes back to deliberate again, \nand when the President submits a budget to us next year, there are \nfiscal caps for nondefense discretionary spending requiring the \nrestraint we are promising Americans we will someday get to.\n  Congress has a pattern of spending more and more and more every year. \nAs I have indicated, nondefense discretionary spending has gone up 15 \nto 17 percent the last 2 years. The fact is, it is time for us to adopt \nthis amendment and put caps on the first 3 years of this budget to \nforce some fiscal restraint in Congress.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, just briefly, in a way, the Senator \nmakes my point because none of us can foresee what happens 2 and 3 \nyears from now. That is why we do an annual budget resolution. The \nnumbers he just cited--who knew we were going to fall off the edge and \nhave a precipitous decline in the economy?\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\n  So what really matters to me is to have a 1-year cap that is \nenforceable. We will be right back here with a budget resolution next \nyear and can extend enforceable caps at that time.\n  According to the order that has been entered into, I am happy to \nyield back my time and go to Senator Tester for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I \nrise today to talk more globally about the budget. After 8 long years \nof failed Federal policies that have driven our economy into the ditch, \nthe Senate this week is finally considering a budget that sets us on \nthe right path--a path that will get us out of the ditch--with balanced \npriorities for the American people. It is about time.\n  Last week, more than 5.5 million people filed for unemployment claims \nin this country. Unfortunately, that is a new record. Overall, the \neconomy declined at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter \nof last year, and experts say it is continuing to shrink. We are \nfeeling the effects in Montana in the mining industry, wood products \nindustry, and especially in the construction industry.\n  In fact, every county in northwestern Montana is suffering from \nunemployment that is at 10 percent or worse. At last week's annual \nemployment expo in Kalispell, MT, 4,000 Montanans showed up looking for \na job. That is an increase of 1,500 from last year; nearly a 40-percent \nincrease. Times are tough.\n  Some DC politicians say: Don't worry about it; the recession is \ntemporary. But let me tell my colleagues, for folks who have lost their \njobs or who fear they will lose their jobs at any time, that kind of \nattitude is out of touch. We need action now, and this Congress is \nworking with the President to provide that help.\n  Earlier this year, we passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, which I call the JOBS bill. The JOBS bill is creating and keeping \nmillions of jobs, and it is pumping hundreds of millions of dollars \ninto our State's economy to build roads, water systems, repair our \nschools, health care facilities, and energy projects. Throughout \nMontana and across rural America our infrastructure is worn out. This \nJOBS bill is a first step to rebuild our economy from the ground up by \nreinvesting in infrastructure and providing tax relief for hard-working \nAmericans. This budget is the next step in that effort.\n  For far too long in this town budget policies were set by folks whose \nideology said ``deficits don't matter,'' as Vice President Cheney \nfamously put it.\n  That was nonsense then and it is nonsense now. Unfortunately, the \nlegacy of that ideology is a national debt that doubled between 2001 \nand 2007. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, Kent Conrad. We \nare cutting those record Republican deficits in half in just 3 years. \nThat cannot be the end of the story, but it is a good start.\n  Once we get the economy up and running again, we are going to need \ntough fiscal discipline to pay off the piles of debt run up by the \nprevious administration and its allies in Congress.\n  Some DC politicians claim the budget mess left to us by the Bush \nadministration is an excuse to do nothing on urgent priorities such as \nenergy, education, health care, and tax relief for middle-class \nfamilies and Main Street small businesses. Continuing to accept those \nexcuses would be the worst mistake we could possibly make.\n  For example, we must take action on comprehensive plans to overhaul \nour energy policy to make America energy secure once and for all. Our \nnational security depends on us getting that right. Energy security is \nnational security. Ask the Eastern Europeans how it felt when the \nRussians cut off their natural gas supply in the middle of winter. We \nneed to take aggressive action on energy policy. We cannot wait until \ngasoline prices push to $5 a gallon again. We must try to develop a \nbroad-based energy policy, and we must act now.\n  Instead of a balanced energy policy to ensure our security with \nrenewables and conservation measures, some people want to see us \ndrilling more in our untouched hunting and fishing habitat places, such \nas the Rocky Mountain Front. This makes no sense. There are places we \nshould drill, and Rocky Mountain Front is not one of them.\n  Montana has always been an energy resources-producing State, and we \nalways will be. But we need to protect our outdoor heritage and invest \nin sustainable, renewable sources of energy such as biofuels, wind, \nsolar, and geothermal power.\n  This budget outline builds on the JOBS bill's investment in renewable \nenergy, efficiency and conservation, low carbon coal technology, and \nmodernizing the electrical grid.\n  This budget also puts a priority on education. My life tells the \nstory of the power of education and the opportunity it provides. For \nme, the grandson of dry land homesteaders, to be selected by my friends \nand neighbors in the State of Montana to serve them in the Senate, that \nis a story that is only possible because of my education. Smart \ninvestments in education generate economic growth and jobs. Education \nand training prepare our workers to compete in a global economy.\n  This budget prioritizes education from early childhood initiatives, \nsuch as Head Start, all the way up to Pell grants to make college more \naffordable.\n  Some on the other side also argue their budget deficits are an excuse \nnot to reform health care in this country, but I believe we cannot \nafford to wait. We have to rebuild our health care system because it is \nbroken. Too many Americans lack health care. Too many families live \nevery day in fear that one illness could ruin them.\n  This budget starts us down the road of allowing Congress and the \nPresident to work together to reform our Nation's health care system so \nour families can thrive.\n  I know this budget process is always a partisan exercise, but it is \nmy hope that when we start to work out the details of health care \nreform, we do it in a bipartisan manner. That is an issue that impacts \nevery American family. So I hope we can work together to pass \ncommonsense solutions.\n  Again, I thank Senator Conrad and the Budget Committee for producing \na budget that continues to support one of my highest priorities since \ncoming to the Senate--honoring the service and commitment of our \nNation's veterans and their families.\n  This budget builds on bipartisan efforts in the last 2 years to boost \nfunding to get the VA into working order. At long last, the quality of \ncare at the VA is starting to improve. We have begun to bring some \npriority 8 veterans back into the system. This budget provides \nresources to continue those important steps.\n  Finally, we need to pass this budget resolution to ensure middle-\nclass tax relief, so ordinary folks can get ahead and our Main Street \nsmall businesses can prosper.\n  This budget resolution is our national mission statement. The mission \nof this Congress is to work with the President to get us out of the \nditch and rebuild our economy from the ground up by cutting the \nRepublican deficit in half and investing in important priorities, such \nas energy, education, health care, middle-class families, and small \nbusinesses.\n  No budget is perfect, and I look forward to supporting amendments \nthat can improve this one. But this is a responsible budget with \nbalanced priorities. I urge the Senate to pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2010 \nbudget. I also plan to discuss two amendments--Nos. 817 and 818--which \nI would like to see considered.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I spoke on this budget last week \nduring the committee consideration. I was unable to support it then, \nand unless truly major changes are made on the Senate floor this week, \nI will not be able to support it as it comes up for a vote.\n  Since the President first gave us a preview of his plan, we have \nheard a lot about this year's budget. I have found it to be very \ntroubling. The budget proposed by the Obama administration is \nunworkable, and I think everyone knows that. It spends too much, taxes \ntoo much, and borrows too much.\n  The numbers in the President's proposal were appalling to anyone who \nbelieves in any kind of fiscal restraint. It got even worse 2 weeks \nago, when the Congressional Budget Office predicted\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nthe numbers used by the administration were far too optimistic. The \nPresident's proposal would double the publicly held national debt to \nmore than $15 trillion. Annual spending would leap from $24,000 per \nhousehold to about $32,000 per household. This plan would also raise \ntaxes by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. The increase in debt is also \nstaggering. The President's proposal would double the debt held by the \npublic in 5 years and nearly triple it over 10 years.\n  In fact, the proposal would create more debt than every previous \nPresident from George Washington to George W. Bush. With numbers such \nas that, it is not surprising that the authors of this budget \nresolution before us today had to make some changes.\n  While I applaud the efforts of Chairman Conrad to attempt to rein in \nsome of the worst aspects of the administration's budget proposal, it \nappears we may only have an ``Obama lite'' version before us. In fact, \nPeter Orszag, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, tells us \nthe two versions are 98 percent the same. The budget on the floor still \nhas the same problems and, in some cases, new problems.\n  President Obama promised a new era of transparency in Government. \nThis is one reason why he submitted a 10-year budget proposal. However, \nthe proposal before us is only a 5-year projection. Also, the \nPresident's budget assumed that Congress would continue to patch the \nalternative minimum tax, which digs deeper and deeper into the middle \nclass each year. This budget assumes it will be fixed for only the \nfirst 3 years of this 5-year plan. Everyone here knows we are going to \nhave to take care of those other 2 years, as we should. However, it \nlooks like we still have more tax increase here.\n  It defies logic that this budget targets tax hikes on the very people \nwho are good at creating jobs. We know that 70 percent of all job \ngrowth in the United States--when we had it--came from small business. \nThis budget penalizes the people who are responsible for two-thirds of \nthe small business jobs. One of the most basic economic principles is \nthat if you want less of an activity, you tax it more. Well, we must \nwant less job creation.\n  Maybe we only want to create jobs for Government bureaucrats who \nspend other people's money and our grandchildren's and children's \nmoney.\n\n  As I have outlined, this budget has many other problems. It spends \ntoo much, taxes too much, and borrows too much. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting changes that would make this a responsible and \nfair piece of legislation.\n  I also wish to take a few minutes to talk about the two amendments I \nwill be introducing later in the marathon we have tomorrow. The first \nis especially important for many of our seniors because it deals with \ntaxes on Social Security benefits. The amendment I will be offering \nsets up a deficit-neutral reserve fund to repeal the 1993 increase in \nthe income tax on Social Security benefits. I brought this issue before \nthe House and before this Chamber before. In fact, earlier this year on \na stimulus bill, I offered an amendment to repeal this unfair tax for \njust 1 year. That amendment failed.\n  With this amendment, I am taking a different tack and using a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to repeal the 1993 Social Security tax \nincrease completely. This should be familiar to the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, since he offered a similar amendment using a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund during the budget consideration last year. \nI remind my colleagues that his amendment passed last year by a vote of \n53 yeas to 46 nays.\n  When the Social Security program was created, benefits were not taxed \nat all. However, in 1983, Congress changed the rules of the game by \npassing legislation to taxing up to 50 percent of a senior's Social \nSecurity benefit if their income was over $25,000 for a single \nindividual or $32,000 for a couple. In 1993, as I sat on the Ways and \nMeans Committee at the time, Congress felt that taxing 50 percent of \nbenefits wasn't good enough.\n  That year, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, a bill that \nallows 85 percent of a senior's Social Security benefits to be taxed if \ntheir income was above $34,000 for a single taxpayer or $44,000 for a \ncouple. The additional money this tax raises doesn't even go to help \nSocial Security's solvency. It goes, instead, to the Medicare Part A \nProgram. I opposed this tax increase then, and I oppose it today, \nbecause 14 million seniors are hit by an 85-percent tax on their Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  On one hand, we tell seniors to plan and save for retirement; on the \nother hand, we tax them for doing just that. This amendment puts the \nSenate on record that this 85-percent tax tier would be eliminated, and \nthe maximum amount of Social Security benefits that could be taxed \nwould be 50 percent.\n  If Congress passed legislation to do this, millions of seniors would \nbe able to keep more of their Social Security benefits. I hope my \ncolleagues can support this amendment when it comes up for \nconsideration.\n  I am offering another amendment to pave the way for relieving \ntaxpayers who have suffered devastating capital losses during these \ntroubled economic times. Many taxpayers have been forced to sell their \nhomes, stocks or any kind of capital asset at a loss. Our constituents \nwill be stunned to learn they can only deduct $3,000 of those losses \nfrom their adjusted gross income. The $3,000 limit was set in 1976, \nwhen tax writers seemed to be ignorant about the impact of inflation. \nThat limit is ridiculous in today's dollars.\n  My amendment creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund for increasing \nthe capital loss deduction. If it helps struggling taxpayers, we have \nto do it because if we raised that deduction from $3,000 and adjusted \nit for inflation, it would be over what I propose--at $15,000, which \nyou could deduct from your adjusted gross. Prominent economists have \nnoted that by eliminating some of the downside risks of investing, \nincreasing the capital loss deduction will stimulate investment and \neconomic growth.\n  This amendment is a winner for taxpayers and a winner for our economy \nat a time when they both need some wins.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of this budget resolution. \nI particularly commend Senator Conrad for his extraordinary work.\n  Later, at the conclusion of my brief remarks, I will call up an \namendment.\n  We have a situation that is unprecedented in the history of the \ncountry--extraordinary economic challenges, extraordinary international \nchallenges. This budget resolution is designed to and will, I believe, \nhelp get our economy moving again and serve as a catalyst for job \ncreation and for long-term growth. It will also put this Nation on a \nsustainable path in a fiscal dimension. The budget resolution reflects \na commitment to transparency and restores honesty and integrity to the \nprocess. The budget incorporates the cost of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, which were notably neglected in past budgets. It enhances \noversight of Government, including defense procurement spending, to \nroot out waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  We are in very challenging circumstances, both domestically and \ninternationally, and this budget reflects and faces up to those \nchallenges.\n  Against these daunting challenges, the priorities reflected in the \nbudget are clear: lower the tax burden on working men and women and \nsmall businesses, trim health care costs, invest in education, and \nreduce our dependency on foreign oil.\n  For too long, these challenges have undermined our economic vitality, \nand they will continue to drive down progress unless we take essential \nsteps, as reflected in this budget, to deal with them. These are \nreasonable and necessary provisions. They represent a way to grow our \neconomy and put more money in the pockets of middle-class Americans.\n  We are inheriting a weakened fiscal position based on the policies of \nthe last 8 years, marked by an economic ideology that extended \nsignificant tax cuts to the very wealthiest, skewing these tax cuts so \nthey benefitted a very few rather than ordinary Americans.\n  The Obama administration inherited an economic mess, a $1.3 trillion \nbudget deficit and a near doubling of the public debt, rising from $3.3 \ntrillion in 2001 to $5.8 trillion in 2008. This doubling of our debt \noccurred at a time of\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\nmacroeconomic prosperity and strong productivity growth. Yet, for \nmiddle-class Americans who have been working harder and more \ninnovatively, there is little or no job creation. In fact, family \nincomes fell $2,000 between 2000 and 2007. Simply put, most families \nsaw their income fall by $2,000 in a period of economic boom and \nprosperity, and we have to reverse that. We have to make an economy \nthat will provide the jobs and the growth of income that Americans \ndepend upon to educate their children, provide for their health care \nneeds, and to contribute to their community.\n  This budget will provide that path of sustainable economic growth. It \nwill do so by making investments to counter some of the downward spiral \nwe have seen over the last several years.\n  It will invest in tax reform. This budget provides tax cuts for 95 \npercent of working Americans. It will close tax loopholes to ensure \nthat we are all paying our fair share. It will eliminate some \ncomplicated, sophisticated tax shelters that benefit the wealthy but do \nnot benefit working families.\n  In addition, it will focus on health care reform, which is necessary \nnot only for our position as citizens but also for our economic future. \nDespite technological innovation, despite technological advances in \nmedicine, far too many of these basic services are out of reach of \nAmericans. They are simply not affordable or accessible. This budget \nwill set the parameters for significant health care reform.\n  It will also begin to address the issue of global warming, which has \nhuge implications internationally.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I can speak to the Senator through the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has the floor.\n  Mr. REED. I gladly yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In addressing the Chair, first of all, I apologize to the \nSenator for interrupting. It is important that we get another unanimous \nconsent agreement in effect at this moment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of Senator Reed's \ndiscussion, Senator Johanns be recognized for 12 minutes and that \nSenator Whitehouse then be recognized for 12 minutes. I make that \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this for debate only?\n  Mr. CONRAD. This is for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does Senator Johanns have an amendment to offer?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. It is not an amendment but a motion. I can provide it to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator could discuss it but not formally offer it \nso we get it in the right place in the queue--would that be acceptable \nto the Senator?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, that is acceptable.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to make sure the Senator's rights \nare protected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are going to get a vote on the Senator's amendment \nprior to the vote-arama?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reed be able to call \nup his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are doing some quick arithmetic. There is 4 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, can you remind me or let me know when 1 \nminute remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are dealing with a plethora of issues \nthat are absolutely critical to the economic success of the country. I \nmentioned climate effects. I mentioned investment in reducing our \ncarbon footprint. All of these have been outlined and provided for in \nthis budget resolution.\n  We are also going a long way to invest in the future of the country \nthrough education. I am pleased to see that this proposal includes a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for higher education to allow for \nexpanding student aid.\n  I have worked with Senator Collins on an amendment to ensure that \nthis reserve fund may be used for increased investments in the \nLeveraging Educational Assistance Partnership or LEAP program which \nprovides critical need-based grant aid and support services to low-\nincome students.\n  This budget also provides for increased spending on Pell Grants, and \nas such, invests in our greatest resource, the talent and innovation \nand imagination of America. In that sense, I think this is a very \nstrong step forward.\n  The budget helps deal with the issues facing small business in terms \nof providing, for example, $880 million for the Small Business \nAdministration. It is small businesses, indeed, that create the jobs. \nToo often in the past, we have talked the talk but not walked the walk. \nThis budget provides real resources for the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  We have very difficult decisions to make, but we have made them \nbefore. I can recall being elected in 1990, beginning in 1991 with a \nhuge deficit. Through the tough decisions we made here, a Democratic \nCongress following a Democratic Congress, we were able to not only turn \nthe economy around but reduce the deficit. That is something we have to \ndo going forward, and we must do that. I think this budget will \nposition us to do that.\n  We have a difficult series of choices before us. I believe this \nbudget and the work of Senator Conrad have positioned us to respond to \nthe crisis of the moment and positioned us to take opportunities of the \nfuture.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 836\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 836, the Reed-Snowe LIHEAP \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Whitehouse, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 836.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assist \n                  (LIHEAP) by $1.9 billion in FY 2010)\n\n       On page 21, line 24, increase the amount by $1,900,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 25, increase the amount by $1,330,000,000.\n       On page 22; line 4, increase the amount by $532,000,000.\n       On page 22; line 8, increase the amount by $38,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $1,900,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $1,330,000,000.\n       On page 28. line 3, decrease the amount by $532,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 7, decrease the amount by $38,000,000.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment would enhance \nand increase funding for the LIHEAP program. It is a program that is \nabsolutely essential as we see energy prices begin to creep up again. \nWhen it hits again next winter, we will need these funds. When heating \ncosts increase this summer in the Southwest and Southeast, we will need \nthese funds.\n  I am proud to join Senator Snowe in supporting this amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it when it comes up for a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, under the consent agreement, I believe \nSenator Johanns is recognized for 12 minutes, followed by Senator \nWhitehouse. Then I understand Senator Graham would like to speak on the \nJohanns amendment for 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that after \nSenator Whitehouse, Senator Graham be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, just so we are clear on this procedure, I \nsupplied a copy of my motion to the chairman of the Budget Committee. \nIt is being reviewed. I would like the opportunity to speak on it now.\n  I rise to discuss this motion which I firmly believe would bring a \nbit of fiscal responsibility back to Washington\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nat a time where I fear spending restraint has gone out the door.\n  The budget before us increases nondefense discretionary spending by 9 \npercent. That translates into $42 billion over last year's levels. My \nmotion would instruct the Budget Committee to take the budget \nresolution back to the committee and limit the overall increases to \nCBO's projected rate of inflation. The motion asks that we do this for \neach of the budget years. The motion would save $36 billion in 2010 and \n$194 billion over the 5-year budget window.\n  I would like to point out that my motion does not attempt to dictate \nwhich programs are prioritized for funding or which are cut back. \nInstead, my motion ties the aggregate spending to the rate of \ninflation. It asks the Budget Committee to take a scalpel to the budget \nline by line, which is exactly what the President has promised to do. \nGovernment simply cannot be everything to everyone, and at some point, \ntough spending decisions do have to be made.\n  Some may wonder why I chose to limit spending to the rate of \ninflation. The answer to that is very straightforward. If the average \ncost of goods and services for folks has increased by a certain \npercentage, I believe it makes common sense to require the Federal \nGovernment to spend within the same range. The American people cut back \nduring tough economic times. Yet their Government is blatantly \nrejecting that commonsense principle. If you do not have enough money \nto pay for something, well, you shouldn't buy it. While most American \nfamilies are planning to spend less this year compared to last year, \nisn't it eminently sensible that their Government increase spending no \nmore than the rate of inflation?\n  It is clear that this budget does not have enough revenue to pay for \nits price tag, $3.6 trillion, even though it levies a massive tax \nincrease on hard-working Americans to the collective tune of $1.7 \ntrillion. Instead, the budget piles more debt on more debt, so much so \nthat the debt per household for fiscal year 2010 would be $74,000. \nConsidering that the average hourly wage in my home State is about $17 \nan hour, it would take most Nebraskans about 4,200 hours to earn that \nmuch money. That is an astronomical amount of debt.\n  But why should people back home worry about the debt the Government \ncontinues to amass? Because debt becomes unsustainable. When this \noccurs, the interest consumes more and more of the revenue, leaving \nvirtually no money left to fund programs. Then you find yourself \nborrowing more and more to offset the difference. It is not a \nproductive dance--taking one step forward, two steps back, then one \nforward, three back, year after year, until pretty soon you are not on \nthe dance floor, and if you are not careful, you are not even in the \ndancehall. We will be so indebted to our creditors, such as China, that \nwe will be watching through the dancehall window as economic engines of \nother nations carry the world economy.\n  Consider this sobering thought: If this budget passes, a few years \nfrom now we will be spending more on finance charges than on the entire \ndefense budget. Put another way, our finance charges will be eight \ntimes the Nation's education budget. The budget before us is comparable \nto a family running up so much credit card debt that their finance \ncharges are more than the house payment. We have lost our way.\n\n  Gone are the days when $1 million was a significant amount of money \nto invest in a program. Some think it is a bargain if we just spend \n$100 million or even $1 billion. More and more commonplace are bills \nthat actually spend $1 trillion. How did we get spending so out of \ncontrol?\n  It seems as if every time legislation is passed, we end up by just \nnonchalantly raising the debt limit. How long do you think our Nation \ncan keep going down this course of unrestrained spending? Not very \nlong.\n  We have a country that lives on credit, and we are close to maxing it \nout. Then what? Well, I will tell you what. Our dollar will be worth \nnothing. No one will want to invest in the United States, and economic \ngrowth will stall. I shudder at the thought.\n  I mentioned China a minute ago. They are the largest foreign holder \nof our debt. Why do we allow that to happen? I don't know about you, \nbut we need something to change the course. This motion just simply \ntakes a step back from bloated spending and a step forward to fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to offer a few short and very \nstraightforward comments about an amendment that I offered on Monday. \nIt has not yet come up for a vote. I hope the delay means my colleagues \nare thinking long and hard because it is an amendment that stands for \nthe Senate.\n  It basically says: Don't use reconciliation for climate change \nlegislation. First, climate change and energy are important enough that \nthe Senate should deliberate these issues carefully. Haste leads to \nerror and consequences. I remind my colleagues that budget \nreconciliation means far-reaching cap-and-trade legislation would only \nget 20 hours of debate. That is right. If the leadership keeps the \nSenate floor open all night long, a $250-per-month increase in energy \nbills could pass the Senate in just 1 day.\n  Second, let's not permit the House to dictate how we do business in \nthe Senate. I tried to suggest to my colleagues that the House budget \nis a Trojan horse meant to force the Senate's hand. Many of my \ncolleagues understand and know exactly what the House leadership has in \nmind.\n  I know the chairman of the Budget Committee has indicated he will \nresist. I applaud him for that. I thank the chairman. I note also that \nthe chairman has been careful and thoughtful in his comments regarding \nthe use of budget reconciliation. Again, I applaud that. I think my \namendment just lays this issue before us and gives us the chance to \nstand for the Senate.\n  I would like to emphasize one other point. I have tried to make clear \nthat the merits of climate change are not at issue. This body will \nthoughtfully consider climate change given the chance. What is \nuncertain--and the issue before us--is whether we have an open, robust \ndebate and the opportunity to share with our constituents the content \nof the legislation and the amendments we offer.\n  I thank most Members on the other side of the aisle for their support \nand their reasoned approach. In fact, eight Members who are Democrats \njoined me in a letter to the leadership of the Budget Committee. My \namendment directly addresses the concerns in that letter. In reality, \nthe proposed solution in the letter is exactly what my amendment is \ndoing.\n  Additionally, a man I respect a great deal, another Democratic \nSenator, the junior Senator from North Dakota, also indicated his \nopposition in his own letter. My amendment addresses these concerns.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee has indicated that using \nreconciliation ``is not a good idea.'' I could not agree more. House \nDemocrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee urge the use of \n``hearings, markup and regular order'' instead of budget \nreconciliation.\n  I could quote on and on from Members on both sides who have stood \nwith me on this issue and have expressed their concern long before I \narrived. I thank them for protecting the integrity of the Senate \nprocess, and I offered that amendment in that bipartisan spirit.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, under the order, Senator Whitehouse is \nnext.\n  If I could just say, Senator Whitehouse is a very valued member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee. He brings a wealth of experience to the \ncommittee, especially on health care, and he has been extremely \nenergized on the issue of the use of information technology to reduce \ncost and improve health care outcomes. He has also been very focused on \nhealth care reform and the significant opportunity that is for the \ncountry, and, of course, global climate change, protecting the planet, \nand being concerned about environmental values.\n  We are very fortunate to have Senator Whitehouse as part of the \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman \nvery much for those very kind and gracious\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nremarks, and I am indeed here to discuss the budget, and particularly \nthe health care aspects of the budget.\n  This is the season. Here we go again, into the annual budget process, \nand as we have seen today on the Senate floor, our friends across the \naisle are doing a great deal of complaining and not a great deal of \ncontributing.\n  Are their complaints sincere? Well, perhaps. I am sure some are \nsincere. But in evaluating them, we should bear this in mind: Under \nGeorge Bush, the difference between the budget projections he inherited \nfrom President Clinton and the budget performance he left for President \nObama was a negative nearly $9 trillion--a massive, reckless landslide \nof fair-weather debt.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Again, I apologize \nfor interrupting.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Of course, I will yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Just for a moment, for the purpose of a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Whitehouse \nis done, Senator Graham be recognized for 5 minutes and then Senator \nEnzi for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I apologize for this interruption, but I have to go to \nanother committee to introduce someone who is up for a nomination. So I \nneeded to do it at this moment to make certain there is a good flow.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I understand perfectly, and I appreciate the \nchairman's diligence in ensuring a smooth flow of this important \nlegislation.\n  So we have this litany of complaints from the side that is \nresponsible for the Bush debt of nearly $9 trillion. Now that President \nObama has to dig out from under the Bush economic collapse, now that we \nare in a deep economic recession, now, in the one time when Government \nspending and borrowing is justified to get us through the economic \ntrough we are going through, we are treated to lectures about debt from \nour free-borrowing friends. The party of ``deficits don't matter'' \nwakes up to this concern just in time, coincidently, to thwart our new \nPresident.\n  The grotesque folly of the Bush debt was that it addressed things \nsuch as lowering tax rates for America's billionaires, not the core \nAmerican priorities we need to address, in a country that is failing to \neducate its children as well as international competitors do, a country \nwhose energy policy hurts everyone except oil-producing nations and the \noil and coal industry, and a country mired in a disastrous health care \nsystem. President Obama's budget addresses these priorities.\n  Indeed, one of the highest priorities in our budget proposal for \nfiscal year 2010 is a badly needed and long-overdue reform of that \nbroken and dysfunctional health care system. I have spoken on this \nsubject in the Chamber many times because unless something is done \nsoon, health care's massive costs will overwhelm us. Already, the \nsystem costs well over $2 trillion a year, and as our population ages, \nwe face $35 trillion in unfunded Medicare liabilities, with not a \nnickel set aside against those liabilities.\n  No one seriously now questions the need for fundamental health care \nreform, and it is time to come together to determine what that reform \nwill look like and how we can get it done. That would be a productive \nthing to talk about with regard to this budget.\n  An event last Thursday marked an important step forward on health \ncare reform. The American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes \nAssociation, the American Heart Association, and Consumers Union came \ntogether to issue a joint statement on the vital importance of \nincluding health care delivery system reform as part of any \ncomprehensive health care legislation that Congress should move this \nyear. I was proud to join them at their announcement, together with \nSenator Schumer and Senator Rockefeller.\n  These organizations represent tens of millions of Americans--\nAmericans living with chronic illness, with cancer, with diabetes, with \nheart disease, and millions more who are consumers of health care in \nthis country. These organizations and their members understand the \nfailures and the tragedies of our health care system. Separate and \ntogether, their voices are powerful, and I would like to share some of \nwhat they said.\n\n       The number of uninsured Americans exceeds 45 million. \n     Health care costs are rising faster than incomes. We spend at \n     least twice as much per capita on health care as our major \n     trading partners, and we rank 37th in the World Health \n     Organization's evaluation of health systems worldwide. The \n     major chronic diseases--cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular \n     diseases, and stroke--account for three out of every four \n     deaths in the United States, and the estimated total direct \n     and indirect health care costs for these chronic diseases \n     exceeds $700 billion each year. Much of America's chronic \n     disease burden could be avoided through better coordination \n     of care and by applying known best practices to prevent the \n     onset and progression of these conditions at the primary, \n     secondary, and tertiary levels.\n       While insurance coverage for all Americans is an important \n     goal, we must give equal weight in the health care reform \n     debate to changes that improve the quality of care, increase \n     and improve the delivery of preventive services, and ensure \n     that individuals always receive care that is safe, efficient, \n     and without unnecessary interventions, tests, and treatment. \n     To achieve these goals we must make structural changes: \n     Improve our health information technology infrastructure; \n     align financial incentives with evidence-based and cost-\n     effective decision making; and develop a reliable process for \n     assessing the health value of new technologies.\n\n  That is a part of the joint statement the American Cancer Society, \nthe American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, and \nConsumers Union issued last Thursday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full text of the joint statement I have just referred to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Also, on Thursday, Mr. President, Consumers Union \npresented new polling data about Americans' experiences with the health \ncare delivery system that confirms the urgent need for delivery system \nreform. In the poll, 18 percent of respondents reported that either \nthey or an immediate family member contracted an infection following a \nmedical procedure, and more than 60 percent of those reported that the \ninfection was severe or life-threatening. Mr. President, 13 percent of \nrespondents have had their medical record misplaced, and 9 percent have \nreceived the wrong prescription from the pharmacist. Only half of \nadults--only half of adults--receive routine preventive medical tests, \nand for adults 35 years and younger, only 30 percent even visit a \ndoctor for routine testing.\n  At our event last week, these organizations emphasized the importance \nof preventive care. As is so often the case in our health care system, \nno data or information is as compelling as a personal story, and we \nwere fortunate on Thursday to hear an extraordinary one.\n  Gina Gavlak is a diabetes center and emergency department nurse and \nthe vice chair of the American Diabetes Association's advocacy \ncommittee.\n  Gina was diagnosed with diabetes at age 10, and has been living with \nthe disease for the last 29 years. She has worn an insulin pump 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year for the past 12 years. \nBefore using the pump, Gina took over 21,000 insulin injections, an \naverage of 6 times a day.\n  Gina has battled pre-existing condition rules and outrageously high \ninsurance premiums, but her biggest battle has been the daily \nmanagement of her disease. She has taken on this battle with \nextraordinary determination and diligence, and with exemplary results.\n  Through extremely careful monitoring and management, she has had only \ntwo hospitalizations and one emergency department visit due to \ndiabetes. She has never missed a day of work because of diabetes. She \nhas had two uncomplicated pregnancies resulting in the birth of her two \nhealthy children.\n  Gina's story is both poignant and important. It shows the tremendous \nbenefits that come from comprehensive management of chronic disease--\nboth in quality of life and in reduced cost of care. But not everyone \nhas Gina's unique drive and commitment. Many patients will need an \ninteractive, organized, and prevention-focused health care system to \neffectively manage their care.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the health care system we have. The Cancer \nSociety, the Diabetes Association, the\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\nHeart Association, and Consumers Union wrote:\n\n       The promise of . . . delivery system reform measures to \n     lower costs is the most humane avenue to a financially \n     sustainable health care system . . .\n       Although coverage for all Americans is a vital component of \n     this change--a simultaneous effort aimed at securing high-\n     quality, cost-effective preventive care is equally important \n     . . . the time for comprehensive health care reform has \n     arrived and our organizations will work together to help \n     create a health care system capable of consistently \n     delivering the most effective, patient-centered care.\n       These efforts will improve the quality of life and health \n     outcomes for millions of people who suffer from a chronic \n     disease, and lead to more efficient use of our nation's \n     health resources.\n\n  The time has indeed come, not only for coverage reforms that will \nbring all Americans the security and stability that health insurance \nprovides, but also for a fundamental overhaul of the way our delivery \nsystem provides care. That is a necessary investment this budget makes.\n  We have to be smart about this. We know how bad the system is; we see \nits looming catastrophic costs; we must invest the time, the money and \nthe effort to transition to a modern, safe, efficient and healing \nhealth care system.\n  That is why this President's budget matters. That is why President \nObama's budget is worth passing; it looks beyond the sorry politics of \ntoday and addresses the real problems Americans have to cope with day \nto day, in their regular lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that statements by Dr. Timothy J. Gardner and \nDan Smith, and a Consumer's Union Release be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Congressional Briefing on Health System Reform\n\n      (Prepared Remarks for Dr. Timothy J. Gardner, Mar. 26, 2009)\n\n       I am pleased to be here today on behalf of the American \n     Heart Association to highlight the need for health system \n     reforms that will result in the high-quality, cost-effective \n     care that our patients deserve. The Heart Association is very \n     pleased to be joined at today's event by Senators Whitehouse, \n     Rockefeller and Schumer and to be collaborating on the \n     statement we're announcing today with the American Cancer \n     Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the Consumers \n     Union.\n       Cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, \n     is the nation's leading cause of death and the most costly \n     disease. Cumulatively, the leading chronic diseases--heart \n     disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes--account for three out \n     of every four deaths in the U.S. and the estimated total cost \n     for these diseases exceeds $700 billion each year.\n       The American Heart Association supports reforms that will \n     extend affordable coverage to all Americans. Equally \n     important, the Heart Association supports measures that will \n     improve the value of cardiovascular and other chronic disease \n     prevention and care. Delivery system changes that speed the \n     translation of new knowledge to practitioners and strategies \n     that improve care coordination are essential to reducing \n     mortality and morbidity from heart disease, stroke and other \n     chronic diseases and to improve the value of the care \n     provided.\n       The reality is that in our country health care remains \n     largely fragmented and uncoordinated, and as a result, we \n     miss many opportunities to both improve the quality of care \n     that patients receive and prevent disease altogether.\n       Unfortunately, a patient with chronic diseases like heart \n     disease, stroke, cancer or diabetes often serves as the \n     poster-child for these missed opportunities. As a heart \n     surgeon, I have witnessed many such examples--both in the \n     prevention and treatment of patients with cardiovascular \n     disease. I see conditions that could have been prevented or \n     caught at an earlier, more treatable stage if risk factors--\n     such as hypertension or high cholesterol--had been identified \n     and treated appropriately. And I have seen problems that \n     could have been avoided if evidence-based guidelines were \n     followed.\n       For example, we know that patients who develop a hospital-\n     acquired infection after undergoing coronary artery bypass \n     surgery have worse outcomes and are twice as likely to be \n     readmitted to the hospital compared to those without an \n     infection. We also know that administering an antibiotic \n     before surgery reduces a patient's risk of a post-operative \n     infection 5-fold. And yet studies have shown that correct \n     antibiotic use preoperatively continues to be uneven, which \n     results in unnecessary complications and re-hospitalizations \n     for some patients.\n       As a physician, I can also attest to the tremendous \n     challenge that doctors and other healthcare professionals \n     face in staying current on the latest evidence and \n     guidelines. As the Institute of Medicine said in its landmark \n     2001 report, Crossing the Quality Chasm, ``[Health care] \n     today is characterized by more to know, more to do, more to \n     manage, more to watch, and more people involved than ever \n     before.''\n       The American Heart Association and other scientific \n     organizations have invested a great deal of time, effort, and \n     money developing evidence-based guidelines and science \n     statements to help healthcare professionals give their \n     patients the highest quality care possible. The Heart \n     Association's Get With The Guidelines quality improvement \n     programs, now being used in over 1600 hospitals around the \n     country, are translating many of our science-based Guidelines \n     into practical systems of care that reflect best practices. \n     Interdisciplinary health professional team training and \n     programs that promote the coordination of acute patient care \n     are helping our health providers manage increasingly complex \n     medical care. For example, the Heart Association launched its \n     Mission: Lifeline program, which seeks to decrease critical \n     time to treatment and increase adherence to evidence-based \n     therapies for patients with the deadliest type of heart \n     attack by establishing regional systems of care.\n       During the briefing session, I shared some of the tools and \n     strategies developed by the American Heart Association that \n     can serve as models of what needs to be done to systemically \n     increase quality of care, with the added benefit of spending \n     healthcare dollars more effectively. By doing so, we will be \n     doing our part to ``bend the cost curve'' for cardiovascular \n     disease.\n       We look forward to working with Senators Whitehouse, \n     Rockefeller, Schumer and others in Congress, as well as with \n     our partners in the chronic disease and consumer community, \n     to enact meaningful health reform that not only provides \n     health insurance coverage to all Americans but also makes \n     care more patient-centered, reliable, and efficient. Thank \n     you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Health Care Delivery System Reform Press Conference\n\n             (Dan Smith, President, ACS CAN, Mar. 26, 2009)\n\n       I want to thank you--Senator Whitehouse, Rockefeller and \n     Schumer for gathering us all here today to talk about the \n     importance of fixing the way we deliver health care in this \n     country. We are encouraged by the work that Congress is \n     already doing in this regard and we look forward to working \n     with you as you move forward.\n       The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the \n     advocacy affiliate of the American Cancer Society is adding \n     its voice to this discussion because the quality of our \n     nation's health care system will affect our success in the \n     fight against cancer.\n       Providing all Americans with access to high quality health \n     care will significantly reduce the rates of cancer incidence \n     and mortality and will measurably improve the quality of life \n     for all people with cancer.\n       I am happy to be standing with my friends from The American \n     Heart Association, The American Diabetes Association, and \n     Consumers Union.\n       Five years ago, the American Cancer Society, the American \n     Heart Association, and the American Diabetes Association \n     joined forces to create the Preventive Health Partnership.\n       The Partnership's goal is to reduce the burden of chronic \n     disease by focusing health care policy on prevention. Our \n     organizations all agree that insurance reform by itself is \n     not sufficient. Real reform must include changes in the way \n     we deliver services to people.\n       We believe all Americans should have access to adequate \n     health care coverage. But coverage is not enough. We must \n     also fundamentally transform the health care delivery system.\n       That is why we must move from a system focused on episodic \n     treatment of disease to one that focuses much more heavily on \n     wellness, disease prevention and early detection.\n       We must also:\n       Increase the delivery of prevention services to detect and \n     mitigate the potential harm of serious diseases and \n     conditions;\n       Enhance knowledge and awareness of how good outcomes can be \n     achieved; and\n       Reward providers that utilize them.\n       In fact, by applying proven prevention and early detection \n     strategies that we have available right now up to \\2/3\\ of \n     all cancers can be prevented.\n       Investing in these strategies will improve the health of \n     our nation and slow the growth of health care spending.\n       All four of our organizations are releasing a joint \n     statement today in support of health care delivery system \n     reform.\n       We all agree that the signs and symptoms of our broken \n     health care system are numerous.\n       We must address not only coverage and access, but \n     fundamental delivery system reform.\n       We believe that the time for comprehensive health care \n     reform has arrived. Our organizations stand ready to help \n     create a health care system that delivers effective patient-\n     centered care.\n                                  ____\n\n\nConsumer Reports Poll: More Americans Acquiring Medical Infections and \n                      Experiencing Medical Errors\n\n       Washington D.C.--A new Consumer Reports poll finds that 18 \n     percent of Americans say they or an immediate family member \n     have acquired a dangerous infection following a medical \n     procedure and more than one-third report that medical errors \n     are\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\n     common in everyday medical procedures. The new poll, which \n     assessed people's experiences with the health care system, \n     also found that only half of adults participate in routine \n     preventive medical testing.\n       ``Healthcare-acquired infections and medical errors can \n     devastate American families who are already struggling with \n     the cost of health care,'' said Consumers Union President Jim \n     Guest. ``These preventable errors and infections can cost \n     families hundreds--if not thousands--of extra dollars each \n     year, and add tens of billions of dollars to our national \n     health care costs. It is imperative that Congress pass health \n     care reform legislation that includes simple safety \n     provisions to help save lives and fix our broken health care \n     system.''\n       The new poll was released in conjunction with a \n     Congressional briefing on health care delivery system reform \n     with the American Cancer Society, American Diabetes \n     Association and the American Heart Association. The poll was \n     performed March 12-16, 2009, and interviewed more than 2,000 \n     adults on issues such as acquired infections, medical errors, \n     and preventive care.\n\n\n                     Healthcare Acquired Infections\n\n       The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports \n     that almost 100,000 people die each year from an infection \n     they contract while in the hospital. Data from the new poll \n     shows that the risks of medical infections continue to be \n     very real.\n       Nearly one-in-five (18%) reported that they or an immediate \n     family member had acquired an infection owing to a hospital \n     stay or other medical procedure. More than 6 out of 10 \n     reporting an infection told Consumer Reports the infection \n     was severe or life-threatening.\n       The risk of an infection increased 45 percent if a patient \n     spent the night in the hospital.\n       Fifty-three percent of Americans polled said these \n     infections required additional out of pocket expenses to \n     treat the infection.\n       Sixty-nine percent had to be admitted to a hospital or \n     extend their stay because of the infection.\n\n\n               Errors in Diagnostic Testing and Treatment\n\n       Many Americans told Consumer Reports they regularly \n     encounter errors in routine medical procedures like lab work, \n     CAT scans or blood testing.\n       More than one-third of Americans polled believe it was very \n     common or somewhat common for an error to occur during a \n     diagnostic procedure.\n       Thirteen percent have had their medical records lost or \n     misplaced.\n       Twelve percent have had a diagnostic test that was not done \n     properly.\n       Nine percent have been given the wrong medicine by a \n     pharmacist when they filled their doctor's prescription\n\n\n                        Early Detection Testing\n\n       Early detection testing is the key to fighting many common \n     illnesses. The new poll highlights the number of adults who \n     have not been screened for common diseases.\n       While 94 percent of consumers felt it was important to have \n     routine tests for diseases, only 59 percent have discussed \n     testing with their doctors and only 55 percent have actually \n     undergone tests.\n       This behavior increased sharply with age: Among those 65 \n     years and older, 73 percent have visited their doctor for \n     routine testing, but among adults 35 years and younger, that \n     percentage drops to 30 percent.\n       ``The findings of this poll clearly show that we need to \n     make fundamental improvements in the quality of care that is \n     delivered to American families,'' said Jim Guest. ``Consumers \n     are paying to fix bureaucratic errors and medical harm that \n     can easily be avoided. We need to make sure more Americans \n     have access to basic public information on hospitals quality \n     of care and disclosure of infection rates and medical \n     errors.''\n     About the poll\n       The Consumer Reports National Research Center conducted a \n     telephone survey of a nationally representative probability \n     sample of telephone households. A total of 2,005 interviews \n     were completed among adults ages 18+. The margin of error is \n     +/- 2.2% points at a 95% confidence level.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Association, \n           American Heart Association, American Stroke \n           Association, Consumers Union.\n\n         Joint Statement on Health Care Delivery System Reform\n\n       Our health care system is in desperate need of reform. The \n     number of uninsured Americans exceeds 45 million; health care \n     costs are rising faster than incomes; health disparities \n     persist; and although we spend at least twice as much per \n     capita on health care as our major trading partners, we rank \n     37th in the World Health Organization's evaluation of health \n     systems worldwide. The signs and symptoms of a broken health \n     care system are numerous and unmistakable, and we must \n     address not only coverage and access, but fundamental \n     delivery system reform, to truly cure what ails us.\n       The major chronic diseases--cancer, diabetes, \n     cardiovascular diseases, and stroke--account for three out of \n     every four deaths in the United States and the estimated \n     total direct and indirect health care costs for these chronic \n     disease areas exceed $700 billion each year. These staggering \n     human and economic costs will increase as our population ages \n     and as risk factors common to cancer, diabetes, and \n     cardiovascular disease rise in prevalence.\n       For Americans who struggle with a chronic disease, failure \n     of the health care system to provide quality care throughout \n     the life stages compounds the problems of coverage and cost. \n     Much of America's chronic disease burden could be avoided \n     through better coordination of care, and by applying known \n     best practices to prevent the onset and progression of these \n     conditions, at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels.\n       While insurance coverage for all Americans is an important \n     goal, we must give equal weight in the health care reform \n     debate to changes that improve the quality of care, increase \n     and improve the delivery of preventive services, and ensure \n     that individuals always receive care that is safe, efficient \n     and without unnecessary interventions, tests, and treatment. \n     To achieve these goals, we must make structural changes: \n     improve our health information technology infrastructure; \n     align financial incentives with evidence-based and cost-\n     effective decision making; and develop a reliable process for \n     assessing the health value of new technologies.\n       The promise of these delivery system reform measures to \n     lower costs is the most humane avenue to a financially \n     sustainable health care system.\n       The American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes \n     Association, and the American Heart Association, joined by \n     Consumers Union, share a common objective: to reduce the toll \n     of chronic disease on individuals, families, and our nation. \n     Although coverage for all Americans is a vital component of \n     this change--a simultaneous effort aimed at securing high-\n     quality, cost-effective preventive care is equally important.\n       We believe that the time for comprehensive health care \n     reform has arrived and our organizations will work together \n     to help create a health care system capable of consistently \n     delivering the most effective, patient-centered care. These \n     efforts will improve the quality of life and health outcomes \n     for millions of people who suffer from a chronic disease, and \n     lead to more efficient use of our nation's health resources.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have been allocated 5 minutes. I ask the \nChair to let me know when 1 minute is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator. The \nSenator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today is April Fool's Day and the biggest \nprank I have seen so far is the one proponents of this budget are \ntrying to pull on the American taxpayer.\n  Proponents of this budget say the plan is transparent, but the \nauthors knowingly hide a stunning explosion in long-term debt by \nconveniently dropping the last 5 years of their budget.\n  Proponents of this budget say the plan cuts taxes for low- and \nmiddle-income families, but right there on page 32 is the blueprint for \na plan that would raise taxes on anyone who drives a car or heats their \nhome that probably includes almost everybody.\n  Proponents of this budget will say that it cuts spending, but this \nplan adds nearly $5 trillion to the public debt in just 5 short years.\n  Proponents of this budget say this plan is honest because for the \nfirst time it extends protections against the tenacious reach of the \nalternative minimum tax, but revenues from the AMT mysteriously \nreappear in 2013 and 2014.\n  Proponents of this budget will say it contains no reconciliation \ninstructions and preserves an important minority privilege. But this \nbudget doesn't preclude reconciliation either, and my colleagues know \nthat our brethren in the House of Representatives are banging on our \nChamber doors with a budget that does include reconciliation--which is \nodd because they don't need it at their end at all. They have a Rules \nCommittee that takes care of all that.\n  Now I know folks back home in Wyoming are listening to me, scratching \ntheir heads and saying ``what the heck is reconciliation and why should \nI care?'' Let me sum it up this way: reconciliation is the on-ramp to a \nnational energy tax. Reconciliation will make it impossible for me to \nprotect your family from higher energy prices. Reconciliation will make \nit impossible for me to protect your community from cost-cutting \nlayoffs. Reconciliation will make it impossible for me to make your \nvoice heard here in Washington, DC.\n  Reconciliation does not allow for a full and open debate. \nReconciliation does not allow a thorough vetting and amendment process. \nReconciliation's fast-track nature shuts out members of the minority \nparty and will shut out\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nmany centrist Democrats too. Reconciliation is the declaration that any \nidea other than the majority party idea has no place at the drafting \ntable--just as, so far, there has been no recognition of a Republican \nidea. I know all the ideas aren't great--but not even one?\n  As a former committee chairman and the co-author of many successful \nbipartisan bills, I know firsthand that ramming through reconciliation \nis not a successful model for good government, and it is certainly \ncounter to the way Senator Kennedy and I work together on the HELP \nCommittee. Senator Kennedy and I strive to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to achieve legislation that both sides can support. \nLaws like the Pension Protection Act, the Head Start reauthorization, \nand the MINER Act were hundreds of pages in length but passed with \nlittle dissent in the Senate. The budget resolution we have adopt for \nthe new fiscal year ought to follow a similar bipartisan model, \nespecially on issues like education and health care which are so \nimportant to the future of our Nation.\n  Misusing the reconciliation process to get a health care bill is not \nthe right approach and it conflicts with the new bipartisan spirit that \nPresident Obama has promised. A bill passed without work and agreement \nby both parties on the front end is more like a shotgun wedding than \nlegislating.\n  This budget includes a massive tax increase--$361 billion in explicit \ntax hikes and $1.3 trillion embedded in 27 different reserve funds. And \ndespite the ``Robin Hood'' rhetoric of taxing just the ``rich,'' the \ntax increases contained in this budget will hit all Americans. No one \nis spared: This budget raises taxes on energy. If you drive a car or \nheat your home, your taxes will go up. That comes under cap and trade, \nand there is a clever little thing in here which is where they get the \ntax cut from. They are going to raise your taxes on all the energy you \nuse, then they are going to give it back to you so you can pay for \nthat. But it will not be an equal distribution based on what you are \nusing.\n\n  This budget raises taxes on senior citizens who are dependent on \ndividend and capital gains income for the retirement income.\n  This budget raises taxes on charitable contributions at a time when \nwe need charity the most.\n  This budget reinstates the death tax, making it harder to keep the \nfamily ranch or family farm or family business in the family.\n  This budget raises taxes on small business. More than half of all \nsmall businesses that employ between 20 and 500 employees will see \ntheir tax bills rise and jobs eliminated. Small business is the \nincubator for entrepreneurship and we should protect it and nurture it, \nnot tax it. That is where the community donations come from.\n  And most foolish of all, none of this ``new'' money will help reduce \nthe deficit. Instead, this budget directs all new taxpayer money to the \nexpansion of big Government--more Government programs we can't afford.\n  I think a newspaper columnist, Diane Badget from Lovell, WY, said it \nbest when she wrote how her mother would react to what is happening in \nWashington today. Diane wrote, ``Momma always said, `If you don't have \nenough money to buy a quart of milk you don't take someone else's hard-\nearned cash and buy ice cream.' ''\n  The budget we are debating this week certainly would put us on the \nhook for a lot of figurative ice cream all right--all kinds of flavors. \nThis budget charts ominous new policy directions for healthcare, \neducation and energy.\n  I ask unanimous consent her entire article be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 2)\n  Mr. ENZI. Peter Orszag, Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, has argued that we need to fix health care in order to address \nour current economic crisis--a sentiment echoed by many in this \nChamber. But this argument misses an important point. If we enact the \nwrong health care fix, our budget crisis will get even worse. Simply \nthrowing more money at the problem--as this budget suggests--is not a \nsolution.\n  I am concerned about the direction of energy policy in this budget. \nThis budget leaves open the possibility of putting in place a carbon \ncap-and-trade system which will lead to higher energy prices for \nfamilies and small businesses. Enacting such a system is the equivalent \nof placing a national tax on energy usage. Raising energy prices at a \ntime when families are struggling to make ends meet just doesn't make \nsense.\n  I don't support Federal policies that will increase energy costs, \neven in good economic times, but it is especially troubling that the \nbudget lays the framework for this national energy tax when \nunemployment is above 8 percent and rising.\n  What we need to do now is prepare for the worst and hope for the \nbest. That is the way to make a better future because in the end this \nbudget isn't about numbers. It is about people. But this budget doesn't \nprepare us for the future. It robs from it.\n  America, this budget taxes too much, spends too much and borrows too \nmuch. I am not fooled by this budget and I hope you are not either.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Lovell Chronicle, Mar. 26, 2009]\n\n                          If Ma Was in Charge\n\n                           (By Diane Badget)\n\n       Gee, I wish my mom was in charge in Washington. Things \n     would be a lot different with her up there watching every \n     move. She had eyes in the back of her head and nothing got \n     past her radar.\n       Ma would have taken one look at the stimulus package and \n     had a fit. ``You have one minute to explain to me what you \n     were thinking. Your time started yesterday.''\n       She would have chewed out our president for spending so \n     many hours each day in front of TV cameras pushing his \n     inflated budget and stimulus package at the expense of \n     everything else. ``Barack,'' she would scold, ``you get out \n     of that TV set right now and let someone else have a turn. \n     For heaven's sake, you are a President now, not a candidate--\n     start acting like it.''\n       Boy, she would have let Congress have it! ``You kids have \n     until the count of three to stop that arguing and stomping \n     around. Don't make me come up there or you'll all be sorry!'' \n     There'd be a long pause and then she'd warn, ``I don't CARE \n     who started it--if I have to come up there I know who'll end \n     it!''\n       If Ma asked a plain question she'd expect a plain answer, \n     and that would mean accepting responsibility for mistakes \n     immediately. I can hear her now: ``Don't you be blaming this \n     mess on each other. I know when someone is wetting on my leg \n     and telling me it's a rainstorm.''\n       Ma didn't believe in complex ideas. Heck, I'm not even sure \n     she understood them. ``If you keep things simple,'' she'd be \n     telling the economists, ``you don't have so much to remember \n     and fix later.''\n       I don't think the banking executives would get by \n     unscathed, either. ``Now, fellas, how much sense does it make \n     to bounce a check and then send the bank another check to \n     cover your overdraft? You know better than that! If you can't \n     learn how to handle money then we need to rethink your \n     allowances.''\n       She would have rolled those incredible blue eyes and \n     questioned the experts. ``We have to jump start the banks, \n     jump start the auto industry, and jump start the economy? \n     Maybe it's time to stop jump starting and just replace the \n     stupid battery!''\n       Throwing good money after bad was a pet peeve of hers, and \n     she'd flat let the politicians hear about it. ``Doggone it! \n     If you drop a one dollar bill in the john and are dumb enough \n     to throw a five dollar bill in after it to see what's gonna \n     happen, don't whine when someone else comes along and flushes \n     the toilet.''\n       She wouldn't have cared that Congress has its own agenda \n     and that it has nothing to do with what she would think was \n     best. She'd hit the hallowed halls of the Capitol Building \n     yelling, ``As long as you are under MY roof you'll do as \n     you're told.''\n       Ma didn't believe in politics. She never voted. With an air \n     of superiority I once made the mistake of telling her that if \n     she didn't vote she really shouldn't be complaining about the \n     people who got elected. I don't remember much after that.\n       Senators and Representatives wouldn't stand a chance \n     against her common sense and strong moral fiber. She'd give \n     one of those guaranteed-to-have-you-regret-your-conception \n     looks and pull no punches. ``I don't care what the Speaker of \n     the House said to do. If she told you to jump off a cliff \n     would you do it?'' Um, no Ma, not with you at the bottom \n     ready to kick my behind when I landed.\n       She definitely wouldn't be happy about the amount of money \n     being discussed. ``What in the heck is wrong with you? If you \n     don't have enough money to buy a quart of milk you don't take \n     someone else's hard earned cash and buy ice cream.'' And she \n     never would have understood the concept of deficit spending. \n     ``You be careful with that money. When it's gone, it's \n     gone.''\n       If she'd known about the way health care reform would be \n     buried in the stimulus package she would I have come \n     uncorked. ``Alright, just for that little stunt I'm going to \n     sneak broccoli into everything you eat--and\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\n     you'll eat it and be grateful. There are thousands of \n     starving Americans who would be thrilled to have what you \n     have.''\n       She would have chewed them out for being wasteful and for \n     hoping that waste would somehow make things all better. \n     ``Garbage is garbage. No point in giving it a fancy name \n     because it won't change the smell.''\n       She'd look at all the palms outstretched waiting for their \n     share of the bailout and just shake her head. ``I told you \n     what would happen if you got too big for your britches,'' \n     she'd lecture. ``You got yourselves into this mess, so now \n     you get yourselves out.''\n       What Washington needs is a good dose of Ma. She'd get them \n     back on track. I think they've forgotten that you can't fill \n     up the bathtub unless you put the plug in the drain first.\n       Good Grief! It's finally happened. I sound just like my \n     mother! Thank you, Lord.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The current order is for the Senator from \nSouth Carolina to speak for 5 minutes, whom I do not see on the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Since he is not on the floor, I ask the way we would \nproceed is, Senator Barrasso wanted to speak in his stead--is that it--\nfor 5 minutes, followed by Senator Whitehouse, followed by me for 5 \nminutes, if that is OK?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 735\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Johanns \nclimate change amendment, No. 735. Budget reconciliation was designed \nto facilitate passage of legislation to reduce the deficit with a \nsimple majority. It was never meant to pass major policy initiatives \nsuch as cap and trade.\n  I was pleased to sign a letter written by both Senator Byrd and \nSenator Johanns opposing the idea of using budget reconciliation to \npass climate change. The letter has broad bipartisan support.\n  Cap and trade would be one of the most dramatic expansions of \nGovernment in American history. It is a trillion-dollar climate bailout \nscheme. This weekend, Thomas Friedman stated in the New York Times that \n``we need a climate bailout along with our economic bailout.'' I tend \nto disagree.\n  The American people, including my constituents in Wyoming, are very \nskeptical about any bailouts. So how important is climate change in the \ninterest of the American people? The Pew Research Center did a poll and \nthey showed that climate change ranked dead last with the public in \nterms of what was important to them. The American public is dealing \nwith the reality of an economic meltdown. This is a real and immediate \nproblem. Trillions of taxpayer dollars are being directed to stimulate \nthe economy. Every step Congress takes to spend additional funds is \nbeing watched closely, as it should be, by the American public.\n  We have passed numerous bailout bills over the past 6 months. We have \njust passed a $787 billion bailout for an economic plan intended to \nsave or create millions of jobs. The American people deserve the \nopportunity to have any climate bailout go through the regular order.\n  Frankly, the American people are demanding the opportunity to have a \nclimate bailout go through regular order. Such legislation should not \nbe enacted using procedures that limit debate and do not otherwise \nprovide the kind of transparency the people of this country want and \ndemand.\n  I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support the Johanns \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I want to respond very briefly before \nI yield to the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee on this question of reconciliation and climate change. \nOne really has to have had their sense of irony surgically removed to \nkeep a straight face on the Senate floor today as the party of \nreconciliation comes to the floor, over and over again, to complain \nabout the use of reconciliation.\n  The party of reconciliation is the Republican Party. They have used \nit 13 times. They used it for George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires. \nIf you have bloody hands from reconciliation, the Republican Party has \nblood above the elbows from reconciliation. Yet they come to the floor, \nas innocent as lambs, to say: Oh, my gosh, what a terrible thing it \nwould be if we used reconciliation for something important like \nprotecting the planet from climate change as opposed to just something \nlike, say, our favorite: tax cuts for billionaires.\n  I think climate change is a little bit too serious for that quality \nof rhetoric and debate. If the Republican Party in the Senate is \nwilling to stand and say that climate change is not real, then we can \nhave that discussion. But the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from \nIdaho and Senators across the other side of the aisle have all had \ntheir health directors from their home States come to the Environment \nand Public Works Committee to say that climate change is real, and it \nis dangerous for the health of their constituents. I think it is \nincumbent on us to do something about it. I don't think it is helpful \nto call it a bailout or to call it a tax. You could unwind the most \nvigorous rhetoric you like, but it doesn't change the point that we \nhave to do something about climate change.\n  The fundamental fact that they are defending and the fundamental \npoint that is lurking behind this rhetoric about bailout, rhetoric \nabout a tax, is they want to continue to make it free for industry to \npollute our atmosphere with carbon and greenhouse gases.\n  Behind it all, that is the proposition for which opposition to cap \nand trade stands. If you are opposed to cap and trade, then what you \nare saying is, it should be free, it should continue to be free for \nindustry to pollute our atmosphere and warm our planet and compromise \nthe quality of lives of our children. And we, as a party, the \nRepublicans are going to stand and defend that proposition.\n  Well, of course, they cannot say that. So they instead talk about \nbailouts and taxes. But I very much hope we will look behind that \nscreen, that we will treat this problem as a serious one, as it should \nbe treated, and if we need to go to reconciliation to solve it, well, \nby gosh, this would be a far better use of it than the tax rates for \nbillionaires that was the Republican's favorite use for reconciliation.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope America is watching this debate. I \nthink Senator Whitehouse was very on point when he exposed what the \nRepublicans are doing. We all know it is perfectly in order to utilize \nsomething called reconciliation, which is a way to get around a \nfilibuster, and it is the way to govern with a majority.\n  The fact is, as Senator Whitehouse has said, since 1980, \nreconciliation has been used 19 times, 16 times by my Republican \nfriends who now come to the floor and say: Oh, my God, we should not \nuse it for health care, we should not use it for climate change, we \nshould not use it at all.\n  They do not want to use it because they want to be able to obstruct \nprogress. Now, the reason I hope America is watching this debate is \nbecause they will see the difference in the parties. If you listen to \nthe Republicans, what are they saying?\n  No. We are not going to do any health care reform of any meaning. We \nare not going to do education reform of any meaning. We say no--they \nsay no--to global warming legislation. They say no to energy \nlegislation. They are the party of nope, and I am in the party of hope. \nHere is where we stand. Same old politics.\n  All they want is tax breaks for billionaires, tax breaks for \nmillionaires. We saw where that led us, along with the war in Iraq, \nbudget deficits as far as the eye could see, a recession that is as \nclose as we have come to the Great Depression.\n  Same old politics, same old policies that got us into this crisis in \nthe first place. So every time they speak, I urge you, America, to \nlisten. It is no. No. No. No. It is no to this new President who ran on \nfixing the education system. It is no to this President who ran on \nfixing the health care system. It is no to this President who ran on \ndoing something about global warming. It is no. No. No. No on energy \nreform.\n  This budget is so important to be passed because it is, in fact, \nbrought to\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nus by this new President who had a very strong debate with John McCain, \nwho won a convincing victory, who is off now taking his first foreign \ntrip. I hope that we can make that trip more pleasant for him by \nrallying around his priorities.\n  Now, we are going to be facing a slew of amendments that try to \nundermine and undercut President Barack Obama and the priorities I \ntalked about. We talked a little about reconciliation. When people \nlisten, they do not get what it means, so I will try and explain it. It \nis a way you can bring up a bill and avoid a filibuster. It is a way \nyou can bring up a bill and pass it with majority votes instead of a \nsupermajority vote.\n  That is a very important option for us to have when we are dealing \nwith very important issues. I think it is important to be stated right \nnow, important to be stated right now, that in this Senate budget there \nare no reconciliation instructions regarding climate change. There are \nno reconciliation instructions.\n  But the other side is not happy with that. They want to make sure we \ncan vote on it. So Senator Johanns has a very simple and \nstraightforward resolution that says: Reconciliation will not be used \nrelated to climate change. Senator Whitehouse and I have a side by side \nwith that that says: Fine, we will not use it unless the Senate finds \nthat the public health--I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Whitehouse and I, and I think the Presiding \nOfficer will be interested in this, have said: OK, we will not use \nreconciliation unless the Senate finds that the public health, the \neconomy, and national security are jeopardized by inaction on global \nwarming.\n  What we are doing is saying: If we find that our people are in danger \nbecause of inaction on global warming, and if we find we are facing a \nfilibuster from the Republicans on getting anything done, then we \nshould be able to use reconciliation and get around a filibuster. That \nis what we are saying.\n  Why did we put in here economy? It is very clear why we did that. \nBecause we believe if we turn out to be the only Nation in the world, \nin the industrialized world, that is doing nothing, this could hurt us. \nBecause other nations can say: Well, you know what. Until the United \nStates acts, we are not going to have free trade with the United \nStates. We can find ourselves isolated.\n  We could learn that as a result of inaction, we are not creating the \ngreen jobs that we should create and that business wants to create. We \nshould have that opportunity to come together and, with a majority \nvote, pass global warming legislation.\n  We could find out from the FBI, the CIA, our Defense Department that \ntensions are growing around the world due to global warming. We already \nsee in Darfur--and a lot of experts believe that is what has happened \nto the climate there and the fight over water there. We could learn \nthat our national security has worsened because of climate change.\n  We already know it is a major issue with the intelligence community. \nWhat Senator Whitehouse and I are saying in this side by side is, we \nwill not use this procedure unless we find out there is an emergency. \nWe hope colleagues will realize that to take a very legitimate tool off \nthe table is wrong.\n  The last point I wish to make is my colleagues on the Republican side \nkeep intimating and saying that any bill on climate change will involve \na tax. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are going to rebate \nfunds to people. We are going to rebate funds to our families.\n  We have turned our back on a tax. Although some of my Republican \nfriends said they would rather see a carbon tax, I rejected it. I do \nnot want a tax. I want to model climate change legislation after the \nacid rain legislation and set up a free market mechanism to put a price \non carbon.\n  So there is no tax. There is going to be a break for people. They are \ngoing to get rebates. Our States are going to get funded. So you can \nstand and call me a Republican. You can call me a Republican morning, \nnoon, and night. I am not a Republican. I am a Democrat. You can call \ncap and trade a tax morning, noon, and night. It is not a tax. It is \nthe opposite. It is an allowance.\n  It is a permit. It is a way to cap the amount of carbon going into \nthe air by requiring that people who pollute purchase the allowance to \npollute. Those funds will be given out to the people of the United \nStates of America as we transition to a clean energy future.\n  I did not expect this budget debate would turn into a battle about \nclimate change. But it has. I am here to say that I welcome this \ndebate. I am very proud that over in the other body, in the House, they \nhave begun their work on climate change. I look forward to seeing the \nprogress that is made over there.\n  In closing, I hope we will see support for the Whitehouse-Boxer \nalternative to the Johanns amendment. I hope, at the end of the day, we \nhave support for President Obama's very first budget. The people in \nthis country support our President. They support him over party lines. \nThose who are Independent support him.\n  This is his first budget, folks, his first chance to show to the \nAmerican people the priorities he laid out in his campaign and that are \nin this budget. Let's not forget it. If we support education and health \ncare and action to clean up this environment, if we support deficit \nreduction--which is part of this package--then let us support this \nbudget and let us defeat some of these nefarious amendments that are \nmeant to undermine our new President and this budget.\n  I yield back my remaining time and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Earlier, Senator Graham was in a unanimous consent \nagreement for 5 minutes. Other Senators were here at the time and took \nthe time. It would be appropriate if we allowed Senator Graham 5 \nminutes at this point. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Graham be \nallowed to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the chairman for the courtesy.\n  As we talk about different views of the budget, one thing I would \nlike to comment upon to the people of North Dakota, I have been very \nstruck and impressed by the way the people of North Dakota have come \ntogether with the flood. It looks like tough going there but a hearty \ngroup. We all wish them well. The two Senators from North Dakota \nrepresent their State well.\n  The Johanns amendment is what I would like to talk about a bit. This \nidea to most people of a debate about reconciliation probably is mind-\nnumbing and not very interesting. But there is a process in the \nCongress where you can take legislation and basically put it on a fast \ntrack. It is subject to 50 votes.\n  The Senate has served the country well. When you are in the majority, \nyou don't appreciate the minority's role too much. But the one thing \nabout the Senate, it changes hands fairly often.\n  The AIG legislation in the House where there is going to be a 90-\npercent tax on bonuses because people are upset--I can understand \npeople being upset about AIG, but that wasn't the right response, \ncreating a retroactive tax on a limited group of people because you are \nmad. The power to tax somebody is a pretty awesome power. It should be \nused in a constitutional and lawful way. Our friends in the House are \nup every 2 years, and sometimes they get carried away in the moment. I \nguess sometimes the Senate does as well.\n  The whole idea of the Senate kind of cooling things down has served \nthe country well. In that regard, to end debate you need 60 votes. If \n41 Senators are opposed to a piece of legislation, strongly enough to \ncome to the floor every day and talk about it, that legislation doesn't \ngo anywhere. I argue that is probably a good rule. There were times \nwhen we were in the majority that we didn't particularly like the\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nrule. But if 41 Senators from one party or a bipartisan group believes \nthat strongly, it is probably worth sitting down and thinking about.\n  If you took climate change and health care, two very controversial, \nbig-ticket items, and put them on the reconciliation track, you would \nbasically be doing a lot of damage to the role of the Senate in a \nconstitutional democracy.\n  Senator Byrd, who is one of the smartest people to ever serve in the \nSenate about rules and parliamentary aspects of the Senate, said that \nto put climate change and health care reform in reconciliation is like \n``a freight train through Congress'' and is ``an outrage that must be \nresisted.''\n  Senator Conrad said:\n\n       I don't believe reconciliation was ever intended for this \n     purpose.\n\n  I think both of them are right. Under the law, you cannot put Social \nSecurity into reconciliation because we know how controversial and \ndifficult that is. I come here in support of the Johanns amendment that \nrejects that idea.\n  Our majority leader said something a little bit disturbing. He said \nclimate change cap-and-trade revenues could be used to pay for health \ncare. If we put climate change in reconciliation, you have really \nabused the process and will create a bad climate for the Congress. \nThere is a lot of bipartisan support not to go down that road to abuse \nreconciliation. From the climate change debate, there are some \nDemocratic and Republican Senators who are opposed to 100 percent \nauction. We believe climate change is real but do not want to go down \nthe road the administration has charted. I believe manmade emissions \nare heating up the planet. But if you take the revenue stream from the \nclimate change bill to fund the Government, you will lose a lot of \nsupport for climate change. The money that is generated from a cap-and-\ntrade system should go back into the energy sector to allow people to \ncomply with the cost of a cap-and-trade system. The Obama proposal, \n$3,000 per family, is a very expensive proposal. There is bipartisan \nsupport for climate change legislation with a mix of auctions and \ncredits that could be done in a reasonable way.\n  The idea of putting climate change or health care in reconciliation \nwill bring the Congress to a halt. It would be everything opposite of \nwhat the President ran on in terms of bringing us together. There is a \nlot of Democratic push back for this idea. I applaud my Democratic \ncolleagues who think it is a bad idea because it is.\n  I do pledge to work on climate change. Health care will be tough. We \nwill certainly try that. But there is bipartisan support for climate \nchange legislation through the normal process. For those who disagree \nthat it is a problem, they can have their say and we can get the votes \nnecessary to put together a bipartisan climate change bill through the \nnormal process.\n  Senator Johanns from Nebraska has done the Senate a service by \nputting this amendment forward. I urge its adoption and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to indicate for all colleagues what \nis happening. We are about to go to a series of votes. It is not clear \nhow many in total. I would say it is probably at least nine, perhaps \nmore, rollcall votes. We are waiting for the unanimous consent \nagreement to be entered into.\n  When we start this process, we are going to have 2 minutes equally \ndivided before each amendment. We will start with the Lieberman-Collins \namendment and then go to the Alexander amendment, then the Sessions \namendment--at least this is the understanding at this point--then we \nwill proceed until all of the amendments have been dispensed with. \nThen, once those are completed, the ranking member and I will work on \nanother series of amendments to have in order.\n  This evening, there will be an opportunity for Members to present \ntheir amendments. We have not yet decided if they would be able to call \nthem up or just speak on them and then call them up tomorrow. This goes \nto the question of trying to make sure there is some fairness going \nback and forth between the two sides. We do not have a Sessions \nmodification on which we are waiting.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask if we could bring up some amendments. They would be \nvoted in the vote-arama, and I have no problem with that, not wanting a \nspecific vote before that, but we could get them up and get them \npending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We can't do that with amendments we have not yet seen.\n  Mr. COBURN. Every one of them has been filed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have 150 amendments that have been filed. Before we go \nto somebody to call up an amendment, we need to be able to see it \nbecause if we start the debate, we need, for the effective and \nefficient ordering of the debate, to be able to answer the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to speak on the budget until the \ntime should come up for the UC and not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to make certain that we have a chance to interrupt \nand go immediately to the votes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if we have a unanimous consent agreement, \nI will cease the discussion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Coburn be \npermitted to talk on the budget generally for up to 15 minutes, but if \nwe have the unanimous consent request ready to go, that he be \ninterrupted so we can get on to votes as quickly as possible because we \nare already 15 minutes behind schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, I have no problem with this. I \nwant to do two things. First, I want to make sure the Whitehouse-Boxer \namendment is at the desk and would be considered in order when we have \nanother tranche of votes later tonight. Is that done?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is in the unanimous consent request we are working \non. We have not yet agreed to the whole package, but it is in the \nproposal to be agreed on next.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I would ask, if Senator Coburn does use the full 15 \nminutes, I would like to have 5 minutes when he is done, if we are not \nvoting. And if we are, obviously, I do not need the 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first off, I thank the chairman for his \ngraciousness.\n  If you are sitting at home right now and you have a job and you see \nthe tough times that are out there, or you are sitting at home and \nlooking for a job, one of the things you are doing is you are starting \nto say: Here is what is coming in and here are the mandatory things \nthat have to go out, and you are starting to prioritize.\n  We have a budget before us that prioritizes two things. It \nprioritizes growing the Federal Government by a huge amount over the \nnext 10 years. If you were running a business and you were at these \ntimes, the last thing you would do is go borrow money to expand a \nbusiness into a market that is not growing. Yet we have before us the \nbiggest budget in the history of the country--a budget that will, in \nfact, double the debt that is going to our kids over the next 5 years \nand triple it over the next 10 years. It does not fit what any of us \nwould do with our own families' budgets or our own businesses' budgets.\n  Why is it we are afraid to say that what we really need to do is live \nwithin our means? Instead, we are going to have a $1.7 trillion, maybe \na $1.8 trillion, maybe even a $2 trillion deficit this year and \nsomething very close to that next year.\n  Instead of cutting some of the $380 billion of documented waste, \nfraud, and abuse associated with the Federal Government, we are not \nlooking at it at all. When President Obama ran for the office, he said \none of the things he was going to do was a line-by-line item analysis \nof every Department, at every area, to make sure it was effective and \nefficient at accomplishing the task it was set out to do. We have not \nseen any of that, and there is none of that in this budget. If, in \nfact, we were to do that, here is what we would find. We would find $50 \nbillion worth of wasted money at the Pentagon. There is no effort to do \nthat in this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator, we are now \nprepared to go forward with the unanimous consent request to set up the \nvotes, and if the Senator would permit us to do that, we could get an \nearlier start on the votes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would be happy to. I would like to have \n1 minute to wind up the one point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fair enough.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you.\n  We have $80 billion worth of fraud in Medicare. Yet we are going to \ntalk about health care, but we are not going to fix the problem with \nGovernment-run health care and the fraud that is associated with it. We \nhave $40 billion in Medicaid. There is no attachment to do that. So \nwhat we are doing is we are not trimming spending anywhere, we are \ngoing to raise taxes significantly, and we are going to grow the \nFederal Government in a time when we can least afford to grow it.\n  The idea that we can have prosperity out of the Government instead of \nout of our own individual efforts is counterintuitive to everything \nthis country stands for.\n  With that, I will carry on my debate at a later time, and I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \ncourtesy. It is gracious of him, as is typically the case with the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:20 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the amendments listed below and \nthat prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form; that after the first vote in this \nsequence, the succeeding votes be limited to 10 minutes each; that no \nintervening amendments or motions be in order during this vote sequence \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendments, except if a point of \norder is raised and a motion to waive the relevant point of order is \nmade; that all time consumed during the votes be counted against the \ntime remaining on the budget resolution; the order of the amendments is \nas follows: Lieberman-Collins No. 763, and that the purpose line be \nchanged as noted at the desk; Alexander No. 747; Sessions No. 772, and \nthat the amendment be modified with the changes at the desk; Casey No. \n783; Ensign No. 804; Kerry No. 732; Cornyn No. 806; Gregg No. 835; \nIsakson No. 762; Shaheen No. 776; Crapo No. 844; Reed No. 836; Johanns \nNo. 735; and Whitehouse-Boxer as a side by side with the Johanns \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, \ntraditionally--I think we ought to go back to the usual order on \nWhitehouse-Boxer. It being a second degree, it would go first.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, that is the typical order. Let's take a quick \npause, and we will check with the Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would refine my request to have the \nWhitehouse-Boxer amendment that is a side by side to Johanns be voted \non first, and then Johanns amendment No. 735.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, how did we \ndecide to deal with Senator Kyl's amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Kyl's amendment is awaiting a side by side from \nSenator Baucus.\n  Mr. KYL. That would be included within this list we have, however, \nwith or without the side by side?\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Then we will work diligently to come up with something \nthat is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate prior to \na vote on the Lieberman-Collins amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we would be willing to take the Lieberman-\nCollins amendment by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There would be no objection on this side to taking \nLieberman-Collins by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Lieberman-\nCollins amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Lieberman-\nCollins amendment?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 763) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 747\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, next is the Alexander amendment.\n  May I say to colleagues, if staffs are listening, Members are \nlistening, the Alexander amendment is next in line, then the Sessions \namendment, then the Casey amendment, then the Ensign amendment, then \nthe Kerry amendment, then the Cornyn amendment. It is very helpful if \nSenators are here when their amendments are called up. Also I say to \ncolleagues, after the first vote, we are going to be dealing with 10-\nminute votes.\n  So, again, we have done the Lieberman-Collins amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 747\n\n  The Alexander amendment is next, and Senator Alexander is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I understand I have 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is the runaway debt limit \namendment. It says 60 Senators have to agree before a budget can raise \nour national debt to more than 90 percent of U.S. gross domestic \nproduct, which this budget does every single year.\n  We saw this week the leverage a lender can have over a borrower when \nthe President of the United States fired the president of General \nMotors. Well, China, Japan, and Middle Eastern oil countries already \nown $1.4 trillion of U.S. debt. So vote yes on the runaway debt limit \namendment if you do not want China, Japan, and Middle Eastern oil \ncountries telling the United States how to run our business in the same \nway our Government is telling General Motors how to run its business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a well-motivated amendment, but I \nthink it is fatally flawed. The cure here is to make it harder to do a \nbudget. If we are serious about reducing deficits and debt, I think all \nof us would want to do everything we can to encourage a budget \nresolution because it contains the fundamental disciplines to prevent \ndeficits and debt from growing larger.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, while I understand the sentiment, \nand share in it, I think we all have to be concerned about burgeoning \ndebt. To make it harder to get a budget resolution, actually, I think \nundermines the effort to establish fiscal discipline because you lose \nall of the disciplines that are provided for in a budget resolution, \nall of the special points of order, the supermajority votes that are \nrequired to increase spending beyond what the budget resolution \nprovides.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Alexander amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 747.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 119 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 747) was rejected.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, this amendment would call for the level \nfunding of nondefense--my amendment earlier today was nonveteran \ndiscretionary spending--by leveling the funding for 2 years and having \na 1-percent growth for 3 years.\n  This is reasonable and responsible, No. 1. No. 2, let me recall to \nour colleagues the stimulus package that we passed a few weeks ago, \nwhich increases nondefense discretionary spending by an average of 30 \npercent over the next 3 years. We are not cutting our spending for \ndiscretionary accounts this year. We are seeing them surge. But in \nlight of the stimulus package, this will be an excellent way to contain \nspending and save $200 billion over 5 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, freezing domestic spending is a mistake at \na time of sharp economic downturn. You would be freezing education \nspending, freezing health care and transportation and freezing law \nenforcement.\n  Beyond that, the Senator sought earlier to freeze veterans, and then \nhe had an amendment to add back $1 billion for veterans. The problem \nis, the additional spending for veterans in the chairman's mark is $5.5 \nbillion. If you want to cut veterans $4.5 billion from the chairman's \nmark, vote for the Sessions amendment. If you want to keep veterans \nwhole, vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I thank the Senators who agreed to allow \nus to take their amendments by voice vote. I thank them for their \ncourtesy to their colleagues. Senator Casey, Senator Kerry, Senator \nIsakson, and Senator Shaheen set a very good example for our colleagues \nand we appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers of the \nbill. One of the amendments that was just accepted--and I want to make \nclear Senator Lugar is a cosponsor of it, together with Senator Corker \nand others on that side of the aisle.\n  This is an amendment that adds to the function 150 account. I want to \nmake clear to colleagues why that was so important. Secretary Gates, a \nyear and a half ago, while he was still Secretary serving with \nPresident Bush, said the following:\n\n       What is clear to me is that there is a need for a dramatic \n     increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national \n     security, diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign \n     assistance, civic action, and economic reconstruction and \n     development.\n\n  National Security Adviser Jim Jones, just the other day, mentioned \nthat we have huge warships off the coast of Lebanon, but Hezbollah is, \nin fact, gaining more foothold because they are building schools and \nbuilding homes and involved on the ground. Our diplomacy and our \nforeign policy needs to do that. With the acceptance of this amendment, \nhopefully, we are going to.\n  I thank the distinguished managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I remind our colleagues that these are 10-\nminute votes. This is sort of like the hors d'oeuvre for tomorrow. Get \nused to this. Please try to stick around.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Ensign is next.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 804\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 804 offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. The \nPresident, during his campaign, as well as during his speech to the \nNation--his first major speech to the Nation--promised Americans who \nmade less than $250,000 as a family that not one dime of their taxes \nwould be raised. Repeatedly he has said it, time and again, and he \nlisted taxes and basically said any taxes. That means direct and \nindirect taxes.\n  My amendment makes the Senate and the House keep that promise made by \nthe President.\n  There is going to be a point made that the Parliamentarian is going \nto rule that this threatens the nature of the budget resolution being a \nprivileged resolution. We submitted some questions to the \nParliamentarian. We asked him:\n\n       When was the last budget that lost its privileged status?\n\n  Never happened. We also asked:\n\n       Has one amendment ever resulted in a budget resolution \n     losing its privileged status?\n\n  That has never happened.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I hope we do not do that because if we \nstart adding time on both sides--\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Just 30 seconds to explain because we had a big \ndiscussion with the Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Because of the unusual nature of this, go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, just to finish, Senator Gregg offered \nearlier--because the Parliamentarian was saying that one amendment \ncould threaten but not necessarily kill this budget resolution, we \nasked the Parliamentarian to clarify. He said this has never happened. \nOne amendment has never brought down a budget resolution from a \nprivileged process. So do not make that as an excuse on this budget for \nstripping this amendment out of the conference report when it comes \nback, if it is adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Ensign amendment. \nI don't think any of us want to raise taxes on those earning less than \n$250,000 a year, and so I intend to vote for the Ensign amendment.\n  On the question of threatening the special status of the budget \nresolution, the Parliamentarian made clear this morning in a series of \nquestions that if we brought this matter back from conference, that \nwould threaten the privileged nature of a budget resolution. That would \nbe a very serious matter. But in the Senate, I intend to support the \nEnsign amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Last year, \nit got 58 votes, but it nevertheless was a strong bipartisan showing.\n  For my colleagues' information, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business supports this because they recognize what we all \nknow, and that is that small businesses are the economic engine that \ncreates jobs. Particularly in a tough economy, exactly the wrong thing \nto do is to raise taxes on the job creators, our small businesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, colleagues should know that the \nParliamentarian has told us that if this amendment comes back from the \nconference committee, it would endanger the special privilege of a \nbudget resolution.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nIsakson be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to move down \nthe road in resolving what is at the center of the problems which we \nhave as a nation for fiscal policy in the future, which is that we are \npassing on to our children a country they cannot afford, primarily \ndriven by the cost of entitlement programs. There are $66 trillion of \nunfunded entitlements.\n  This is a proposal to start to address that issue through using a \nfast-track procedure, with a bipartisan task force. The debate this \nmorning was about how that task force is structured. We believe, I feel \nstrongly, that the task force must be bipartisan or will not be viewed \nas fair.\n  In order to be bipartisan, a majority of both the minority members of \nthe task force and the majority members of the task force have to vote \nfor the proposal, whether or not there is going to be a membership \nwhich gives the majority a significant number of members more than the \nminority. But that minority membership has to vote as its group as a \nmajority. It is the only fair way to do this; otherwise, you could end \nup with a report where, let's say, there are six Republicans on the \ntask force and only two approve it. That would not work properly. We \nneed bipartisanship in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is actually a proposal that Senator \nGregg and I have made. But this is at variance from our earlier \nagreement. Let me explain why. We talked about a membership of 16, 8 \nDemocrats and 8 Republicans. But that is when the Republicans \ncontrolled the White House; Democrats controlled the House and the \nSenate.\n  Now Democrats have more numbers in the House and the Senate and \ncontrol the White House. Yet the requirement of this task force is that \nthe bipartisan task force, to report, has to have majority approval of \neach participating party.\n  That gives our friends who are in the minority an unfair ability to \ninfluence the outcome. That does not recognize the political reality of \nthe Senate controlled by Democrats, the House controlled by Democrats, \nthe White House controlled by Democrats.\n  Absolutely it should be bipartisan. But it should not be something \nthat weights both parties the same. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Madam President, this amendment is straightforward. One of \nthe reasons Congress cannot control its runaway spending is that we \nalways have 5-year budgets, where the tough decisions are made in the \noutyears, and in the first year of the budget, we don't make any tough \ndecisions. This amendment will put a cap on the nondefense \ndiscretionary spending for the first 3 years of this budget using the \nvery numbers of the budget.\n  Why do we want to do this? Look at the budget. In the first year of \nthis budget, nondefense discretionary spending grows by 7.3 percent. It \nis true that in the second and third and outyears, that rate of growth \nis projected to go down to under 2 percent. But we never get to the \nsecond year of any of our budgets because next year we will come back \nand start all over. We will have a budget where all the pain is in the \noutyears and the first year doesn't make any hard choices. We need to \nsupport this effort to put some teeth into the budget, put caps on at \nleast the first 3 years of the numbers this budget proposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I urge colleagues to vote against this \namendment. At this time of extraordinary uncertainty, multiyear caps \nare especially unwise. Beyond that, we have a 1-year cap. This is a \nbudget that will be revisited next year. A 1-year cap makes sense. \nMultiyear caps at a time of this uncertainty would be most unwise.\n  I urge colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer this amendment \nwith my colleague, Senator Snowe of Maine. It is a bipartisan amendment \nthat would increase funding for LIHEAP from $3.2 billion to $5.1 \nbillion. That $5.1 billion is the total we spent this year.\n  This is a program critical to seniors, critical to low-income people. \nWith unemployment rates soaring in double digits, there are more and \nmore people who will qualify. If we do not raise this ceiling, \napproximately 1.5 million households will lose help with their heating \nbills, not only in the wintertime but in the hot months in the areas of \nthe Southwest and Southeast because they, too, benefit from LIHEAP.\n  Mr. President, I would be prepared to accept a voice vote, hopefully \na very positive voice vote.

Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this amendment requires the Senate to balance, on the \none hand, the newfound concern of our Republican colleagues about the \nreconciliation procedure they have used no less than 14 times for \npurposes such as raising the national debt to give America's suffering \nbillionaires a tax cut against, on the other hand, jeopardy to the \neconomy, to the public health or to the national security of the United \nStates.\n  It allows the reconciliation procedure to be considered if the Senate \nfinds that inaction on climate change will jeopardize the public \nhealth, the economy or the national security of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the economy, the national \nsecurity, and the public health of the United States. I call up the \namendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 202 is amended by inserting at the end the \n     following: ``(c) The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the \n     Budget shall not revise the allocations in this resolution if \n     the legislation provided for in subsections (a) or (b) is \n     reported from any committee pursuant to section 310 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974,'' unless, the Senate finds \n     that public health, the economy and national security of the \n     United States are jeopardized by inaction on global warming.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote against this \namendment. I ask them to vote against this amendment because it is \nimportant for Senate tradition.\n  Some weeks ago, a man whom I respect a tremendous amount, Senator \nByrd, and I circulated a letter. It was directed to the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. It simply said: Please don't use reconciliation to \npass complex legislation such as climate change. We got over 30 \nsignatures on that--very bipartisan. We had Democrats and we had \nRepublicans join in that.\n  If we allow this amendment to pass, basically what we are saying is, \nunder the terms of this language, a majority of Senators can arrive and \nsimply take away our ability to have a robust debate, to have the \nability to debate this issue the way it deserves, and this is \nenormously significant legislation.\n  So I ask my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. It is important \nto the tradition of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the pending amendment is not germane to \nthe measure now before the Senate. I raise a point of order under \nsection 305(b)2 of the Budget Act.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the \npoint of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for \npurposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me thank my colleagues for their \nthoughtful approach to a very important issue.\n  What this amendment essentially does is say that the budget \nreconciliation process will not be used to pass climate change \nlegislation. There are many in this body who can talk about this \ninstitution and the importance of approaches such as this.\n  Budget reconciliation was designed to reduce the deficit. It was \nnever designed to pass complex legislation such as climate change. What \nthis amendment does is it very clearly says that. It simply says \nreconciliation will not be used for that process.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment. It is enormously \nimportant. I think it is an enormously important statement for this \ninstitution.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, I wish to give you two reasons to vote \nno on this important, precedent-setting issue. Why would we start down \nthis road taking a legal Senate procedure off the table? Have we ever \ndone this before? We have looked it up and the answer is no.\n  On the contrary, let me tell you when the Republicans used \nreconciliation. They used it 14 times in the 19 times it has been \nused--to cut food stamps, to cut energy assistance, to cut impact aid, \nto cut title I, to cut dairy price supports, and to cut the Social \nSecurity minimum benefit.\n  Did I ever hear any of them then say: Oh, my goodness, reconciliation \nshould not be used. Oh, no, which brings me to my second reason for \nvoting no on this: hypocrisy and duplicity. Let me tell you what else \nthe Republicans used it for: to cut Federal civilian and military \nretirement and disability COLAs, to delay and cut disaster loans to \nfarmers. Let's stand tall for what we have a right to have, our rules. \nThank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on amendment No. 793.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, my amendment prohibits Federal rationing of \nhealth care. A provision of the stimulus bill has raised a lot of \nconcern. Madam President, $1.1 billion has been allocated for \ncomparative effectiveness research.\n  Here is the exact effective language from my amendment:\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall not use \n     data obtained from the conduct of comparative effectiveness \n     research to deny coverage of an item or service under a \n     Federal health care program.\n\n  That is all it does. Some say: Why do you need that? We are never \ngoing to do that.\n  Well, then, we might as well say we are not going to do that. But \nwhen it came to Medicare Part D, we wanted to be sure we did not \nwithhold coverage of a prescription drug, and as a result we provided \nthat kind of language.\n  Just last Thursday, the Acting Director of the NIH talked about \nresearch in terms of guiding future policies that support the \nallocation of health resources for the treatment of acute and chronic \ndiseases. That is deciding what to cover and not cover.\n  My amendment does not prevent the Secretary from protecting patients \nfrom unsafe or ineffective drugs. It is simply about using this kind of \nresearch to ration health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is a rather remarkable amendment. \nIt basically says we cannot pay any attention to the fruits of clinical \nresearch in making decisions about what is covered under health care \nreform. I find that pretty amazing.\n  For example, let's say that clinical research shows a certain \nprocedure is not only not good but it is harmful, such as Vioxx, which \ncaused problems for seniors. This amendment says we cannot use that \nevidence. We cannot use that information. We can't do that because it \nmight suggest we can't use a certain procedure--Vioxx.\n  This is an ostrich amendment. This is a head-in-the-sand amendment. \nWe want to have the benefits of clinical research so that doctors can \nmake up their own minds what is the best procedure. We want the fruits \nand the benefit of clinical research to address the quality of health \ncare.\n  I urge Members to vote for health care and vote against this \namendment.\n  I might say, too, Madam President, that I misspoke earlier when I \nsaid who is a cosponsor of the bill. We are urging Senators Enzi and \nHatch to cosponsor the bill. They haven't quite done that yet, but I \nthink it is going to happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 806\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, everyone in this body knows that small \nbusinesses are an extremely important dynamic part of the U.S. economy. \nI like to say that small business is the engine that drives the U.S. \neconomy. President Obama agrees that small businesses have generated 70 \npercent of net new jobs over the past decade. I was pleased to see that \nSenator Cornyn's small business amendment passed earlier tonight by an \noverwhelming vote of 82 to 16.\n  America's small businesses have been suffering during this recession. \nBig banks have been cranking down lending to small businesses.\n  In addition, job losses for small businesses have been staggering. A \nnational employment report released today by Automatic Data Processing \nshows that 742,000 nonfarm private sector jobs were lost from February \nto March 2009. Of those 742,000 lost jobs, 614,000, or 83 percent, were \nfrom small businesses. Let me repeat that. From February to March, \nsmall businesses lost 614,000 jobs, or 83 percent of all nonfarm \nprivate sector job losses.\n  The President's recent efforts to increase lending to the small \nbusiness sector are commendable. The centerpiece of his small business \nplan will allow the Federal Government to spend up to $15 billion to \npurchase the small-business loans that are now hindering community \nbanks and lenders. However, the positives that will come to small \nbusinesses from these loans which will ultimately have to be paid back \nwill be heavily outweighed by the negative impact of the President's \nproposed tax increases. Helping small businesses get loans just to take \nthat money back in the form of tax hikes is not wise.\n  The President's Budget proposes to raise the top two marginal rates \nfrom 33 percent and 35 percent to 40 percent and 41 percent \nrespectively, when PEP and Pease are fully reinstated. President \nObama's marginal rate increase would mean an approximately 20 percent \nmarginal tax rate increase on small business owners in the top two \nbrackets.\n  Many of my friends on the other side will say that while they agree \nthat successful small businesses are vital to the success of the U.S. \neconomy, the marginal tax increases for the top two brackets will not \nhave a significant negative impact on small businesses.\n  Proponents of these tax increases seek to minimize their impact by \nreferring to Tax Policy Center data that indicate about 2 percent of \nsmall business filers pay taxes in the top two brackets. They argue \nthat a minimal amount of small business activity is affected.\n  However, there are two faulty assumptions to this small business \nfiler argument.\n  The first faulty assumption is that the percentage of small business \nfilers is static. In fact, small businesses move in and out of gain and \nloss status depending on the nature of the business and business cycle. \nAlso, the 2 percent figure from the Tax Policy Center is\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\nwell below the percentage actually reported by the Government. For \nexample, a 2007 Treasury study states that, for flow-through businesses \nin 2006, 7 percent to 9 percent of small business owners paid the top \ntwo marginal rates.\n  The second faulty assumption is that the level of small business \nactivity, including employment, is proportionate to the filer \npercentage.\n  According to NFIB survey data, 50 percent of owners of small \nbusinesses that employ 20 to 249 workers would fall in the top two \nbrackets. According to the Small Business Administration, about two-\nthirds of the Nation's small business workers are employed by small \nbusinesses with 20 to 500 employees.\n  Do we really want to raise taxes on these small businesses that \ncreate jobs and employ two-thirds of all small business workers? With \nthese small businesses already suffering from the credit crunch, do we \nreally think it is wise to hit them with the double-whammy of a 20-\npercent increase in their marginal tax rates?\n  Newly released data from the Joint Committee on Taxation demonstrates \nthat in 2006, the last year for which data is available, 65 percent of \nthe flow-through business income was earned by those making over \n$250,000. That flow-through business income will be subject to this \nbudget's tax increases. This is a conservative number because it \ndoesn't include flow-through business owners making between $200,000 \nand $250,000 that will also be hit with the budget's proposed tax \nhikes.\n  If the proponents of the marginal rate increase on small business \nowners agree that a 20 percent tax increase for half of the small \nbusinesses that employee two-thirds of all small business workers is \nnot wise, then they should either oppose these tax increases or present \ndata that show a different result.\n  Madam President, today is April 1. It is known as April Fools Day. It \nis a day when folks play jokes on one another. But the state of our \njob-creating machinery, small business America, is no joke.\n  Sadly, Senators Kerry and Snowe found out in a Small Business \nCommittee hearing a short time ago that small business is getting the \nshort end of the stick from the big banks. I suspect the treatment is \neven worse when the big banks getting the bailout money is considered. \nI put that question to the TARP oversight team the other day in a \nFinance Committee TARP oversight hearing.\n  I told one of the witnesses, Professor Warren from Harvard, that we \nSenators need to stand behind the oversight committee, so that we can \nget answers from the Treasury.\n  In any event, it seems to me that we need to step back from the big \npieces of recent economic policy and take a look at the big picture. We \nneed to look at what we are doing. The three pieces I am referring to \nare the TARP program, the stimulus bill, and this budget. All of these \nefforts involve trillions of taxpayer dollars.\n  If our goal is doing the best we can to get jobs to every American \nwho wants a job, then we need to recalibrate our actions. We ought to \nfocus, as President Clinton once said, like a laser beam on job \ncreation.\n  President Obama and all of us agree at least 70 percent of new jobs \ncome from small business. Let's take a look at how each of these three \nmajor pieces of legislation affects small business. On TARP, it looks \nlike we need to make sure that the TARP recipients are providing credit \nto small business. On stimulus, less than one-half of 1 percent of the \n$787 billion went to small business tax relief. Less than one-half of 1 \npercent.\n  Now, on the budget, 82 Senators, a big bipartisan margin, agreed with \nSenator Cornyn that we ought to not raise taxes on small business. \nSenator Snowe, likewise, will be pressing the case for small business \nin a separate amendment.\n  It may be April Fools Day, but this is no joke. We need to keep our \neye on the job creation ball. Rather than hitting a foul ball with \ntaxes on small business, we can hit a home run if we leave their taxes \nlow. Future jobs depend on it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of the budget resolution on Thursday, \nApril 2, there be 90 minutes remaining for debate, equally divided \nbetween the chair and ranking member or their designees, with 40 \nminutes of that time for debate with respect to the McCain substitute \namendment, with 20 minutes deducted from each manager, with the time \nfor debate on the McCain amendment equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form; that for the remainder of today's session, no sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendments be in order to the budget resolution; that for \nthe remainder of this evening, members be permitted to debate \namendments they expect to offer during Thursday's session; that on \nThursday, with respect to a vote sequence of amendments, the sequence \nwould be established with the chair and ranking members concurring on \nany order; that during any sequence of votes established, there be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote, equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form; that after the first vote in any sequence, the \nremaining votes would be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, for the information of my colleagues on \nmy side of the aisle, we intend to proceed, and I will list the \nspeakers that we have this evening who have informed us that they wish \nto have time. Tomorrow, when we start the voting sequence, their \namendments will be in order relative to the sequence that they are \nspeaking here tonight; so the purpose of that being they do not have to \ncall up their amendment tonight to protect their position in the order.\n  We are going to begin with Senator McCain for 15 minutes. It is \nunderstood that there will be alternating speakers. On our side: \nMcCain, 15 minutes; Senator Vitter, 10 minutes; Senator Coburn for 10 \nminutes; Hutchison for 10 minutes; Bennett for 10 minutes; Senator \nBrownback for 10 minutes; Senator Snowe for 10 minutes; Senator \nBarrasso for 10 minutes.\n  That is not a unanimous consent request. That is for the information \nof my colleagues. Actually, I ask unanimous consent that this evening, \nas these people arrive, these Senators be granted those times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, in the morning, after the McCain \namendment is disposed of, Senator Sanders would be the first to be able \nto offer an amendment on our side.\n  For the information of Senators, tomorrow will be the so-called vote-\narama. That means Senators need to be ready to answer votes every 10 \nminutes, and we will try to move expeditiously and with dispatch.\n  We thank all Senators for their cooperation today, and I think next \nup is Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 882\n\n       (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 882.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, tonight I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Coburn, Graham, and Hutchison to offer an amendment that will \nserve as an alternative to the 5-year budget offered by the chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee and the 10-year budget offered by the \nPresident. Except for defense and veterans affairs, our proposal would \ncap discretionary funding, reduce our Nation's deficit and debt more \nthan the proposals offered either by the Senate Budget Committee or the \nPresident.\n  This 10-year budget alternative would cap discretionary funding at \nbaseline levels, plus inflation, except for defense and veterans. \nDefense is increased by $190 billion above baseline over 5 years. \nVeterans is increased by $25 billion above baseline over 5 years,\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\nand other discretionary spending, $62 billion less than the Senate \nbudget proposal over 5 years, $229 billion less than the President's \nproposal over 5 years, and $759 billion less than the President's \nproposal over 10 years. Mandatory spending is $373 billion less than \nthe Budget Committee proposal over 5 years, $922 billion less than the \nPresident's proposal over 5 years, and $3.2 trillion less than the \nPresident's proposal over 10 years.\n  The deficit would be at $484 billion in 2014, the Conrad budget, the \nSenate Budget Committee budget deficit would be $508 billion, the \nPresident's would be $749 billion. It would be $448 billion by the year \n2019, compared with the President's $1.189 trillion deficit over 10 \nyears, and the Senate Budget Committee proposal is a 5-year budget.\n  This results in a cumulative deficit reduction of $369 billion more \nthan the Senate budget proposal, $977 billion more in reductions than \nthe President's proposal, and $3.44 trillion--the deficit would be \nreduced--than the President's budget.\n  The national debt would be $767 billion less than the Budget \nCommittee over 5 years, $2 trillion less than the President's budget \nover 5 years, and $3.5 trillion less than the President's over 10 \nyears. In other words, why, why are we offering this alternative? It is \nsimple. Our current national debt is $10.7 trillion. I know when we \nthrow these numbers around, like $10.7 trillion, people's eyes glaze \nover.\n  But we are talking about numbers that are unprecedented in the \nhistory of this country. The projected deficit for 2009 is $1.7 \ntrillion. The total cost of the stimulus bill enacted last month is \n$1.18 trillion. We gave the TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, \n$700 billion. Everyone expects the administration will request up to an \nadditional $75 billion more.\n\n  President Obama recently signed an Omnibus appropriations bill \ntotaling $410 billion. The Federal Reserve recently pumped another $1.2 \ntrillion into our markets, and the President's budget request totals \n$3.6 trillion.\n  Earlier this week the administration laid out a plan that will \nprovide even more taxpayer dollars to the domestic automakers. The \nmeasure offered by the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nincreases spending by $225 billion over current levels and raises at \nleast $361 billion in taxes and borrows $1.1 trillion more than what we \nexpect to borrow under current law.\n  The President's budget doubles the public debt in 5 years and nearly \ntriples it in 10 years. As a consequence, beginning in 2019, the \nGovernment will spend more on interest than on the defense of our \nNation: $806 billion we will be spending on interest, $720 billion on \ndefense. That is eight times more than we will spend on education, \neight times more than we will spend on transportation.\n  The budget proposals offered by the President and by the Senate \nBudget Committee put us on an unsustainable fiscal path, and we will \npass on to future generations unprecedented levels of debt that they \nwill never be able to afford.\n  As I said on the floor of the Senate earlier this week, the \nPresident's budget numbers are staggering. On average, his budget adds \n$1 trillion to the debt every year for the next 10 years and contains \n$1.4 trillion in tax increases. It reinstates the death tax, and it \ndiscourages investment by raising taxes on capital gains and dividends. \nIt would create more debt than under every President from George \nWashington to George W. Bush combined. As others have already warned, \nthe Nation would be bankrupt. This is not just generational theft, it \nis multigenerational theft.\n  That we are on a dangerous path is not just my opinion, in fact, it \nhas been acknowledged by the President's Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. In a recent interview, Peter Orszag was asked to \nrespond to this statement:\n\n       What deficit hawks are really saying is that the number is \n     so huge that it is literally going to swarm over us and \n     destroy us if we do not start dealing with it today.\n\n  Mr. Orszag replied:\n\n       There is no question that we are on an unsustainable fiscal \n     course, and we need to change course.\n\n  The Federal budget must address the most pressing issues facing our \nNation, and among these priorities are keeping Americans safe and our \nNation secure and all of the other issues with which we are familiar.\n  The budget must also ensure that taxpayers' dollars are managed in \nthe most fiscally responsible manner by targeting resources to \npriorities, spending no more than needed, and holding their Government \naccountable to the taxpayer. This is exactly what our alternative will \ndo. Our plan meets America's needs by spending less and reducing the \ndebt faster than the Democrats' proposals. It caps discretionary \nspending, except for defense and veterans, at baseline, and increases \ndefense spending by $190 billion. I would point out we are still in two \nwars.\n  It also increases veterans spending by $25 billion over 5 years. It \nreduces the deficit to $484 billion by 2014, compared to the Budget \nCommittee's $508 billion and the President's $749 billion. It keeps \ntaxes low, and it shaves, by 2014, $767 billion more off the national \ndebt than Chairman Conrad's 5-year budget and nearly $3.5 trillion more \nthan the President's 10-year budget.\n  Today, the ranking member of the House Budget Committee unveiled the \nRepublican alternative to the House budget resolution. In an op-ed \nabout his plan in today's Wall Street Journal, Representative Paul Ryan \nwrote:\n\n       House Republicans will offer an alternative plan. This too \n     is no ordinary budget. As the opposition party, we believe \n     this moment must be met by offering the American people a \n     different way forward--one based on our belief that America \n     is an exceptional nation, and we want to keep it that way. \n     Our budget applies our country's enduring first principles to \n     the problems of our day. Rather than attempting to equalize \n     the results of people's lives and micromanaging their \n     affairs, we seek to preserve our system of protecting our \n     natural rights and equalizing opportunity for all.\n\n  I agree with Congressman Ryan's assessment, and that is why we are \nhere tonight. My friends on the other side of the aisle have become \nfond of criticizing Republicans for just saying no and offering no \nalternatives or specifics.\n  Well, we offered an alternative on the stimulus package. We offered \nan alternative on the omnibus bill. And we will continue, as members of \nthe loyal opposition, to propose alternatives, complete with specifics \nand reflecting our philosophy as fundamentally fiscal responsible. I \nhope this will put an end once and for all to that argument.\n\n  Our proposal budgets for 10 years. It achieves lower deficits than \nthe Democratic plan in every year. By 2019, it yields nearly half the \ndeficit proposed by the President. In doing so, we control Government \ndebt so that under our plan, debt held by the public is $3.5 trillion \nless during the budget period. It gives priority to national defense \nand veterans health care. It addresses our critical energy goals. It \ntakes steps to ensure health and retirement security by making these \nproblems fiscally sustainable while preserving existing Medicare \nbenefits for those beneficiaries age 55 and older. It does not raise \ntaxes and extends the 2001 and 2003 tax laws. The nearly identical \nproposals of the House and Senate Republicans share the same goals of \nattaining health and retirement security, controlling our Nation's \ndebt, putting our economy on a path of growth, and preserving the \nAmerican legacy of leaving the next generation better off.\n  We obviously are living in perilous economic times, but we will \nemerge from this period with strong job growth, rising incomes, \nrestored confidence, and the ability to meet our obligation of passing \non to the next generation the opportunity to make their lives safer, \nmore prosperous, and more enriching than our own. We are dealing with a \nfinancial crisis, a housing crisis, and a consumer-led recession. Why \nthen does the President's budget envision borrowing trillions of \ndollars for new initiatives without spending discipline or offsets? \nAddressing our most important and immediate problems should be our \nurgent priority. For two centuries, Americans have worked hard so their \nchildren could have better lives and greater opportunity. Are we going \nto reverse that order and force our children to work hard to pay off \nour debts because we didn't have the courage to make tough economic \nchoices now? That is what this alternative is about--tough but \nrealistic decisions designed to secure the future prosperity of our \ncountry. We were\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\npromised change, and that is what our proposal offers.\n  In the op-ed I mentioned earlier, Congressman Ryan also wrote that \n``America is not the greatest nation on earth by chance. We earned this \ngreatness by rewarding individual achievement, by advancing and \nprotecting natural rights, and by embracing freedom. We (Republicans) \nintend to continue this uniquely American tradition.'' The Congressman \nis exactly right. We have an opportunity to put our Nation back on \nsound fiscal footing. Let us seize that opportunity. Let us propose, \nreason, debate and exhaust every means to invest in the future of this \ncountry according to our faith in free people and free markets, a faith \nthat has produced more good for more people than ever imagined by our \nForefathers. Let us not exploit this crisis for political gain. Let us \ndo what every preceding generation has managed to do--bequeath \nsubsequent American generations a land of unlimited opportunities.\n  We can, and must do better, I urge my colleagues to support this \nalternative proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record other \nprovisions in this proposal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Our proposal also includes:\n       RESERVE FUNDS FOR:\n       BRAC-like Social Security and Medicare & Medicaid \n     Commissions that would provide recommendations to reduce \n     mandatory spending by at least 4 percent over the next 5 \n     years, and 7 percent over the next decade.) For the purposes \n     of this Resolution, for individuals 55 or older, Medicare \n     will not be changed (other than income-relating to the \n     prescription drug benefit).\n       Sense of the Senate to Protect Seniors. This budget should \n     preserve existing Medicare benefits for those beneficiaries \n     age 55 or older (other than means testing for high-income \n     beneficiaries under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. \n     To make the program sustainable and dependable, those 54 and \n     younger should be able to enroll in a new Medicare Program \n     with health coverage similar to what is now available to \n     Members of Congress and Federal employees. Starting in 2021, \n     seniors should receive support payments based on income, so \n     that low income seniors receive extra support, and high \n     income seniors receive support relative to their incomes.\n       Comprehensive health reform legislation that reduces the \n     costs, increases access to health insurance, and improves \n     quality of care for Americans.\n       Enhanced eligibility for disabled military retirees and \n     their survivors to receive retired pay, veterans' disability \n     compensation, and survivor benefit plan annuities.\n       Energy security activities, including funding for waste \n     storage alternatives, clean energy deployment, refurbishing \n     the transmission grid and increasing the use of nuclear \n     power.\n       Tax code modernization, including income (includes AMT \n     revenue) and payroll tax reform that makes the tax code fair, \n     more pro-growth, easier to administer, improves compliance, \n     and aids U.S. international competitiveness.\n       Defense acquisition and contracting reform.\n       Bipartisan and comprehensive investigation into the \n     underlying causes of the current economic crisis and to \n     recommend ways to avoid another crisis.\n       ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS:\n       Point of Order against mandatory spending legislation that \n     increases the deficit until the President submits and \n     legislation is enacted to restore solvency to the Social \n     Security system.\n       Point of Order against a budget resolution containing a \n     debt held by the public-to-GDP ratio that exceeds 65%.\n       Point of Order against a budget resolution containing \n     deficit levels exceeding 8% of GDP.\n       Additional provisions include discretionary spending \n     limits, program integrity initiatives, and points of order \n     against advance appropriations and legislation increasing \n     short-term deficit.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. We, as the loyal opposition, are required to offer an \nalternative to the President's budget and that passed by the Senate \nBudget Committee on a party-line vote. These are tough decisions that \nhave to be made. We must continue to fund defense and take care of our \nveterans. But we are also going to have to reform entitlement programs, \nand we all know that. There is no expert or ordinary citizen in America \nwho doesn't agree that we have to reform Medicare, Social Security, and \nother mandatory spending programs which are consuming a larger part of \nour budget. We need a bipartisan commission that has the BRAC \nimperatives, that they meet and we come up with a solution to the \nburgeoning fiscal problems posed by entitlement programs and other \nmandatory spending programs.\n  I was in the other body in 1983, when Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill \nsat down together across the table and negotiated and saved Social \nSecurity for decades. That is what we need to do again. After this \nbudget debate is over, why don't we sit down, the President, \nRepublicans, and Democrats, together, and try and solve our Nation's \nproblems. Americans voted for change. Americans want change. That \nchange is to address these compelling and terrible issues that affect \nthis Nation and our future in a bipartisan fashion. It is pretty clear \nwhat is going to pass tomorrow night sometime, but wouldn't it be time \nfor us to sit down together and chart a path for the Nation's future in \nan environment committed to fiscal responsibility on both sides of the \naisle and ensuring our children's future?\n  We will be discussing this more for a short period of time before the \nvote tomorrow.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 759\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have listened with interest to the \ncomments of the Senator from Arizona. I would like to point out one \nfact to fellow Senators and to the country: In this proposed budget, \nthere is roughly $2.2 trillion worth of revenue. There is also roughly \n$2.2 trillion worth of mandatory spending. The mandatory spending eats \nup all the revenue. That means everything else we spend in a \ndiscretionary way--and that includes defense--is going to come out of \nborrowed money. That is the first time we have ever had that situation \noutside of wartime. It is a cautionary note. I salute the Senator from \nArizona for his remarks.\n  I rise to comment upon an amendment I have submitted, No. 759. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Hatch be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. This amendment deals with the tax treatment of \ncharitable contributions. In the trillions of dollars we have been \ntalking about today, it may seem a relatively small amount. But to the \npeople who are involved in it, it becomes a very major issue. It is \nworth focusing on. As I have said before, I have been called upon by \narts organizations in the State of Utah that are very concerned that \nthe contributions that keep them alive have dropped off as a result of \nthe slowing down of the economy. They are hoping they might recover \nsome of that dropoff from Federal dollars. Interestingly enough, the \nPresident's proposal calls for a reduction in the tax incentive for \npeople to give money to charitable contributions. So the President is \nproposing something that will hurt the charities, will cause their \nincome to go down in the name of fiscal responsibility and saying we \nneed more Federal money, so let's change the tax treatment so we get \nmore Federal money from those who would otherwise contribute to \ncharitable contributions, and then turns around and watches the \ncharities come in and say: We have to make that up or we will have to \nstart laying off people. The President talks about saving jobs. The \nnonprofits provide over 10 million jobs. If they cannot get the money \nfrom their contributors and they cannot get the money from the Federal \nGovernment, they will lose jobs. It is foolish for us to say: All \nright, in the name of fiscal responsibility, let's take the money away \nfrom the contributors and bring it into the Federal coffers and then, \nto save the jobs, let's take the money out of the Federal coffers and \ngive it to the charities so the Federal Government becomes the \ndecisionmaker as to which charities get the money rather than the \npeople themselves.\n  Charitable giving is an almost unique American experience. As we look \nat other countries around the world, they do not have the level of \ncharitable contributions we have. We contribute an enormous amount to \nnonprofit organizations, and we do it on the basis of what we want to \nsupport. We, unlike European nations, do not have governmental support \nin the form of expenditures made to churches. You go to churches in \nother countries, and it is the government that supports them.\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nTheir pews are empty by comparison to the religious services held in \nthe United States because people don't take it seriously. Here the \nGovernment stays out of funding churches and says: If you want to have \na viable church, a viable religious experience, you have to provide \nsufficient incentive to the people who align themselves with your \nchurch that they will support it out of their own pockets.\n  That is what has made religion so viable and vigorous in America, \nbecause people do support it out of their own pockets, and it does not \nhave a direct Government expenditure, but it does have Government \napproval of those kind of expenditures in the tax treatment of \ncharitable contributions, tax treatment which the President now says he \nwants to change. That is a foolish thing to do, and that is why I have \noffered the amendment, along with my cosponsors. I hope the amendment \nwill be voted on in appropriate fashion tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 799\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 799 that \nprioritizes small towns and rural communities in Colorado and all over \nthis Nation at a time when so many there do not have sufficient access \nto quality, affordable health care. My amendment establishes a reserve \nfund that addresses inequalities in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement \nthat fall most harshly on rural areas.\n  I thank Senator Roberts of Kansas for his strong support on this \nissue. Rural health disparities are truly a bipartisan issue, and I am \nhonored that the distinguished Senator has cosponsored this amendment. \nI also thank Senator Lincoln of Arkansas for her cosponsorship. I ask \nunanimous consent to print letters of support for my amendment in the \nCongressional Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNET. The current system disadvantages rural areas in primary \ncare and outpatient services, hospitals, and the supply of providers in \nthe workforce. The problem is truly widespread. In Colorado, almost 75 \npercent of the counties are considered rural. Health care providers in \nour rural communities are under enormous pressure to provide broad \naccess to quality health care. They need our help. My amendment can \nopen doors to reducing these disparities. It is important to know that \nthis amendment is written to ensure deficit-neutrality as well. Thus, \nit is fiscally responsible.\n  Colorado, like many other States, has a strong backbone of rural \ncommunities that work with the limited resources they have. For years, \nthere have been payment disparities between rural and urban areas in \nMedicare and Medicaid. This imbalance only discourages providers from \nstaying in rural communities and underfunds hospitals that serve as a \nsafety-net for a majority of my population.\n  Over 90 percent of Colorado counties are considered health \nprofessional shortage areas. These areas are severely underserved. They \nlack an adequate workforce. For example, six counties in Colorado do \nnot have a full-time primary care physician. Fourteen counties do not \neven have a hospital. We will work hard to ensure that every family has \ninsurance coverage, but this alone will not lead to access to health \ncare services. Small communities need doctors and nurses, along with \nmany other providers. Yet it must be worth their while to take new \nMedicare and Medicaid patients. Understanding this reality is critical \nif we are to improve our health care system.\n  My amendment would highlight that future health care legislation \nshould address rural disparities in a deficit-neutral way. I thank the \nchairman for all his good work on this budget resolution. I urge \nsupport from all my colleagues on this issue and the chairman's \nthoughtful, important underlying legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                 Colorado Rural Health Center,\n\n                                       Aurora, CO, March 31, 2009.\n       To Whom It May Concern: The Colorado Rural Health Center \n     (CRHC) is writing this letter of support for Senator Bennet's \n     proposed amendment, which emphasizes the importance of \n     Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement in accessing healthcare \n     services in rural areas of the United States. Serving as the \n     State Office of Rural Health, representing 29 Critical Access \n     Hospitals and 44 Rural Health Clinics throughout Colorado, \n     CRHC would like to encourage Congress to consider rural \n     clinics and hospitals, when deciding future budgetary \n     actions. CRHC understands these are tough economic times, but \n     it is essential that these rural safety net clinics, \n     hospitals, and other providers are able to survive since they \n     are often the sole source of healthcare services serving a \n     community or county.\n       There are a number of primary care clinics across rural \n     Colorado that are not designated as Federally Qualified \n     Health Centers (FQHCs) also known as Community Health \n     Centers. These rural clinics that are not FQHCs are valuable \n     safety net clinics, yet they have not received the same sort \n     of boost in funding from the federal stimulus package nor do \n     they receive the same amount of assistance from the federal \n     government, leaving them to rely more on reimbursement rates \n     from Medicare and Medicaid to remain viable.\n       In addition to the Rural Health Clinics and Critical Access \n     Hospitals with whom CRHC directly works, there are numerous \n     other non-FQHC clinics that deliver care to rural Coloradans. \n     As stated above, for some of these clinics, it is the \n     Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement rates that help keep \n     their doors open. Any substantial cut in Medicaid and/or \n     Medicare provider rates greatly impacts and potentially \n     threatens the viability of healthcare in rural and \n     underserved areas of our state. At current reimbursement \n     rates, it is becoming more and more difficult for providers \n     to continue to accept Medicare and Medicaid patients due to \n     the abysmal reimbursement. Colorado is set to cut provider \n     rates yet again this year, due to the $1 billion dollar \n     shortfall in our state general funds. Unfortunately, this \n     means the federal government is being looked to in order to \n     help strengthen these vital rural healthcare services.\n       CRHC understands difficult decisions need to be made in \n     regards to the federal budget. We urge you to please consider \n     and improve rural healthcare services by improving the \n     sustainability of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. \n     Thank you for your consideration.\n                                                   Lou Ann Wilroy,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National Rural\n\n\n                                           Health Association,\n\n                                   Kansas City, MO, April 1, 2009.\n     Hon. Michael Bennet,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennet: The National Rural Health Association \n     (NRHA) strongly supports your amendment to S. Con. Res. 13, \n     the Budget Resolution, to improve the health of 62 million \n     rural Americans. Your amendment, which creates a deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund to target the grave inequities in rural \n     areas, will not only protect the fragile rural health care \n     safety net, it will make health care more accessible and \n     affordable for all rural Americans.\n       Health care reform which will expand health care coverage \n     is necessary and laudable--in fact, rural Americans lack \n     insurance at a higher rate than their urban counterparts--but \n     there is a greater crisis in rural America: access to health \n     care. Coverage does not equate to access. Over 50 million \n     Americans live in areas where there are too few providers to \n     meet their basic primary care needs. Yet these rural patients \n     face the most daunting of health care challenges. Per capita, \n     rural populations are older, poorer and sicker than their \n     urban counterparts, and illnesses associated with poverty, \n     including infant mortality, are much more pronounced in rural \n     populations.\n       Rural providers struggle, due to grave inequities in \n     Medicare and Medicaid payments, to keep their doors open. \n     Several Medicare payment provisions, vital to the \n     sustainability of rural providers, are once again set to \n     expire, thereby critically jeopardizing the rural health care \n     safety net providers and seniors' access to care.\n       Senator, for any health reform to be a success, the health \n     care crisis in rural America must first be resolved--for it \n     does not matter if you have health insurance coverage if you \n     do not have access to a doctor or other health provider. For \n     health reform to be a success, the rural health care safety \n     net must be prevented from crumbling. Three reforms are \n     crucial:\n       1. Equity in reimbursement must occur;\n       2. The workforce shortage crisis must be abated;\n       3. Decaying rural health care infrastructure must be \n     repaired and non-existent infrastructure must be created.\n       Senator Bennet, the NRHA applauds your efforts and could \n     not support your amendment more. Creating a reserve fund to \n     address the systemic inequities in rural health care and \n     prioritizing eliminating those inequities as a part of health \n     care reform will finally create equity for the 62 million \n     people who call rural America home.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Beth Landon,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                       Amendment Nos. 751 and 787\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to present two amendments to the\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nbudget resolution. They will be made in order and voted on tomorrow. \nThe first is amendment No. 751. The idea behind that is very simple but \nimportant. It is to protect against what many of us fear, which is \nsignificant energy tax increases that will hit consumers, \nmanufacturers, farmers, many others in our economy and hurt them as we \nare trying to recover from this crippling recession.\n  Specifically, my amendment would add language to what is currently in \nthe budget resolution in the area of the deficit-neutral reserve fund \nto invest in clean energy and preserve the environment. In that section \nof the budget resolution, my amendment would simply insert language \nthat it would ``not increase the cost of producing energy from domestic \nsources, including oil and gas from the Outer Continental Shelf or \nother areas, would not increase the cost of energy for American \nfamilies, would not increase the cost of energy for domestic \nmanufacturers, farmers, fishermen, or other domestic industry, and \nwould not enhance foreign competitiveness against U.S. businesses.''\n  No one in this body--in fact, no one across America I know of--has a \nproblem with efforts to invest in clean energy and to preserve the \nenvironment.\n  There is no debate there. What we have a problem with is when we come \nup to Washington and get in this stale either/or debate--either it is \nthat or it is traditional oil and gas, as if the two have to be at \nconstant loggerheads and as if we do not have to produce under both of \nthose headings very aggressively to get out of the energy deficit we \nare in. I believe in new alternative renewable energy. I believe in new \ntechnology. But I also believe in traditional energy sources as an \nabsolutely necessary bridge to get us to that future.\n  That gives rise to my amendment. I think it is crucial that we reject \nthose aspects of the Obama budget which would tax traditional energy \nsuch as oil and gas, put an enormous burden on those providers in \nLouisiana and many other places around the country--folks who provide \ngood, reliable energy domestically for our Nation right now--and I \nbelieve it would be a similar mistake to adopt whole hog in its present \nform the President's climate change proposals which would also place \nheavy taxes and heavy cost increases on energy consumers.\n  Now, where am I pulling this from? I am pulling it from the \nPresident's own budget proposals, his concrete, specific proposals on \nclimate change and taxing domestic energy, and I am pulling it \nspecifically from what he has laid out in terms of movement in that \ndirection.\n  Perhaps the single clearest expression we have in that regard is a \nstatement the President made about his cap-and-trade proposals in \nJanuary of 2008 as he was in the midst of his Presidential campaign. He \nwas speaking about cap and trade. He was very straightforward, very \nclear, and said:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket regardless of what I say . . . \n     that will cost money. They will pass that money on to \n     consumers.\n\n  Electricity costs, energy costs, not just increasing at the margin \nbut skyrocketing. Unfortunately, the President has followed through on \nthat promise with regard to his specific climate change and energy \nproposals. When you look at his budget, they, in fact, ensure this sort \nof skyrocketing, both in terms of climate change proposals, which this \nquote directly refers to, but also in terms of producing traditional \nenergy here in this country in areas of oil and gas.\n  The President of the United States has laid out significant tax \nincreases on domestic energy. This would cost real jobs here and now. \nIt would be a significant antistimulus, and it would hamper domestic \nproduction exactly when we need it the most.\n  Let me repeat--let me back up and repeat--I support investment in new \ntechnology. I support development of new alternative and particularly \nrenewable forms of energy, and I have cast many votes in support, in \nfurtherance of that goal. But it is not either/or. It has to be all of \nthe above because we need to build that new energy future based on new \nrenewable sources and new technology, but we also need to get there, \nand we also need the bridge to get there, which includes traditional \nenergy, produced in this country, particularly natural gas, also oil, \nso we can cross that bridge, get to the future, without bankrupting \nourselves in the process.\n  It is interesting, just as we are still apparently caught up in this \nstale either/or debate and we are attacking and taxing and burdening \ndomestic oil and gas production, it is interesting that our neighbor to \nthe north, Canada, is doing exactly the opposite. They are doing \nexactly the positive thing I am talking about by encouraging both--by \nencouraging new renewable forms of energy and at the same time \nencouraging domestic production of oil and gas.\n  Specifically, in early March of this year, March 3, the government of \nAlberta announced a new three-point incentive program specifically \ndesigned to help keep Albertans working in the province's energy sector \nduring the current global economic slowdown. The highlights of the \nthree-point plan include a drilling royalty credit for new conventional \noil and natural gas wells; a new well incentive program, which offers a \nmaximum 5-percent royalty rate for the first year of production from \nnew oil or gas wells; and to encourage the cleanup of inactive oil and \ngas wells, the province will invest $30 million in a fund committed to \nabandoning and reclaiming old well sites. Those are exactly the sort of \nincentives in present law that the President would get rid of. Those \nare exactly the sort of areas where President Obama proposes moving in \nthe opposite direction with tax increases which are disincentives for \nmuch needed domestic production.\n  To quote the Canadian Energy Minister, Mel Knight, on this \nannouncement of their policy:\n\n       While we cannot make up for the impact that global \n     financial markets are having on Alberta, we are doing what we \n     can. This short-term incentive program introduces innovative \n     ways to help spur activity in our energy drilling and service \n     sector during this economic downturn.\n\n  That is exactly the sort of approach we should be taking here in this \ncountry. Yes, let's invest in new technology. Yes, let's develop new \nsources of energy, new and renewable. But at the same time, let's \nmaintain and expand the domestic production of oil and gas as that \nbridge to the future, as that bridge to that new energy future that \nwill take some time to build.\n  Unfortunately, our President is moving in the opposite direction. He \nis proposing to levy significant tax increases on domestic oil and gas \nproduction. That is bad for our energy security, and it is a major \nantistimulus which will keep us in recession even longer.\n  So, again, my amendment No. 751 is very simple. It would simply add \nto the relevant part of the budget resolution the following language, \nthat it:\n\n     would not increase the cost of producing energy from domestic \n     sources, including oil and gas from the Outer Continental \n     Shelf or other areas; would not increase the cost of energy \n     for American families; would not increase the cost of energy \n     for domestic manufacturers, farmers, fishermen, or other \n     domestic industries; and would not enhance foreign \n     competitiveness against U.S. businesses. . . .\n\n  I commend that amendment to all of my colleagues, Democratic and \nRepublican.\n  Secondly, Madam President, I will also formally present and have a \nvote on a second amendment tomorrow, amendment No. 787. Amendment No. \n787 has to do with the TARP program, the so-called Troubled Asset \nRelief Program. Again, it is very simple. It would simply say, except \nfor the TARP money which is already out the door and except for the \n$100 billion that is committed to the Treasury's newest plan to buy up \ntoxic assets--which was the original point all along--with those two \nexceptions, the remainder of the TARP money will be returned to the \ntaxpayer and bring down the debt, will reduce the debt. That is a \nsignificant amount of money. The entire TARP program, of course, is \n$750 billion. So far, approximately $371 billion is out the door. It \nwould also create an exception under my amendment for $100 billion for \nthis newly announced program of troubled assets. The remainder would go \nto buy down debt, not increase as much this horrendous debt we are on \nthe road to doubling and tripling under this budget. That would save \nliterally hundreds of billions of\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\ndollars. I daresay, of all of the myriad dozens and dozens of budget \namendments we will be asked to consider and vote on, this probably \nsaves the most money, reduces debt the most. If it is not No. 1, it is \nvery close to that.\n  CBO says they would expect us to never recoup all of that TARP money \nwe are sending out the door. They are guesstimating we will only recoup \nhalf of that. So building that into the formula, this amendment will \nsave hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  But there is another even more important reason to adopt this \namendment; that is, to get back to the original intent of the TARP \nprogram and not allow it to continue to be used for a slush fund--first \nby the Bush administration, now by the Obama administration--for every \nrandom idea they develop every other week.\n  As we know, that is exactly the history of this fund and this \nprogram. It was proposed specifically to allow the Treasury to buy up \ntroubled assets, to get those off the books of the troubled banks, and \nthat is how it was sold to the Congress, 100 percent lock, stock, and \nbarrel. In fact, Secretary Paulson, at the time, specifically said he \ndid not want to, did not think it was a good idea to invest directly in \ntroubled institutions and get preferred stock. Congress, without my \nvote, passed the program.\n\n  Then, within a few weeks, literally within a few weeks of that \npassage, everything changed. The original troubled asset program model \nwas thrown out the window and the Treasury started doing exactly what \nSecretary Paulson said it should not do, exactly what he had previously \nrejected by directly infusing capital into banks and taking preferred \nstock.\n  Since then, there have been at least five other uses of the TARP \nprogram which have been imagined and instituted by, really, executive \nfiat because the underlying legislation has not changed at all.\n  Then we finally came around full circle this past month under the new \nObama administration. Secretary Geithner said: Gee, why don't we use \nTARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to actually buy up troubled \nassets? What a novel idea. It was the original idea. I guess if you go \nround and round often enough, you will eventually come back to where \nyou started. And that is the new program that the Secretary said would \ntake $100 billion.\n  My amendment, again, is simple. It says the money that is out the \ndoor is out the door. We cannot do anything about that, unfortunately. \nAnd we will reserve the $100 billion for that newly announced program, \nwhich was the original intent, sole intent of TARP. But everything \nelse--everything else that was imagined and that TARP was used and \nabused to authorize since it was first passed--everything else has to \nstop. If the new administration thinks some of these things are \nnecessary ideas, great; they should come back to Congress and get real \nand proper and appropriate authority for that activity, which TARP \nnever was.\n  In doing so, in adopting this sort of amendment, we will save the \ntaxpayer and reduce the debt several hundred billion dollars, well over \n$150 billion by any estimate. If we want to get serious about the debt, \nif we want to heed the call of the American people to control that \nrunaway deficit and debt, this is the single biggest thing we can do in \nsight to do that to begin to turn the corner. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment. In contrast, voting against this amendment will \nessentially be a vote for everything Treasury has done and continues to \ndo outside the original stated intent of the TARP program. I believe \nthat is a very bad vote, both on the substance and in terms of where \nthe American people rightly are.\n\n  I commend both of these amendments to all my colleagues. I look \nforward to further debate and voting on them as we proceed on the \nbudget resolution tomorrow. I thank the Chair.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I wish to speak this evening about an \namendment I have filed. Do I understand it is not actually in order to \noffer amendments at this time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                    Michigan State in the Final Four\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, before talking about a very important \nand serious amendment I will be offering, I wish to take a point of \npersonal privilege to speak about my alma mater, Michigan State \nUniversity, that is in the final four. I have to say for the record, I \nknew they would get there. The final four is in Detroit. We are \nthrilled at Ford Field, a state-of-the-art facility. They play on \nSaturday night, and I am saying ``go State'' right now. For all those \nlistening who are Michigan State fans, let's root them on because it is \na point of terrific pride for Michigan State University, after a hard-\nfought year with, I think, the best coach in the league, Tom Izzo, who \nis now going to represent us in the final four. I appreciate that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 879\n\n  Madam President, I have an amendment I will be offering that has been \nfiled, amendment No. 879. I will be offering it tomorrow. I wish to \nread it briefly because I think it is important to read what this is. \nThis is about climate change and it is about being for something and \nnot just against something, and we have had a lot of amendments doing \nthat.\n  The amendment says we will decrease greenhouse gas emissions with a \npolicy that will invest in energy technologies, reduce greenhouse \ngases, create new jobs, strengthen the manufacturing competitiveness of \nthe United States, diversify the domestic clean energy supply, protect \nconsumers and regions, and include opportunities for agriculture and \nforestry.\n  This is the text of the amendment. As I indicated before, my \namendment is about what we should be for. We have seen a number of \namendments on the floor saying what we shouldn't do and what we can't \ndo. This is about what we can do and what we should do.\n  This budget is about investing in America's future. Our policy on \nclimate change must do the same thing. As will the budget, if it is \ndone right--and I believe we can do this right--climate change \nlegislation will create new jobs in the great State of Michigan, in the \ngreat State of New Hampshire, and all across this country and \nrevolutionize and revitalize our economy if this is done right.\n  Coming from a Midwestern State where economic troubles are not new--\nin fact, we now have 12 percent unemployment. I could spend a lot of \ntime, as I have in the past on this floor, talking about what is \nhappening to our families. I understand the risks associated with \npoorly designed climate policy, but I also understand that our \neconomy--Michigan's economy, the U.S. economy--cannot go forward with \nthe same old policies, dependent on foreign oil and pollution, that \nharms both our health and our economic interests. Climate change \nlegislation, if designed right, will be a significant opportunity for \nnew jobs and an economic transformation for our country.\n  Climate change can and must look out for working families and \nbusinesses, whether it be a farmer, a manufacturer or a cleantech \nengineer. That is why I propose this amendment, so the budget instructs \nthe future of climate policy to be well balanced, so it creates new \njobs, strengthens manufacturing, and breaks America of our dangerous \naddiction to foreign oil.\n  We can no longer rely on the same old technologies and the same old \nfuels. With new energy solutions come new jobs and new industries. \nAmerica has always led the world in innovation and invention, and we \ncan do it again with green energy. With or without a climate policy, \nenergy companies, industries, and entrepreneurs must make investments \nfor the future. This amendment will ensure that a cap-and-trade policy \nwill provide direction for future investments. This amendment will \ndirect us toward a smart climate policy that will protect and \nstrengthen manufacturing.\n  First, we can ensure a level playing field in the world economy by \nbringing other countries into an international agreement and ensuring \nthat jobs remain in the United States by preventing rising energy costs \nfrom being a factor. Second, new manufacturing opportunities will \narise. For example, to meet the needs of new clean energy production, \nnew technologies must be produced. The massive scale of this need will \ncreate new markets for American manufacturers.\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\n  Recent history has shown what happens when we rely primarily on \nforeign sources of energy. We subject ourselves to less than friendly \ninternational governments that can leverage unstable supplies and \nhigher prices against the people we represent. This amendment will take \nus steps further to reducing our dangerous addiction to foreign oil.\n  Furthermore, our domestic energy needs will increase over time, and \nall sources of clean energy should be added to our portfolio. Good \ninvesting, wise investing always requires diversification, so we must \nbring new clean sources of energy into the mix.\n  This is a national and international problem, and we have to solve \nthis together. Our President now has been spending time with global \nleaders talking about issues we know we need to be working together on. \nAs he is reaching out to them, we must do that as well. But we know \nthat through this amendment, we will ensure that all regions contribute \nequitably and help each other as America transitions to a clean energy \nfuture.\n  A successful climate policy also has to include all stakeholders. \nAgriculture and forestry can make significant contributions to \ngreenhouse gas reductions--as much as 20 percent--with the right \nincentives. This amendment will provide clear and certain opportunities \nfor landowners as to how they can achieve emission reductions and \nbenefit from doing so.\n  Overall, this amendment is the road map, I believe, to a reasonable, \nbalanced climate policy. With policies that meet these objectives, we \ncan ensure the American public that greater economic opportunity lies \nahead. We can do this while meeting the ambitious emission reduction \ntargets set by President Obama.\n\n  Instead of arguing about what we can't do, I urge the Senate to \nembrace what we can do and what we must do to create jobs for the \nfuture, to get us off our dependence on foreign oil, and to improve our \nenvironment. This is about the future of the country. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment that gives us a road map on how to \nget there.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to spend some time tonight \ntalking about the budget that is before us as well as some good \nGovernment things we can do.\n  If you are a typical American family, husband and wife working and \nyou are bringing home $3,500 a month, and all of a sudden one of you \ngets a cut in pay, where now you are bringing $3,000 a month home, what \nis the first thing you do? The first thing you do, knowing the kind of \neconomic times we are in, is you start saying: What is necessary and \nwhat is not? Where can we make up this difference? What can we not \nspend money on so that, in fact, we are not using our credit cards to \nfinance a living standard that is less than what we have today? Almost \nevery family in America would do that. They would go through and they \nwould say: Well, utilities are important, food is important, clothing \nfor the kids is important, automobile repair, gasoline is important, \nbut building a new addition onto our house isn't important right now. \nIt needs to wait. Going to the movies may not be important. Going out \nto eat may not be important, in terms of a list of priorities. Every \nfamily would look at what their expenditures are and say: Where do we \ncut spending?\n  This budget does exactly the opposite of that. We have markedly \ndeclining revenues, and we are going to increase spending $1.3 \ntrillion. The net effect of that is not so much that we might want to \ndo good things for people, but it is that we are going to be doing \nthose good things by taking the money--not from us and not even from \nour kids--but from our grandkids. So within this budget--the real \nbudget, the Obama budget--are the plans for us to grow Government \nspending over the next 10 years to a level we have never seen before \nand at a rate of growth we have never seen before.\n  Why would we do that? We wouldn't do it with our own home and our own \nfamily; we certainly wouldn't do that with our own business. Why is it \nCongress thinks, and this budget purports, that we can borrow our way \nand spend our way out of financial difficulty? The fact is, we can't. \nWe cannot do that. It is impossible for us to do that.\n  The dread secondary effect of that is to cripple potential growth in \nthe future. Let me explain how that works. As we go from $11 trillion \nin debt to $30 trillion in debt, what is going to happen to us? How \nmuch inflation ultimately will come about because we do that kind of \nborrowing? Well, what will happen is everything you have and everything \nyou try to buy will cost more and everything you own will be worth \nless. So what we are doing is we are generationally thieving, stealing \nmoney for us today so we don't have as much problem recognizing the \npain.\n  What is called for in our country today is not growing the \nGovernment, it is shrinking the Government. Here is what we do know, \naccording to GAO and IG reports that are published and that any \nAmerican can find: that out of the money we do spend every year, at \nleast $380 billion of it is lost to fraud, duplication or waste. \nNowhere in this budget is there any attention to any of that; not one \nplace is there attention to it. My friend, President Obama, campaigned \non the fact that the first thing he was going to do was a line-by-line \nanalysis of every department of every program and get rid of the things \nthat don't work and the things that work marginally, make them better. \nWell, that comes up to $380 billion. That is what it comes up to.\n  Tonight I am going to introduce a series of amendments--I know they \ncan't be called up by the unanimous consent agreement we are operating \nunder, but they will be voted on during our votes tomorrow--that are \nplain common sense and that we would all do with our own business or \nwith our own family; that we would actually put into place. The first \nthing we would do is we wouldn't give somebody a bonus who is repairing \nour house who didn't repair our house. Yet every year in this country, \nthis Government pays out about $7 billion to bonuses to people who \ndidn't perform.\n  We create a reserve fund so we don't do that anymore. Let me give \nsome examples. We have paid $8 billion to contractors for \nnonperformance bonuses--they didn't perform but got paid bonuses \nanyhow--in the Defense Department. Why would we continue to do that? I \nwill put into the Record throughout the evening the line-by-line areas \nassociated with that.\n  The first amendment says we are going to quit paying for performance \nthat we didn't get, so we will save $8 billion a year, or $80 billion \nover the next 10 years. It will get voted on, and everybody will vote \nfor it, but then in conference it will get stripped out. That is the \ngame we are playing in the Senate this week. Anything that passes, and \nwe put it in, we will take it out in conference. Why would we continue \nto pay extra money for something that didn't perform the way it was \nsupposed to? I am not talking about not paying the bills--that is a \ntotally different question--and about absolutely not meeting the \ncontract.\n  I will give you an example. The Census Department had a contract--a \nno-bid contract with Harris Corporation--for hand-held recorder devices \nfor the census. Oversight hearings were done in the Senate, and we \nsaid: What is your plan B if it doesn't work? They said it is going to \nwork, no problem. Now we have spent $700 billion and paid $26 million \nin bonuses for something that doesn't work and will not be used by the \ncensus.\n  Why would we do that and allow that to continue to happen? The \nGovernment is rife with that. So why would we not put a prohibition \ninto the budget that has teeth, which says we are not going to pay \nbonuses for work that didn't meet performance standards? Yet we will \nvote on it, and it will get jerked right out when it goes to conference \nbecause of the connectedness of the elite in this country.\n  The second thing I have an amendment for creates a reserve fund so we \nwill do exactly what President Obama\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\nsaid we would do and that is a line-by-line analysis of every \nGovernment program: Does it work? Is it accomplishing what it is \nsupposed to? If it is not, we should be eliminating it or fixing it. \nThat may or may not pass. But it will get pulled out, even though that \nwas a campaign promise--not only in the campaign, but in his inaugural \nstatement, as well as in his statement to the Nation. He has embraced \nthe very idea that we need to do that. Everybody knows we need to do \nthat. If you are running a business and have hard times, you go through \nwhat is not working and get rid of it. But we don't do that in the \nFederal Government.\n  One of the other amendments we will have says we will apply metrics \nto every program we have. In other words, we will say here is the goal, \nand we will put in measurements as to whether we are achieving the \ngoal. Then we can, for sure, tell what we are doing. The fact is that \n50 percent of the programs aren't living up; 12 programs, specifically, \nhave been on the warning list by the GAO for 10 years, and Congress has \ndone nothing about that. The reason is because they don't want to put a \nmetric system in because they don't know what it is. It might cause \nthem to lose a vote with somebody if, in fact, it is not an effective \nprogram.\n  The third amendment is to offer a reserve fund to set up metrics, so \nthat when we do that and see that things aren't working, we can get rid \nof them.\n  The fourth amendment we will offer is another one President Obama \nadvocated. He said this time after time and he believes it and I \nbelieve it. The question is whether we will do it. There ought not to \nbe any no-bid contracts for anything above $25 million. We mandate that \nthere has to be competitive bidding.\n  It is interesting that when we passed the stimulus, we all voted for \nit, but when it came out of conference, there was no competitive \nbidding requirement in the over $870 billion worth of spending. What \ndoes that mean to the average taxpayer? That means you are not going to \nget good value for the money we are spending. So there is no mandate, \neven though that is a commitment that was made, and we should live up \nto it.\n  So we will have an amendment that says no bonuses if you don't earn \nit; No. 2, line-by-line going through the budget; No. 3, metrics \nperformance measurements; No. 4, competitive bidding.\n  Then, finally, an amendment I will offer is something that will make \na real difference in people's lives today. The Senator from Texas and I \nworked on that during the stimulus. What it says is that if you have an \nIRA or 401(k) and you are underwater on your mortgage and you have \nmoney in that 401(k) or IRA and you want to take that money and apply \nit to your primary residence mortgage, where you are underwater, you \ncan do that without a 10-percent penalty. In other words, we are not \ngoing to penalize you for taking out money you have saved to get \nyourself out of trouble today.\n  That will be a controversial amendment, I am sure. The fact is, that \nis something that would make a big difference for families because they \nhave money locked up, but we have such a harsh penalty for them to take \nit out; they have to give the Government 10 percent so they can use it \nto get themselves out of trouble on their mortgage.\n  There will be two other amendments I will offer. One will be with \nSenator McCain on an alternative budget, which describes what we should \ndo, and it will save over $3.5 trillion, compared to this budget, which \nshrinks the size of the Federal Government and doesn't allow it to grow \nin terms of nondiscretionary spending, except for defense and veterans. \nIt puts a cap on how fast it can grow. It doesn't raise taxes like this \nbudget does.\n  The last thing we should be doing--we know the history of what we did \nwrong in the 1930s and at other times--is raising taxes on individuals \nand corporations at a time when we are in a deep recession. That is \nexactly the wrong tax policy to create jobs. So we will be offering all \nthose amendments come tomorrow.\n  The draft budget increases the veterans spending by $25 billion over \n5 years to take care of the commitments we have made to our veterans. \nIt increases the defense spending, which we need to do rather than \ndecrease it, in terms of real dollars, $190 billion. It decreases some \nof our real problems, which is our mandatory spending in Medicaid, \nMedicare, and Social Security, by $3.2 trillion less than what the \nPresident's budget and this budget will portend. It doesn't play any \ngames with AMT, as far as paying for it. It doesn't raise taxes. It \nwill reduce the cumulative deficit, over the next 10 years, by $3.5 \ntrillion. It also will give us $3.5 trillion less debt. It is a budget \nthat reflects a family's budget, that reflects the real times we are \nin, and it is a budget that says we recognize that if we are going to \ndo something for our kids and grandkids, some sacrifice has to come \nnow. Will people peel at it and shoot at it? You bet.\n  The fact is, we have a way too big Federal Government. It is highly \ninefficient. It wastes at least 10 percent of everything it does every \nyear--at least. That is a very conservative estimate. What we are going \nto put forward is a budget that doesn't do any of those things. When we \nwaste $80 billion a year through fraud in Medicare, think what that \nmeans. That means 20 percent of the money spent in Medicare is \ndefrauded. Our biggest problem is we are not going to be able to keep \nup with Medicare. Yet we have 20 percent of it that we are not doing a \nthing about in getting rid of fraud and improper payments. We have at \nleast $40 billion in terms of Medicaid. We have a Medicaid Program here \nand a health care program that will save the States $880 billion over \nthe next 10 years, and the Federal Government $400 billion over the \nnext 10 years. That is $1.3 trillion. It will cover everybody at a \nlevel, where every doctor--no matter who they are--will take their \ninsurance and will take the stamp of being a Medicaid patient right off \ntheir forehead, and nobody will ever know they are a Medicaid patient \nbecause they will have an insurance card just like everybody else. We \ncan buy for them something better than they have and also save $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  Why wouldn't we want to do that? That is in our budget. Why wouldn't \nwe want to do that? Why wouldn't we want to create the opportunity so \npeople will have an option? Instead of going to a nursing home, they \ncan have a program that gives them in-home care, and we can still save \nmoney.\n  Going back to what we were talking about on bonuses, do you realize \nthat CMS paid out $322 million last year to nursing homes that were \nalso on their list as substandard nursing homes? Think about that. We \npaid out in excess of $300 million in bonuses to nursing homes that had \nsignificant problems in terms of giving the care and meeting Medicare \nstandards in the first place, but we still paid it. Why? Why wouldn't \nwe fix that? We don't want to. It is hard to fix--except our budget \nwould fix that. This budget will cause us to not waste as much money.\n  This budget recognizes that we have real problems in our country, and \nthe way to get out of it is not to borrow more money and spend more \nmoney. It is to be frugal and learn what we were taught by our \ngrandmothers: If you have a penny, spend it wisely. If you have a \ndollar, don't spend it all. If you get fortunate enough to get more \nthan a dollar, make sure you are saving something for the future.\n  We all know that is right, but we don't apply it to the Federal \nGovernment. Consequently, what will happen is the standard of living of \nour grandchildren will erode. We are in a seminal moment in this \ncountry, where we are going to become on an equal basis with Europe. \nWhat does that mean? That means the standard of living in this country \nis getting ready to drop 30 percent, both by what we spend and the \nprinted money that will come after that in terms of the inflation that \nwill devalue everybody else's assets in this country.\n  There are a lot of ways to run this Government, but the way we are \nrunning it now wouldn't pass muster anywhere in anybody's household. \nNobody would throw 10 percent of their money away every year. Nobody \nwould give bonuses to people who didn't deserve it. Nobody would not \nmake measurements about what they are doing to see if it was working. \nWe need a change. The seminal moment is coming. We may not win the \nbudget battle but, in fact, if we don't win the budget battle, the \nproblems are just going to be that much more severe.\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\n  The debt load we will carry with this President's budget will shackle \nthe next two generations in this country for their entire lifetime.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to discuss amendments I intend to offer \ntomorrow. I thank the Senator from Texas for allowing me to speak \nbriefly. The first amendment is No. 898, which is a point of order \nagainst new mandatory spending if the Social Security trust fund dips \nbelow $5 billion.\n  There is talk about this economy and the effects of a recession, and \nthey are real. But one of the things we found out a couple of days ago \nis the Social Security trust fund spent more than it took in, in \nFebruary. The projections for next year are to have a $3 billion \nsurplus, so the day of reckoning that Senator Coburn was talking about, \nwhen it comes to Social Security, is upon us even quicker than we \nthought. Everybody thought it would be 2018 when we would pay out more \nbenefits than we collect in taxes.\n  If this trend continues, that will be accelerated by several years. \nThat means the longer we delay in finding a fix for Social Security, \nthe harder the mountain will be to climb. If we put this off one \nCongress after the next, the solutions that will get us to solvency are \ngoing to be too draconian and will hurt people. We need to act now \nbecause this problem is getting bigger faster than anybody anticipated.\n  If we do responsible things about readjusting the benefits for upper \nincome Americans and for Senators, where if we took $10 less a month \nwhen we retire, it would bring about 70 percent of the solvency needed \nto get Social Security back in balance. Do something on the age that is \nprospective, that realizes we all live longer. Do something on \nmodernizing the program, so you could have savings on top of the Social \nSecurity. There are ways to get there. Increase revenues by raising the \ncap to have a transition. Let's make sure that people who live past \n80--the fastest growing demographic in America--do not outlive their \n401(k) plans.\n\n  So we have a challenge and an opportunity, and this amendment says \nthat there will be a budget point of order against any budget when \nthere is not a $5 billion surplus in Social Security.\n  The second one would be a point of order against any bill that would \nimpose a national energy tax on middle-income Americans. The reason we \ntalk about this is cap and trade. We have to be smart about how we deal \nwith climate change. If we don't watch it, we will create a cap-and-\ntrade system that will be a huge burden on average, everyday Americans. \nEvery time they flip on a light switch, there will be a sales tax. So \nthis point of order is against an energy tax on middle-income \nAmericans.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor, and I look forward to \ndiscussing these amendments when I offer them tomorrow. And I thank the \nSenator from Texas for allowing me to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 866, 868, and 867\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senator from South \nCarolina is going to have amendments that will try to bring this \nbudget, which is going to increase the debt in our country, down to a \nlevel that can sustain our future generations. So I am proud to work \nwith him to try to do that.\n  I rise to discuss three amendments I will offer tomorrow as well. I \ntruly believe we have made some progress today because some of the \namendments that have passed will have an effect that I think will be \npositive on this budget.\n  Anywhere I go in my State, or anywhere I go in this country, people \nare talking about the mounting debt. It is almost breathtaking because \nwe have never seen this kind of debt. This debt, juxtaposed against our \ngross domestic product, is the highest we have seen since World War II. \nWe know that World War II and the Great Depression before that were \nextraordinary times. Clearly, these, too, are extraordinary times, but \nwe have a responsibility to our country and to the hard-working people \nof our country, and the people who have lost their jobs in our country, \nto act responsibly.\n  We have already passed a trillion-dollar stimulus package. We passed \nanother trillion dollars in spending just for this year, much of which \nwas duplicative with the stimulus package. So that is $2 trillion we \nhave obligated in the first 2 months of this year. Now we are looking \nat a budget that, over a 10-year period, is going to increase the debt \nby another $9 trillion. That is not sustainable. We are coming to a \ntipping point in which we will not be able to sell our debt because \nthere will be a fear that we cannot repay it. That will be a financial \ncrisis for sure.\n  So I am offering three amendments, and I would like to start with \namendment No. 866. It would provide permanent marriage penalty relief. \nMy amendment would establish a point of order against any legislation \nthat would impose or increase a marriage penalty, which is the most \negregious antifamily action in our Tax Code.\n  One of my highest priorities in the Senate has been to relieve \nAmerican taxpayers of this punitive burden. The marriage penalty pushes \nmarried couples into a higher tax bracket than two single earners \nearning the same combined income. After years of fighting this issue of \nequity, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts made a great stride toward \neliminating the marriage penalty by lowering tax rates, doubling the \nstandard deduction, and simplifying other elements of the Tax Code. \nPrior to the Bush tax cuts, an estimated 25 million couples paid a \npenalty for being married in 1999, amounting to approximately $1,400 \nper couple.\n  Enacting marriage penalty relief was a giant step for tax fairness. \nBut we may lose it. Even as married couples use the money they now save \nto put food on the table, buy clothes for their children, or send them \nto college, the budget that has been proposed by the President would \nraise taxes on the top two income brackets, both of which still include \na marriage penalty. As a result of increasing the tax rates on this \nbracket, the President further exacerbates the marriage penalty for \nmarried couples in those brackets, effectively reversing the progress \nwe have made in ensuring that marriage would not be a taxable event.\n  The benefits of marriage are well-established. Yet, without marriage \npenalty relief, the Tax Code gives a disincentive for people to become \nmarried. My amendment would affirm this body's commitment to the \ninstitution of marriage by creating a point of order against any \nlegislation that would impose or increase a marriage penalty. We should \nbe celebrating marriage. Marriage and families are the core of our \nsociety. We should not be penalizing it.\n  Amendment No. 868 enacts a permanent deduction for State and local \nsales taxes. I have worked, since I came to the Senate, to rectify a \ntax inequity that plagues eight States. They are the eight States that \nhave a sales tax but not an income tax.\n  Before 1986, taxpayers in these States--Texas, Washington, Nevada, \nWyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, Florida, and Tennessee--had the ability \nto deduct their sales taxes, like every taxpaying citizen from States \nthat impose income taxes. Unfortunately, citizens of some States were \ntreated differently after 1986 when the deduction for State and local \ntaxes--sales taxes, that is--was eliminated.\n  Together, the eight States that impose sales taxes in lieu of income \ntaxes fought to correct this injustice from 1986 until 2004, when we \nfinally did correct it. Since then, we have provided extensions every \nfew years, with the current extension set to expire at the end of this \nyear. While the budget before us assumes an extension of that valuable \nrelief for an additional 2 years--through 2011--what we really need is \nto make this relief permanent.\n  The majority leader has an amendment, which I have cosponsored, to \naccomplish this goal. I support his effort, and I welcome his \nleadership on the issue because it is an initiative that we must \naccomplish to ensure fairness for our constituents. He certainly was \none of the leaders in correcting the inequity in 2004, and I appreciate \nthat.\n  While I support his effort--I am not opposed to the approach he is \ntaking--I do today rise to offer an alternative approach that ensures a \npermanent sales tax extension by actually accounting for it directly in \nthe budget.\n\n[[Page S4160]]\n\n  There is a key distinction between our amendments. The majority \nleader's amendment requires our States' tax equity to be paid for by \nother changes in the budget, whether it is spending cuts or other tax \nincreases. I disagree that our States should have to pay for tax relief \nthat not only pays for itself but is granted to taxpayers who do not \nhave sales taxes but do have income taxes, or maybe they have sales \ntaxes and income taxes. It is a fundamental issue of fairness.\n  While I will support any measure that makes the sales tax deduction \npermanent, I think we should not have to be held to a higher standard \nthan other States when we are dealing with tax relief that really pays \nfor itself. We should be equal in this country. The Federal Government \nshould not be giving breaks to people who have income taxes but not the \nsame breaks to people who have sales taxes. All the States collect \ntaxes. They do it in different ways. The Federal Government should not \npick winners and losers.\n  The amendment I am offering today will permanently end the \ndiscrimination suffered by the eight States that have no income tax but \ndo have a sales tax and don't have the option of that deduction. There \nshould be a deduction, and you should be able to choose. People in \nincome tax States should be able to choose that as their deduction; or \nif they would prefer, they could also deduct sales taxes. But the \npeople in sales tax States that don't have an income tax should have \nthe same rights.\n\n  So I urge the adoption of amendment No. 868 when it is brought \nforward tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I have a third amendment, No. 867. This is the Outer \nContinental Shelf expansion budget resolution amendment. I wish to \nspeak in support of the amendment I have filed with my colleagues, \nSenators Bond, Vitter, and Murkowski, which ensures that we will expand \ndomestic offshore energy production on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Section 202 of the budget resolution directs that we reduce our \ndependence on foreign sources of energy by producing green jobs, \npromoting renewable energy development, establishing a clean energy \ninvestment fund, and encouraging conservation and efficiency. While I \nsupport these initiatives, which will play a role in making our country \nmore energy independent, we cannot overlook our own domestic oil and \ngas resources in the Outer Continental Shelf, which this budget before \nus does.\n  The goal of reducing our Nation's dependence on foreign sources of \noil is one on which both sides of the aisle should be able to agree. \nOur President has said we must reduce our Nation's imports of oil. It \nis irresponsible to put our economic and national security in the hands \nof unstable and unfriendly regimes. Today, we import over 60 percent of \nour energy needs, and too much of it comes from unstable and unfriendly \nregimes, such as Venezuela and parts of the Middle East. In 2008 alone, \nwe spent close to $475 billion on imported oil.\n  This amendment I have will reduce America's dependence on foreign \nsources of energy, minimize future increases in gasoline prices, and \nhelp reduce the debt with new lease revenue. We must reduce our \ndependence on dictators, such as Hugo Chavez, who control our energy \nsupplies. Increased domestic oil and gas production right here at home, \nin the waters off our shores, will help us reduce our foreign \ndependency and make us more energy independent, and we can do it in an \nenvironmentally safe manner.\n  Expanded energy production off U.S. shores will also help us minimize \nfuture price increases. With a lack of supply that could force up \nenergy prices, increasing supply will certainly bring it back down. \nSome will say: Well, oil prices are low now. Why should we drill?\n  That is exactly the kind of attitude that will ensure that prices go \nup. We could sit back and wait for oil prices to go back up and then \nact, but we have more responsibility and hopefully more leadership in \nthe Senate than to wait because we know that if supplies dwindle, \nprices will go up.\n  We have oil right here off our own shores. We need to use it. We are \nthe only Nation in the world that has an abundance of energy supplies \nyet refuses to use them. Other nations either don't have energy \nsupplies or they are trying very hard to get some kind of energy in \ntheir own countries. We have the capability to provide for our energy \nindependence and we are not doing it. And we are letting down the \npeople of our country if we don't.\n  So I urge support for amendment No. 867 when we vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I just want to end by saying that I am a cosponsor of \nSenator McCain's amendment that would be a substitute for this budget. \nI hope to be able to talk on the floor tomorrow about his substitute. I \nbelieve we must produce an alternative to this budget. We have \ncertainly criticized how big it is and how much we have to borrow to \npay for it and the taxes that would have to be raised. The budget \ncurrently before us spends too much, borrows too much, and taxes too \nmuch. We can do better in this country. The substitute of Senator \nMcCain and myself and other cosponsors will certainly do more in the \narea of bringing our budget down to a sustainable size and doing what \nis right for this country.\n  It basically freezes spending and adds as the rate of inflation, so \nthe programs in place right now would be able to grow with inflation, \nbut it will show the American people that we mean to cut back in the \noutyears of this spending so we will not increase the debt. In fact, \nthe McCain substitute will lower the debt that is envisioned in this \nObama budget by $3.9 trillion. This would be our first step toward \nfiscal responsibility and doing what the Senate ought to do.\n  I hope to talk more about the McCain substitute of which I am a \ncosponsor because I think it is the responsible approach and I think it \nis our responsibility to provide an alternative.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Brownback as a cosponsor of \nmarriage penalty amendment No. 866.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I urge my colleagues to support these amendments when \nthey come up, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 808\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 808, an \namendment I will offer tomorrow that will protect seniors from identity \ntheft. Every day, some 44 million Americans are at risk of having their \nidentity stolen--simply because they are Medicare beneficiaries. Why is \nthat? We have talked in Congress for years now about removing Social \nSecurity numbers from Medicare cards. I think it is time to demonstrate \nthat we are serious about taking action on something that, when you get \nright down to it, is pretty simple.\n  It is common sense that Americans should avoid carrying their Social \nSecurity number around with them because of identity theft. In fact, \nthe Social Security Administration itself insists citizens should not \n``routinely carry . . . documents that display [their Social Security \nnumber].'' Yet Medicare cards clearly display the Medicare \nbeneficiary's health insurance claim number, which is the Social \nSecurity number followed by a letter. So anyone interested in identity \ntheft when stealing a purse or billfold containing a Medicare card gets \nthe Social Security number and can then have a Social Security number \nand can exploit having that Social Security number.\n  What is worse, on the back of each card, beneficiaries are told to \n``carry your card with you when you are away from home.'' Medicare says \nyou should carry your card with you, Social Security says don't carry \nyour Social Security number with you.\n  Something needs to change. It is not acceptable for the Government to \nbe unnecessarily putting millions of Americans at risk of identity \ntheft. That is why I will offer amendment No. 808, which will give the \nbudget authority to make this change.\n  Medicare thought, back in 2005--we don't have the numbers since--that\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\nidentity theft costs the country $1.5 billion in 1 year. That is a \nconservative estimate.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says, for whatever reason, it will \ncost $25 million to remove Social Security numbers from all future \ncards, so that is the amount we have raised under pay-go in this. It is \na downpayment on fully addressing this problem. We owe it to seniors to \ninclude the language in our budget. I am confident we can find the $25 \nmillion in savings by reducing waste, fraud, and abuse. That is why \nthis amendment has the support of the Consumers Union and AARP. They \nboth endorsed it. That is how the amendment is paid for. It is budget \nneutral. Let's demonstrate we are committed to protecting seniors from \nidentity theft.\n  To recap, Medicare suggests to seniors they should carry their \nMedicare card with them at all times. Medicare has made a decision to \nput a Social Security number on the Medicare card. Social Security \nsays: Don't carry your Social Security number with you because if it is \nstolen, whatever you have with you and that number is stolen, then you \ncan be a victim of identity theft.\n  We just want a commonsense solution. We want seniors to carry their \nMedicare card, but we don't want seniors to be victims of identity \ntheft, so we want to take the Social Security number off the card. \nMedicare could use another identification that protects seniors' \nconfidentiality, protects privacy, and protects the public from anyone \ninterested in identity theft from being able to get access to that \nSocial Security number.\n  It is a simple amendment. I urge my colleagues to support amendment \nNo. 808.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 840\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will be calling up amendment No. 840 \ntomorrow. It is an amendment I put forward before. It is an amendment \nthat passed this body last year in the budget debate. We talked about \nit. I think it is one of the things we need to do to try to be \nefficient with Government programs, and effective, and to make sure \nthat if we have waste, fraud, and abuse or duplicative programs, they \nget eliminated.\n  I draw the attention of my colleagues to a report card. I don't know \nif they know this, but the Federal Government itself does a report card \non itself as to whether its programs are meeting the design of the \nprograms they put forward, are meeting the criteria of the program that \nwas put forward by the Congress, and then this is scored by the Federal \nGovernment itself and it gets a report card.\n  I am not very pleased to note to my colleagues and to the public that \nthe Federal Government, giving itself a grade on this card--if you did \nit in A, B, C, D, you would see that the Federal Government's GPA is \n1.14. A 1.14 GPA is what the Federal Government has for its own \nprograms, whether they pass or fail this test of whether the program is \nduplicative, whether the program has accomplished its purpose, whether \nthe program is effective at all.\n  You can go down through here and you can see--the State Department \nactually has the highest score that the Government grades for its \nprograms that were reviewed, whether they are hitting the targets the \nprogram was designed to do--the highest score. They get a C-plus. You \nsee down here we have the Labor Department, HUD, Education, all with \nfailing scores, and D-minuses at EPA, Homeland Security; a D at \nInterior, HHS, Agriculture, and Justice.\n  This is a bad report card. It is never seen as having much \nsignificance because nothing happens at the end of the report card, \nunlike when I was going to school or when my kids now are in school. \nThere is a consequence to not getting a good grade, and you try to \nimprove it. On this one, there is kind of no consequence to it: OK. We \ngot an F. So what? Because there is no consequence.\n  What I want to do is put a consequence into a Federal program failing \nto meet its target. And that is this amendment. It is called the \nCommission on Budgetary Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies; \nit is called CARFA. It would basically create a commission. Every 4 \nyears, each Federal program would be reviewed. That program would be \nscored. If the program receives an F, it would be put in the groups of \nFederal programs that all get failing scores and then be required to be \nvoted on by this body, by the House, whether the program is continued \nor not. So all the bundled 500 programs--however many there are--those \nthat fail, we would have to vote whether to continue those programs or \ndiscontinue those programs altogether, no amendment, limited time \nperiod for debate, deal or no deal. Do we eliminate the wasteful \nprograms that have failed? Do we keep them?\n  This is a process we have done on military bases--it has worked--on \nconsolidating bases to ones from lower priority to higher priority \nones. It has not cut military spending, but it has made it more \nefficient and effective. That is what we should at least be looking at \nin the Federal Government, to make the Federal programs more efficient \nand more effective. That is what this amendment would do.\n\n  I had a group of college students in today. They were talking about \nthe need to be able to do work programs abroad, study-abroad programs, \nall which I think are great. They say it has a price tag of about $3 \nbillion. Look at the deficit we are looking at. That is just way too \nhigh. But what if you said: OK, that is a good idea, or, we want to \ndeclare war on cancer--that is one I think we ought to uptick on this, \nsaying we want to get a country where within a decade there are no \nlonger deaths by cancer in the United States. If you decide to take \ncare of yourself, the right treatments, this is treated as a chronic \ndisease, not as a death sentence. That is something worth investing in.\n  Typically, what we do here is say: OK, let's just put it in the stack \nand we will see if we can get at it. It goes along with all the other \nprograms, even though these programs are failing, and we just try to \nadd it on. What if we said we are going to take out the failing \nprograms within these agencies we are going to eliminate them and take \nthat money and put it on higher priority programs like a war on cancer, \nlike maybe it is work experience abroad. I don't know if that is it or \nmaybe it is green jobs and new energy, a big energy project. We want to \nget more energy production from the United States. Great, let's \neliminate those that have not worked and take that money and spend it \non programs that are higher priority.\n  Maybe these are programs that have accomplished their purposes. We \ndon't need them anymore. It is a novel notion that maybe the Federal \nGovernment started a program and it actually accomplished its purposes \nand we don't need it anymore, so we should move on past it. Yet the way \nthe budget process so often works, the appropriations process works, \nonce it gets in, it never leaves. It just continues on and on rather \nthan us reappraising it or saying is it really meeting the need or is \nit not meeting the need. This is the way we get at waste, fraud, and \nabuse, duplication, and programs that have accomplished their purposes.\n  Everybody here in this body would declare themselves against waste, \nfraud, and abuse in the Federal Government and say we are going to get \nto the bottom of this program and we are going to make sure it is \nefficient and effective. We have heard that from President Obama. \nFrankly, we hear it from every President who gets into office, that \nthey are going to get at the bottom of this and they are going to make \nsure these programs are working, efficient and working. Yet the Federal \nGovernment, giving itself its own scorecard after President after \nPresident said this--and we have a 1.14 grade average, most of the \nprograms failing to be able to do that--they say: Well, so? What are \nyou going to do about it? We are going to continue to get our funding \nnext year anyway.\n  This is conservative Presidents, this is liberal Presidents who come \nin. We are always going to create and make a better system and we are \ngoing to stop this wastefulness, and it just doesn't happen. This would \nget added by putting a procedure in place, a required procedure that \nwould cause these programs to be effective or face the consequences. \nThis is sensible, bipartisan, good-government, an efficient way to move \nforward. It will work, and it is something we need to do.\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\n  In closing, I ask that my colleagues would look at this program, and \nif we get it passed again this year--not strip it out in the conference \nreport, that we would actually do something like this--it would send a \nnotice of credibility to the American public that we are actually going \nto go at programs, and if they don't work, we are actually going to \npull them out. Right now, the public does not believe we will do that. \nThis creates a mechanism, a culling process that we eliminate those, \nand we could have some credibility with the public that we are going to \neliminate programs that don't work, that have waste, fraud, and abuse \nwithin them. We have had good bipartisan support of this idea and this \nproposal in the past. I hope we could have it again in this budget \nproposal.\n  Overall on the budget, I still think we are going seriously the wrong \nway. I did a townhall meeting, tele-townhall meeting last night in my \nState, talking about the budget. People are not satisfied at all with \nthis process. They think there is way too much deficit spending in it. \nThey think it is failing to hit the mark. They are very upset about a \nlot of the payouts for big entities. They are saying: What about us? \nWho is taking care of us? They look at those deficit numbers and the \ntax increases that are probably going to come behind them, and they \njust don't like it. They do not agree with it, and they do not think \nthat is a way to move forward as a country; that what we ought to do is \nreally get our house in order.\n  I am pleased to see people putting forward other options for how they \ncan deal with the budget and with the deficit. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against this one, and let's start over. Let's get one where we can \nhave bipartisan agreement. Let's get one that cuts back on that \ndeficit. Let's get one that doesn't raise taxes on Americans. Let's get \none that can really help us move forward in this crisis we are in today \nrather than this one that is highly partisan, deficit oriented, tax \nincrease oriented, and is not supported by the vast majority of the \nAmerican public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Kerry/Lugar \namendment that restores the full amount of the President's request for \nthe international affairs budget.\n  The Budget Committee has recommended a cut of $15 billion out of $540 \nbillion from total nondefense discretionary spending--a reduction of \n2.8 percent. But it has recommended a $4 billion cut out of $53.8 \nbillion from the international affairs account--a reduction of more \nthan 7 percent.\n  The foreign affairs account, already relatively small in the overall \nbudget, is being asked to carry more than double the percentage \nspending cut than the rest of nondefense discretionary spending.\n  Furthermore, the small investment in our overseas engagement is \nbarely 1.5 percent of the entire proposed Federal budget and only 6.8 \npercent of the national security budget, which includes defense and \nhomeland security. Even at this level of spending, the international \naffairs budget represents only 0.35 percent of GDP.\n  Our foreign affairs account is modest compared to what many other \nsimilarly wealthy nations spend on such programs.\n  As we take stock of America's image in the world, it is clear that we \nneed to do more to improve the lives of the world's poor and help \nstabilize fragile governments and economies.\n  America's generosity and ability to help other countries are becoming \nmore important to the effectiveness our foreign policy. In many cases \nour own security depends on the stability of far-flung places beyond \nour borders.\n  With this relatively small account, the international affairs budget \nfunds programs that: reduce tensions with other nations through \ndiplomacy and engagement; lift millions out of poverty through \neducational, health, and economic programs; bring clean water and \nsanitation to the world's poor; strengthen fragile democracies and weak \nstates; help with humanitarian, refugee and peacekeeping needs; and \nsend some of most talented Americans to work in some of the most \ndifficult corners of the planet.\n  At a time when the need for such engagement is stark, we haven't made \nthe investment we need in these critical foreign policy tools.\n  For example, America's lead development agency, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, at one point in its history had more than \n5,000 full time Foreign Service officers working on health, education, \nagricultural, and political development around the world.\n  Today, while engaged in a global war of ideas and values, USAID has \njust over 1,000 Foreign Service officers. Its budget in real dollars \nhas been cut by almost a quarter from a high in the 1980s.\n  Similarly, the Peace Corps, one of our most successful programs at \nboth sharing American values and assistance while also exposing our \nyoung people to the people and cultures of other worlds, has seen its \nbudget in real dollars cut by almost 40 percent since its inception in \n1967.\n  At a time when more failed states are in need of international \npeacekeeping missions, the United States is millions of dollars in \narrears in U.N. peacekeeping dues.\n  This budget is an essential component of our national security. \nDefense Secretary Gates has said:\n\n       The problem is that the civil side of our government--the \n     Foreign Service and foreign-policy side, including our aid \n     for international development--[has] been systematically \n     starved of resources for a quarter of a century or more . . . \n     We have not provided the resources necessary, first of all, \n     for our diplomacy around the world; and second, for \n     communicating to the rest of the world what we are about and \n     who we are as a people.\n\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed,\n\n       The relatively small but important amount of money we do \n     spend on foreign aid is in the best interests of the American \n     people'' and ``promotes our national security and advances \n     our interests and reflects our values.\n\n  The 2006 National Security Strategy, the Quadrennial Defense Review, \nand the 9/11 Commission all support increased investment in America's \ndiplomatic and development capabilities.\n  As the Obama administration works to address multiple difficult and \ndangerous international problems, we have to fully fund the basic tools \nneeded for such engagement.\n  Last year, 73 Senators, including 24 Republicans, voted for an \namendment to restore the international affairs budget to the level \nrequested by the President. The bipartisan message was clear we must \ncontinue to invest in our country's international affairs programs.\n  America's international affairs programs are as important foreign \npolicy tools as diplomacy and defense. Let's make sure they are funded \nas such.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last fall, in a debate with my Arizona \ncolleague, Senator McCain, President Obama decried the ``orgy of \nspending and enormous deficits'' that occurred under President Bush.\n  At a recent press conference, the President told us that America must \nshun the ``borrow and spend'' policies of the past and embrace plans to \n``save and invest.'' I agree that we have to curtail Government \nspending now to protect future generations from historic debt.\n  So why, after denouncing deficit spending, is President Obama \nproposing to borrow and spend more than any President ever? His budget \nis not only the biggest in history; it also creates more debt than the \ncombined debt under every President since George Washington.\n  Senator McCain told us during the campaign that spending and deficits \nare two sides of the same coin, that President Obama's spending \npromises would raise deficits to unsustainable levels; and that huge \ntax hikes--and not just for the wealthy--would be required to pay for \nit all.\n  Now, the President's own Office of Management and Budget Director \nPeter Orzag has confirmed what Senator McCain said all along, that: the \nbudget will lead to ``rising debt-to-gross domestic product ratios in a \nmanner that would ultimately not be sustainable.''\n  Let's consider some numbers to put that into perspective.\n  Last year we had a $459 billion deficit. The Congressional Budget \nOffice now projects it will more than triple this year, to $1.669 \ntrillion deficit. This budget will double the public debt in 5 years \nand triple it in 10. This budget does not contemplate one-time \ninvestments followed by years of reduced\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\nspending. Instead, billions in new outlays will continue indefinitely. \nSo it is not just about massive spending, but about the permanent \naccruement of power in Washington.\n  After bottoming out at $658 billion in 2012--a level still more than \n40 percent above the highest deficit during the Bush administration--\nthe Congressional Budget Office projects the total debt to increase to \n$9.2 trillion in 2019, or 82.4 percent of GDP! The Washington Post \nrecently editorialized, ``President Obama's budget plan would have the \ngovernment spending more than 23 percent of gross domestic product \nthroughout the second half of the this decade while collecting less \nthan 19 percent in revenue.''\n  Is this the legacy we want to leave for the next generation? \nUnprecedented debt?\n  And let's not forget the finance charges. Beginning in 2012 and every \nyear thereafter, the Government will spend more than $1 billion per day \npaying finance charges to holders of U.S. debt.\n  What does this mean for the average American family? Federal spending \non finance charges for our Government's debt will be about $1,500 per \nhousehold for 2009. Under President Obama's budget, this number would \nsoar to nearly $5,700 per household by 2019. The interest on the \nnational debt would be so big that it would be the largest single \nexpenditure item in the budget by 2019.\n  Then there are the tax increases this budget contemplates. President \nObama said he will cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans. But his \nbudget would raise taxes by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. It not only \nlets some of the existing tax rates expire--thus raising taxes--but \nimplements a new $646 billion energy tax that will impact every \nAmerican household--regardless of income--and is estimated to increase \nenergy costs for every family by $3,168 annually. And it's described as \na ``down payment,'' meaning there is more to come.\n  What about President Obama's suggestion that this deficit spending \nconstitutes ``investments'' for the future? Most of us would agree that \nshort-term deficits are sometimes necessary to help finance future \nprosperity. As Stephen Moore writes in the latest Weekly Standard, \n``The 1980s deficits were probably one of the highest-return \ninvestments in American history. We bought a victory over the Evil \nEmpire in the Cold War and borrowed to finance reductions in tax rates \nthat launched America's greatest period of wealth and prosperity: 1982-\n2007.''\n  But much of the new spending in this year's budget is not what the \nIRS or a well-run business would classify as an investment. Most of it \nis earmarked for services whose long-term value is difficult to \nmeasure.\n  I'll quote Stephen Moore's article again: ``The debt we are now \nincurring is paying for windmills . . . new cars for federal employees, \nweatherizing homes, high-speed trains to nowhere, and the like. It buys \nalmost nothing of long-term economic benefit.''\n  Senator McCain was right. President Obama has promised to spend so \nmuch that we are looking at record deficits and tax increases on \neveryone just to start paying for it all. We need to get a handle on \nthis budget before it is too late.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee \nand his staff for their hard work on this year's budget resolution.\n  I regret, however, that the discretionary spending level is less than \nPresident Obama's request. The Obama administration, to its great \ncredit, recognizes the serious consequences of the previous \nadministration's lack of investment in American infrastructure. I will \ncontinue to support President Obama's full discretionary budget \nrequest. I look forward to working with the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee on this matter as the resolution moves forward.\n  I also compliment the chairman for making the right decision to \nforego reconciliation instructions in this budget. Unfortunately, the \nHouse budget resolution does include reconciliation instructions, and \nthat should be of concern to every Senator.\n  The House provisions open the door in conference to language \nrequiring as many as five Senate committees to report reconciliation \nlegislation--the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, the Finance Committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. While the House reconciliation \ninstructions are ostensibly for health reform and education bills, they \ncould also be used to report other bills under the jurisdictions of \nthose committees--including climate legislation--as long as the bill \ncomplies with the budget's net deficit reduction instructions. Whatever \nlegislation those committees decide to report, their bills would \nrequire only 51 votes for Senate passage. Under the Budget Act, debate \nis limited to 20 hours, and amendments are sharply curtailed.\n  I am one of the authors of the reconciliation process. Its purpose is \nto adjust revenue and spending levels in order to reduce deficits. It \nwas not designed to cut taxes. It was not designed to create a new \nclimate and energy regime, and certainly not to restructure the entire \nhealth care system. The ironclad parliamentary rules are stacked \nagainst a partisan minority, and also against dissenting views within \nthe majority caucus. It is such a dangerous process that in the 1980s, \nthe then-Republican majority and then-Democratic minority adopted \nlanguage, now codified as the Byrd Rule, intended to prohibit \nextraneous matter from being attached to these fast-track measures. The \nbudget reconciliation process will not air dissenting views about \nhealth and climate legislation. It will not allow for feedback from the \npeople or amendments that might improve the original proposals.\n  If there are rules--such as the Byrd Rule--that frustrate Senators, I \nhope that they will take the time to understand that those rules exist \nfor a reason. They protect every Senator, regardless of whether they \nare in the majority or minority party, because even a Democrat in the \nmajority today may have a viewpoint in the minority tomorrow.\n  I understand the White House and congressional leadership want to \nenact their legislative agenda. I support a lot of that agenda, but I \nhope it will not require using the reconciliation process. Again, I \ncommend the chairman of the Budget Committee for excluding \nreconciliation instructions, and look forward to working with him to \nensure those instructions are not included in conference.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Kerry and Lugar which I and many other Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle have cosponsored to restore $4 billion to the \ninternational affairs function of the budget.\n  This amendment would not have any effect on the top line for \nnondiscretionary spending. It is budget neutral.\n  We have two choices. Cut $4 billion from the President's Fiscal year \n2010 budget for national security and diplomacy programs as the budget \nresolution would do, or restore those funds, as the Kerry-Lugar-Leahy-\nDurbin amendment would do, and which both the Secretary of State and \nthe Secretary of Defense have said is vital.\n  This $4 billion is an insignificant amount when it comes to having an \nappreciable effect on the deficit over the long term, but it will pay \nimmediate dividends in restoring United States influence around the \nworld where it is desperately needed.\n  The difference we are talking about is whether to freeze funding for \ninternational assistance programs at the 2009 level, or to step up to \nthe plate and fund the initiatives President Obama, and Members of \nCongress of both parties, have recognized are urgently needed.\n  These funds will be used to put the United States back in the \ndriver's seat on climate change. They will support the increases for \nPakistan and Afghanistan that the Secretary of Defense says are \ncritical elements of our counterterrorism strategy there. It is not \njust a military strategy. It is also a diplomatic and development \nstrategy.\n  These are the funds to support that. They will support treatment for \nmillions of people infected with HIV/AIDS. Lifesaving drugs that \nrepresent the best of America.\n  Years from now, countries in Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, and \nCentral Asia will remember what we do today. China is expanding its \ninfluence\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\naround the globe. We can step back and watch that happen, or we can \nshow once again that the United States is going to lead by example.\n  Not very long ago we had that chance with Russia. But rather than \nlook for ways to put past hostilities and distrust behind us and embark \non a new relationship, we sought to take advantage in ways that \nexacerbated that distrust.\n  Today the relationship is a far cry from what it could and should be, \nand it will require significant investments in diplomacy to rebuild it.\n  We can lead in the world, we can build new alliances and work to \nsolve conflicts, promote stability and develop new markets, or we can \nturn inward. That is the choice we face with this amendment. We are \npart of a global economy. We face grave challenges, from al-Qaida in \nPakistan to drug cartels in Mexico. Climate change threatens the \nsurvival of species in ways that may profoundly affect our own survival \nnot fifty million years from now, but within the lifetimes of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  This is no time to trifle with the need for American leadership. I \nthank all Senators for supporting this amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage of a \ntruly bipartisan amendment to the budget resolution that Senator Cardin \nand I are introducing. This vital amendment would address the \nGovernment Accountability Office's, GAO, recent recommendations to \nimprove the Small Business Administration's, SBA, management and \noversight of the Historically Underutilized Business Zone, HUBZone \nProgram and ensure that only eligible firms participate in this crucial \nprogram.\n  As former chair and now ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have long championed critical \nsmall business programs such as the HUBZone Program, which provides \nFederal contracting assistance to small firms located in economically \ndistressed areas, with the intent of stimulating economic development \nand job creation. According to the GAO, as of February 2008, 12,986 \ncertified businesses have participated in the HUBZone Program, since \nits inception in 1997. And in fiscal year 2007 alone, over 4,200 \nHUBZone firms obtained approximately $8.5 billion in Federal contracts. \nDuring these troubling financial times, the HUBZone Program is an \nessential tool in helping small businesses drive our national economic \nrecovery.\n  Unfortunately, the GAO recently found in its three reports--Small \nBusiness Administration: Additional Actions Are Needed to Certify and \nMonitor HUBZone Businesses and Assess Program Results, GAO-08-643; \nHUBZone Program: SBA's Control Weaknesses Exposed the Government to \nFraud and Abuse, GAO-08-964T; and HUBZone Program: SBA's Control \nWeaknesses Exposed the Government to Fraud and Abuse, GAO-08-964T--that \nthe mechanisms that the SBA uses to certify and monitor HUBZone firms \nprovide limited assurance that only eligible firms participate in the \nprogram. The GAO report found that of 125 applications submitted in \nSeptember of 2007, the SBA only requested supporting documentation, \nwhich helps to clarify the eligibility of the business, for 36 percent \nof the applications and only conducted a single site visit for all 125 \napplicants. While the SBA's policies and procedures require program \nexaminations, the agency only conducts them on 5 percent of certified \nHUBZone firms each year. This is a glaring lack of oversight that must \nbe rectified.\n  The amendment we introduce today would take immediate steps to \ncorrect the lack of effective administrative oversight by incorporating \nall recommendations that GAO provided for improving the HUBZone \nProgram. This measure would require more routine and consistent \nsupporting documentation during the program's application process. In \nits report, the GAO found that the SBA relies on Federal law to \nidentify qualified HUBZone areas, but the map it uses to publicize \nHUBZone areas is inaccurate, and the economic characteristics of \ndesignated areas vary widely. Our amendment would require that the SBA \ntake immediate steps to correct and update the map that the SBA uses to \nidentify HUBZone areas and implement procedures to ensure that the map \nis accurately updated with the most recently available data on a more \nfrequent basis.\n  The GAO also found that the mechanisms that the SBA uses to certify \nand monitor firms provide limited assurance that only eligible firms \nparticipate in the program. It reported that more than 4,600 firms that \nhad been in the program for at least 3 years went unmonitored. This \namendment would require the SBA to develop and implement guidance to \nmore routinely and consistently obtain supporting documentation and \nconduct more frequent site visits, as appropriate, to ensure that firms \napplying for certification are indeed eligible. These commonsense, \nachievable steps would help to eliminate participant fraud and \nmisrepresentation and ensure that firms applying for HUBZone \ncertification are truly lawful and eligible businesses.\n  In its reports, the GAO illustrates the SBA lack of a formal policy \non how quickly it needs to make a final determination on decertifying \nfirms that may no longer be eligible for the HUBZone Program. According \nto the GAO, of the more than 3,600 firms proposed for decertification \nin fiscal years 2006 and 2007, more than 1,400 were not processed \nwithin 60 days--the SBA's targeted timeline. As a result of these \nweaknesses, there is an increased risk that ineligible firms have \nparticipated in the program and had opportunities to receive Federal \ncontracts based on their HUBZone certification. This failure in \noversight hurts new and deserving firms in their quest to receive \nassistance through the HUBZone Program, which is the last thing we need \nduring these challenging and perilous economic times. Our amendment \nwould require the SBA to formalize and adhere to a specific timeframe \nfor processing firms proposed for decertification in the future, as \nwell as require further developed measures in assessing the \neffectiveness of the HUBZone Program.\n  Moreover, the Federal Government must strive to continue to provide \nadditional contracting opportunities to those who are legitimate \nHUBZone firms. I am dismayed by the myriad ways that Government \nagencies have time and again egregiously failed to meet most of their \nsmall business contracting goals. I am alarmed that only one Federal \nsmall business contracting program--the Small Disadvantaged Business \nProgram--has met its statutory goal and that the three other small \nbusiness goaling programs have all fallen drastically short. For \nexample, in fiscal year 2007, the HUBZone Program met only 2.2 percent \nof its 3 percent Government-wide goal. The Federal Government can and \nmust provide more to our country's hard-working small businesses, and I \nam confident that this amendment will pave the way for more qualified \nfirms to receive HUBZone assistance. In my home State of Maine, only \n127 of 41,026 small businesses are qualified HUBZone businesses. \nHUBZones represent a tremendous tool for replacing lost jobs across all \nindustry sectors in distressed geographic areas--clearly, this program \nshould be better utilized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4164-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, 50 years ago--April 12, 1959--the Las Vegas \nConvention Center opened its doors for the first time. The first event \nat the new convention center was the World Congress of Flight's air and \nspace show. Attracting 7,500 attendees, this was the first-ever \ninternational air show in American history, attracting the \nparticipation of 51 foreign nations. Originally 1.5 million square \nfeet, the convention center has grown over the years to accommodate its \npopularity to a current size of 3 million square feet.\n  Today, the Las Vegas Convention Center is a major part of Nevada's \nculture and a force for job creation and economic growth. More than \n46,000 jobs are directly related to the meetings\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\nand conventions industry in southern Nevada. Aside from the jobs \ndirectly within the building, the Las Vegas Convention Center also \ncontributes to the success of the dozens of small businesses that serve \nand supply the trade show industry. This includes florists, office \nsupply stores, caterers and transportation services, just to name a \nfew.\n  The Las Vegas Convention Center has contributed to Las Vegas growing \ninto the No. 1 trade show destination in America. Clark County hosts \nmore than 22,000 meetings, conventions, and trade shows every year. The \nconvention center has also been home to many of our Nation's most \nhistoric product announcements--including the VCR, the DVD player and \nhigh-definition television.\n  By hosting concerts by the Beatles, heavyweight fights featuring \nMuhammed Ali, events with Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Ford, Reagan and \nBush, the Las Vegas Convention Center has for 50 years played a central \nrole in the fabric of our national culture.\n  The Las Vegas Convention Center is an example of private industry and \npublic agencies working collaboratively for the benefit of the \ncommunity. I congratulate the Las Vegas Convention Center--and all \nthose who make it a success--on 50 outstanding years of creating \nopportunity for the people of Nevada and capturing the imagination of \npeople throughout America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4165-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4165-S4166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HELSINKI COMMISSION ACTIVITIES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to report to my colleagues on \nthe work of the U.S. delegation to the eighth Winter Meeting of the \nParliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe. This meeting was held on February 19 and 20 in Vienna, \nAustria. Prior to attending the Winter Meeting, the delegation traveled \nto Israel and Syria to ascertain the prospects for the Middle East \npeace process at this critical time.\n  I had the honor to lead this delegation as chairman of the Commission \non Security and Cooperation in Europe, better known as the Helsinki \nCommission.\n  Joining me as delegation leader in Vienna was my Helsinki Commission \nCochair, Representative Alcee L. Hastings. Three Senate colleagues on \nthe Commission--Senator Roger Wicker, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, and \nSenator Tom Udall--also joined the delegation for the entire trip, as \ndid fellow Commission member Representative Mike McIntyre. Although not \na member of the Helsinki Commission, Representative Gwen Moore also \njoined the delegation.\n  The delegation first visited Israel. Our arrival came 3 days after \nthat country's parliamentary elections and in the aftermath of the \nevents in Gaza. We met with Israeli President Shimon Peres, Prime \nMinister Ehud Olmert, Likud leader and now Prime Minister-designate \nBenjamin Netanyahu and numerous other officials. We also visited Yad \nVeshem and laid a wreath in memory of the millions lost in the \nHolocaust.\n  The delegation met with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam \nFayyad in East Jerusalem and Palestinian Authority Chief Negotiator \nSa'eb Erakat in the West Bank and in each of these meetings discussed \nthe current situation in Gaza and the West Bank, the potential for \nreconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, and how the United States can \nbe a constructive partner in facilitating the peace process.\n  In Damascus, Syria, our delegation had a country team briefing with \nU.S. Embassy staff, including U.S. Charge d'Affaires to Syria, Maura \nConnelly. We also held a constructive meeting with Syrian President \nBashar al-Asad and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallim, where the \ndelegation pressed them on the need to improve human rights in Syria, \nencouraged them to assist the international community in bringing Iran \ninto compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and \npromoted restarting peace talks with Israel.\n  The delegation paid a courtesy visit to the historic Omayyad Mosque \nas well as visited the only surviving synagogue in Damascus. A briefing \non the Iraqi refugee situation by the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees, UNHCR, Site Director in Damascus was extremely \ninformative. The delegation was particularly moved by its meeting with \na group of Iraqi refugees living in Syria. Their stories of hardship \nand suffering have galvanized our efforts to improve U.S. policies and \nactivities in support of these refugees in Syria and in other \nsurrounding countries.\n  The delegation's final stop was Vienna for the Winter Meeting. During \nthe first day of the meeting, our delegation was joined by a delegation \nled by Representative John Tanner that attended a meeting of the NATO \nParliamentary Assembly in Brussels earlier in the week.\n  A meeting of the Standing Committee, composed of the officers and \nheads of delegation to the OSCE PA, took place prior to the formal \nopening. As an OSCE PA vice president, I reported on the latest efforts \nof the Obama administration to close Guantanamo Bay as a detention \nfacility, an issue of continued concern in the Assembly. Our efforts in \nrecent years to be responsive to criticism of U.S. performance have \nbeen well received and provide a stronger basis for us to raise concern \nabout the human rights performance of other countries. In addition to \ndetailing the specific policy changes already announced by the Obama \nadministration, I expressed hope that ``these measures will help \nrestore faith in the United States as a friend, ally and leader in the \nglobal community. If the United States wants to lead, we must lead by \nexample.''\n  Cochairman Hastings also made a presentation on his work as the \nAssembly's Special Representative on Mediterranean Affairs, in \nparticular his travel to Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Israel--\nall Mediterranean Partner states--last December. He met with \nparliamentarians and senior government officials to discuss greater \nOSCE engagement, the Middle East peace process, regional economic \ncooperation, the prospects of the Union for the Mediterranean, and the \nIraqi refugee crisis.\n  OSCE PA President Joao Soares, Portugal, opened the Winter Meeting \nbefore 250 parliamentarians. The opening plenary was addressed by \nBarbara Prammer, President of Austria's National Council; Greek Foreign \nMinister Dora Bakoyannis, who chairs the OSCE in 2009; French diplomat \nMarc Perrin de Brichambaut, the OSCE's Secretary General, and by \nRepresentative John Tanner in his capacity as President of the NATO \nParliamentary Assembly.\n  Following the opening plenary, additional discussions were held in \neach of the Assembly's three General Committees: the First Committee, \ndealing with political affairs and security; the Second Committee, \nfocusing on economic Affairs, science, technology and environment; and \nthe Third Committee, which covers democracy, human rights and \nhumanitarian questions. Rapporteurs and guest speakers discussed \ncurrent issues and the prospects for OSCE PA work in the coming year. \nAmong the OSCE officials speaking in committee were Knut Vollebaek of \nNorway, the High Commissioner on National Minorities; Goran Svilanovic \nof Serbia, Economic and Environmental Coordinator; Miklos Haraszti of \nHungary, Representative of Free Media; and Janez Lenarcic of Slovenia, \nDirector of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.\n  Every member of the U.S. delegation was active throughout the \ncommittee sessions. In the First Committee, Representative McIntyre \nreported on the delegation's visit to Israel and Syria, and \nRepresenative Moore called attention to the plight of children in armed \nconflict and especially their use as child soldiers around the globe. \nIn the Second Committee, Senator Udall discussed the new prospects for \nU.S. engagement with Europe on climate change, and Senator Whitehouse \ncalled for greater transparency regarding extractive industries, where \ncorruption limits economic progress in developing countries. Senator \nWicker responded to criticisms of the United States related to the \neconomic crisis and pushed back against calls for greater trade \nprotectionism. In the Third Committee, Senator Wicker stressed the \ncontinued need to focus on religious freedom, which is threatened in \nmany countries of the OSCE region, while Cochairman Hastings explained \nthe OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\nimportant contribution to election observation in the region.\n  The Winter Meeting traditionally includes a plenary debate on issues \nthat are particularly relevant and timely. This year, the debate \nfocused on a proposal by Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and \nsupported by French President Nicolas Sarkozy for a new European \nsecurity architecture. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander \nGrushko and senior French Foreign Ministry official Veronique Bujon-\nBarre made opening presentations. Senators Whitehouse, Wicker, and I \neach spoke in the debate. We stressed the need to maintain a \ncomprehensive definition of security to include respect for human \nrights and commitment to democratic governance and, while not opposing \nfurther work, defended the NATO Alliance which some believe the Russian \nproposal intends to undercut. There was also considerable criticism of \nRussia's actions against neighboring Georgia in 2008, with considerable \nopposition to any attempt to legitimize this action in any new security \ntalks.\n  As the Winter Meeting came to a close, Representative Moore took the \nfloor during debate on gender issues to announce her intention to \nintroduce a resolution on the issue of maternal mortality, calling for \naction to reduce the number of women around the world and especially in \ndeveloping countries who die due to the lack of medical care in \nresponse to complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth. A \nGreek presentation on piracy as a new security threat and presentations \non Kazakhstan's preparations to chair the OSCE in 2010, rounded out the \nclosing issues of the meeting.\n  In addition to the sessions of the Winter Meeting, the congressional \ndelegation was briefed by the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Secretary \nGeneral, Spencer Oliver of the United States, and by the Charge \nd'Affaires of the U.S. Mission to the OSCE, Kyle Scott. The delegation \nhad bilateral sessions with OSCE Chair-in-Office Bakoyannis and \nnumerous OSCE officials.\n  The U.S. delegation also held a lengthy bilateral session with the \nRussian delegation, during which dialogue between the U.S. Congress and \nthe Russian Duma, among other issues, was discussed. While we do not \nagree on many issues, we did firmly agree on the importance of \ncontinued dialogue.\n  By all accounts, the Winter Meeting was 2 days of robust debate, and \nthe U.S. Delegation was an active part of that debate, engaging \nEuropean friends and allies on a variety of issues of importance to the \nUnited States. I want to thank my colleagues for the active \nparticipation throughout the trip.\n  At the invitation of the Government of Slovakia, I traveled the very \nshort distance from Vienna to Slovakia's capital, Bratislava. My other \ncolleagues remained in Vienna actively engaged in the work of the \nassembly discussed above.\n  Immediately upon arrival in Bratislava, I had a substantive and \nlengthy discussion with Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak. As the \nMinister had taken office just 2 weeks prior to our arrival, I had the \nprivilege of being the first Member of Congress to meet with him in \nthis capacity. Our wide-ranging discussion touched on the global \neconomic crisis, the Middle East peace process, the situation in the \nBalkans--the Minister was recently the EU Special Representative for \nBosnia and Herzegovina--anti-Semitism, and the plight of Slovakia's \nRoma population.\n  Following that meeting, Keith Eddins, the U.S. Charge d'Affaires, \nhosted a lunch with leading academics and NGO leaders to discuss \ncurrent events in Slovakia and the state of U.S.-Slovak relations. \nAfter lunch, I met with the chief rabbi and the lay leadership of \nSlovakia's Jewish community. Finally, before heading back to Vienna, I \nmet with a cross-section of Slovakia's Roma community. As Europe's \nlargest ethnic minority group, the Roma have been victims of some of \npostwar Europe's greatest discrimination. Congress's attention to \nissues of importance to this community has been inadequate in the past, \nbut I hope to see that change in the future.\n  The U.S. House and Senate should both take great pride in the unique \nability of the Helsinki Commission to represent the views and values of \nour country abroad, something which I, as chairman, intend to continue \nat future OSCE Parliamentary Assembly gatherings, including the Annual \nSession which convenes in Vilnius, Lithuania, in June and July of this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4166-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4166-S4168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Fellow Idahoans, the high cost of gas is taking its toll on \n     my family as well. I have very little money left after \n     driving to work and paying rent and insurance, to buy food. \n     After everything is all paid for, I do not have any money to \n     stash away for a rainy day. However, Senator Crapo and others \n     are letting us down and trying to give us simple answers. I \n     have spent countless hours researching alternative \n     technologies for transportation as well as power. Senator \n     Crapo and our other elected officials want to tell us the \n     simple way is to drill for more oil, According to government \n     scientists, drilling in ANWR will not actually have an impact \n     for five years if we started drilling tomorrow, and it would \n     only lower gas prices by 1 cent and make no mistake when they \n     say domestic drilling this is what they mean. They want to \n     open more nuclear power plants but nobody wants to take the \n     nuclear waste and Senator Crapo has no problem leaving it in \n     Idaho for us to deal with the nuclear waste of the world!!!!! \n     And Senator Crapo has no plans for the waste!! Search the MYT \n     engine; it is a great new technology that just disappeared \n     because oil companies do not want that technology out there. \n     Our elected officials are not working for us and they are \n     stuck in the mindset of oil as the only alternative. I demand \n     and so should you that NASA stops wasting our money going to \n     Mars and INL stops wasting money studying nuclear power and \n     works on a way to make solar power and wind power more \n     efficient. Solar thermal is a new type of solar power that is \n     more efficient than solar panels and produces more \n     electricity, Wind power is great and I see more windmills \n     going up all around Idaho. The truth is the technology and \n     the know how are out there, but our elected officials are \n     stuck in the mindset of oil, coal, and nuclear and not \n     willing to look at alternatives; demand that they think \n     outside the box.\n     Steven.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate your emails and asking how the energy problem \n     is affecting me and my family. I also hope you still have \n     your integrity and that you honestly do what is right for \n     America. In the 1990s, you were my Aunt's attorney in fixing \n     her estate before and after she died. She was very impressed \n     with you and thought you were an honest man. Please do not \n     let us down.\n       I am a retired/disabled police officer. I am on an income \n     that is pretty much fixed, but my wife is still working \n     though she is 66 years old, and we are both on Medicare and \n     Medicare Part D. I also take care of my 82-year-old father \n     who lives 30 miles from me and he is also on a fixed income. \n     I have to drive that distance two to three times a week to \n     take care of him. We have a small car, but the prices are \n     getting unbearable. We have cut back on most trips to the \n     store and to take care of my dad. We are still doing okay, \n     but the fear of the unknown grows constantly within us. I \n     wish Congress would get off feeling animals (e.g., caribou) \n     are more important than people. The environmental thing has \n     just gone too far. I believe in taking care of the things \n     that God has charged us with, but the citizens of this \n     country are important, too.\n       We are constantly fearful of Congress doing away with \n     Medicare and Medicare Part D. Please do the right thing and \n     make this country something proud to live in again.\n     Cliff.\n                                  ____\n\n       Many changes have come about in our life as a result of the \n     high gas prices.\n       1. Our planned 7,000 mile summer trip with our \n     grandchildren has been scaled back to 500 miles.\n       2. We do not eat out, and non-essential foods have been cut \n     from our food budget.\n       3. We must combine our shopping trips to the mall, grocery \n     stores, library, doctor appointments etc. in order to \n     conserve.\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\n       4. Our fixed income budget demands that we limit family \n     birthday and special occasion gifts.\n       5. We never drive our 2005 diesel powered pickup--it costs \n     over $200 to fill the tank--no money for that.\n       6. We are grateful that we can grow a garden and that we \n     have economical public transportation that is available to \n     use in getting to some locations in our city.\n       7. Retirement, which was quite comfortable for several \n     years, is no longer comfortable--we must watch every penny.\n       Thank you for allowing us to vent. We must go after the \n     resources within our borders and become energy independent!\n     Jack and Patricia, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       I e-mailed John Boehner and Bill Sali regarding the idea of \n     a new contract with America. I think we need it badly. I \n     recommend it be called ``The Freedom Contract with America.'' \n     Specifically, it could contain the following:\n       (1) Freedom from foreign oil and high gas and diesel \n     prices--bring up a vote for the ``All of the Above'' energy \n     bill of the Republicans.\n       (2) Freedom from high taxes--bring up a vote to make the \n     tax cuts of 2003 permanent.\n       (3) Freedom from any more illegal immigration--draft, \n     debate, and vote on a plan to complete the securing of our \n     borders and deal with the existing illegal immigrants in this \n     country.\n       That is it. Three items that would resonate with the \n     American public. Pledge to bring these up for a vote in the \n     first 100 days if a Republican majority is elected to \n     Congress. The left-wing media and the Democrats would mock it \n     and call it desperation. It does not matter. Take a risk. \n     What do we have to lose?\n       Anyway, I just wanted to mention to you this thought.\n     David.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked for stories on how high gas prices are affecting \n     people's lives. I provide occupational therapy home health \n     services to children with behavioral, cognitive, sensory, \n     and/or physical impairments that affect the development of \n     skills for functional living. I live in southeast Idaho, and \n     we have a shortage of therapists. These high prices are \n     affecting how many clients and which clients I can see. I \n     tend to see the clients in the more rural or hard to get \n     areas. I now pay $250-$350 a month in gas, and only see that \n     going up. This is going to affect whether some families \n     receive the services they so desperately need. It may end up \n     being that only those close to town get services.\n       We have been spoiled as a nation to consume, consume, throw \n     away, and use more energy that affects global warming than \n     all the other nations put together. They are used to paying \n     higher rates, we are not. I understand that; I just want it \n     to somehow be affordable. I do not want to have to change \n     jobs as I love the one I have! I do not think the idea of \n     adding a tax will help as the oil companies will just pass \n     that on to us, the consumers. I think they do need to pay \n     their full income tax (especially since they have been making \n     billions). Nor do I think drilling in the Arctic refuge areas \n     is the answer either--(I would rather use someone else's oil \n     as long as possible). I think the answer is in energy \n     alternatives. Electric cars/solar cars have been around since \n     the 1960s--however oil and big money kept the companies from \n     further developing those as a priority. Well, the time is \n     now. Develop incentives and cash breaks for people to buy, \n     try, or rent electric, solar, or hybrid type of vehicles. \n     These need to be developed and made available to consumers at \n     reasonable rates. It is the everyday person that needs those \n     types of vehicles, not just those in the higher income \n     brackets. Possibly offer higher reimbursement consideration \n     at tax time for mileage usage. (i.e.; instead of 46.5 cents \n     per mile, it may need to be 60 cents per mile)\n       Please, find a way for us to be able to continue to keep \n     our jobs, buy our groceries, have the occasional vacation, \n     and to provide services to those in need.\n     AJ.\n                                  ____\n\n       I wrote an email to you recently about the effects of the \n     energy crisis. My son, living in Alaska, has a different \n     perspective that is well taken. Please consider his position, \n     explained in his e-mail below.\n     Cheryl.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have a different view of the gas ``crisis.'' I personally \n     am glad that gas prices are increasing and oppose any type of \n     increased harvest of fossil fuels in Alaska. There is a large \n     amount of stored energy beneath the soil in Alaska but it is \n     finite. Once it is used . . . it is just that. The locations \n     of the proposed drill sites in Alaska are remote. Of course \n     the infrastructure to support the harvest can easily be \n     constructed but who will pay for that? We will. I think in \n     today's economy it is unrealistic to ever expect much of a \n     decrease in gas prices. The oil companies are not going to \n     ever give up their profits for the benefit of the general \n     public, regardless of where they drill. It is like a drug \n     dealer luring his addicts in little by little. Pretty soon we \n     are hooked and feel that we cannot survive without it. We as \n     the American public like the addict have become lazy and see \n     no way to survive without ``getting more.'' In rehab they \n     used the old cliche, ``Insanity is continually doing the same \n     thing and expecting different results.'' We the consumer, \n     like the drug addict, have the power to change our present \n     situation. God has blessed us with the faculties to adapt to \n     change and develop solutions to our problems. The recent \n     energy crisis in Juneau is a good example.\n       In May, an avalanche destroyed the power line responsible \n     for transporting electrical power from a hydro-electric power \n     plant to Juneau. Diesel generators were used to produce \n     energy for the city of over 30,000 people while repairs could \n     be made. The power company announced that the cost of repairs \n     would result in an increase to the consumer of 500% per \n     kilowatt hour. Neither business nor resident had ever planned \n     on such a drastic and sudden increase. What were we to do? \n     What we did was listen to people who had studied and prepared \n     for such things. Most had previously been touted as, \n     ``extreme left wing environmentalists.'' However, now their \n     experience, ingenuity, advice, and insight was publicized in \n     local newspapers and radio shows. Flyers were sent out in the \n     mail with suggestions on how to go about daily life while \n     drastically cutting power consumption. What happened in the \n     face of financial disaster? We listened, took the direction \n     and embraced change. It was extremely difficult at first, and \n     somewhat bizarre. Million dollar homes had clothes drying on \n     lines in the front yard. Grocery stores and businesses turned \n     off the lights and the neon signs that line the streets. \n     People stopped watching televisions in the evening. We took \n     either fewer showers or cold ones to eliminate the need for \n     water heaters. Meals were prepared for ahead of time and \n     planned so that the use of ovens and microwaves decreased. We \n     bought fewer groceries to eliminate the need for a second \n     refrigerator. We used blankets rather than run the electric \n     furnace. I wore my clothes to 3 and 4 times before washing, \n     unless they became soiled to an unsightly point. The result \n     was an overall decrease in power consumption by the entire \n     city of over 30%.\n       The power company took note of that immediately. AEL (the \n     power company) had originally planned on taking three months \n     to complete the repairs. That would have resulted in the 500% \n     cost increase to last twelve months. Instead, in large part \n     due to the drastic decrease in energy consumption, AEL \n     decided it would be in their best interest to return things \n     back to normal ASAP. The repairs were made in one month with \n     the increase lasting only three months. Guess what? Even \n     though our supply is back, people took note and are still \n     working to conserve. At first everyone panicked, and felt \n     that it was a hopeless situation. Some of the meter readers \n     even got beat up by the residents of the metered houses they \n     read. Those idiots are still addicted to their lazy way of \n     life, and are the ones who are asking the government for help \n     to pay their power bills. Those who were not resistant to \n     change are now on to a better, freer way of life. We do have \n     a choice. That is the American way.\n       In my opinion it is no different than the message taught by \n     the church in its admonition to store food and supplies. The \n     Boy Scout motto is ``Be Prepared.'' I personally think we \n     should take it to heart and be prepared for anything. I for \n     one do not want to be dependent on anyone . . . especially a \n     for profit corporation that makes billions of dollars in \n     profit each quarter.\n       In Alaska, the oil and mining industries lobby Native \n     American villages and corporations (which own the land) to \n     support their cause. They pay poor communities big bucks to \n     have their citizens do TV and radio spots in support of the \n     company's agenda. They capitalize on the poverty of the \n     people to help them sell their cause, all in the effort of \n     making another dollar. I guess it could be seen as an even \n     trade until the resource is used up, the people who have been \n     dependent on the money from that resource abandoned and the \n     executives of the oil company sitting on top of a fat \n     fortune.\n       I do not mind paying more money for gasoline right now \n     because I see it as a catalyst for change. I can choose \n     whether or not to purchase the gas. I live about 15 miles \n     from work. It takes me just under an hour to ride my mountain \n     bike one way. I get fit, have time to think, breath fresh \n     clean air, and do not use gasoline. FYI . . . gas just hit \n     4.75 here and is expected to top $5.00 by the end of the \n     week. They're telling us that September will be even worse \n     with prices topping $6.00.\n       I live in Alaska. We have the greatest stores of fossil \n     fuels in the country. We also pay more to use those fuels \n     than most places in the country. I am not at all in favor of \n     harvesting the natural resources here, and defacing the last \n     unspoiled place in our country to foster the laziness of the \n     rest of the country. Forget about gas prices. Buy a bike, \n     turn off the television, work in the garden, do more manual \n     labor. Supply meets demand. Demand less and the supply will \n     be greater. Produce more the demand will continue to increase \n     . . . just like dope.\n       This is just my opinion. I wish all of you could experience \n     Alaska. Not the cruise ship, guided hunt/fishing trip Alaska. \n     Come spend some quiet time with me in the woods where you \n     know that when you walk five miles into the brush, you will \n     not come across another soul walking upright on two legs. I \n     hope this letter did not offend any of you. I will not \n     apologize for my feelings but hope I have remained tactful in \n     expressing them.\n     Shane.\n                                  ____\n\n       You requested a couple of paragraphs about how we are \n     affected by high energy prices so I am responding. My husband \n     and I\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\n     retired to Kamiah in 1991. We really liked the small \n     community and being close to outdoor activities. Since then, \n     our property taxes have tripled. The town is now considered a \n     retirement community (according to our insurance company), so \n     car insurance has gone up. Every time our Social Security \n     gets a cost of living raise, then Medicare takes most of it.\n       If we need to buy some reasonably priced clothing or other \n     items, we have to drive 70 miles (one way) to Lewiston. So, \n     it is costing us $20 plus to go shopping for necessities. \n     Yes, there are towns approximately 30 miles, but on a fixed \n     income the price of clothing and other essentials prevents us \n     from shopping in these towns. The gas stations in this town \n     have finally settled down to the national average, but they \n     were charging 10 cents higher than the national average.\n       We can no longer afford to go to Lewiston for a nice dinner \n     to celebrate a birthday or special occasion. I do hope you \n     can do something. If nothing else, make sure that Social \n     Security gives us a cost of living raise at the start of next \n     year that includes the high price of gas and groceries, and \n     that Medicare does not take it away.\n     Marilyn.\n                                  ____\n\n       The high cost of energy has made me realize that the \n     problems will not be solved by the government. This national \n     crisis has been identified as coming for 30 years with little \n     or nothing to fix it, and most of the time laws are passed \n     that aggravate the energy problem.\n       Homeowner associations prevent modifications to homes in \n     developments to add solar or wing energy generation \n     appliances to ``preserve property values''. New housing \n     development companies disregard plot alignment that prompt \n     use of solar energy. Every few developers build homes this \n     smart home technology installed that has been available for \n     20 years. The added cost of smart home technology would be a \n     tiny fraction of an added cost at construction time and a \n     major cost to retrofit but would pay back in 5 years or less \n     in energy savings when utilized. ``Passive Annual Heat \n     Storage'' is a technology that would have a major impact on \n     energy savings but will never see any support because it \n     leaves the money saved in the pocket of the homeowner and \n     does not go to some alternate energy conglomerate.\n       I have personally drawn a circle on the map around my house \n     and anything within one mile I walk to. Anything within three \n     miles I bicycle to and if I have to drive I plan at least \n     three stops or I wait until I have three stops. Any family \n     member that do have to drive are hunting for jobs closer to \n     home and we phone relay to have any one going by a store pick \n     up thing needed so a trip home from work can pick up for a \n     number of family member.\n     Perry.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing you this e-mail because of the gas prices. I \n     am a single mom of three boys, and I work a full time job. \n     These three or four years I have not had to get help from the \n     state and was able to make it on my own without the help from \n     the state. But now that the gas prices keep going up I might \n     have to get that help again, just to be able to feed my boys. \n     Life right now is getting too hard when I have to my choice \n     of making sure that I can provide the food for my boys or put \n     gas in my car. So that I can get to work every day and it has \n     been hard. Plus I think that these gas prices are wrong for \n     the amount we are having to pay, but if we do not pay that \n     amount then we do not have a jobs and no money to buy food \n     and etc. Something needs to be done and stop the gas prices \n     from going up any more so we as Americans can make it. So \n     please help us.\n     Felicia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4168-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 COMMENDING KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS--HAWAII\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

This year Kamehameha was one of three schools \nselected to receive this award and the only school noted for multiple \nsports programs.\n  I wish to acknowledge Kamehameha Schools--Hawaii's vision, \ncommitment, and diligent efforts to create and uphold a positive \nathletic environment for its students, coaches, and fans. Kamehameha is \nthe first PCA-partnered school in the State of Hawaii, and it requires \nall leaders, coaches, parents, and students who want to participate in \nthe school's athletics programs to attend PCA workshops to be eligible. \nAdditionally, it has integrated the school principle of pu'uhonua--\nsanctuary--into the 22-sport athletics program, ensuring appropriate \nbehavior toward referees and other visitors. I wish to acknowledge all \nmembers of the Kamehameha Schools--Hawaii Athletic Department on their \nnoteworthy accomplishment. I wish to give special recognition to \nathletic director Bob Wagner, headmaster Stan Fortuna, and school \nprincipal Ninia Aldrich.\n  However, this sort of large scale effort cannot be done without the \ncooperation and support of all of the student-athletes and their \nfamilies. I commend the entire Kamehameha Schools--Hawaii community for \ntheir initiative and understanding in establishing the high level of \nsportsmanship and respect that has earned this award.\n  I encourage these coaches and students to continue their dedication \nto teamwork, character-building and positivity that helps the young \nathletes of today become the model citizens of tomorrow. I wish nothing \nbut the best for the students, their families, and their coaches and \nwish them and the athletic program continued success in future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4168-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TESSA SHUMWAY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Tessa \nShumway of Terry, MT--this year's winner of the National Disaster \nResponse Preparedness Award from the American Red Cross. Tessa is from \nTerry, a small town in eastern Montana.\n  In Montana, we are proud of our open spaces, of our outdoor heritage \nand our rural landscape. We didn't get the title ``Big Sky Country'' by \nfilling our land with skyscrapers or high rises or byways. We are hard \nworking, quiet people with the grit to build our lives on some of the \nmost beautiful and rugged land on Earth. We are Montanans.\n  Of course, living in Montana's rural communities can create some \nchallenges. For folks in places like Ismay or Brockaway, when disaster \nstrikes, the nearest help may be miles away. And that is where Tessa \nShumway comes in. Tessa is the face of the Red Cross across 10 counties \nin eastern Montana. Her territory is larger than the entire State of \nIndiana.\n  She is on call 24 hours a day, every day of the week. She is the \nlocal disaster chair, disaster instructor, preparedness trainer, \nvolunteer recruiter and statewide disaster committee cochair. In \naddition to all this, Tessa holds a regular day job as a bartender at \nthe American Legion in Terry.\n  Tessa received the Disaster Response Preparedness Award not only for \nher years spent helping the folks of eastern Montana, but also for the \nnew volunteers and Red Cross workers she has trained. It is impossible \nto know how many lives she has touched, how many people she has helped, \nsimply by passing her knowledge on to others.\n  I would like to congratulate Tessa, her husband Zane and two \nchildren, Josh and Katrina--as well as the folks of Terry, who have a \ntrue hero in their community.\n  March of 2009 was a difficult month for Montanans. Several tragedies \nshook our State, from a deadly explosion in Bozeman to the tragic plane \ncrash in Butte. Montana's Red Cross stepped up to help folks recover \nand rebuild. Tessa herself was on hand to help victims of the fire in \nMiles City and find shelter for folks displaced by dangerous winter \nstorms.\n  I believe service is one of the most honorable things a person can \ndo. Whether it is service to one's community, State or country--service \nis the most noble of all human endeavors. That is why I would like to \nrecognize Tessa Shumway as a Montana hero--a woman who has given so \nmuch of herself to her neighbors and to the people of our State. We are \nlucky to have her under the Big Sky and I am proud to call her a fellow \nMontanan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4168-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4168-S4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PATRICK J. FINNERAN JR.\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to honor a fine Missourian, \nPatrick J. Finneran, Jr., for his distinguished career as well as his \nrecord of community activism.\n  In 1967, Pat graduated from the University of Notre Dame, where he \nwas\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nan ROTC cadet. Upon graduation he was commissioned a second lieutenant \nin the U.S. Marines and reported to the Officers Basic School. \nFollowing successful completion of naval flight officer training, Pat \nwas ordered to Vietnam for combat duty with the First Marine Air Wing.\n  Having served his country honorably, Pat departed from the U.S. \nMarine Corps in 1987, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Though \nleaving the military, Pat remained involved in national defense. He \njoined the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which eventually became the \nBoeing Company, as manager of business development for the AV-8 Harrier \nProgram and later rose to become the president of Boeing's Support \nSystems Division, Integrated Defense Systems.\n  Aside from his professional career, Pat has served the State of \nMissouri and the Nation as a respected citizen. His love of country has \nshown itself in Pat's two sons, one a Marine Corps major and another \nwith the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency.\n  Pat will retire from Boeing on April 1 of this year. From his \nhonorable service as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps to \nhis current post with the Boeing Company, Patrick Finneran, Jr. has \nalways worked to inspire those around him with a sense of duty and \npride in their country.\n  I thank Pat and his family for their service to our Nation, and I \nwish them all the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4169-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING RON SILVER\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on March 18, the lights were \ndimmed by theatres on Broadway in tribute to a talented actor and a \npassionate patriot. Ron Silver's life was cut short by cancer and, as a \nresult, America lost an individual who was not just a marvelous \nentertainer, but an engaged and active citizen.\n  I was proud and privileged to call Ron Silver my friend. Everyone who \nknew Ron was impressed by his intelligence, his humor, and his passion. \nHe was not the distant celebrity, but rather he was a man of humility \nwho possessed great talent.\n  Ron's acting ability was recognized in 1988 when he won a Tony Award \nfor his performance in the play ``Speed-the-Plow.'' He was known to \nmillions of Americans for his roles on television in ``Rhoda'' and more \nrecently as the political operative in the ``West Wing.''\n  Ron's had a deep and abiding love for America. He took the \nresponsibilities of citizenship very seriously and he was active in the \npublic square. Ron was one of the cofounders of the Creative Coalition \nthat advocated for support for the arts. As Ron once said, ``I'm an \nactor by calling but an activist by inclination.''\n  I believe that Ron was a political liberal in the best and truest \nsense of the term. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attack, Ron recognized \nthat our progressive values and our national security were most \nthreatened by the forces of radical Islamic extremism. He became an \neloquent and effective advocate in winning the war on terror and \ndefending our values and country.\n  Some said Ron Silver changed his political orientation. In reality, \nhe was entirely consistent in his belief that we can never be \ncomplacent when the values we cherish are under attack whether at home \nor abroad.\n  Although Ron had political differences with some of his old friends, \nit rarely affected their friendships. He understood that people of good \nfaith could have political differences and still get along. That \ndynamic is reflected in some of the tributes that I have included at \nthe conclusion of my remarks. We can all learn from Ron's example.\n  Ron Silver was a passionate patriot who entertained us, moved us and \nmade us think. My prayers and wishes are with his family and many \nfriends. He was an original and will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4169-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING ENCHANTMENT WEDDING SERVICES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize \nEnchantment Wedding Services, a small business in my home State of \nMaine that is led by an innovative and caring entrepreneur who is using \nher talents to lighten the burden for those struggling with breast \ncancer.\n  Enchantment Wedding Services is the brainchild of Ellie Bowie, a \nnotary public who has been officiating wedding ceremonies for over a \ndecade. She recently opened a shop on Main Street in Lisbon Falls, \nwhere she began selling wedding gowns, in addition to offering wedding \nservices. Aside from its dresses, Enchantment Weddings sells tiaras, \ngloves, and veils, and Ms. Bowie hopes to soon carry bridesmaid dresses \nat her shop. Enchantment Weddings purchases both new and vintage \nwedding gowns from the Making Memories Foundation, a group that focuses \non granting the wishes of terminal breast cancer patients, as well as \nproviding education about the disease and resources available to these \npatients. The dresses are all elegant Victorian or Edwardian styles, \nmany of which were donated to the organization by high-end bridal \nboutiques nationwide.\n  Committed to helping the Making Memories Foundation in its efforts, \nMs. Bowie returns 5 percent of the price of each gown's sale to the \nBrides Against Breast Cancer program, an initiative of the Making \nMemories Foundation that raises money to help breast cancer patients \nand their families. She was inspired to engage in this partnership by \nher grandmother, a breast cancer survivor who lived to be 96, as well \nas a close friend's mother who is fighting the disease.\n  What makes Ms. Bowie's business all the more impressive is that it \nis, in essence, her second job. Ms. Bowie works fulltime for a local \ntrucking company, and operates Enchantment Weddings during evenings and \nweekends. Ms. Bowie's commitment to her business is remarkable, and her \npassion for making a difference in the lives of the hundreds of \nthousands suffering with this disease is nothing short of inspiring.\n  Mr. President, too many women and men will find out this year that \nthey have breast cancer. But fortunately for them, our country has \npeople like Ellie Bowie, who will ensure that America's greatest \nstrengths--its benevolent nature and kindhearted spirit--never fade. I \nthank Ms. Bowie for her thoughtful, creative, and compassionate \nefforts, and wish her and her business the best of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4169-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4169-S4170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 151.

A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to reauthorize a provision relating to additional contract \nauthority for States with Indian reservations; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleagues Senators Bennett, Udall, Kyl, and Hatch to introduce the \nIndian School Bus Route Safety Reauthorization Act of 2009. This bill \ncontinues an important Federal program begun in 1998 that addresses a \nunique problem with the roads in and around the nation's single largest \nIndian reservation and the neighboring counties. Through this program, \nNavajo children who had been prevented from getting to school by roads \nthat were often impassable are now traveling safely to and from their \nschools. Because of the unusual nature of this situation, I believe it \nmust continue to be addressed at the Federal level.\n  I would like to begin with some statistics on this unique problem and \nwhy I believe a Federal solution continues to be necessary. The Navajo \nNation is by far the Nation's largest Indian Reservation, covering \n25,000 square miles. Portions of the Navajo Nation are in three states: \nArizona, New Mexico, and Utah. No other reservation comes anywhere \nclose to the size of Navajo. To give you an idea of its size, the State \nof West Virginia is about 24,000 square miles. In fact, 10 States are \nsmaller in size than the Navajo reservation.\n  According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, about 9,700 miles of \npublic roads serve the Navajo nation. Only about one-third of these \nroads are paved. The remaining 6,500 miles, 67 percent, are dirt roads. \nEvery day school buses use nearly all of these roads to transport \nNavajo children to and from school.\n  About 6,200 miles of the roads on the Navajo reservation are BIA \nroads, and about 3,300 miles are State and county roads. All public \nroads within, adjacent to, or leading to the reservation, including \nBIA, State, and county roads are considered part of the Federal Indian \nReservation Road System. However, only BIA and tribal roads are \neligible for Federal maintenance funding from BIA. Moreover, \nconstruction funding and improvement funding from the Federal Lands \nHighways Program in SAFETEA is generally applied only to BIA or tribal \nroads. Thus, the States and counties are responsible for maintenance \nand improvement of their 2,500 miles of roads that serve the \nreservation.\n  The counties in the 3 States that include the Navajo reservation are \nsimply not in a position to maintain all of the roads on the \nreservation that carry children to and from school. Nearly all of the \nland area in these counties is under Federal or tribal jurisdiction.\n  For example, in my State of New Mexico, \\3/4\\ of McKinley County is \neither tribal or Federal land, including BLM, Forest Service, and \nmilitary land. The Indian land area alone comprises 61 percent of \nMcKinley County. Consequently, the county can draw\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\nupon only a very limited tax base as a source of revenue for \nmaintenance purposes. Of the nearly 600 miles of county-maintained \nroads in McKinley County, 512 miles serve Indian land.\n  In San Juan County, Utah, the Navajo Nation comprises 40 percent of \nthe land area. The county maintains 611 miles of roads on the Navajo \nNation. Of these, 357 miles are dirt, 164 miles are gravel and only 90 \nmiles are paved. On the reservation, the county has three high schools, \ntwo elementary schools, two BIA boarding schools and four pre-schools.\n  The situation is similar in neighboring San Juan County, New Mexico, \nand Apache, Navajo, and Coconino Counties, Arizona. In light of the \ncounties' limited resources, I do believe the Federal Government is \nasking the States and counties to bear too large a burden for road \nmaintenance in this unique situation.\n  Families living in and around the reservation are no different from \nfamilies anywhere else; their children are entitled to the same \nopportunity to get to school safely and to get a good education. \nHowever, the many miles of unpaved and deficient roads on the \nreservation are frequently impassable, especially when they are wet, \nmuddy or snowy. If the school buses do not get through, the kids simply \ncannot get to school.\n  These children are literally being left behind.\n  Because of the vast size of the Navajo reservation, the cost of \nmaintaining the county roads used by the school buses is more than the \ncounties can bear without Federal assistance. I believe it is essential \nthat the Federal Government help these counties deal with this one-of-\na-kind situation.\n  In response to this unique situation, in 1998 Congress began \nproviding direct annual funding to the counties that contain the Navajo \nreservation to help ensure that children on the reservation can get to \nand from their public schools. In 2005, the program was reauthorized in \nSAFETEA through 2009. Under this provision, $1.8 million is made \navailable each year to be shared equally among the three states. The \nfunding is provided directly to the counties in Arizona, New Mexico, \nand Utah that contain the Navajo reservation. I want to be very clear: \nthese Federal funds can be used only on roads that are located within \nor that lead to the reservation, that are on the State or county \nmaintenance system, and that are used by school buses.\n  This program has been very successful. For the last 12 years, the \ncounties have used the annual funding to help maintain the routes used \nby school buses to carry children to school and to Headstart programs. \nI have had an opportunity to see firsthand the importance of this \nfunding when I rode in a school bus over some of the roads that are \nmaintained using funds from this program.\n  The bill I am introducing today provides a simple 6-year \nreauthorization of that program, for fiscal years 2010 through 2015, \nwith a modest increase in the annual funding to allow for inflation and \nfor additional roads to be maintained in each of the 3 States.\n  I believe that continuing this program for 6 more years is fully \njustified because of the vast area of the Navajo reservation by far the \nnation's largest and the unique nature of this need that only the \nFederal Government can deal with effectively.\n  I do not believe any child wanting to get to and from school should \nhave to risk or tolerate unsafe roads. Kids today, particularly in \nrural and remote areas, face enough barriers to getting a good \neducation. The Senate already passed this legislation last year. I ask \nall Senators to join me again this year in assuring that Navajo \nschoolchildren at least have a chance to get to school safely and get \nan education.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member \nInhofe of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Voinovich of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee, to incorporate this legislation once again \ninto the comprehensive 6-year reauthorization of the surface \ntransportation programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian School Bus Route \n     Safety Reauthorization Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACT AUTHORITY FOR \n                   STATES WITH INDIAN RESERVATIONS.\n\n       Section 1214(d)(5)(A) of the Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century (23 U.S.C. 202 note; 112 Stat. 206; 119 \n     Stat. 1460) is amended by striking ``$1,800,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 2005 through 2009'' and inserting ``$2,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2015''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT of Utah. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues Senators Bingaman, Hatch, Udall of New Mexico and Kyl as we \nintroduce the Indian School Bus Route Safety Reauthorization Act of \n2009. This legislation reauthorizes an important program that has \nserved the Navajo Nation and specifically Navajo children since 1998. \nThe funding provided in this program is used exclusively to maintain \nroads that provide bus routes for Navajo children. Two thirds of the \n9,700 miles of the Navajo public roads are unpaved, dirt roads. Many of \nthese roads are traveled everyday by children heading to school on the \nbus. When the rough rains and snows of winter hit, the deficient roads \nare frequently impassable. Damage caused by winds and rains can create \nhuge holes and gullies that often make the roads unfit for a school bus \neven in good weather!\n  This program was started in 1998 to ensure the local governments, \nworking in partnership with the Navajo, are able to maintain the roads \nand ensure the school bus routes are usable and in good condition. \nBefore children can learn at school, they have to get to school! \nCongress answered the urgent call for help by providing direct funding \nto the counties that contain the Navajo reservation to help ensure that \nchildren on the reservation can get to and from their public schools. \nThis program was reauthorized in SAFETEA-LU in 2005 and we urge our \ncolleagues in the Senate to join us in supporting this important \nproject again in 2009.\n  This bill provides for $2 million annually to be shared equally among \nArizona, New Mexico and Utah. The funding goes directly to the counties \nthat contain the Navajo reservation. These funds can only be used on \nroads that are located within or that lead to the reservation and that \nare used by school buses.\n  I want to take a moment and pay tribute to San Juan County, UT. San \nJuan County has done a commendable job of working with their Navajo \nneighbors to ensure a strong working relationship and to truly serve \nthe Navajo members of their community. The Navajo Nation comprises 40 \npercent of the San Juan County land area and the county maintains 611 \nmiles of roads on the Navajo Nation. Of these, 357 miles are dirt, 164 \nmiles are gravel and only 90 miles are paved. On the reservation, the \ncounty has three high schools, two elementary schools, two BIA boarding \nschools and four pre-schools. The funds reauthorized in this bill will \nallow San Juan County to continue their commitment to ensuring busses \ncan reach the students and thus the students will be safely transported \nto school.\n  I am proud to again bring this authorization before the Senate and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues here and in the House to \nensure that this important measure is included in the upcoming \ntransportation authorization. I thank my colleague Mr. Bingaman for his \nstrong work on this legislation and look forward to working closely \nwith him as well as Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and Chairman Baucus and Ranking \nMember Voinovich of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee \nto ensure that this legislation is again included in the comprehensive \n6-year transportation reauthorization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 762. A bill to promote fire safe communities and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a series of \nbills, S. 762, S. 763, and S. 764, designed to better prepare for \ncatastrophic wildfires like the ones that recently devastated \nSouthwestern Australia and\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\nthat have plagued much of our country for years.\n  California has seen unprecedented devastation from wildfires in the \nlast 5 years.\n  Over 10,000 families have lost their homes.\n  Over 4 million acres have been burned.\n  In 2007, wildfires in Southern California caused the evacuation of an \nestimated 750,000 people--the largest evacuation in California history.\n  In these fires alone, more than a million acres burned, and more than \n2,000 homes were destroyed.\n  These fires killed nine people, and injured 130. Mostly firefighters.\n  The financial damage is estimated to be in the billions.\n  Simply put, this was a disaster of epic proportions.\n  It was not the first. Southern California suffered similar wildfire \nlosses just 5 years ago.\n  We must face the fact that catastrophic wildfires are in California's \nfuture, and the future of other States.\n  Experts predict that things are only going to get worse in the years \nto come.\n  Global warming, extended droughts, dangerous invasive species \noutbreaks, and years of poor forest and fuel management have all \ncontributed to the explosive conditions that we now face.\n  The reality is that California and much of the West is tinder-dry. \nFires are larger, and they burn hotter and with more intensity.\n  In early February we saw the tragic consequences of catastrophic \nwildfire in Australia. Two hundred are dead, a million acres burned, \nand whole communities were wiped out in a matter of hours.\n  Here in the U.S. we face that very same possibility, and we must do \neverything we can to stop a similar tragedy from devastating our \nneighborhoods.\n  The problem is that more and more people are living in areas at high \nrisk of wildfire. There are more than 5 million homes in California \nalone in this high-threat ``wildland-urban interface.'' Across the rest \nof the country, there are nearly 40 million more homes located in the \nwildland urban interface.\n  So the question comes: What can be done?\n  There is no doubt that we cannot fully eliminate wildfires.\n  But I believe that we can take steps now to better protect \ncommunities, to improve firefighting capabilities, and to improve \nrelief and recovery aid.\n  The three bills that I am introducing today will get this process \nstarted. They are the Fire Safe Communities Act, which would establish \nnew incentives for communities at risk of wildfires to adopt \nresponsible building codes and mitigation practices.\n  The Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act, to make sure that \nqualified individuals, displaced by major disasters, are able to make \ntheir mortgage and rental payments.\n  The Disaster Rebuilding Assistance Act, to increase the amount of \nfederal dollars available to homeowners whose rebuilding costs outstrip \ntheir insurance coverage.\n  The Fire Safe Communities Act will help protect our communities from \nthe catastrophic effects of wildfires.\n  Most importantly, it does three key things.\n  It gives incentives to local communities that have adopted \nresponsible fire-mitigation plans by allowing for greater federal \nreimbursement of firefighting costs during major fires.\n  It creates a grant program to encourage responsible development \npractices that meet wildland-urban interface code guidelines.\n  It allows for the Department of the Interior and the Department of \nAgriculture to collaboratively work on mitigation projects that will \nprotect homes on State and private lands\n  In effect, the Federal Government would become the partner of local \ngovernments as they seek to make their communities fire-safe.\n  As I have said, we can never stop wildfires. But we can take \nimportant steps to make these fires less destructive.\n  This bill starts with the first step, by putting a reliable, \nunambiguous definition to ``Fire Safe'' communities.\n  Current Wildland fire codes, such as those produced by the \nInternational Code Council and the National Fire Protection \nAssociation, compile a comprehensive set of best practices that can be \nadopted by communities that are looking to protect themselves from fire \ndamage. If properly implemented, these codes can greatly improve the \nfire resistance of these communities and their residents.\n  The fire code guidelines address water supply, construction materials \nand techniques, defensible space, vegetation management, and \ninfrastructure standards.\n  The target mitigation measures in fire codes have been proven to be \neffective. Firefighter groups, insurance companies, and blue ribbon \npanels have all come to the same conclusions. It is time that we take \ntheir advice and start making this important investment.\n  The bill authorizes a $25 million per year grant program, \nadministered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's, FEMA, Office \nof Grants, and Training.\n  It will help communities implement these standards, and bring the \nsafest development practices to their neighborhoods.\n  This grant program will be available to local governments located in \nthe wildlife-urban interface, and to high-threat regions that have \nadopted--or plan to adopt--these responsible firesafe measures.\n  As further incentive, this bill makes the existing Fire Management \nAssistance Grants program contingent on the implementation of Firesafe \ncodes, standards and ordinances.\n  Today under the Fire Management Assistance Grant program, the federal \ngovernment covers 75 percent of the cost of fighting wildfires.\n  Under this bill, communities that adopt the firesafe codes would be \neligible for Federal reimbursement of up to 90 percent of their \nfirefighting costs.\n  It is important to note that firesafe building codes, standards and \nordinances are not mandatory. The Federal Government should not be in \nthe business of telling local governments how and where to build their \nbuildings.\n  Instead these are voluntary codes; communities can choose to adopt, \nor not to adopt, at their discretion.\n  The bill does not step on the toes of local government. Rather, helps \nall of us reach a common goal.\n  I come from local government--I am 9 years a mayor, 9 years a county \nsupervisor--and I recognize that zoning is the province of local \ngovernment.\n  But we have a real problem here: We know that development in the \nwildland-urban interface is accelerating, and it is making fires more \ncostly.\n  We need to take steps to improve fire safety in these areas.\n  This bill is an important step toward becoming better prepared.\n  Now I want to discuss two bills intended to improve recovery aid \nafter disaster strikes.\n  The Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act will provide much-needed \nrelief to working families hit hard by disasters.\n  It would authorize FEMA to make mortgage and rental assistance \navailable for qualified individuals in communities designated as \ndisaster areas by the President under the Stafford Act.\n  It is based on an important point: While catastrophic wildfires and \nother disasters can destroy homes, they don't relieve people of the \nfinancial obligations that come with home ownership or lease \nagreements.\n  In most cases, these payments must still be made, even if the \nresidence has been wiped out.\n  This burden is too much for many working families. They incur \nadditional expenses--such as hotel or lodging costs--that come with \nbeing displaced following a major disaster.\n  FEMA used to provide mortgage and rental assistance. But these types \nof assistance were eliminated by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000.\n  This bill would re-authorize the program, and make several changes to \nensure that assistance is provided only to those most in need.\n  First, to qualify for assistance applicants must demonstrate that \nthey face significant economic hardships and suffered disaster-related \nincome loss.\n  The disaster-related income loss must fit into one of the following \ncategories: your employer, or your own business, must be located in the \narea declared a major disaster by the President; you lose your job \nbecause your\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\nemployer or business has a significant business relationship with a \ncompany located within the Presidentially declared disaster area; or \nyou live in a Presidentially declared disaster area, and have suffered \nfinancially due to travel restrictions and road closures post-disaster.\n  To qualify for this aid, applicants must also provide proof that \ntheir employment was discontinued as a result of disaster.\n  They must also show imminent delinquency, eviction, dispossession, or \nforeclosure.\n  Finally, this assistance is available only for up to 18 months, and \nis subject to income caps.\n  Only households with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or less, in \nhigh-cost states such as California, would be eligible.\n  Households in lower-cost States could be eligible if their annual \nadjusted gross incomes do not exceed $75,000.\n  In today's market conditions, the federal government needs to make \nsure that we do everything we can to help families stay in their homes.\n  The Mortgage and Rental Assistance Act will prevent foreclosures in \ndisaster areas by helping families make their payments on time. Given \nthe state of the housing market, this bill is of the utmost importance \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The Disaster Rebuilding Assistance Act would increase the amount of \nmoney FEMA can provide--for rebuilding and temporary housing--in high-\ncost states such as California.\n  It is designed to help disaster victims whose rebuilding costs exceed \ntheir insurance coverage. Or for low income earners who have no \ninsurance.\n  Sadly, many Californians hit by wildfires or other disasters learn \ntoo late that their insurance coverage is insufficient.\n  This is a real problem in California. In fact, California Insurance \nCommissioner Steve Poizner estimates that as many as 25 percent of the \nvictims of the 2007 wildfires were underinsured.\n  Let me be clear: this bill will not cover the full costs of \nrebuilding.\n  But it will help close the gap, for qualified households in areas \ndeclared by the President to be disaster areas.\n  Today, FEMA can provide up to roughly $28,000 to individuals and \nhouseholds whose rebuilding costs exceed their insurance coverage. This \nassistance can be used for rebuilding costs, as well as temporary \nhousing.\n  The Disaster Rebuilding Assistance Act would increase this amount to \n$50,000 for individuals who earn less than $100,000 per year. By \nincreasing the amount of assistance, and targeting the program toward \nlower-income homeowners, the FEMA Disaster Assistance program will more \nefficiently help homeowners recover from disasters.\n  The legislation also gives the President the discretion to increase \nthis cap, if necessary, to cover rebuilding expenses in high-cost \nstates.\n  I believe this bill will provide an important step toward giving \nAmericans the chance they need to rebuild their lives after suffering \nthrough a major disaster.\n  Catastrophic wildfires are not going away. In fact, the evidence \nstrongly suggests they will occur with greater frequency and ferocity.\n  But we can take important steps--now--to make our communities safer.\n  To strengthen our firefighting capabilities.\n  To ensure that more relief and recovery aid is provided to victims, \nso they can get back on their feet as soon as possible.\n  These bills are not a panacea. But they are an important first step. \nI urge my colleagues to vote for them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 766. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue \nright-of-way permits for natural gas pipeline transportation utility \nsystems in non-wilderness areas within the boundary of Denali National \nPark and Preserve; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will authorize a right-of-way for Construction of an in-state \nnatural gas pipeline to run along the State's main highway from \nFairbanks to Anchorage. This bill would provide a right-of-way for a \nnatural gas pipeline near the shoulder of the Parks Highway for the \nroughly 7 miles that the highway runs through Denali National Park.\n  I wish to explain I am introducing the bill now, and why, rather than \nbeing an infringement on Alaska's most visited Interior national park, \nthe measure is actually the favored route by many in the environmental \ncommunity to bring natural gas from the foothills of Alaska's North \nSlope to Southcentral Alaska.\n  While many in this body have heard about plans for a large-volume \nnatural gas pipeline to run from the Prudhoe Bay oil fields to the \nLower 48--the project for which many in this body voted to approve a \nloan guarantee, tax credits and permitting improvements in 2004--there \nis concern that the big pipeline will not be finished in time to get \ngas to Southcentral Alaska. That is gas that is vital for electric \ngeneration in Anchorage, the Mat-Su Borough and Kenai Peninsula. \nCurrently electricity in Alaska's southern Railbelt, as it is called, \nis often generated by burning natural gas that has been produced since \nthe 1960s from the gas fields in Cook Inlet, south of Anchorage. But \nproduction from Cook Inlet, while the province theoretically holds far \nmore gas, has been falling for years. A major fertilizer plant near \nKenai, for example, had to close in 2007 because there was not enough \nnatural gas being produced to allow it to obtain the raw product it \nneeded for urea production.\n  While there are contract issues involving problems with getting \nsufficient gas quantities for Railbelt utilities starting as early as \nnext year, there are serious concerns about the ability of the region \nto produce sufficient gas for electric generation and home heating for \nAlaska's most populated area as early as 2014.\n  To provide a new, reliable natural gas supply, one proposal, the so-\ncalled ``bullet'' gas pipeline, is to construct a small diameter \nnatural gas line, 24 inches in size, to run from Alaska's North slope \nregion, pass Fairbanks along the Parks Highway, and terminate near \nWasilla, Alaska. This pipeline would tie into existing transmission \nsystems and would bring about 500 million cubic feet of gas a day to \nSouthcentral Alaska. This project would be completed well in advance of \nwhen a larger-diameter pipeline might be in service to deliver 4 to 4.5 \nbillion cubic feet a day to Lower 48 markets. Given the pace of \nplanning for construction of the main line, it is unlikely that a \nlarger Alaska natural gas pipeline will be able to deliver gas now \nuntil 2018 or 2019, perhaps four or more years too late to aid \nSouthcentral Alaska's growing need for natural gas. Further, any delays \nin solidifying a new gas supply could permanently end chances to reopen \nthe Agrium fertilizer plant and to continue operations of the Kenai LNG \nexport terminal, both key components of local Kenai Peninsula industry.\n  There are two potentially competing proposals for a small diameter, \nin-state gas pipeline. I have just described the ``bullet'' line \nproposal. The second proposal it to run a similarly sized pipeline \nalong the Richardson and Glenn Highways to the east, also tying into \nexisting transmission systems near Palmer, Alaska. There are advantages \nto both routes, the Parks route delivering gas to communities along the \nParks Highway and providing clean natural gas to Denali National Park, \nwhile the Richardson/Glenn project would help provide economic activity \nto differing towns, such as Delta and Glennallen to the east.\n  It is not my desire to prejudge the outcome of which project or route \nshould be selected, since that decision will be made by Alaska state \nregulators and financial markets. It is my desire, however, to \nintroduce legislation that would clear the lone legal impediment to \nplanning for the Parks route, that being how to get the gas \neconomically through the mountainous central region of the State past \nDenali National Park and Preserve.\n  According to a recent analysis of routing options through this area, \nthere are two feasible routes for a pipeline through or around the \nroughly 10-mile bottleneck of the Nenana River Canyon and Denali \nNational Park and Preserve. The shortest and most logical route follows \nthe existing highway through this entire area, 7 miles of which passes \nthrough Denali National\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nPark. This route causes the least environmental and visual impact due \nto its location in an existing corridor, and provides a route that is \neasily accessible for routine pipeline maintenance. The other feasible \npipeline route diverts from the highway to stay outside of the national \npark boundaries, but in so doing skirts across a steep hillside that \ndominates a park visitor's view to the east. Furthermore, the route \nthat avoids the park will create a new disturbed corridor in a remote \nlocation, and will cause pipeline operations and reliability challenges \ndue to the remoteness and the ruggedness of the route. The route that \navoids the park is estimated to cost twice as much as the route along \nthe highway and through the park.\n  Besides being less expensive to construct and operate, the pipeline \nalong the existing, previously disturbed Parks Highway right-of-way, \nalso permits electric generation for the park facilities at Denali to \ncome from natural gas. And for the first time reasonably priced \ncompressed natural gas, CNG, would be available to power park \nvehicles--another environmental benefit of the Parks Highway route. \nCurrently National Park Service permitted diesel tour buses travel 1 \nmillion road miles annually. Converting the buses to operate on CNG \nwould significantly reduce air emissions in the park. A third benefit \nis that for the pipe to cross the Nenana River, not far from the park's \nentrance, will require a new bridge to be built that could carry not \njust the pipe, but provide a new pedestrian access/bicycle path for \nvisitors that today need to walk along the heavily traveled highway \nrather than on a separated, pedestrian path toward visitors attractions \nand hotels located just outside of the park's entrance. In all \nprobability the installation work will be conducted in the shoulder \nseasons to make sure there are no visitor dislocations for tourists \nvisiting the park.\n  For those reasons and others, a group of eight environmental groups: \nThe National Parks and Conservation Association, the Alaska \nConservation Alliance, the Denali Citizens Council, The Wilderness \nSociety, Cook Inlet Keeper, the Alaska Center for the Environment, the \nWrangell Mountain Center and the Alaska Wildlife Alliance have formally \nendorsed the granting of a gas line right-of-way through Denali Park, \nalong the existing highway right of way.\n  The granting of a permanent 20-foot easement, and probably a 100-foot \nconstruction easement, is not precedent setting. The National Park \nService already has granted a permit for an installed fiber-optic cable \nalong the same basic alignment for an Alaska communications company. \nObviously the exact right-of-way will have to be delineated to avoid \nthe existing cable and to accommodate park goals, such as routing \naround a vernal pond viewing area located along the general right-of-\nway.\n  I am proposing this bill simply to authorize the right-of-way for a \nParks Highway route soon so that the decision on which route is best \nfor the state and its citizens--if the ``bullet'' line option is \nchosen--can be made based on greater certainty in the cost estimates \nfor a Parks Highway project. Removing the uncertainty of permitting and \nregulatory delays will at least permit the Parks Highway route to be on \na level playing field with the Richardson and Glenn Highway route when \na routing decision is made. Then the decision on which project makes \nthe most sense for all Alaskans can be made without fear that right-of-\nway acquisition delays could inflate project costs.\n  If the Parks route is chosen and the project proceeds, then the \nnational park will benefit from the environmental benefits of natural \ngas and compressed natural gas being available for park activities, \ncutting air quality concerns, and improving pedestrian access. I truly \nbelieve there are no environmental issues with this legislation. I \nthink anyone who has ever traveled on the Parks Highway in Alaska near \nthe park would agree, and I hope it can be considered by Congress \nrelatively soon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  30 January 2009.\n     Re Denali National Park & Preserve Title XI process.\n     M. Colleen Starring,\n     President, ENSTAR Natural Gas Company, Anchorage AK.\n\n       Dear Ms. Starring, thank you and your staff for reaching \n     out to the Alaska conservation community early on in your \n     process to obtain permits to build a bullet gas pipeline from \n     either the Foothills or Prudhoe Bay into the existing \n     Southcentral gas pipeline system. In your presentation to us, \n     your identified immediate concern was location of the right-\n     of-way either through or around the Nenana Canyon and Denali \n     National Park & Preserve. We appreciate the two briefings you \n     have provided to the community on the options at Denali.\n       Based on the information you have provided to us at these \n     two briefings, the apparent logical environmentally \n     preferable choice for the gas pipeline through Denali \n     National Park & Preserve is the six miles along the Parks \n     Highway. This would seem to make the most sense from both an \n     engineering and an environmental perspective as going around \n     the park would necessitate construction in currently \n     undeveloped lands. While the signers of this letter agree \n     that bringing the gas pipeline along the Parks Highway \n     through Denali seems to be the environmentally preferable \n     alternative, we reserve final judgment until completion of \n     the environmental review.\n       As mitigation for the pipeline through the park, we were \n     pleased to hear you discuss the opportunity for a pathway \n     constructed atop the pipeline ROW and a new pedestrian bridge \n     across the Nenana River at McKinley Village. We feel this \n     expansion of the existing front-country trail system would be \n     a benefit to park visitors and would link the many visitors \n     at McKinley village into the park entrance area by trail. We \n     strongly encourage continuation of this part of the plan. In \n     addition, we encourage you to work with the Park Service to \n     see if they would benefit from a lateral line into the park \n     to support both the energy needs of the park headquarters \n     complex and also possible use of natural gas for park buses.\n       Assuming the preferred gas pipeline right-of-way is along \n     the Parks Highway, there will need to be a Title XI review \n     for the six miles through Denali, which we anticipate will be \n     included in your environmental review. Currently the National \n     Park Service is not authorized to issue a right-of-way permit \n     for gas pipelines anywhere in the country, which means final \n     approval of the Title XI permit would need to go to the \n     President and then to Congress. While our preference would be \n     to complete the environmental review and, assuming the Parks \n     Highway route is the best, follow the existing Title XI \n     process, we understand that Enstar is developing legislation \n     to give the National Park Service authority to issue a right-\n     of-way permit for the six miles within Denali IF the \n     environmental review shows it to be the environmentally \n     preferable route.\n       This would not negate the need for a Title XI review, but \n     it would allow the Park Service to make the decision without \n     any additional review by the administration or Congress. We \n     need to withhold any position on this proposed legislation \n     until we see specific language, In keeping with your pattern \n     of outreach early in the process, we would very much like to \n     be a part of crafting this legislation to ensure that it is \n     specific to this project only and it only provides authority \n     to the Park Service to issue the right-of-way should the \n     environmental review show it is the environmentally \n     preferable alternative.\n       Furthermore, this letter should not be construed as \n     anything more than an understanding of how to get through the \n     six miles inside the boundaries of Denali National Park & \n     Preserve. There are many unanswered questions about the \n     routing and construction of the pipeline beyond these six \n     miles that remain of interest and concern to many \n     conservation groups in Alaska. We strongly urge you to expand \n     your right-of-way and source of gas discussions with many of \n     these same groups to cover the entire project.\n       Signed:\n     Jim Stratton,\n       Alaska Regional Director, National Parks Conservation \n     Association.\n     Kate Troll,\n       Executive Director, Alaska Conservation Alliance.\n     Nancy Bale,\n       President, Denali Citizens Council.\n     Eleanor Huffines,\n       Alaska Regional Director The Wilderness Society.\n     Toby Smith,\n       Executive Director, Alaska Center for the Environment.\n     Jeremy Pataky,\n       Executive Director, Wrangell Mountains Center.\n     Bob Shavelson,\n       Executive Director Cook Inlet Keeper.\n     John Toppenberg,\n       Director, Alaska Wildlife Alliance.\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL, of New Mexico (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Levin, Mr. Udall of Colorado and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 768. A bill to grant the Congressional Gold Medal to the soldiers \nfrom the United States who were prisoners of war at Bataan during World \nWar II; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to some of the \nbravest soldiers ever to wear this country's uniform--the prisoners of \nwar from the Bataan Death March.\n  For the thousands of soldiers who were surrendered to enemy forces on \nApril 9, 1942, the years that have passed since have been filled with \nmemories of what occurred that day and in the hundreds of days that \nfollowed: starvation, torture, forced work, captivity and death.\n  But in the 66 years since, the events at Bataan have conjured other \nideas for the rest of us: bravery, sacrifice, and an unbreakable \ndemonstration of courage.\n  ``The Battling Bastards of Bataan,'' they were christened by Frank \nHewlett, one of the last journalists to report on the troops before \nthey were surrendered. For 4 months they fought, battling daily against \nthe enemy, against illness, and against time. And when there was no \nfight left, when the time for surrender was upon them, they were alone. \nNeither planes in the skies nor boats in the sea appeared, ready to \ngive the boost of firepower that would turn the tides. Instead, the men \nat Bataan laid down their weapons and walked into a hell that would \nlast over 3 years.\n  Many survivors never recovered from their experience. Half died \nwithin a few years of returning home. Others lived on in physical and \nmental pain for the rest of their lives--a daily reminder of the \nexperience they had endured.\n  But the story of Bataan is not just about surrender or the suffering \nthat followed. By holding off enemy fighters longer than expected, the \nBataan forces gave the Allies time to regroup after Pearl Harbor. Their \nsacrifice allowed Allied commanders to take the fight to the enemy. And \nthey made a future victory possible.\n  The soldiers of Bataan also gave America something we needed as much \nas guns or tanks. They gave us an example. Their story inspired \nAmerican soldiers to fight and committed American commanders to \nretaking the Pacific. Just as an earlier generation of Americans had \nremembered the Alamo, our soldiers in World War II remembered Bataan. \nWe should remember it today as a place where America's fighting spirit \nshowed itself to the world.\n  For those of us from New Mexico, the events at Bataan strike home \nparticularly hard. Eighteen hundred men from New Mexico's 200th and \n515th regiments left their homes to fight; half returned. These \nsoldiers earned the honor of being the ``first to fire'' on the enemy \non December 8, 1941--the day after Pearl Harbor. They and their \nfamilies have spread the story of Bataan to their New Mexico neighbors. \nWe feel the suffering they saw. And we take pride in their heroism.\n  For six decades, the Western world has enjoyed the freedom that the \nBataan veterans helped to win. For six decades, our world has been more \npeaceful because of the sacrifices they made. And for six decades, \nthose men have not received the honor that is their due.\n  This failure of memory hits particularly hard because so many of the \nmen who suffered at Bataan were Hispanic. They fought and died in the \nuniform of a nation that treated them as second class citizens. While \nin uniform, many faced discrimination if they had Hispanic surnames or \nwere caught speaking Spanish. This legislation will honor American \nheroes, including those who were asked to sacrifice and then forgotten \nwhen the fighting was over.\n  We must always remember the sacrifice of our soldiers, particularly \nduring times of war. The men and women who risk their lives today must \nknow that America never forgets those who sacrifice in her name. By \nrecognizing the heroes of Bataan, we show our commitment to the heroes \nof Kabul and Baghdad--and to the heroes of the future.\n  I thank Senator Bond for joining me as the lead cosponsor of this \nlegislation. His home State of Missouri had hundreds of soldiers at \nBataan, including one, John Playter, who passed away recently this year \nbut never stopped telling his story. I also want to thank Senators \nBingaman, Inouye, Landrieu, Levin, Kerry, and Udall for being original \ncosponsors. I also thank the VFW and AMVETS for their support of this \nlegislation.\n  I hope you will join them--and so many others--in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 770. A bill to amend titles V, XVIII, and XIX of the Social \nSecurity Act to promote cessation of tobacco use under the Medicare \nprogram, the Medicaid program, and the maternal and child health \nservices block grant program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tobacco is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths \nin the U.S.--that is 438,000 deaths every year. Sadly, another 50,000 \nAmericans die each year from exposure to second hand smoke. Just this \nyear, scientists discovered another danger in ``third hand smoke'' \nwhich describes the chemicals that cling to smokers'' hair and \nclothing, and linger in cushions and carpeting long after smoke has \ncleared a room. This residue includes heavy metals, carcinogens and \neven radioactive materials that young children can get on their hands \nand ingest, especially if they are crawling or playing on the floor.\n  Despite the known dangers of tobacco use, more than 45 million adults \nin the U.S. smoke cigarettes. Approximately 90 percent of those adults \nstarted smoking before the age of 14. Every day over 3,500 kids under \nage 18 try smoking for the first time, and of these, 1,100 will become \nregular, daily smokers. Between \\1/3\\ and \\1/2\\ will eventually die as \na result of their addiction.\n  The likelihood of being a smoker varies depending on your ethnicity, \nsocioeconomic status, and even where you live. African-Americans are \ntwice as likely as the general population to smoke, and communities in \nthe South are more likely to be smoker-friendly than other communities \nin the country. While 22.5 percent of the general adult population in \nthe U.S. currently smokes, the percentage is about 50 percent higher \namong Medicaid recipients. Thirty-six percent of adults covered by \nMedicaid smoke.\n  The costs to our Nation of tobacco use are staggering. Total health \ncosts attributable to tobacco approach $100 billion annually, and \ncomprise an estimated 14 percent of all Medicaid costs. Our Federal \nGovernment pays $17.6 billion through Medicaid and $27.4 billion \nthrough Medicare for smoking related illnesses. Tobacco use is a \nleading cause of pregnancy complications, premature birth, and low \nbirth weight.\n  Despite the fact that nicotine is a highly addictive drug, research \nhas confirmed that smoking cessation strategies that include evidence \nbased counseling and FDA-approved pharmacotherapies are effective. More \nthan 4 in 5 smokers say they want to quit, and each year about 1.3 \nmillion smokers do quit. Overcoming an addiction to tobacco is arguably \none of the single most important lifestyle changes that a person can \nmake to improve and extend his or her health and life.\n  Studies have shown that reducing adult smoking through tobacco \ncessation treatment pays immediate dividends, both in terms of health \nimprovements and cost savings. Shortly after quitting smoking, blood \ncirculation improves, carbon monoxide levels in the blood decrease, the \nrisk of heart attack decreases, lung function and breathing are \nimproved, and coughing decreases. Pregnant women who quit smoking \nbefore their second trimester decrease the chances that they will give \nbirth to a low-birth-weight baby. Over the long term, quitting will \nreduce a person's risk of heart disease and stroke, improve symptoms of \nCOPD, reduce the risk of developing smoking-caused cancer, and extend \nlife expectancy. Breaking an addition to nicotine is a very difficult \nprocess, and that is why we should make a variety of treatment options \navailable to tobacco users.\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n  I am proud to be joined by my colleagues Senator Kennedy in \nintroducing the Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion \nAct of 2009. This legislation would make it easier for people to access \ntobacco cessation treatment therapies in three meaningful ways.\n  First, this bill adds a smoking cessation counseling benefit and \ncoverage of FDA-approved tobacco cessation drugs to Medicare. By 2020, \n17 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 years of age or older. It \nis estimated that Medicare will pay $800 billion to treat tobacco-\nrelated diseases over the next 20 years.\n  Second, this bill provides coverage for counseling, prescription and \nnon-prescription smoking cessation drugs in the Medicaid program. The \nbill eliminates the provision in current federal law that allows states \nto exclude FDA-approved smoking cessation therapies from coverage under \nMedicaid. Despite the fact that the states have received payments from \ntheir successful federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry, less \nthan half the states provide coverage for smoking cessation in their \nMedicaid program. Even if Medicaid covered cessation products and \nservices exclusively to pregnant women, we would see significant cost \nsavings and health improvements. Children whose mothers smoke during \npregnancy are almost twice as likely to develop asthma as those whose \nmothers did not. Over seven years, reducing smoking prevalence by just \none percentage point among pregnant women would prevent 57,200 low \nbirth weight births and save $572 million in direct medical costs.\n  Finally, this bill ensures that the Maternal and Child Health Program \nrecognizes that medications used to promote smoking cessation and the \ninclusion of anti-tobacco messages in health promotion are considered \npart of quality maternal and child health services.\n  As Congress examines more closely the impact of tobacco on our \ncountry--considering regulation by the FDA or raising taxes to pay for \npublic health priorities--we must make sure we assist those fighting \nthis deadly addiction. I hope my colleagues will join me in \ncosponsoring this legislation and taking a stand for the public health \nof our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) high and volatile international oil prices represent \n     an unsustainable threat to the economic and national security \n     of the United States; and\n       (B) approximately 40 percent of the primary energy demand \n     of the United States is met by petroleum, the price for which \n     is set in a fungible and opaque international market \n     vulnerable to geopolitical instability and increasingly \n     complex barriers to investment;\n       (2)(A) it should be the goal of the United States to reduce \n     the oil intensity (the number of barrels of oil required to \n     generate $1 of gross domestic product) of the national \n     economy from 2008 levels by at least 50 percent by calendar \n     year 2030 and by at least 80 percent by calendar year 2050; \n     and\n       (B) reduced oil intensity is a primary means for improving \n     the resilience of the economy to high and volatile \n     international oil prices;\n       (3) the transportation sector of the United States is \n     critical to breaking the oil dependence of the United States \n     because the transportation sector--\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\n       (A) accounts for nearly 70 percent of total national oil \n     consumption;\n       (B) is 97-percent reliant on petroleum for the delivered \n     energy needs of the sector; and\n       (C) remains an industry of vital national significance and \n     importance;\n       (4)(A) electrification of short-haul transportation \n     represents a likely pathway to reduced oil dependence;\n       (B) electrified ground transport--\n       (i) promotes fuel diversity because the electric power \n     sector uses a diverse range of feedstocks; and\n       (ii) relies on a portfolio of fuels that are largely \n     domestic and have prices that are generally less volatile \n     than oil; and\n       (C) electricity prices are generally stable relative to oil \n     because the price of fuel in the electric power sector is a \n     small portion of the cost of delivered energy;\n       (5)(A) electrification of transportation will require a \n     more modern, technologically advanced national electric power \n     system that draws on a variety of location-constrained \n     generation sources sited in a range of geographic areas; and\n       (B) a national transmission system that efficiently \n     delivers power across long distances to load centers should \n     be a high priority;\n       (6)(A) widespread deployment of electric vehicles and \n     supporting infrastructure is a long-term process that will \n     require a national commitment over many years;\n       (B) in the interim, steps can be taken to minimize the \n     danger that oil dependence poses to the economic and national \n     security of the United States; and\n       (C) it is critical to--\n       (i) support the continued growth of the domestic biofuels \n     industry;\n       (ii) foster domestic production of conventional fuels for \n     which infrastructure and technology exist; and\n       (iii) support deployment of additional renewable, cleaner \n     fossil, and nuclear generating capacity for providing the \n     necessary low emissions, reliable, and dispatchable power \n     that is essential for the electricity supply of the United \n     States;\n       (7)(A) a robust, dynamic, and diverse biofuels industry is \n     an important component of a secure United States liquid fuels \n     system;

A bill to promote industry growth and competitivenes and to \nimprove worker training, retention, and advancement, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today, Senator Snowe of Maine, Senator \nMurray of Washington, and I are introducing a workforce development \nbill--the Strengthening Employment Clusters to Organize Regional \nSuccess, or SECTORS Act.\n  Over the last 2 years, I have held more than 130 roundtable \ndiscussions in communities all over Ohio.\n  One of the themes that has recurred in the roundtables--from workers \nand employers, business and labor, teachers and professors--is that we \nneed to do a better job connecting workers with the middle and high \nskills needed for careers that are growing in Ohio.\n  Today, Ohio has an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent higher than the \nnational average. As many in this chamber are aware, older workers have \nbeen hit hard by the economic downturn. The Urban Institute reported \nthat job loss for older workers is at a 31-year high.\n  Over the past eight years, Ohio lost more than 230,000 manufacturing \njobs--a 24 percent drop of employment in a sector so vital to Ohio's \neconomy.\n  That said, employers throughout the State talk about jobs gone \nbegging, and not being able to fill middle and high skilled positions. \nThere are open jobs in high-tech, healthcare, and even manufacturing \nthat are going unfilled.\n  A recent report by labor economists Harry Holzer and Robert Lerman \nfound that substantial demand remains in today's labor market for \nskilled workers. This is particularly true for ``middle- skill'' jobs \nthat require more than a high school degree but less than a four-year \ncollege degree. These jobs make up nearly half of America's labor \nmarket and provide good compensation for workers.\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\n  Congress needs to focus on skills training now more than ever.\n  The approach Senator Snowe, Senator Murray, and I take in this bill \nis to organize training around industry clusters.\n  Silicon Valley, the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Route 128 \naround Boston--these are examples of clusters.\n  But, it is not just high tech jobs either.\n  Think of tourism in Florida, or insurance in Connecticut, or food \npackaging in Pennsylvania. These are successful clusters that build \naround a skilled labor force.\n  The Ohio Workforce Board has compiled great information about \nemerging industries and skills programs needed to see people fill these \njobs.\n  Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Chancellor Eric Fingerhut are giving \nworkforce training a high priority.\n  This bill provides incentives to employers, labor, educators, and \nworkforce investment boards to model the best skills training \napproaches happening in Ohio and around the country.\n  The SECTORS Act focuses on targeted training, with multiple \nstakeholders in the same industry. The bill right now requires four \nprincipal stakeholders to be part of a training program: industry, \nlabor unions, workforce investment boards, and community colleges.\n  It encourages official economic development organizations, where \nappropriate, to be partners.\n  We want to build in a process that makes a training program \nsustainable and not just a one-time infusion of money. With that in \nmind, our bill contains a matching funds requirement.\n  The legislation builds in rigorous evaluation so lawmakers and \npolicymakers know how tax dollars are being spent, something that has \nnot been the cause under President Bush's Department of Labor's \ntraining initiatives.\n  The Government Accountability Office found in May 2008 that the Labor \nDepartment's demand-driven workforce training programs have often been \nawarded through a non-competitive process, and have lacked \naccountability and evaluation so that Americans know how their tax \ndollars are being spent.\n  We need to break clean from this approach.\n  I plan to work with Senator Snowe, Senator Murray, and colleagues in \nboth chambers to authorize an industry sector skills training program \nthat builds in accountability and sustainability, and helps workers and \nbusinesses thrive in Ohio, Maine, Washington, and throughout the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Selecting \nEmployment Clusters to Organize Regional Success, SECTORS, Act which \nSenators Brown and I are introducing. This legislation would amend the \nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998 to establish a new industry or sector \npartnership grant program administered by the Department of Labor.\n  The SECTORS Act provides grants to industry clusters--interrelated \ngroup of businesses, service providers, and associated institutions--in \norder to establish and expand sector partnerships. By providing \nfinancial assistance to these partnerships, this legislation would \ncreate customized workforce training solutions for specific industries \nat a regional level. A sector approach is beneficial because it can \nfocus on the dual goals of promoting the long-term competitiveness of \nindustries and advancing employment opportunities for workers, thereby \nencouraging economic growth. Existing sector partnerships have long \nbeen recognized as key strategic elements within some of the most \nsuccessful economic development initiatives throughout the country. \nUnfortunately, current Federal policy does not provide sufficient \nsupport for these critical ventures.\n  As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, one \nof my key goals is to ensure that manufacturers have access to a \ncapable workforce. Unfortunately, manufacturers across the country have \nraised significant concerns about whether the next generation of \nworkers is being trained to meet the needs of an increasingly high-tech \nworkplace.\n  In fact, in my home State of Maine, the manufacturing sector has shed \nan alarming 23,600 jobs in the past 10 years; nearly 30 percent of the \nState's manufacturing employment. It is thereby critical that we as a \nNation provide unemployed manufacturing workers the training needed to \nexcel as our manufacturing sector becomes increasingly technical. This \nlegislation provides a crucial link between establishing worker \ntraining programs and fostering new employment opportunities for those \nwho have been affected by the manufacturing industry's decline. By \npromoting this innovative partnership we will take a crucial step \ntoward rejuvenating our economy.\n  Throughout the country, sector partnerships are being used to promote \nthe long-term competitiveness of industries and to advance employment \nopportunities. For example, the State of Maine has created the North \nStar Alliance Initiative. The Alliance has brought together Maine's \nboat builders, the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood \nComposites Centers, Maine's marine and composite trade association, \neconomic development groups, and investment organizations for the \npurpose of advancing workforce training.\n  Our Nation's capacity to innovate is a key reason why our economy \ncontinues to grow and remains the envy of the world. Ideas by \ninnovative Americans in the private and public sector have paid \nenormous dividends, improving the lives of millions throughout the \nworld. We must continue to encourage all avenues for advancing this \nvital sector if America is to compete at the forefront of innovation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON, of Florida (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Martinez, \n        and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 780 bill to amend the Andean Trade Preference Act to add Paraguay \nto the list of countries that are eligible to be designated as \nbeneficiary countries and ATPDEA beneficiary countries; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nbill, the U.S.-Paraguay Partnership Act of 2009, to add Paraguay as a \nbeneficiary under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act.\n  I want to thank my colleague on the Finance Committee, Senator John \nCornyn, for joining me in sponsoring this legislation. I understand a \ncompanion bill is being introduced in the House today as well by \nRepresentatives Engel and Burton.\n  Paraguay, located in the important Tri-Border region of South \nAmerica, shares borders with Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina. Paraguay \nis one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere, with 30 \npercent of its population surviving on less than $2 a day. In 2007, \nU.S. exports to Paraguay exceeded $1.2 billion, while Paraguayan \nimports to the U.S. totaled just $68 million. Florida has historically \nserved as a key source and transit point for U.S. two-way trade with \nParaguay and will likely benefit from increased economic links between \nour two countries. Florida's deep-water ports serve as the main \nshipping points for goods coming from or going to Latin America. In \naddition, Paraguay, a major drug transit hub, has been a reliable U.S. \npartner for many years in our counternarcotics and counterterrorism \nefforts in the region. Nevertheless, we have neglected to include \nParaguay in the important Andean trade program.\n  I believe that Paraguay is deserving of inclusion in this program.\n  The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act is a preference \nprogram that was established in 1991 and reauthorized with the drug \ncooperation element in 2002. It currently grants duty-free access to a \nrange of exports from four Andean countries including Colombia, \nEcuador, Peru, and Bolivia. This bill will add Paraguay as the fifth \nbeneficiary country of this program, which will help connect Paraguay \nto the U.S. market and foster closer cooperation on a range of \nimportant anti-drug trafficking and national security issues. \nCurrently, Paraguayan products are not competitive in U.S. markets \nbecause they are subject to higher tariffs than other Latin American \nand Caribbean countries that ship these same items duty-free to the \nU.S.\n  You may recall that the very first Summit of the Americas was held in \n1994 in Miami, FL, where delegates discussed trade, combating drugs, \nand promotion of democracy. The new administration and our \ninternational partners will continue to grapple with these vital issues \nat the 5th Summit of the Americas, which will take place in Trinidad \nfrom April 17 to 19.\n  President Obama, who will be leading the U.S. delegation to the \nSummit in Trinidad, has said that we must work to develop a \n``partnership based on respect that the people of Latin America are \nlooking for and that will be beneficial to the United States.''\n  The upcoming Summit of the Americas is dedicated to promoting \nprosperity and democracy in the Western Hemisphere. Surely, the thirty-\nfour democratically elected heads of state who will be in attendance in \nTrinidad must focus on the situation of poverty-stricken countries such \nas Paraguay and Haiti. The election of President Fernando Lugo of \nParaguay in May\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\n2008 marked the democratic transfer of power in Paraguay after six \ndecades of uninterrupted rule by the Colorado Party. It is in America's \ninterest to support democracy and economic prosperity throughout the \nHemisphere and I believe that adding Paraguay to this trade program is \na positive step in that direction. The proud Paraguayan-American \ncitizens of Florida and of other States, who have made important \ncontributions to American society, will no doubt support this move.\n  In the spirit of the Summit of the Americas, we should strengthen our \nrelationship with Latin America as a whole. We should continue to \nsupport representative democracy and expand prosperity in the \nHemisphere. Therefore, I urge the Senate to include Paraguay in the \nAndean Trade Preference Act, a decision that will benefit both our \ncountries as trade expands. Together with the other nations of the \nWestern Hemisphere, we must strive to find common solutions to common \nproblems, given the tremendous challenges we face today.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the U.S.-\nParaguay Partnership Act of 2009. I introduced this legislation earlier \ntoday along with my colleague from the Finance Committee, Senator Bill \nNelson of Florida.\n  This legislation will do two things; it will reduce trade barriers \nbetween the U.S., and Paraguay and it will encourage continued bi-\nnational security cooperation. Paraguay is a friendly ally in Latin \nAmerica, and it is beneficial to support and empower our allies in this \nsometimes-hostile region of the Americas.\n  The U.S.-Paraguay Partnership Act will add Paraguay to our Nation's \nexisting trade pact with four countries in the Andean region of Latin \nAmerica. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Enforcement Act, ATPDEA, \nenacted in 2002, is an economic tool that provides incentives for \nAndean nations to grow and manufacture legitimate products in order to \nreduce the grip of illegal drug cultivation and trafficking.\n  The ATPDEA has helped reduce the flow of narcotics from Peru, \nColombia, and Ecuador since its enactment. In addition to the illegal \ndrug eradication function, the accord also fostered much greater \neconomic cooperation between the Andean region and the U.S. Moreover, \nthe two free trade agreements President George W. Bush negotiated and \nsigned with Peru and Colombia were borne out of the cooperation \ndeveloped by the Andean trade accord.\n  Paraguay is an important ally in U.S. counternarcotics efforts and is \nhelping crackdown on terrorist financing activities in its region. The \ngovernment of Paraguay recognizes the value in developing its economy \nby promoting legitimate alternatives to narcotics cultivation and \ntrade. Our bi-national eradication strategy is working, and this bill \nwill provide economic incentives to continue the fight against narco-\nterrorism from the ground up.\n  The ATPDEA is a temporary trade preferences law and is due for \nreconsideration later this year. I encourage my colleagues to seriously \nconsider the merits of adding Paraguay as a beneficiary country when \nthe ATPDEA is reauthorized. It is time to extend the benefits of the \nATPDEA to the nation of Paraguay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4196-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 97--DESIGNATING JUNE 1, 2009, AS ``COLLECTOR CAR \nAPPRECIATION DAY'' AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE COLLECTION AND RESTORATION \n  OF HISTORIC AND CLASSIC CARS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF PRESERVING THE \n TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS AND CULTURAL HERITAGE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. TESTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

and\n       (B) in recognition of the athletic and cultural \n     contributions of Jack Johnson to society.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a \nresolution to pardon posthumously the world's first African-American \nheavyweight champion, John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson. This resolution \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the President should exercise \nhis constitutional authority to pardon Jack Johnson posthumously.\n  For my colleagues who may not be familiar with the plight of Jack \nJohnson, he is considered by many to be the most dominant athlete in \nboxing history. Arthur John Johnson was born March 31, 1878, in \nGalveston, TX, to parents who were former slaves. At an early age he \nrealized his talent for the sweet science. In order to make a living, \nJohnson traveled across the country fighting anyone willing to face \nhim. But he was denied repeatedly on purely racial grounds a chance to \nfight for the world heavyweight title. For too long, African-American \nfighters were not seen as legitimate contenders for the championship. \nFortunately, after years of perseverance, Johnson was finally granted \nan opportunity in 1908 to fight the then-reigning title holder, Tommy \nBurns. Johnson handily defeated Burns to become the first African-\nAmerican heavyweight champion.\n  Mr. Johnson's success in the ring, and sometimes indulgent lifestyle \noutside of it, fostered resentment among many and raised concerns that \nhis continued dominance in the ring would somehow disrupt what was then \nperceived by many as a ``racial order.'' So as history tells us, a \nsearch for a Caucasian boxer who could defeat Johnson began a \nrecruitment effort that was dubbed the search for the ``Great White \nHope.'' That hope arrived in the person of former champion, Jim \nJeffries, who returned from retirement to fight Johnson in 1910. But \nwhen Johnson defeated Jeffries, race riots broke out as many sought to \navenge the loss.\n  Following the defeat of the ``Great White Hope,'' the Federal \nGovernment launched an investigation into the legality of Johnson's \nrelationships with Caucasian women. The Mann Act, which was enacted in \n1910, outlawed the transport of Caucasian women across State lines for \nthe purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for ``any other immoral \npurpose.'' Using the ``any other immoral purpose'' clause as a pretext, \nFederal law enforcement officials set out to ``get'' Johnson. On \nOctober 18, 1912, he was arrested for transporting his Caucasian \ngirlfriend across State lines in violation of the act. However, the \ncharges were dropped when the Caucasian, whose mother had originally \ntipped off Federal officials, refused to cooperate with authorities. \nShe later married Johnson.\n  Yet Federal authorities persisted in their persecution of Johnson, \npersuading a former Caucasian girlfriend of Johnson's to testify that \nhe had transported her across State lines. Her testimony resulted in \nJohnson's conviction in 1913, when he was sentenced to 1 year and a day \nin Federal prison. During Johnson's appeal, one prosecutor admitted \nthat ``Mr. Johnson was perhaps persecuted as an individual, but that it \nwas his misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting \nthe intermarriage of whites and blacks.''\n  After the trial, Johnson fled the country to Canada, and then \ntraveled to various European and South American countries, before \nlosing his heavyweight championship title in Cuba in 1915. He returned \nto the United States in 1920, surrendered to federal authorities, and \nserved nearly a year in Federal prison. Despite this obvious and clear \ninjustice, Johnson refused to turn his back on the country that \nbetrayed him. Mr. Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.\n  The Jack Johnson case is an ignominious stain on our Nation's \nhistory. Rectifying this injustice is long overdue. Again, this \nresolution calls on the President to pardon Mr. Johnson posthumously. \nIt recognizes the unjustness of what transpired, and sheds light on the \nachievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry \nand prejudice. Johnson was a flawed individual who was certainly \ncontroversial. But he was also a historic American figure, whose life \nand accomplishments played an instrumental role in our Nation's \nprogress toward true equality under the law. And he deserved much \nbetter than a racially motivated conviction, which denied him of his \nliberty, and served to diminish his athletic, cultural, and historic \nsignificance.\n  Yesterday was the 131st anniversary of Jack Johnson's birth and we \nshould take this opportunity to allow future generations to grasp fully \nwhat Jack Johnson accomplished against great odds and appreciate his \ncontributions to society unencumbered by the taint of his criminal \nconviction. We know that we cannot possibly right the wrong that was \ndone to Jack Johnson, but we can take this small step toward \nacknowledging his mistreatment and removing the cloud that casts a \nshadow on his legacy. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4197-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4197-S4199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 805.

OVERSIGHT OF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, all committees are directed \n     to review programs within their jurisdiction to root out \n     waste, fraud, and abuse in program spending, giving \n     particular scrutiny to issues raised by Government \n     Accountability Office reports. Based on these oversight \n     efforts and committee performance reviews of programs within \n     their jurisdiction, committees are directed to include \n     recommendations for improved governmental performance in \n     their annual views and estimates reports required under \n     section 301(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to the \n     Committees on the Budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate Regarding Supporting the President \n     in His Efforts to Go ``Line by Line'' Through the Federal \n     Budget.--\n       (1) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (A) as of March 30, 2009, the national debt of the United \n     States currently stands at $11,045,554,110,788.22 , the \n     largest in world history;\n       (B) each United States citizen's share of this debt is \n     $36,155.97;\n       (C) the fiscal year 2010 Senate Budget Resolution will \n     increase the total United States national debt by at least \n     $5,000,000,000,000 over the next 10 years;\n       (D) the power of the purse belongs to Congress;\n       (E) Congress authorizes and appropriates all Federal \n     discretionary spending and creates new mandatory spending \n     programs;\n       (F) Congress annually funds programs that are wasteful, \n     inefficient, and duplicative that result in taxpayer losses \n     in the billions;\n       (G) it is irresponsible for Congress to continue funding \n     wasteful, inefficient, or duplicative Government programs \n     that will result in borrowing from Social Security, Medicare, \n     foreign nations, or future generations of Americans;\n       (H) every cent that the United States Government loses on \n     wasteful, inefficient, or duplicative programs is money \n     stolen from future generations of Americans and from \n     important programs, including Social Security and Medicare, \n     on which our senior citizens depend for their retirement \n     security;\n       (I) President Obama declared on November 25, 2008, ``In \n     these challenging times, when we are facing both rising \n     deficits and a sinking economy, budget reform is not an \n     option. It is an imperative. We cannot sustain a system that \n     bleeds billions of taxpayer dollars on programs that have \n     outlived their usefulness, or exist solely because of the \n     power of politicians, lobbyists, or interest groups.''; and\n       (J) President Obama pledged, on November 25, 2008, to go \n     through the Federal Budget ``page by page, line by line, \n     eliminating those programs we don't need, and insisting that \n     those we do operate in a sensible, cost-effective way.''.\n       (2) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should support the President in his efforts to \n     go line by line through the Federal budget to eliminate \n     wasteful spending by--\n       (A) requiring the head of every Federal department and \n     agency to provide a report to Congress, within 90 days of the \n     date of adoption of this resolution, on programs that are \n     duplicative, inefficient, or failing, with recommendations \n     for elimination and consolidation of such programs;\n       (B) requiring the Office of Management and Budget, within \n     90 days of the date of adoption of this resolution, to \n     provide a report to Congress on programs that are duplicative \n     government-wide, with recommendations for elimination or \n     consolidation of such programs; and\n       (C) requiring every standing committee of Congress to \n     conduct at least one oversight hearing per fiscal year to \n     identify wasteful, inefficient, outdated, and duplicative \n     programs that could be eliminated.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 830.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED NATIONS TRANSPARENCY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States taxpayer provides the United Nations \n     with over $5,000,000,000 annually, representing up to 25 \n     percent of all funds received by the United Nations, even \n     though the United States is only 1 of 192 United Nations \n     members.\n       (2) In 2008, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \n     of the Senate found that the United Nations lead development \n     entity, the United Nations Development Program, diverted \n     development funds to the entity used by the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea to finance illicit missile sales \n     and permitted the Government of North Korea to use United \n     Nations bank accounts to freely transfer cash around the \n     world and elude detection and sanctions.\n       (3) The United Nations Procurement Task Force reported in \n     2008 that the United Nations Environment Program, which \n     spends over $1,000,000,000 annually and receives almost 10 \n     percent of its budget from United States taxpayers, conducts \n     almost no auditing or oversight of its spending, has one \n     auditor and one assistant to inspect its operations, and \n     would take 17 years to audit its high-risk areas already \n     identified.\n       (4) The United Nations Procurement Task Force reported in \n     2008 that poor data collection across the United Nations \n     system makes it impossible to determine whether a United \n     Nations program is relevant or effective.\n       (5) The United Nations Procurement Task Force reported in \n     2008 that United Nations resource allocation and performance \n     assessments do not take into account whether or not results \n     have been achieved.\n       (6) The Department of State reported in 2007 that the \n     United Nations 2008/2009 Biennial Budget represents the \n     largest increase in its funding request in United Nations \n     history, in excess of $5,200,000,000 and representing a 25 \n     percent increase from the previous biennial budget.\n       (7) The Department of State reported in 2007 that, in the \n     previous 5 years, the United Nations budget has grown at a \n     record 17 percent, the United Nations Peacekeeping budget has \n     grown by 40 percent, and the United Nations Tribunals budget \n     has grown by 15 percent, but the United States budget has \n     only grown 7 percent during the same period.\n       (8) The Department of State reported in 2007 that the \n     overwhelming majority of the United Nations budget, 75 \n     percent, is diverted to costs associated with its staff \n     instead of direct humanitarian assistance or conflict \n     prevention.\n       (9) United Nations auditors in 2007 found that 43 percent \n     of over $1,000,000,000 in audited procurement contracts were \n     tainted by fraud and corruption.\n       (10) The official policy at the Department of State for \n     United Nations reform, as implemented through the United \n     Nations Transparency and Accountability Initiative, is to \n     press the United Nations to reform by providing access to \n     United Nations audits, budget information and procurement \n     activities, instituting legitimate whistleblower protections, \n     financial disclosure policies, and an ethics office, \n     providing independence for its internal oversight bodies, \n     adopting international accounting standards, and establishing \n     a cap on administrative overhead costs for United Nations \n     funds and programs.\n       (11) The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency \n     Act (Public Law 109-282; 31 U.S.C. 6101 note) requires all \n     federal funding information to be put on the public website, \n     USAspending.gov, including all contract, subcontract, grant, \n     and subgrant data such as the amount of the award, source of \n     funds, and the intended purpose of the funds.\n       (12) Section 212 of this resolution creates a deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund for a bipartisan congressional sunset \n     commission that is tasked with providing ``for a process that \n     will help abolish obsolete and duplicative Federal programs'' \n     and ``for improved government accountability and greater \n     openness in Government decision-making''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that no \n     appropriated funds should be obligated, expended, or \n     otherwise made available for the United Nations or any \n     subsidiary body of the United Nations, including any \n     organization that is authorized to use the United Nations \n     logo, for a fiscal year unless the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget certifies that the United Nations, such \n     subsidiary body of the United Nations, or such organization, \n     as the case may be, is fully and publicly transparent about \n     all of its spending, including for procurement purposes, that \n     occurred during the prior fiscal year, including the posting \n     on a publicly available website of--\n       (1) copies of all contracts, grants, subcontracts, and \n     subgrants awarded or utilized during the prior fiscal year;\n       (2) copies of all program reviews, audits, budgets, project \n     progress reports, and other management documents relating to \n     the prior fiscal year; and\n       (3) any other financial or management information \n     determined necessary by the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 832. Mr. COBURN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 13, setting forth the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2010, revising the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2009, \nand setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years \n2011 through 2014; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED FOR \n                   TRANSPARENCY FOR DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE \n                   AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) On September 16, 2008, the Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve, after consulting with Treasury Department, \n     issued a press release announcing it ``authorized the Federal \n     Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion to the \n     American International Group (AIG) under section 13(3) of the \n     Federal Reserve Act.''.\n       (2) On October 8, 2008, the Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve issued a press release, announcing it would \n     loan AIG an additional $37.8 billion, stating, ``Under this \n     program, the New York Fed will borrow up to $37.8 billion in \n     investment-grade, fixed-income securities from AIG in return \n     for cash collateral.''.\n       (3) On November 10, 2008, the United States Treasury issued \n     a press release announcing it would ``purchase $40 billion in \n     senior preferred stock from the American International Group \n     (AIG) as part of a comprehensive plan to restructure federal \n     assistance to the systemically important company.''.\n       (4) On November 25, 2008, the Treasury Department used \n     funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to \n     purchase the $40 billion in preferred shares in AIG.\n       (5) The November 10, 2008, a Treasury Department press \n     release also stated, relating to compensation for AIG \n     executives in light of the recent taxpayer-funded purchase of \n     senior preferred stock, ``Under the agreement AIG must be in \n     compliance with the executive compensation and corporate \n     governance requirements of Section 111 of the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act. AIG must comply with the most \n     stringent limitations on executive compensation for its top \n     five senior executive officers as required under the \n     Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Treasury is also \n     requiring golden parachute limitations and a freeze on the \n     size of the annual bonus pool for the top 70 company \n     executives.''.\n       (6) On January 26, 2009, H.R. 1, the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009 was introduced in the House with no \n     language on executive compensation requirements for Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients.\n       (7) On January 28, 2009, H.R. 1 passed the House of \n     Representatives by a vote of 244-188, with no language \n     included on executive compensation requirements for TARP \n     recipients.\n       (8) On January 30, 2009, the Senate began consideration of \n     Senate Amendment 98, a substitute amendment to H.R. 1, which \n     did not include language on executive compensation \n     requirements for TARP recipients.\n       (9) On February 5, 2009, during consideration of Senate \n     Amendment 98, the Senate adopted by voice vote, Senate \n     Amendment 354, which would prohibit the payment of bonuses to \n     the top 25 executives at firms in receipt of TARP funds.\n       (10) On February 7, 2009, Senate Amendment 98 was withdrawn \n     in the Senate, and Senate Amendment 570, a substitute \n     amendment was ordered to be printed in the Senate, which \n     included Senate Amendment 354, previously approved by the \n     Senate.\n       (11) On February 10, 2009, Senate Amendment 570 passed the \n     Senate by a vote of 61 - 37.\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\n       (12) On February 13, 2009, the conference report to H.R. 1 \n     was approved by both the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, and contained a new provision, not included \n     in either the Senate-passed or House-passed bills, \n     specifically exempting bonuses agreed to before February 11, \n     2009, for executives at companies that received TARP funds.\n       (13) Senators were given less than 24 hours to review any \n     changes that were made to the conference report, which \n     totaled more than 1,000 pages.\n       (14) According Senate Rule XXVIII, paragraph 2(a), \n     ``Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not \n     committed to them by either House, nor shall they strike from \n     the bill matter agreed to by both Houses.''.\n       (15) According Senate Rule XXVIII, paragraph 9(a)(1), ``It \n     shall not be in order to vote on the adoption of a report of \n     a committee of conference unless such report has been \n     available to Members and to the general public for at least \n     48 hours before such vote. If a point of order is sustained \n     under this paragraph, then the conference report shall be set \n     aside.''.\n       (16) On March 18, 2009, CNN reported that one United States \n     senator ``denied inserting that exemption at the 11th hour, \n     and insisted he doesn't know how it got in there.''.\n       (17) On March 19, 2009, ABC News reported that one United \n     States senator stated the following regarding the executive \n     compensation language included in H.R. 1, ``And frankly it \n     was such a rush, talking about the stimulus bill now, to get \n     it passed, I did not have time, other conferees did not have \n     time to address many of the provisions that were modified \n     significantly. We do the best we can, but we missed that \n     stuff as a result.''.\n       (18) On March 19, 2009, The Hill Newspaper reported that, \n     according to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the \n     language in question did not originate in the House of \n     Representatives, stating ``This was never brought to \n     conference, . . .This never came to the House side, and you \n     can talk to any of our conferees. It's a matter of fact and \n     record.''.\n       (19) On March 19, 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported \n     that White House officials suggested they did not request the \n     legislative change, saying that ``Administration officials \n     said the Treasury didn't suggest any language or say how the \n     amendment should be changed. They said they noted legal \n     issues that could likely lead to challenges, but was the end \n     of their involvement. The official said Mr. Dodd and Congress \n     made the final changes on their own.''.\n       (20) On March 19, 2009, in an interview with CNN, Treasury \n     Secretary Timothy Geithner stated that ``Treasury staff did \n     express concern about whether this provision was vulnerable \n     to legal challenge.''.\n       (21) On March 19, an ABC news story reported that ``Two \n     separate federal agencies have begun investigations into how \n     the provisions ended up in the legislation. . .''.\n       (22) On March 28, 2009, the Hartford Courant reported that \n     the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut had sent a \n     letter to the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve contending that the AIG bonuses payments were \n     not protected under Connecticut's wage act, calling such \n     arguments, ``flawed legal bluffs''. Earlier in the week, the \n     Chairman had testified to Congress that he wanted to legally \n     challenge the bonuses but was advised not to because of the \n     potential liability from the wage act.

Mr. President, I plan to offer an amendment tomorrow that \nI would like to discuss this evening very briefly because I do think it \nis an important matter as we consider the economic climate in which we \nfind ourselves.\n  My amendment would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund that would \nextend the 2001 tax cut rates for small business owners so this tax \nincrease does not subtract from the pool of capital that is going to be \navailable to small business. As the Ranking Member of the Small \nBusiness Committee and senior member of the Finance Committee, I rise \non this critical issue of taxation because I am deeply concerned about \nhow proposed tax rate increases will harm small business capital \nformation.\n  There has been a significant debate about the effect on small \nbusiness of raising tax rates on those making over $250,000. I do not \ndisagree with some of those efforts, but I do have a deep concern about \nthe impact and the implications that it will have on small businesses \nand their ability to access affordable capital in this current economic \ndownturn.\n  The expiration of these tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 for couples \nmaking over $250,000 will directly and indisputably affect small \nbusinesses. Hiking taxes from 33 to 36 percent and from 35 to 39.6 \npercent results in a 9-percent tax increase for either tax rate. So if \nthe Government is subtracting 9 percent from small business owners, \nobviously, that suggests fewer resources will be available to reinvest \nin business.\n  As we know, access to capital is a constant struggle for America's \nsmall businesses, particularly at this time of a continuing credit \ncrisis. We have seen the credit crunch that has had a direct effect on \nsmall businesses. Lines of credit have been denied. Access to capital \nis simply not available. Time and time again, we have heard from small \nbusinesses, and certainly that was true at a hearing we held recently \nin the Small Business Committee, because small business owners are \nsaying repeatedly they have had considerable difficulty in being able \nto access credit from banks.\n  So we have a serious crisis because if we depend on small businesses \nto generate the jobs, which they do--70 percent of all the net new jobs \nin this country; half of all the private-sector employers, 70 percent \nof the nonfarm gross domestic product--then clearly we have to be \nconcerned about the response of small businesses when we are raising \nthe tax rates for those making over $250,000.\n  We simply cannot increase taxes by 9 percent on small businesses and \nnot expect that this tax hike will have an immediate effect on the \namount of capital they re-invest in their business. I fear that in lieu \nof investing their own funds, small businesses will have to, obviously, \nturn to the frozen credit markets which clearly has impeded any ability \nof small businesses to secure capital.\n  Most recently, a Federal Reserve study demonstrated that 70 percent \nof banks have tightened loans to small businesses. Well, Chairman \nLandrieu of the Small Business Committee and I have been working to \nfree up lending for small business owners. Recently, the President \nconducted a small business summit at the White House, and we heard \ndirectly from small business owners who said their lines of credit have \nsimply dried up.\n  I know some of the banks have said, some of the TARP recipients said: \nWell, we are lending money. But the truth is, it is simply not \nhappening. So there are numerous provisions in the stimulus package \nthat I and Chair Landrieu had worked to insert because we thought it \nwas important to make sure we took the steps to ensure a Main Street \nrecovery, some of which were in the flagship SBA programs, the 7(a) and \n504 programs, to reduce or eliminate the lenders' and borrowers' fees \nwhich are going to be instrumental to allowing banks to more freely \nloan money to small businesses because\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\nthese are the key lending programs. We also provided for a 90-percent \nguarantee under the 7(a) program for any of the loans that are issued. \nIn the stimulus package, I was able to secure a provision that will \nallow small businesses to make quarterly estimate tax payments of 90 \npercent of their 2008 tax liability rather than 110 percent estimated \ntax payments. That is important to ensure there is available capital \nfor small businesses, to ease the credit flow for small businesses so \nthey can survive in this very serious economic downturn.\n  So we have done a number of things that are going to be so essential \nfor the preservation and survival of small business in this very \nserious recession, which is the worst since the Great Depression.\n  We included a stabilization loan fund that will provide up to $35,000 \nfor small businesses that otherwise have been viable businesses but are \nhaving difficulty making their payments. So we want to ease the flow of \ncapital on a monthly basis. So it gives them a life line, a bridge \nuntil they will be able to find a better economic climate in which to \ndo business.\n  The fact is, credit is essential. Small businesses are vital because \nthey are the job generators in America. Our economy is wholly dependent \non the well-being and the health of small businesses. That is why the \nPresident--and I recommended and endorsed this idea--is going to use \nsome of the TARP funds to buy small business loans in the secondary \nmarket, again, freeing up the capital, easing the pressures on many of \nthe banks, so they can issue those loans in the secondary markets. And \nup to $15 billion in TARP funds would be used. So again, it is another \nway of easing the credit restraints, but also to provide more liquidity \nin the markets so that small businesses are able to go about and \ncontinue to do their business.\n  We have to avert not only job losses in this economy, but primarily \nto make sure if we are going to do so, that we prevent small business \nowners from shutting their doors on Main Streets all across America.\n  The vast majority of businesses in this country are known as ``flow-\nthrough'' or ``pass-through'' businesses, meaning that the income from \na business is taxable to the individual owner and is not taxed at the \nbusiness unit level. The forms of ownership that fall into the \ndefinition of flow-through businesses are sole proprietorships, \npartnerships, and S corporations. According to the Small Business \nAdministration, flow-through businesses represented 93 percent of all \nsmall businesses in 2004. And specifically, there were 19.2 million \nsole proprietorships, representing 72 percent of all businesses; 2.3 \nmillion partnerships, representing 9 percent of businesses; and 3.3 \nmillion S corporations, representing 12 percent of businesses. And we \nconsider this to be an incomplete snapshot of all small businesses \nbecause there are roughly another 2 million small C corporations, \nrepresenting 7 percent of small businesses, that pay taxes both at the \nbusiness level and individual level when profits are distributed.\n  The point is, that small businesses are critical. They pay the \nindividual tax rate. That is the problem with allowing the tax rates to \nexpire from the 2001 and 2003 tax bills, for those small businesses \nthat are earning more than $250,000.\n  The data provided earlier this week from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation shows that 6.5 percent of business owners--as defined by \nindividuals receiving flow-through income, as I mentioned earlier, who \npay the individual tax rate--will see their taxes increased as a result \nof this major tax hike. This is in stark contrast to those critics who \nhave said it is only going to be 2.2 percent of taxpayers who will be \naffected by this tax increase. But yet Joint Tax shows it is almost \nthree times what they indicated. But more importantly, it is the amount \nof income that these small businesses generate in our Nation's economy.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation data reinforces a 2007 Treasury study \nthat demonstrated among taxpayers whose flow-through income amounted to \nat least 50 percent of their wages--clearly indicating the primary \nbusiness owner--that 9 percent earned 69 percent of total flow-through \nincome but paid 81 percent of the taxes on it. So 9 percent earned 69 \npercent of this small business income and they paid 81 percent of the \ntaxes on it. That is the problem because we are going to directly \nincrease taxes on those small businesses that generate the \npreponderance of the income from small businesses in America.\n  Now, I drew on this Treasury study to help craft my amendment which \ntargets not the passive investor in small business but the individual \nwho is really earning their keep from small businesses. My amendment \nuses the definition of ``small business'' as determined by the Small \nBusiness Administration.\n  I want to highlight one form of business ownership in particular, and \nthat is the S corporation because this form of ownership represents \nsmall firms that have graduated past the ``kitchen table'' stage of \nbusiness and have employees. Again, the Joint Committee on Taxation \ndata indicates that in 2006, 22 percent of taxpayers who earned income \nfrom S corporations were making more than $250,000. Furthermore, a new \nstudy--a very recent study--from the SBA Office of Advocacy \ndemonstrated there were roughly 3.3 million S corporation returns filed \nfor 2004 and by the industry sector, the most prevalent, were wholesale \nand retail trade.\n\n  So, in essence, these are the Main Street businesses, the retailers, \nthe construction firms, the manufacturers, the job generators of this \neconomy. We cannot subtract another 9 percent from their income and \nthink it is not going to affect--not only them but our Nation's \neconomy. We have to do everything we can to nurture and cultivate an \nenvironment in which small businesses can survive during this economic \ncrisis. We need to be fostering that environment, not increasing taxes \non small businesses at the very time when they need more capital just \nto get by.\n  A recent SBA study noted that half of all small business income is \nearned by businesses organized either as a partnership or an S \ncorporation, despite the fact that they constitute only about 20 \npercent of business units. So it is critical that we evaluate this \nparticular provision. When we are talking about allowing the expiration \nof the tax rates in 2001 and 2003, we have to consider and evaluate it \nspecifically on how it will affect the health and the well-being of \nsmall businesses in America's economy.\n  Small businesses as job generators have been underappreciated and \nunrecognized. They have been the unsung heroes of our economy, even \nprior to this recession. I think we have to be wholly attentive to the \nrole they play in our Nation's economy. After all, there are 27 million \nsmall businesses in America today. We have to ensure their survival. \nThe way we can do it is to consider the policies enacted and how they \ndirectly have an effect on small businesses, whether it is by \nincreasing regulation, diminishing the availability of credit, or by \nraising taxes, all of which have a collective effect on the well-being \nand effectiveness of small business.\n  I think it is rather ironic that on one hand we are doing everything \nwe can through the stimulus, through the TARP funds to make credit \navailable, and then on the other hand we are subtracting from it by \nraising the tax rate. Some say we are only deferring that; it is 2 \nyears away. But small businesses have to plan for the future. The net \neffect will be that they will constantly retrench in anticipation that \ntheir tax rates are going to rise, which only stands to reason. It is a \nlogical response. It certainly will change their behavior today as a \nresult of what they can expect in the future.\n  So suggesting that somehow deferring it 2 years out will make it \nbetter is not an answer. We don't have any prognostications in terms of \nwhat this economy is going to look like in 2 years, we still will have \nhigh rates of unemployment. It is going to be a slow path forward \ntoward recovery, and we will be depending on small businesses to \nultimately lead the way out of this recession and to pave the way \nforward toward a recovery. So because we are dependent on small \nbusinesses, then we have to consider very carefully the impact that \nraising tax rates will have on small businesses in America.\n  So when some say that tax increases would not have an impact today, \nbut it will in 2 years, I answer that it will have an impact today \nbecause business\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\nowners will just defer investment in a plant. They will defer other \ninvestments. They will defer hiring. They may lay off, given the \ncurrent climate, to be sure, but also in anticipation of the future, \nknowing that they will have to pay increased taxes.\n  A tax increase of this magnitude alters economic behavior. It alters \ncapital formation indisputably. So on this issue alone I think it is \nvery critical that we be circumspect and cautious in terms of how we \napproach it.\n  That is why the amendment I will offer tomorrow will create a \ndeficit-neutral fund so we can be sure that we do not have these sorts \nof tax increases that will be directly imposed on small businesses. I \nhope the Senate will support this amendment. It is specific and \ntargeted toward small business owners so this tax increase doesn't \naffect them, it doesn't affect their behavior, either now or into the \nfuture, and ensures that there is a pool of capital so they can \ncontinue to do business and, hopefully, be able to survive and overcome \nthe hurdles this economic climate represents.\n  The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council recently stated the \nhigher the marginal tax rate, the higher the relative price for \nadditional work and risk taking, and that high tax rates discourage \neconomic activity. I know a number of organizations have conducted \ntheir own surveys, and I think it is illustrative again of the problems \nthat will confront small businesses as a direct result of this specific \ntax increase.\n  There was a poll conducted by Gallup for the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, otherwise known as NFIB. When surveyed, 21.7 \npercent of small business owners who employ 220 to 249 employees \nresponded that the income earned from their businesses would be greater \nthan $250,000. That bears reiterating. More than 20 percent of small \nbusinesses stated that they would have income greater than $250,000. \nThis data certainly comports with the data provided by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation regarding partnership income and S corporation \nincome.\n  Even more striking was the response from other small businesses where \nthey indicated it would certainly have a detrimental impact when they \nwere asked about their total household income from all sources, and 40 \npercent of these entrepreneurs, with 20 to 249 employees, responded \nthat their household income would be greater than $250,000. In either \nsurvey question, this cohort was the largest response group of any \nincome group or size of employer and is indicative that successful \nsmall businesses are precisely the group that is most likely to face \nincreased taxes if the top two marginal tax rates again rise to 36 and \n39.6 percent because the net result is they will pay a 9-percent tax \nincrease.\n  So I hope the Senate will endorse my amendment when I offer it \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/01/senate-section/article/S4230-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
