Mr. President, I intend to take 10 minutes of the \nRepublican time. Will you please let me know when 1 minute remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, there may be a number of Americans who are switching \nover from the Minnesota v. Carolina football game and they may be \nwondering what in the world is the U.S. Senate doing coming into \nsession at midnight on a Sunday in the middle of a snowstorm and \ngetting ready to vote at 1 a.m.? So let me try to explain that for a \nmoment.\n  The reason is, the Democratic majority leader, who is the only one \nwho can set our schedule, showed up yesterday with a 400-page \namendment--yesterday. This amendment had been written in secret for the \nlast 6 weeks. The assistant Democratic leader said, last week, on the \nfloor, he had no idea what was in it. Of course, none of us on the \nRepublican side knew what was in it. So almost no one here knew what \nwas in it. It was presented to us. Then the Democratic leader said: \nWell, we are going to start voting on it, and we are going to pass it \nbefore Christmas.\n  This is an amendment to the health care bill, which when fully \nimplemented, will cost about $2.5 trillion over 10 years, according to \nthe Senate Budget Committee; which restructures a sixth of our economy; \nwhich affects 300 million people; which will raise taxes by about $1 \ntrillion when fully implemented over 10 years; and which will cut \nMedicare by about $1 trillion when fully implemented over 10 years. It \ndoesn't cut Medicare to make Medicare more solvent which, as we know, \nit is going to become insolvent, according to its trustees, by 2015, \nbut to spend on a new entitlement.\n  It will also shift to the States a great many expenses, so much so \nthat our Democratic Governor in Tennessee has said it is the mother of \nall unfunded mandates. The Governor of California says it is the last \nthing we need, take your time, get it right. But the Democratic leader \nand his colleagues insist that we need to bring this up in the middle \nof a snowstorm, write it in secret, vote on it in the middle of the \nnight, and get it passed before Christmas Eve.\n  Why would they want to do that? Well, I think the answer is very \nclear. It is because they want to make sure they pass it before the \nAmerican people find out what is in it. Because the American people, by \nnearly two to one, according to a CNN poll, do not like what they have \nheard about the health care bill. When they have to start explaining \nwhat is in it, they are afraid it will be worse, and it will never \npass.\n  Republicans are not the only ones who believe we ought to stop and \nthink about big issues before we deal with it. Eight Democratic \nSenators--Senators Lincoln, Bayh, Landrieu, Lieberman, McCaskill, \nNelson, Pryor, and Webb--wrote Senator Reid on October 6, saying to \nSenator Reid:\n\n       As you know, Americans across our country have been \n     actively engaged in the debate on health care reform. . . . \n     Without a doubt, reforming health care in America is one of \n     the most monumental and far-reaching undertakings considered \n     by this body in decades. We believe the American public's \n     participation in this process is critical to our overall \n     success. . . .\n\n  I am quoting from the eight Democratic Senators. They go on to say \nthey want to make sure the bill is on a Web site ``for at least 72 \nhours'' before we vote on it. This bill was given to us yesterday--400 \npages of it--we had not seen before. Seventy-two hours would be \nTuesday. So the minimum requirement, according to the eight Democratic \nSenators and all 40 Republican Senators, would be that we should not \neven think about voting on it until at least Tuesday. And then one \nwould think we would be amending it and debating it and considering it \nand thinking about it and trying to find out what it actually does.\n  According to the eight Democratic Senators:\n\n       By publicly posting the legislation and its [Congressional \n     Budget Office] scores 72 hours before it is brought to a vote \n     in the Senate and by publishing the text of amendments before \n     they are debated, our constituents will have the opportunity \n     to evaluate these policies. . . . As their democratically-\n     elected representatives . . . it is our duty to listen . . . \n     and to provide them with the chance to respond to proposals \n     that will impact their lives.\n\n  Yet, we are presented with it in the middle of a snowstorm on \nSaturday, we are meeting at midnight, we are voting at 1 a.m. It is \nbeing demanded that it be passed, even though most of the provisions, \nas the Senator from Maine has said, do not even begin to take effect \nfor 4 more years.\n  What is the rush? I think the rush is that our friends on the other \nside do not want to explain to 40 million seniors how you can cut $1 \ntrillion out of Medicare--it is exactly $470 billion over the next 10 \nyears, but when fully implemented $1 trillion out of Medicare--and \nspend it on a new program without reducing Medicare services to 40 \nmillion seniors. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office has \nalready said that for the 11 million seniors who are on Medicare \nAdvantage that fully half their benefits will be affected.\n  I think our friends on the other side do not want the American people \nto understand why the $578 billion in new taxes that are going to begin \nto be imposed next year--they are going to have a hard time explaining \nhow that will create new jobs in America, at a time when we have 10 \npercent unemployed. New taxes?\n  They do not want the American people to find out the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office said that if we put those new taxes on \ninsurance providers, on medical devices, almost all of those taxes will \nbe passed on to the consumers and, as a result, premiums will go up.\n  There are some very strong words that have been coming from the other \nside about Republicans saying this bill will actually increase the cost \nof health care. It is not Republicans who are saying that. Here is what \nDavid Brooks of the New York Times said in his analysis of the bill \nwhen he gave the reasons for it and the reasons against it this week \nand came to the conclusion that if he were a Senator he would vote \nagainst it. Mr. Brooks said:\n\n       The second reason to oppose this bill is that, according to \n     the chief actuary for\n\n[[Page S13641]]\n\n     Medicare, it will cause national health care spending to \n     increase faster.\n\n  That is right, we are going to raise taxes, cut Medicare, send a big \nbill to the States--all for what? `` . . . according to the chief \nactuary for Medicare, it will cause national health care spending to \nincrease faster.'' So if you are paying X for premiums, you are going \nto be paying more as a result of this bill.\n  Continuing, David Brooks said:\n\n       Health care spending is already zooming past 17 percent of \n     [our gross domestic product] to 22 percent and beyond.\n\n  Then it is going to be hard to explain to the 9 million people who \nthe Congressional Budget Office letter said would lose their employer \ninsurance under this bill why that will happen. Of course, it will \nhappen because under the bill as a whole, as employers look at the \nmandates and the costs, many will decide not to offer health insurance, \nand so those employees will find themselves either in Medicaid, the \nprogram for low-income Americans--into which 15 million more Americans \nare going; a program for which 50 percent of doctors will not see new \nMedicaid patients; it is like giving you a ticket to a bus when the bus \nonly runs half the time--that is where many of these Americans will go, \nor they will go into the individual market, and the individual market \nwill have higher premiums.\n  The other side says: Ah, but there will be subsidies for some of you. \nBut the premiums are going to be higher, the health care costs are \ngoing to be higher.\n  The majority does not want to explain why this bill changes the \nbipartisan agreement not to have Federal funding for abortion that has \nbeen agreed to since 1977.\n  They do not want to take time for the American people to understand \nthe CLASS Act, the long term insurance act, a new entitlement which \nsounds wonderful, but the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee \ndescribed it as a Ponzi scheme worthy of Bernie Madoff. That is because \nthe amount of money that would be paid in, if a person pays a premium \nof $2,880 per year for 5 years, would be $14,000, and then they would \nhave a $1,500 monthly benefit for a long time after that.\n  It is obvious why the majority has cooked up this amendment in \nsecret, has introduced it in the middle of a snowstorm, has scheduled \nthe Senate to come in session at midnight, has scheduled a vote for 1 \na.m., is insisting it be passed before Christmas, because they do not \nwant the American people to know what is in it.\n  It is a deeply disappointing legislative result. But our friends on \nthe Democratic side seem determined to pursue a political kamikaze \nmission toward a historic mistake, which will be bad for the Democrats, \nI am convinced, but, unfortunately, even much worse for our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we approach in less than an hour a very \nimportant vote--some have called it historic, some call it pivotal; it \nhas been given various adjectives and adverbs--I think it might be \nappropriate to discuss for a minute or two how this all began.\n  It all began in the Presidential campaign. I do not like to spend \nmuch time recalling it. But health care was a big issue in the \nPresidential campaign. On October 8, 2008, less than a month before the \nelection, then-Candidate Obama said, concerning health care reform:\n\n       I'm going to have all the negotiations around a big table. \n     . . . What we'll do is we'll have the negotiations televised \n     on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is making arguments on \n     behalf of their constituents and who are making arguments on \n     behalf of drug companies--\n\n  Keep that in mind: the drug companies--\n\n     or the insurance companies.\n\n  That was the statement made by then-Senator/Candidate Obama. What we \nhave is a dramatic departure. There has never been a C-SPAN camera. \nThere has never been a negotiation, a serious negotiation between \nRepublicans and the other side. There has never been. I say that with \nthe knowledge of someone who has negotiated many times across the aisle \non many agreements. So don't stand and say there were serious \nnegotiations between Republicans and Democrats. There never were.\n  But there were negotiations with the special interests, with PhRMA, \nthe same ones the President said he was going to see who the American \npeople were on the side of. Clearly, this administration and that side \nof the aisle was on the side of PhRMA because they got a sweetheart \ndeal of about $100 billion that would have been saved if we had been \nable to reimport prescription drugs. The AARP has a sweetheart deal. \nThere is a provision in this deal for them, plans that Medigap \ninsurance sold by AARP are exempt from tax on insurance companies. The \nAMA signed up because of the promise of a doc fix. Throughout we should \nhave set up a tent out in front and put Persian rugs out in front of \nit. That is the way this has been conducted.\n  Of course, after the special interests were taken care of, then we \nhad to take care of special Senators. One deal is called--we have new \nwords in our lexicon now--the Louisiana purchase, the corn husker \nkickback. I have a new name: the Florida flimflam, the one that gives \nthe Medicare Advantage members in Florida the benefit, but my \nconstituents in Medicare Advantage don't get it.\n  So in answer to this, in answer to a question today, the majority \nleader said:\n\n       A number of States are treated differently than other \n     States.\n\n  Really?\n\n       A number of States are treated differently than other \n     States. That is what legislation is all about. That is \n     compromise.\n\n  Where is that taught? Where is that taught?\n\n       A number of States are treated differently than other \n     States. That is what legislation is all about. That is \n     compromise.\n\n  My friends, that is not what the American people call governing. That \nis called exactly an opposite contradiction of what the President of \nthe United States said, where he says:\n\n       We will have negotiations televised on C-SPAN so that \n     people can see who is making arguments.\n\n  I see the leader from Illinois over there. Just a few days ago, I \nsaid: What is in the bill?\n  The Senator from Illinois said: I don't know. I am in the dark too. I \ncan give him his own quote.\n  So here we are, as the Senator from Tennessee said, in the middle of \nthe night, and here we are, my friends, about to pass a bill with 60 \nvotes. Sixty votes represent 60 percent of this body, but I can assure \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle it doesn't represent 60 \npercent of the American people. In fact, 61 percent of the American \npeople, according to a CNN poll, say they want this stopped. They \ndisapprove of it. I guarantee you, when you go against the majority \nopinion of the American people, you pay a heavy price, and you should.\n  I will tell my colleagues right now that when you--this will be, if \nit is passed--and we are not going to give up after this vote, believe \nme. For the first time in history, for the first time in history, there \nwill be a major reform passed on a party-line basis. Every reform--and \nI have been part of them--has been passed on a bipartisan basis. This \nwill be a strict party-line basis.\n  I was thinking today about this vote, and I was thinking about other \ntimes and other examples I have had of courage or lack of or the fact \nthat in the face of odds, you have to stand for what you believe in. I \nthought about back when I first entered the U.S. Naval Academy at the \nyoung age of 17. One of the first things they told us about in our \nlearning of naval traditions was about a battle that took place early \nin the Revolutionary War. An American ship run by a captain engaged a \nBritish ship, the mighty British Navy. The American ship was outgunned \nand was outmanned. As they came together in mortal combat, with dead \nand dying all around, the British captain said: Do you surrender? The \ncaptain, John Paul Jones, said: I have not yet begun to fight.\n  I tell the American people: We are going to go around this country. \nWe are going to the townhalls, we are going to the senior centers, we \nare going to the rotary clubs. We are going to carry this message: We \nwill not do this. We will not commit generational\n\n[[Page S13642]]\n\ntheft on future generations of Americans. We will not give them another \n$2\\1/2\\ trillion in debt. We will not give them an unfair policy where \ndeals are done in back rooms, and we--all of us on this side of the \naisle--will stand for the American people, and we have just begun to \nfight.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the last several weeks, all we have \nheard from the other side is attack, attack, attack. All we have heard \nfrom the other side is no, no, no. They keep talking. I just heard the \nSenator from Arizona saying this is not a bipartisan bill. I have heard \nso much talk on the other side in the last several weeks about how this \nshould be bipartisan. Well, let's look at that for a second.\n  As I see it, the Republicans have no bill of their own. Our bill has \n60 Democrats, a supermajority, a supermajority. Well, I guess there is \na bill over there. It is the Coburn-Burr bill. It has seven cosponsors. \nThat is it. That is it. Nothing else. Not all the Republicans are \nsupporting it. My friends on the other side are all over the place. \nThey can't even agree among themselves what they want to do. They have \nno comprehensive bill as we have come up with.\n  So I keep hearing that we Democrats are not bipartisan, but whom do \nwe deal with? Just the Senator from Arizona? Just the Senator from \nTennessee? How about the Senator from Oklahoma or the Senator from \nSouth Carolina? So I am sorry. I feel sorry the Republicans are all \nsplit up. They have not done their own homework to pull their own \nSenators together for something positive. So what they have done is \nthey pulled together to say no, to try to kill the reform bill we have \nworked so hard on all year.\n  We extended a hand. If we had wanted to ace out the Republicans, we \nwould have followed their lead on what they did in 2001, when they \nrammed through that tax cut for the wealthy. They did it on \nreconciliation so we couldn't filibuster it, so we couldn't have any \ndebate on it. That is what they did. We didn't do it that way.\n  President Obama said we want to hold out the olive branch. We want to \nwork with Republicans, so that is what we tried to do. Under the \nleadership of Senator Dodd on our committee, we had numerous meetings \nwith Republicans. We had a markup session that lasted 13 days 54 hours. \nWe accepted 161 of their amendments and, in the end, everyone on the \nRepublican side voted against it.\n  Senator Baucus bent over backward, week after week. He not only went \nthe extra mile, he went the extra 100 miles to try to get Republicans \nto work with him on this bill. In the end, only one Republican would \nvote for the bill out of committee.\n  So that is what we have. I am sorry to say my friends on the other \nside are in total disarray. They have nothing they can agree on. Well, \nwe have something we have agreed on. Sixty, a supermajority, have \nagreed on moving a bill forward, a pivotal point in our history, in a \ndecades-long march toward comprehensive health reform. It has alluded \nCongresses and Presidents going back to Theodore Roosevelt.\n  My friends on the other side defend the status quo. They want us to \nvote our fears--fear, fear, fear. Everything you hear, it seems, on the \nother side is fear. Be afraid. Well, it is not going to work this time \nbecause what the American people want is not fear, they want hope. They \nwant the hope they will have the health care they need when they have \nto have it at a price that is affordable. They want to have the peace \nof mind and security of knowing that their children, if they have a \npreexisting condition, will be covered by health insurance. They want \nto have the peace of mind of knowing that if they lose a job, they \ndon't lose their health insurance. The American people want the hope \nand the security of knowing that if they get ill, they will not be \ndropped by their insurance company. They want the hope and the security \nto know they aren't just one illness away from bankruptcy.\n\n  We are the only country in the world--the only one--where people can \ngo bankrupt because they owe a medical bill. No other country would \nallow that to happen. We are the only one. This bill is going to stop \nthat. People will not have to fear going bankrupt because someone in \ntheir family got a chronic illness or a disease that is going to cost a \nlot of money. The American people want us to move forward, and we are \ngoing to do it tonight at 1 o'clock. We are going to move forward. We \nare not going to vote fears, we are going to vote hope.\n  We are going to tell the American people we are going to do three big \nthings. First of all, we are going to cover 94 percent of Americans \nwith health insurance--94 percent. Thirty-one million people out there \nwithout health insurance are going to get health insurance.\n  Secondly, we are going to crack down on the abuses of the insurance \ncompanies. No more cancelling your policy just because you got sick. No \nmore lifetime caps which basically cause more and more people to go \ninto bankruptcy. No more of those lifetime caps. We are going to make \nsure your kids can stay on your policy until they are age 26. We are \ngoing to do away with all these preexisting condition clauses next year \nfor children, up to age 18, and then for everyone later on after we get \nthe exchanges set up.\n  Insurance companies will not be able to rescind your policy or drop \nyou because you got cancer or heart disease. If you are a person out \nthere who has your own health insurance policy right now and you like \nit, you can keep it. But guess what this bill will do. It will lower \nyour premiums, and it will improve your coverage if you want to keep \nyour own health insurance that you have right now.\n  Every year, about 45,000 Americans die in this country because they \nhave no health insurance. Johns Hopkins did a study and said that \nchildren who have no health insurance are 60 percent more likely to die \nbecause of hospitalizations than kids who have health insurance \ncoverage. It is a moral disgrace. The health insurance policies of \nAmerica, what we have right now is a moral disgrace. You can talk to \npeople from other countries, our closest allies, our closest friends \nwho share so many of our values, and when they find out about our \nhealth care system, they say: How can you put up with it? This is \ndisgraceful. You are the leader of the free world. You are supposed to \nset the example. And what a terrible example we have set in health \ncare, what a terrible example.\n  Well, we have finally arrived at one of the most significant moments \nin the history of the Senate, one of the most significant. Our former \nchairman, Senator Ted Kennedy, fought all his life for national health \ninsurance, and years ago, back in the 1960s, said health care ought to \nbe a right, not a privilege.\n  He said that over 40 years ago, almost 50 years ago, that health care \nshould be a right and not a privilege. It was always his highest \npriority. It was his great dream of an America where quality, \naffordable health care is that right. He thought of it as a moral \nimperative--a moral imperative. A lot of times, we lose that. We hear a \nlot of debate about how much this is, who is going to lose this, all \nthese scare tactics. We see all these numbers and all that kind of \nstuff. We forget the essence of it. It is a moral imperative. We are \ncalled upon to right a great injustice, a great wrong that has been put \nupon the American people for far too long. It is a moral imperative \nthat confronts us now that we will vote on in half an hour. We are \ncloser than we have ever been to making Ted Kennedy's dream a reality.\n  A lot of people have worked very hard on this bill. I mentioned \nSenator Baucus. I mentioned Senator Dodd; Senator Reid, our leader, the \namount of hours he has spent and the days he has spent here without his \nfamily, without going home, being here all the time working; our \nassistant leader, Senator Durbin. So many people have worked so hard on \nthis bill. We have had so much input. Everyone has had input on this \nbill. Our Republican friends have had input on this bill. They had it \nin our committee. As I said, we accepted 161 amendments. So I guess you \ncan say this bill has a lot of authors. But there is really only one \nauthor of this bill--Senator Ted Kennedy. It is his bill because it \ndoes get us the start.\n  To my friends, I say this is not the end of health care reform, it is \nthe beginning. But we must make this beginning in order to fulfill that \ndream and\n\n[[Page S13643]]\n\nreally make health care a right, not a privilege.\n  In half an hour, let's make history. The other side says fear. We say \nhope. The other side says no. We say yes. We say yes to progress, yes \nto people, yes to health care as an inalienable right of every American \ncitizen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier today Senator Grassley raised a \nparliamentary inquiry on rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate. \nAs my colleagues recall, this was a rule that the Senate passed \npursuant to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. The \nquestion had to do with whether the managers' amendment we are getting \nready to vote on complied with rule XLIV's earmark disclosure \nrequirement. At the time, the Chair indicated that the disclosure list \nwas not submitted at the time. That was 6 p.m. today.\n  My inquiry is this: Is the Chair aware of the disclosure list being \nmade available as required by rule XLIV now as we vote in the next 30 \nminutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is not aware at this time \nwhether that statement has been made.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes in closing, if \nI may.\n  I spoke earlier this evening about the importance of the moment we \nhave all come to appreciate, I believe, a moment that has been years in \nthe making, dating back, as all have pointed out or most have pointed \nout who spoke in favor of this legislation, to the early part of the \nlast century with Theodore Roosevelt, a former Republican, who first \nadvocated the notion of a national health care system in our Nation. \nFranklin Roosevelt picked up that challenge, and Harry Truman, of \ncourse, was the one who articulated it in specific terms.\n  It was 69 years ago this very month that Franklin Roosevelt \nidentified the four freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, \nthe freedom from want, and the freedom from fear. It is that last \nfreedom that Franklin Roosevelt talked about in December of 1941 that \nis deserving of our attention in these closing minutes.\n  Whatever else one may argue about the specifics of this bill, it is \nthat fear that so many of our fellow citizens have over whether they \nwill be confronted with a health care crisis and have the resources to \naddress it and the ability to have a doctor, a physician, a health care \nprovider, a hospital to provide them with that kind of help when they \nneed it. That fear is not just for those without health care; it is \neven for those who have health care insurance. That fear persists.\n  This evening, more than anything else, beyond the specifics of the \nlegislation in front of us is our desire to address that freedom from \nfear that was addressed so eloquently almost 70 years ago. So this \nevening we attempt, anyway, to begin that journey of eliminating those \nfears so many of our fellow citizens have over the loss or inability to \nacquire that kind of health insurance or the inability to have a \ndoctor.\n  So we are poised to make a monumental vote on legislation that \nfinally makes access to quality health care a right for every American. \nIf you do not believe it is a right, that it is only a privilege, then \nI suppose you could come to a different conclusion. And there are \nthose, I guess, who believe it is a privilege to have access to health \ncare as an American citizen. Those of us on this side of the aisle \nbelieve it is a right, and as a right, you ought not to be denied that \nright based on economic circumstances, your gender, or your ethnicity \nin this Nation. You ought to have access to health care as a \nfundamental right in our Nation.\n  Obviously, we need to participate, engage in responsible activities \nthat will make sure we contribute to the well-being of all our Nation \nto reduce the cost of health care.\n  This is a comprehensive bill. It has been more than just a year \nspecifically on this effort but goes back 40 or 50 years in terms of \ndrafting, and efforts have been made to achieve what we are trying to \nachieve this evening.\n  At the end of the day, however, this legislation is really about \nfreedom from fear, as I said a moment ago. The bill frees Americans \nfrom the fear that if they lose their job, they will never find \ninsurance coverage again. The bill frees Americans from the fear that \nthey might get sick and be unable to afford the treatment they need. \nAnd the bill frees Americans from the fear that one illness, one \naccident could cost them everything they built--their homes, their \nretirement, their life savings.\n  In a nation founded on freedom and sustained by unimaginable \nprosperity, as I mentioned before, this bill is long overdue and \ncritically important. No American can be free from fear when getting \nsick could mean going broke.\n  This fight is older than most of us who serve in this body. Our path \nhas been illuminated by a torch lit years ago in the days of Harry \nTruman and sustained for decades by good people, Republicans and \nDemocrats--the Nixon administration, the Clinton administration, \nMembers such as John Chafee, who worked tirelessly in trying to craft a \ngood health care bill. We heard others talk about the regrets they had \nnot acknowledging his ideas when he proposed them or we might have been \nable to address this issue years ago. Good people have tried to come up \nwith some answers to this issue. It is with a note of sadness this \nevening that we are going to have a partisan vote on this matter. I \nwish it was otherwise.\n  I would like to point out that many of us have fought and challenged \nus to come up with these answers, but tonight this is our answer, the \n60 of us who will vote to go forward with this bill. As Senator Harkin \njust pointed out, it is hardly the final answer on this matter, but it \nallows us to begin that process of addressing these issues in a more \nthoughtful and comprehensive way in the years ahead.\n  Of course, no one was a better champion of all of this, as Senator \nHarkin pointed out, than our deceased and beloved colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Ted Kennedy. He fought these battles for so many \nyears. He understood that you could never solve all of these issues in \none fell swoop. It was going to take an incremental approach to get us \nthere.\n  I can guarantee that if he read this bill, there would be \ndisappointments he would have in it. I knew him well enough to say that \nthis evening. If he had written it on his own, he would have written it \ndifferently. Were he here among us this evening, he would urge all of \nus to move forward on this bill to address it, to vote for it, to allow \nthis Nation to begin to grapple with this issue that should have been \nsolved more than 50 years ago.\n  So this evening, again, as we come down to the final minutes of this \ndebate, let's remind ourselves that history will judge us well for \ntaking up this challenge once again and asking ourselves to give \nAmericans the opportunity to live free from those fears they have this \nvery evening. And tonight, we begin to alleviate those fears.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, tonight marks the culmination of a long \nnational debate. Passions have run high, and that is appropriate \nbecause the bill we are voting on tonight will impact the life of every \nAmerican. It will shape the future of our country. It will determine \nwhether our children can afford the Nation they inherit. It is one of \nthe most consequential votes any of us will ever take, and none of us \ntake it lightly. But make no mistake, if the people who wrote this bill \nwere proud of it, they would not be forcing this vote in the dead of \nnight.\n  Here are just some of the deals we have noticed: $100 million for an \nunnamed health care facility at an unnamed university somewhere in the \nUnited States. The bill does not say where and no one will even step \nforward to claim it. Mr. President, 1 State out of 50--1 State out of \n50--gets to expand Medicaid at no cost to itself while taxpayers in the \nother 49 States pick up the tab. The same Senator who cut that deal \nsecured another one that benefits a single insurance company--just one \ninsurance company--in his State. Do the supporters of the bill know\n\n[[Page S13644]]\n\nthis? I say to my colleagues, do you think that is fair to all of your \nStates? What about the rest of the country?\n  The fact is, a year after the debate started, few people would have \nimagined this is how it would end--with a couple of cheap deals--a \ncouple of cheap deals--and a rushed vote at 1 o'clock in the morning. \nBut that is where we are. And Americans are wondering tonight: How did \nthis happen? How did this happen? So I would like to take a moment to \nexplain to the American people how we got here, to explain what has \nhappened and, yes, what is happening now.\n  Everyone in this Chamber agrees we need health care reform. Everybody \nagrees on that. The question is how. Some of us have taken the view \nthat the American people want us to tackle the cost issue, and we \nproposed targeted steps to do it. Our friends on the other side have \ntaken the opposite approach, and the result has been just what you \nwould expect. The final product is a mess--a mess. And so is the \nprocess that has brought us here to vote on a bill that the American \npeople overwhelmingly oppose.\n  Any challenge of this size and scope has always been dealt with on a \nbipartisan basis. The senior Senator from Maine made that point at the \noutset of the debate and reminded us all of how these issues have \ntypically been handled throughout our history. The Social Security Act \nof 1935 was approved by all but six Members of the Senate. The Medicare \nAct of 1965 only had 21 dissenters, and the Americans with Disabilities \nAct in 1990 only had eight Senators who voted no.\n\n  Americans believe that on issues of this importance, one party should \nnever be allowed to force its will on the other half of the Nation. The \nproponents of this bill felt differently.\n  In a departure from history, Democratic leaders put together a bill \nso heavy with tax hikes, Medicare cuts, and government intrusion that, \nin the end, their biggest problem wasn't convincing Republicans to \nsupport it, it was convincing the Democrats.\n  In the end, the price of passing this bill wasn't achieving the \nreforms Americans were promised, it was a blind call to make history, \neven if it was a historical mistake, which is exactly what this bill \nwill be if it is passed. Because in the end, this debate isn't about \ndifferences between two parties, it is about a $2.3 trillion, 2,733-\npage health care reform bill that does not reform health care, and, in \nfact, makes the price of it go up.\n  ``The plan I am announcing tonight,'' the President said on September \n9, ``will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our \nbusinesses and our government. My plan,'' the President said, ``would \nbring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family. I will not sign a \nplan that adds a dime to our deficit,'' the President said, ``either \nnow or in the future.'' And on taxes, ``No family making less than \n$250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase,'' he said.\n  He said he wouldn't cut Medicare. He said people who liked the plans \nthey have wouldn't lose their coverage, and Americans were promised an \nopen and honest debate. ``That is what I will do in bringing all \nparties together,'' then-Senator Obama said on the campaign trail, \n``not negotiating behind closed doors, but bringing all parties \ntogether and broadcasting these negotiations on C-SPAN.''\n  Well, that was then and this is now. But here is the reality. The \nDemocratic bill we are voting on tonight raises health care costs. That \nis not me talking, it is the administration's own budget scorekeeper. \nIt raises premiums. That is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \ntalking. It raises taxes on tens of millions of middle-class Americans, \nand it plunders Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion. It forces people off the \nplans they have, including millions of seniors. It allows the Federal \nGovernment, for the first time in our history, to use taxpayer dollars \nfor abortions.\n  So a President who was voted into office on the promise of change \nsaid he wanted to lower premiums. That changed. He said he wouldn't \nraise taxes. That changed. He said he wanted lower costs. That changed. \nHe said he wouldn't cut Medicare. And that changed too.\n  And 12 months and $2.3 trillion later, lawmakers who made these same \npromises to their constituents are poised to vote for a bill that won't \nbend the cost curve, that won't make health care more affordable, and \nit will make real reform even harder to achieve down the road.\n  I understand the pressure our friends on the other side are feeling, \nand I don't doubt for a moment their sincerity. But my message tonight \nis this: The impact of this vote will long outlive this one frantic \nsnowy weekend in Washington. Mark my words: This legislation will \nreshape our Nation, and Americans have already issued their verdict: \nThey do not want it. They do not like this bill, and they do not like \nlawmakers playing games with their health care to secure the votes they \nneed to pass it.\n  Let's think about that for a moment. We know the American people are \noverwhelmingly opposed to this bill, and yet the people who wrote it \nwill not give the 300 million Americans whose lives will be profoundly \naffected by it as much as 72 hours to study the details. Imagine that. \nWhen we all woke up yesterday morning, we still hadn't seen the details \nof the bill we are being asked to vote on before we go to sleep \ntonight.\n  When we woke up yesterday morning, we still hadn't seen the details \nof the bill we are going to be asked to vote on before we go to sleep \ntonight.\n  How can anybody justify this approach, particularly in the face of \nsuch widespread and intense public opposition? Can all of these \nAmericans be wrong? Don't their concerns count?\n  Party loyalty can be a powerful force. We all know that. But \nAmericans are asking the Democrats to put party loyalty aside tonight, \nto put the interest of small business owners, taxpayers, and seniors \nfirst.\n  And there is good news: It is not too late. All it takes is one--just \none. All it takes is one. One can stop it. One can stop it or everyone \nwill own it. One can stop it or every single one will own it.\n  My colleagues, it is not too late.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all over this great country of ours, people \nare dying soon--far too soon. More and more Americans who come down \nwith the flu, develop diabetes, or suffer a stroke are dying far \nearlier than modern science says they should die. More and more \nAmericans who contract skin cancer or have a heart condition are dying \nrather than being cured.\n  Pull out the medical records of these patients and the official forms \nwill tell you they died from complications of disease or maybe some \nsurgery. But what is really killing more and more Americans every day \nare complications due to our health care system.\n  Much of our attention this year has been consumed by this health care \ndebate. A national study done by Harvard University found that 45,000 \ntimes this year, nearly 900 times every week, more than 120 times every \nday, on average every 10 minutes, on end, an American died as a result \nof not having health insurance. Every 10 minutes. The numbers are \nnumbing, and they don't even include those who did have health \ninsurance but who died because they couldn't afford a plan that met \ntheir most basic needs.\n  This country--the greatest and richest the world has ever seen--is \nthe only advanced Nation on Earth where dying for lack of health \ninsurance is even possible. To make matters worse, we are paying for \nthat privilege. The price of staying healthy in American goes up, it \ngoes up, it goes up and, not surprisingly, so do the numbers of \nAmericans who can't afford it. In fact, medical bills are the leading \ncause of bankruptcy in America. And the second choice is way down the \nlist--it is medical bills.\n  That is why we are here. Just as we have the ability to prevent \ndiseases from killing us too soon, we have before us the ability to \nprovide quality health care to every American. We have the ability to \ntreat our unhealthy health care system. That is what this historic bill \ndoes. It protects patients and consumers. It lowers the cost of staying \nhealthy and greatly reduces our debt.\n  This landmark legislation protects America's youngest citizens by \nmaking it illegal for insurance companies to refuse to cover a child \nbecause of a preexisting condition.\n\n[[Page S13645]]\n\n  It protects America's oldest citizens by strengthening Medicare and \nextending its life for almost a decade. We are also taking the first \nsteps to closing the notorious loophole known as the doughnut hole that \ncosts seniors thousands of dollars each year for prescription drugs. \nThese are some of the reasons the AARP--the American Association of \nRetired People--and its 40 million Americans are supporting this bill.\n  Contrary to what we heard from my distinguished friend, the \nRepublican leader, premiums are reduced by 93 percent. Ninety-three \npercent of people who have insurance will have reduced premiums.\n  This effort also strengthens our future by cutting our towering \nnational deficit by as much as $1.3 trillion over the next two decades. \nWhat my distinguished Republican counterpart is saying is without basis \nin fact. These aren't numbers that I came up with, these are numbers \nthat the Congressional Budget Office came up with--$1.3 trillion. That \nis trillion with a ``t.'' It cuts the deficit more sharply than \nanything Congress has done in a long time. It lowers costs. I have \ntalked about Medicare.\n  My friend, the Republican leader, said it is going to reshape our \nNation. That is why we are doing it. That is why we are doing this. We \nwant to reshape the health care delivery system in our country. Is it \nright that America has 750,000 bankruptcies a year, about 80 percent of \nthem caused by health care costs, and 62 percent of the people who have \nfiled bankruptcy have health care costs? We are reshaping the Nation. \nThat is what we want to do. That is what we have to do.\n  With this vote, we are rejecting a system in which one class of \npeople can afford to stay healthy while another cannot. It demands for \nthe first time in American history good health will not depend on great \nwealth. Good health should not depend on how much money you have. It \nacknowledges, finally, that health care is a fundamental right, which \nmy friend Senator Harkin spoke about so clearly--a human right--and not \njust a privilege for the most fortunate.\n  President Johnson, former majority leader of the Senate, signed \nMedicare into law when he was President, with the advice: ``We need to \nsee beyond the words to the people they touch.'' That is just as true \ntoday as it was 44 years ago when he signed that legislation.\n  This is not about partisanship or about procedure. And everyone knows \nwe are here at 1 o'clock in the morning because of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. For them to say with a straight face--and I \nknow some of them didn't have that straight face--that we are here \nbecause of us is without any foundation whatsoever. And everyone knows \nthat.\n  This is not about politics. It certainly is not about polling. It is \nabout people. It is about life and death in America. It is about human \nsuffering. Given the chance to relieve the suffering, we must.\n  Citizens in each of our States have written to tell us they are broke \nbecause of our broken health care system. Some have sent letters with \neven worse news--news of grave illness and preventable death. For \nweeks, we have heard opponents complain about the number of pages in \nthis bill, but I prefer to think of this bill in terms of the people it \nwill help.\n  A woman named Lisa Vocelka, who lives in Gardnerville, NV--a \nbeautiful city below the Sierra Nevada mountains--lives with her two \ndaughters, both of whom are in elementary school. The youngest suffers \nseizures. Her teachers now think she has a learning disability.\n  Because of her family history, Lisa, the girl's mom, is at high risk \nof cervical cancer. Although she is supposed to get an exam every 3 \nmonths, she doesn't go. She is lucky if she goes once a year, and most \nof the time she is not very lucky. When Lisa lost her job, she lost her \nhealth coverage. Now both Lisa and her daughter miss the tests and \npreventive medicine that could keep them healthy. Her long letter ended \nwith a simple plea. It was: ``We want to be able to go to the doctor.''\n  That is why this bill will ensure all Americans can get the \npreventive tests and screenings they need. I am voting yes because I \nbelieve Lisa and her daughter deserve to be able to go to the doctor.\n  A teenager named Caleb Wolz is a high school student from Sparks, NV. \nLike so many students, he used to play soccer when he was younger. Now \nhe sticks to skiing and rock climbing. You can forgive him, I am sure, \nfor giving up soccer. You see, Caleb was born with legs that end above \nhis knees.\n  As children mature, even Caleb, they grow out of their clothes. Most \nkids grow out of their shoes. Caleb doesn't. A lot of kids probably get \na new pair every year but Caleb has needed a new pair of prosthetic \nlegs every year since he was 5 years old. Unfortunately and \nunbelievably, Caleb's insurance company has decided it knows better \nthan his doctor and has decided Caleb doesn't need those legs. That is \nwhy this bill will make it illegal for those insurance companies to use \npreexisting conditions as an excuse for taking our money but not giving \ncoverage.\n  This is a big change. But isn't it a good change? I am voting yes \nbecause I believe Caleb deserves a set of prosthetics that fit.\n  Ken Hansen wrote to me from Mesquite, NV, a town on the border of \nNevada, Utah, and Arizona. He has chronic heart problems and parts of \nhis feet have been amputated but Ken can't go to the doctor because he \nmakes too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford private \ninsurance. I share with the Senate exactly what Ken wrote me:\n\n       I am very frustrated because it seems my only hope is that \n     I die very soon, because I cannot afford to stay alive.\n\n  That is why this bill will expand Medicaid to cover people like Ken \nfrom Mesquite, NV, who are caught in the middle. I am voting yes \nbecause when someone tells me his only hope is to die, I think we have \nto take a close look at that. I can't look away. I cannot possibly do \nnothing.\n  A man by the name of Mike Tracy lives in North Las Vegas. His 26-\nyear-old son has been an insulin-dependent diabetic since he was a \nbaby. The insurance Mike's son gets through work will not cover his \ntreatments and the Tracys can't afford to buy more insurance on their \nown. But his family's troubles are about more than just money. Since \nthey couldn't afford to treat his diabetes, it developed into Addison's \ndisease--which of course they can't afford to treat either. It could be \nfatal.\n  This is what he wrote to me 2 weeks ago:\n\n       I don't know what to pray for first: that I will die before \n     my son will so I don't have to bear the burden, or that I \n     outlive him so I can provide support to his family when he is \n     gone.\n\n  Quite a set of prayers. This should not be a choice any American \nshould have to make. It should not be a choice any father or mother \nshould have to make--and when given the chance to help people like \nMike, our choice should be very easy.\n  That is what this legislation is all about. These are hard-working \ncitizens with heartbreaking stories. They are people who played by the \nrules and simply want their insurance company to also do the same. They \nare not alone. These tragedies do not happen only to Nevadans. They \ndon't happen only to people who, despite all their pain, find time to \nwrite their leaders in Congress. These tragic events happen to people \non the east coast, the west coast, and everywhere in between. These \ntragedies happen to Americans in small towns and in big cities. These \ntragedies happen to citizens on the left side of the political spectrum \nand on the right side. As Mike Tracy wrote in his powerful letter about \nhis son:\n\n       Democrats need health care. Republicans need health care. \n     Independents need health care. All Americans need health \n     care.\n       Get it done.\n\n  He is right. Every single Senator, every one of us, comes from a \nState where these injustices happen every single day. Every single \nSenator represents hundreds, thousands of people who have to choose \nbetween paying an electricity bill or a medical bill; between filling a \ndoctor's prescription or--well, maybe just hoping for the best--between \ntheir mother's chemotherapy treatment and their daughter's college \ntuition.\n  As I mentioned earlier, on average an American dies from lack of \nhealth insurance every 10 minutes. That means in the short time I have \nbeen speaking our broken system has claimed at least two lives. Another \nAmerican has died, another American has died--two have died a \npreventable death, each of them.\n\n[[Page S13646]]\n\n  So as our citizens face heart-rending decisions every day, tonight \nevery Senator has a choice to make as well. That choice: Are you going \nto do all you can to avert the next preventable death? I hope so. I \nurge an aye vote to stop this filibuster.\n  Mr. President, I advise my Members that in 1984 the Senate adopted a \nresolution, S. 40, to impose a requirement that Senators vote from \ntheir desks. I know we do not do this all the time but I ask tonight we \ndo vote from our desks and follow the rule, S. Res. 40, and have \nSenators vote from their desks.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to invoke cloture having been \npresented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the \nmotion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Reid amendment \n     No. 3276 to the Reid substitute amendment No. 2786 to H.R. \n     3590, the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of 2009.\n         Christopher J.

Mr. President, on Wednesday, the junior Senator from \nVermont offered his ``single-payer'' health insurance amendment, amdt. \nNo. 2837, to H.R. 3590. Under rule XV of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, an amendment must be read aloud into the Record unless its \nreading is dispensed with by unanimous consent. Such consent is \nroutinely granted but in this instance, the junior Senator from \nOklahoma objected so the clerks commenced with reading the 767-page \namendment. After several hours passed, Senator Sanders withdrew his \namendment.\n  Later in the day, the Republican leader came to the floor and \ncomplained that ``the majority somehow convinced the Parliamentarian to \nbreak with the longstanding precedent and practice of the Senate'' with \nregard to the reading of the amendment. He claimed that continued \nreading of the amendment could not be dispensed with absent consent \nbeing granted, suggesting that Senator Sanders had no right to \ninterrupt the reading to withdraw his amendment. The Republican leader \ncited Riddick's Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices, pages 43-\n44, which states, in part:\n\n       Under Rule XV, paragraph 1, and Senate precedents, an \n     amendment shall be read by the Clerk before it is up for \n     consideration or before the same shall be debated unless a \n     request to waive the reading is granted; in practice that \n     includes an ordinary amendment or an amendment in the nature \n     of a substitute, the reading of which may not be dispensed \n     with except by unanimous consent, and if the request is \n     denied the amendment must be read and further interruptions \n     are not in order; interruptions of the reading of an \n     amendment that has been proposed are not in order, even for \n     the purpose of proposing a substitute amendment to a \n     committee amendment which is being read.\n       When an amendment is offered the regular order is it \n     reading, and unanimous consent is required to call off the \n     reading.\n       A Senator has, at the sufferance of the Senate, reserved \n     the right to object to dispensing with further reading of an \n     amendment.\n\n  Later on Wednesday, the senior Senator from Illinois ably addressed \nthe Republican leader's concerns but I bring the matter up again \nbecause I was presiding at the time Senator Sanders withdrew his \namendment and Senator Coburn called for regular order. I received \nseveral phone calls afterwards from individuals who claimed that I \nacted erroneously in permitting Senator Sanders to withdraw his \namendment so I would like to set the record straight.\n  First of all, before Senator Sanders withdrew his amendment, I \nconsulted with the Senior Assistant Parliamentarian, who was on the \nfloor while I was presiding. He assured me that a Senator has the right \nto withdraw an amendment if no action has been taken on it. No action \ncan be taken on an amendment until it is officially pending. An \namendment is not officially pending until it has been read into the \nRecord or such reading has been waived by unanimous consent.\n  It is important to understand that while the Presiding Officer, not \nthe Parliamentarian, makes rulings, it would be unusual for him or her \nto ignore the advice of the Parliamentarian. Martin Gold, who was the \nsenior floor staffer to two former Republican majority leaders, Howard \nH. Baker, Jr., and William H. Frist, MD, of Tennessee, writes in his \ndefinitive book, ``Senate Procedure and Practice,'' that former \nParliamentarian Floyd M. Riddick ``claimed that in twenty-five years of \nadvising the presiding officer, the Senate only once voted to overturn \nhim on appeal. He also cites an example of Vice President Alben Barkley \nignoring the parliamentarian's advice, only to be overturned on \nappeal.'' The Parliamentarian is a nonpartisan officer of the Senate. \nIn the 72 years since the position was created, there have been just \nfive Parliamentarians. The Parliamentarian and his staff are \nexperienced professionals. I sought and received the Parliamentarian's \nadvice on this matter and I followed it, which is how the Senate \nusually operates.\n\n[[Page S13647]]\n\n  The Parliamentarian and his staff conducted extensive research on \nrule XV and the precedents governing the reading and withdrawal of \namendments prior to what happened during Wednesday's session. While the \nRiddick's text the Republican leader cited seems plain enough, it is \ntrumped by section 2 of rule XV itself, which clearly and succinctly \nstates:\n\n       Any motion, amendment, or resolution may be withdrawn or \n     modified by the mover at any time before a decision, \n     amendment, or ordering of the yeas and nays, except a motion \n     to reconsider, which shall not be withdrawn without leave.\n\n  Prior to the time Senator Sanders withdrew his amendment, no action \nhad been taken on it that would have prevented such a move without \nconsent for a very simple reason: the amendment wasn't officially \npending while it was being read into the Record. So Senator Sanders had \nan unfettered right to withdraw it under such conditions.\n  The precedent for a Senator's ability to withdraw an amendment while \nit is being read without gaining consent first, either to dispense with \nthe reading or to withdraw it, was firmly established in 1950 and \nreiterated in 1992. On April 14, 1950, Senator Forrest C. Donnell \ninsisted that an amendment being offered by Senator William Benton be \nread in its entirety. Afterwards, Senator Benton sought unanimous \nconsent to withdraw his amendment. Senator Donnell made a parliamentary \ninquiry of the Chair, asking the Presiding Officer whether a Senator \nmay withdraw an amendment while it is being read. He further stated \nthat if consent were necessary he would object. The Presiding Officer \nreplied that an amendment may indeed be withdrawn while it is being \nread, citing the language in rule XV I just mentioned. And Senator \nBenton withdrew his amendment.\n  On September 24, 1992, Senator Brock Adams offered an amendment to a \ntax bill and sought consent twice to dispense with reading it. In both \ninstances, Senator Bob Packwood objected so the clerk proceeded to read \nthe amendment aloud. Later, Senator Adams asked for ``permission'' to \nwithdraw the amendment and the Chair replied affirmatively that he had \nthe right to do so.\n  The 1950 precedent is cited on page 119 of Riddick's for the \nproposition that an amendment may be withdrawn ``even as soon as it has \nbeen read'' but it is, in fact, the same ruling as the 1992 precedent, \nthat a Senator may withdraw his amendment while it is being read.\n  The Republican leader did not refer to the 1950 precedent in his \ncomments on Wednesday but spoke disparagingly of what happened in 1992, \nsaying, ``the Chair made a mistake and allowed something similar (to \nSenator Sanders' move) to happen. But one mistake does not a precedent \nmake.''\n  The Parliamentarian doesn't share the Republican leader's contention \nthat the 1992 action was a ``mistake,'' not a precedent. The \nParliamentarian's view is echoed by Walter Oleszek, the noted senior \nspecialist in American National Government at the Congressional \nResearch Service, CRS, who wrote last year, ``Senators are free to \nmodify or withdraw their amendments until the Senate takes ``action'' \non them.'' This is from Senate Amendment Process: General Conditions \nand Principles, CRS Report 98-707, May 19, 2008. Martin Gold's book, \n``Senate Procedure and Practice,'' states:\n\n       When a senator sends an amendment to the desk, he continues \n     to ``own'' that amendment in the sense that he can modify or \n     withdraw it at will (my emphasis) . . . Once ``action'' has \n     been taken on the amendment, that situation changes, and the \n     senator can modify or withdraw his amendment only by \n     unanimous consent. This is from page 102.\n\n  The minority has tried to argue that there was Senate action on the \nSanders amendment because the Senate previously had agreed to a \nunanimous consent request defining the amendment and the Hutchison \nmotion to recommit as the only propositions in order at that stage and \nprohibiting amendments to them. It is true that if an amendment is on a \ndefined list of the only amendments made in order, that amendment when \npending cannot be withdrawn except by unanimous consent. But that order \nis irrelevant in this case because, as I mentioned before, the Sanders \namendment was not pending and could not be until it was read in full or \nunless the reading was dispensed with by unanimous consent. Another way \nto put it is that the reading of the amendment was not ``interrupted'' \nby Senator Sanders; in withdrawing it he obviated the reason for a \nreading. The order allowed but did not require, as it could not, that \nSenator Sanders offer the amendment and take steps to make it pending.\n  So, to summarize, rule XV of the Standing Rules of the Senate and the \n1950 and 1992 precedents are clear that Senator Sanders was well within \nhis rights to withdraw the amendment, the reading of it \nnotwithstanding. The Parliamentarian advised me accordingly and I \nfollowed his advice. I would add that Senator Coburn never explicitly \nobjected to Senator Sanders withdrawing the amendment. He called for \nregular order. While regular order was indeed the reading of the \namendment, that status couldn't prevent Senator Sanders from exercising \nhis right to withdraw it.\n  Finally, I regret that several of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle made comments that were critical of the Parliamentarian and \nhis staff following this incident. The current Parliamentarian helped \nto write, edit, and revise Riddick's Senate Procedure and he has served \nin his current capacity as Chief Parliamentarian for 17 years and \ncounting, and as a Senate Parliamentarian for 33 years. He and his \nstaff have a combined total of 84 years of experience. They are \nprofessionals who serve this institution and the American people with \ndistinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13647-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, DECEMBER 21, 2009\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \nshall be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The assistant Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning we are continuing to run time \npostcloture on the managers' amendment. Following any leader remarks, \nthe time until 12:30 p.m. is equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees. Senator Reid has asked me to serve as his designee on \nthe Democratic side. At 12:30 p.m., we will begin alternating 1-hour \nblocks of time until 6:30 p.m., with the majority controlling\n\n[[Page S13648]]\n\nthe first hour. If all 30 hours postcloture is required, then the \nrollcall vote on the managers' amendment will occur about 7:15 a.m. \ntomorrow, Tuesday morning, and the cloture vote on the substitute will \noccur immediately after that. So we expect at least two rollcall votes \nearly Tuesday morning. Hopefully, votes will not be needed today to \nrecess or adjourn this evening. That is the state of play and business \non the floor.\n  I see the majority leader has arrived on the floor, and I wish to \ngive him a chance, if he is seeking that opportunity, to make any \nannouncements he believes will be timely and appropriate.\n  The majority leader indicates he is not going to make an \nannouncement, so I wish to make some comments about where we are at \nthis moment.\n  I can't imagine there are many people in America who have been \nfollowing this day's session because it began at 12:01 a.m., when the \nSenate was reconvened for a vote on the managers' amendment to health \ncare reform, which took place just a few minutes after 1 a.m. this \nmorning. We recessed and now are returning for the rest of the \nlegislative day.\n  When the history of the Senate is written, I think this vote will be \nincluded because it is a historic vote. We consider many issues in the \nSenate of great importance to individuals, groups, States, and to our \nNation, but seldom do we address an issue of this magnitude or scope. \nThis health care reform issue literally touches every person who is \nfollowing this debate and many who are not even aware of it. What we \nare doing is addressing some of the fundamentals of our health care \nsystem in America that need to be changed.\n  Whenever you are suggesting change in America, there is resistance. \nThere are people who are currently comfortable with the health care \nsystem as we have it, and there are people who are benefiting from the \nsystem as we know it, particularly health insurance companies which \nenjoy great profits because of the current system of health care in \nAmerica. But at the heart of the issue, we know this system is \nunsustainable and, as a result, we have engaged in almost a 1-year \neffort to thoroughly investigate our health care system and to find \nways to change it for the better. This has called on so many of our \ncolleagues to make extraordinary contributions to this search for \nreform.\n  I wish to commend, first, our majority leader Harry Reid, who usually \nstands at our caucus meetings and says: Stop congratulating me; I am \njust doing my job. I am going to do it anyway. Senator Reid has worked \ntirelessly--and I have seen most of it firsthand--to build a coalition \nfor health care reform within the Democratic caucus. We didn't have a \nsingle Republican vote that was in support of reform in the early \nmorning hours. I hope that changes as time passes, but he had to build \na coalition within our caucus of conservative and progressive Senators, \nand he did it, so we had all 60 Democratic Members voting for health \ncare reform.\n  We are united in the belief that there are fundamental things that \nneed to be changed in our health care system. First, it needs to be \nmore affordable. People cannot afford this dramatic escalation in the \ncost of health care. Ten years ago, a health care policy for a family \nof four offered through their employer cost about $6,000 a year in \npremiums. That is $500 a month which, instead of being paid to an \nemployee as salary, was taken from them for health insurance--$500 a \nmonth.\n  Today, that number has grown to $12,000 a year for an average family \nof four for health insurance through their employment. One thousand \ndollars a month that might otherwise go to a family for basic \nnecessities of life and savings and buying things that are important to \ntheir future instead goes to pay for health insurance. That escalation, \nthat 100-percent increase in health insurance premiums in 10 years, is \ntroubling but not nearly as troubling as the projection that if we \ncontinue to see an escalation in costs of health insurance premiums \nbased on what we have seen in the past, in another 8 years it will \ndouble again. Imagine 8 years from now, in 2017, that you have to work \nand earn $2,000 a month just to pay for your health insurance. How many \npeople will be able to do that? How many businesses will be able to \nafford it? The answer is obvious. More and more people will be dropped. \nToday, 50 million Americans have no health insurance. Many of them go \nto work every single day, but their employers can't afford to provide \nhealth insurance or they are unemployed or they have some other problem \nwhere they have been excluded by a health insurance company. So in \naddition to dealing with the fundamental issue of health care reform, \nwe are focusing on affordability, how to bend the cost curve, as they \nsay, or reduce the increase in costs of health insurance premiums. I \nwouldn't stand here and say to the people of America, with the passage \nof the bill we are now considering, everyone's health insurance is \ngoing down, but I think I can say, with some confidence, the rate of \nincrease is going to decline, and that will give people a better chance \nof affordability. That is essential.\n  Secondly, what about those 50 million uninsured people? I have met \nthem, as the Senator from West Virginia has as well. These are not \nlazy, shiftless people who aren't trying. Many of them are trying hard, \nbut they don't have a chance for health insurance coverage for a \nvariety of reasons. We are going to change that. Of the 50 million \ncurrently uninsured, over 30 million will have insurance under this \nbill. Those in the lower income categories will qualify for what we \ncall Medicaid, which is a Federal-State health insurance program for \nthe poor and disabled. Most of those people--those who make less than \n$15,000 a year--will not pay any premiums because they can't. They \ndon't have enough money. For those who are making slightly more, we \nprovide in this bill tax credits that will help people pay for their \npremiums. So if your family is making up to $80,000 a year, the Tax \nCode will now help you pay for your monthly premium for health \ninsurance.\n  So we are going to expand coverage. Thirty million people are going \nto have the security of health insurance coverage. We are bending the \ncost curve so the increase in health insurance premiums is not as \nsteep, making sure more people are covered, and then, equally \nimportant, we are changing the rules when it comes to health insurance \ncompanies.\n\n  For too long, these health insurance companies have ruled the roost. \nSince the early 1940s, they have been exempt from antitrust laws which \nallow them to literally collude and conspire with these set prices. \nOver half the insurance markets in America are dominated by only two \ncompanies, and it is legal under our law for those two companies to sit \ndown and say: OK, how much are we going to charge? They don't compete \nwith one another, they conspire with one another to set premium rates. \nIf you think I am a conspiracy theorist, what I am stating to you is \nwhat the law clearly says in the McCarran-Ferguson Act--something I \nthink should be repealed posthaste--because they can sit down and set \npremiums. They can also allocate markets. They can say to two \ncompanies: You take over St. Louis and those two companies will do \nChicago and these two companies are going to do Wheeling, WV. They can \nset up the market structures so there is little or no competition. How \ncan that be good? If we truly believe in a free market system, how can \nthis be good for America?\n  So what we are doing as well is saying: We are going to change some \nof these rules, some of the most egregious abuses by these health \ninsurance companies--first and foremost, preexisting conditions. How \nmany of us are in such perfect health that we can count on a health \ninsurance company covering us without delving into our background, \nfinding something in our family history or something in our own \npersonal history and saying: Well, we are either not going to cover you \nor we are going to charge you dramatically more. Those days have to \nend.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what this bill does. It says immediately--\nimmediately--children under the age of 18 with preexisting conditions \ncannot be discriminated against by health insurance companies. You \ncan't deny them coverage because a child is born and develops diabetes. \nYou can't deny coverage because a child has had cancer and is fighting \nthat cancer. You cannot\n\n[[Page S13649]]\n\ndeny coverage because of those preexisting conditions. That is \nfundamentally fair. It gets to the heart of what we should be doing as \na nation.\n  Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa stood at this podium early this morning \nand said: What this debate is about is whether health insurance is a \nright or a privilege. If it is a privilege only for the wealthy in \nAmerica, then we have lost our way as a nation. We have to understand \nthat protection of our well-being and health through health insurance \nis something every American is entitled to. We have to understand we \nare the only developed Nation on Earth where a person could literally \ndie because they don't have health insurance.\n  If you think that is overly dramatic, let me give an illustration.\n  A man I met in Illinois had a health insurance policy that wasn't \nvery good. It had a $5,000 copay. He had to take that copay so his \npremiums would be low enough so he could afford it. That man went to a \ndoctor who said to him: I see some indications from tests that you need \na colonoscopy. You may be developing colon cancer. So the man went and \npriced a colonoscopy procedure and found out it was $3,000 he would \nhave to pay out-of-pocket and he said: I don't have it. So he didn't go \nthrough with the procedure. That is a risky thing, and it is something \nno one should have to face, but that is the current system.\n  What we are trying to do is change that system so that basically \npreexisting conditions are excluded from the discrimination of health \ninsurance companies, that basic procedures that are needed for \nprevention and wellness are included in every health insurance policy. \nWe are also making certain that these health insurance companies can't \ncut you off when you need them the most, can't cancel your policy when \nyou face an accident or a diagnosis where medical bills are going to \npile up. That is one of the provisions of this bill as well.\n  We also say, for families with young children who are off to \ncollege--and my wife and I have been through this--that you reach the \npoint where you finally say: Wait a minute. My daughter is graduating \nfrom college. I wonder if she is still under my family health insurance \nplan. Today, in most cases, if your child has reached the age of 24, \nthey are off your family plan. Well, we extend that now so those 24 and \n25 will have the protection of their family health insurance plan while \nthey finish school, look for their first job and obtain their own \nhealth insurance. That is going to be peace of mind for a lot of \nfamilies across America, just those 2 years when young people are the \nmost vulnerable and need the protection of their family health \ninsurance plan.\n  Are these worth anything, these changes? I think they are worth a \nlot. I think that is why 60 Democrats stood proudly and voted for this.\n  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, turned to us in the midst \nof this dramatic debate early this morning and said: If one of you--and \nhe pointed to all of us sitting here--doesn't vote against it, then all \nof you Democratic Senators will own this.\n  We know that, and we have pride in that ownership because we know the \nalternative. Those who voted against change are voting for a system \nthat is unsustainable and morally indefensible--a system which, \nfrankly, today puts good, hard-working people, folks who follow the \nrules, Americans who believe they are doing the very best for their \ncountry, at a distinct disadvantage for one of the most basic things we \nexpect in life: protection of good health care when we are facing \nillness and when we need a helping hand.\n  This bill is also going to change the face of health care in America. \nI don't think I overstated it. Our bill has $10 billion to be invested \nin community health clinics. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been \nsuch a leader on this issue and deserves credit for it. He was dogged. \nSome Members looked to this bill for a variety of things, but Senator \nSanders looked to this bill to provide a helping hand across America \nthrough community health clinics. As those clinics are built and \nexpanded, more and more small towns in West Virginia and in Illinois \nare going to have satellite clinics where people, regardless of whether \nthey are wealthy or not as wealthy, will have a chance to walk in the \nfront door and see a medical professional. They will not be queuing \noutside the emergency rooms of hospitals, where their care is much more \nexpensive. They will be going to these community health clinics and \nmeeting primary care physicians who will give them the basic care they \nneed before their medical problems become much more serious.\n  That is what this bill is fundamentally about. There are many other \nparts to it, parts I am proud to be cosponsoring and proud to be \nsupporting--giving a hand to small businesses, giving a hand to \nindividuals to expand health insurance coverage.\n  Some might ask: If you voted on it at 1 o'clock this morning, why are \nyou still here? Because the minority is exercising its right under the \nSenate rules which requires us now to wait 30 hours before we can vote \nagain on this one section of the bill. As I announced this morning, \nthat means that in the early hours tomorrow morning, about 7:15 or \n7:20, Senators will be coming to the floor again for two votes to move \nthis process forward. I understand it is the right of the minority to \nask us to come in at 1 in the morning or early in the morning. They \nhave that right. Historically, we have usually reached some \naccommodation and agreement, and I hope we can here. The 60 votes that \nwere there last night will be there again tomorrow morning, and they \nwill be there every time needed until this bill is finally passed.\n  Those on the other side believe this bill is so bad that it is going \nto revitalize the Republican Party in the next election. I disagree \nwith them. I think the American people, as they come to understand this \nbill, will view it in its historic context, one of the most dramatic \nsteps forward to provide peace of mind and security to families and \nbusinesses across America for an issue we know needs to be addressed.\n  There are some who came to the floor yesterday--there was one \nSenator. I invited him to come in and explain his remarks. He said \npeople should say a prayer that someone would miss the vote at 1 a.m. I \ndo not think we should be praying for misfortune for our Senators, that \nthey would be delayed or for some other reason could not make the vote. \nInstead, we should be praying to overcome the misfortune of 30 million \nAmericans who will not have health insurance if this bill fails. That \nis the kind of misfortune I want to avoid in the future.\n  We also have one other item of business remaining, and that is the \ndebt ceiling of America. It is something none of us want to face. It is \nalmost like making your monthly payment for the mortgage, and that is \nwhat it is, the mortgage of America. We have to acknowledge the fact \nthat as we fight a war and incur the costs, as we have the workings of \ngovernment assessed, and we know there are costs, it adds to the \nexpense of our government, and some of it is in debt, and that debt \nneeds to be extended for a short period of time as we move forward into \nthe next year that begins in just a few days. This debt ceiling issue \nis one we need to come to grips with before we leave at the end of this \nmonth. There is a short-term extension which I hope the Senate will \nconsider.\n  I wish to also say that Senator Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, has been a real leader in talking about \ncoming to grips with this long-term debt. I have said to him, in the \nmidst of a recession, with high unemployment, most economists believe \nit would be a mistake for us to pull back in terms of the safety net \nfor families out of work, to pull back in terms of the investment in \ninfrastructure to put people to work, and Senator Conrad says he \nagrees. Although he believes we need to be honest about the debt of \nAmerica, he has said to me repeatedly that he is not a Hooverite, \nreferring to that period in history when the Great Depression hit and \nPresident Herbert Hoover believed government should address the debt of \nAmerica instead of the depression of America. He lost that election to \nFranklin Roosevelt in 1932 as a result of that point of view.\n  Many of us believe the debt is a serious issue to be grappled with, \nbut at the current moment we have to focus on the millions of Americans \nout of work who need a helping hand, first with unemployment benefits, \nCOBRA benefits, food stamps, the basic necessities of life. We have to \nprovide opportunities for education and training,\n\n[[Page S13650]]\n\nand then we have to find a way to spark this economy and move it \nforward.\n  Senator Reid has given to me and Senator Dorgan of North Dakota the \nresponsibility of looking at the Senate jobs-creation package. We have \nbeen working on that, and we are close with our colleagues in the House \nin coming up with some ideas on how to expand employment. I hope we can \nhave bipartisan support for that. It would certainly make it a lot \neasier, and it would be done more quickly so that we do not lose jobs \nin the next construction season coming up next year.\n  That is the reality of the agenda we face when we return. I did tell \nyou that now most Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle are \nanxious to share their holiday season with their families. It is one of \nthose special times of the year. We now have a record vote of 60 \nMembers on this side on health care reform. I hope we can get the \nagreement from the Republican side to bring this matter to closure \nsoon, to vote on the debt ceiling, and to have at least a short \nadjournment for some time for us to return home to our States and home \nto our families.\n  Mr. President, if there is no one seeking recognition at this time, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time under the quorum \ncall be assessed against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 6:30 p.m. will be divided in \n1-hour alternating blocks of time, with the majority controlling the \nfirst block.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments this morning \nto talk about a provision in this package about which I am particularly \nproud. This would finally follow through on the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to provide screening and medical care to residents at \nSuperfund public health emergency sites.\n  The term ``public health emergency'' is defined by the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, \notherwise known as CERCLA. People call that the Superfund law--CERCLA. \nThat law reserves the declaration of public health emergency for the \nmost hazardous Superfund sites. These are sites where the release or \npotential release of a hazardous substance rises to the level of an \nemergency.\n  When a public health emergency is declared, the law requires that the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services provide screening and medical \ncare services to people who have been exposed. But to date, the \ngovernment has not created a mechanism to allow the Secretary to \ndeliver the screening and medical care required under current law. The \nbill before us finally provides that mechanism.\n  First, it authorizes a grant program for the screening services. \nThese screenings would determine if a medical condition is present that \nis attributable to environmental exposure. Then, it allows those \nindividuals with a diagnosed medical condition due to the environmental \nexposure at the site to get medical care services.\n  It also establishes a pilot program to provide additional medical \ncare appropriate for the residents of the Superfund site at Libby, MT. \nThis language responds to Libby's rural nature and the lack of access \nto traditional care. This provision is important because it will \nprovide vital medical services to Americans who, through no fault of \ntheir own, have suffered horrible effects from their exposure to deadly \npoisons. It will provide the vital medical services we owe these \nAmericans under our commitment in prior legislation; that is, the \nSuperfund Act.\n  This provision is especially important to me for a special reason. \nThe Environmental Protection Agency currently has 1,270 sites \ndesignated where pollution contamination presents a danger to public \nhealth and welfare. Throughout the history of the program, the EPA has \nfound only one site where conditions are so severe and the \ncontamination so pervasive to have it warranted a declaration of a \n``public health emergency.'' That declaration occurred on June 17 of \nthis year. EPA Administrator Jackson found that a public health \nemergency exists at the Superfund site in Libby, MT.\n  Many Senators have heard me speak about Libby. Libby, MT, is a \nbeautiful little town, a small town in northeastern Montana, surrounded \nby millions of acres of Federal forest lands. It appears to be an \nidyllic spot. It is home to families of all ages. It is a place where \npeople spend their lives creating a sense of community not often found \nin the country today. It is also a town that has gone through lots of \nstress, lots of economic difficulties. The timber industry has \nvirtually shut down Libby, one of the mainstays in Libby. Mining there \nis not quite what it used to be in years past. Here the people work \ntogether. They love Libby. It is tucked away, almost isolated in the \nnortheastern part of Montana. Most people in Montana have never been to \nLibby, and some don't even know where Libby is, but they have this \nwonderful sense of community in their own town.\n  However, Libby is also a Superfund site. It is the home of a big \nmine. It is a place where hundreds of people have grown sick and died--\ndied due to pervasive presence of asbestos spewed from the vermiculite \nmining and milling operations of W.R. Grace.\n  Gold miners discovered vermiculite in Libby in 1881. In the 1920s, \nthe Zonolite Company formed and began mining vermiculite. In 1963, W.R. \nGrace bought the Zonolite mining operations, operated it, and made a \nlot of money, frankly, and the mine closed in 1990.\n  The EPA first visited Libby in 1999. In October 2002, EPA declared it \na Superfund site. Cleanup was begun. It was very pervasive, very \ndifficult, and it was a hard time getting the trust between the EPA and \nthe people in the community. A lot of people didn't trust that EPA was \ndoing the right job, not doing it the right way. In fact, I had to get \nso involved in so many ways in holding EPA's feet to the fire because \nthey weren't doing something such as a base-level study. They didn't \nknow how clean clean was. They did not do a very good job.\n  A guy named Paul Peronard was the onsite coordinator, who was finally \nable to convince EPA back in Denver what they had to do. In my personal \njudgment, they didn't send Paul back because he was doing such a good \njob. Anyway, cleanup began in 2002, and we still have a long way to go.\n  For decades, the W.R. Grace operation belched 5,000 pounds of \nasbestos into the air in and around Libby every day. Deadly asbestos \ncoated the town and its inhabitants. People used raw vermiculite ore or \nexpanded vermiculite to fill their gardens, their driveways, they put \nthe stuff on the high school track, the little league ballfield, and \nput the stuff up in their attics. It was used everywhere, this stuff. \nPeople sort of sensed there was something not quite right with all this \nvermiculite and asbestos, but it was kind of hard to put your finger \non.\n  One day, I visited Libby, and I will never forget, when I went to the \nmine, I was stunned to see these miners come off the mine and into \ntheir buses. They were caked with dust. I mean, it added new meaning to \na dustbin. They were just caked with the stuff on their clothes. They \ngot on the bus, went home.\n  The one person I talked to and who got me interested in doing \nsomething about this--a guy named Les Scramsted--told me, when he got \noff the bus, he would go home--caked with dust--and embrace his wife, \nhis kids would jump in his lap, and guess what: Les is now dead from \nasbestos-related vermiculite. His wife is ill, and one of his children \nhas died as a consequence. Think of the pain he went through. He died \nbecause of mesothelioma asbestos. Also, even worse, he caused his wife \nto be ill and caused his son to die because of this disease.\n  Mine workers brought the dust home with them, as I mentioned, on \ntheir clothing. They contaminated their own families without knowing \nthe dust was poison. We knew something was wrong, but we didn't know it \nwas that wrong.\n  I think the company knew exactly what it was doing. In fact, I might \nsay, the company has been subject to a criminal action against their \nofficers, with allegations the officers knew they were contaminating \nthe people and\n\n[[Page S13651]]\n\ndidn't disclose it. That suit went on for a year. It is true the \nofficers were acquitted not long ago, but in my personal judgment, it \nwas because of a lousy prosecution. But it is an example where somebody \nthought--a lot of people thought--not only did the officers of this \ncompany contaminate people, but they knew they were contaminating \npeople at Libby, MT.\n  Asbestos was everywhere in Libby for decades. I must say, W.R. Grace \nCompany sure did not help matters. I might say, parenthetically, this \nis the same company that is the subject of a book and a movie called \n``Civil Action,'' where W.R. Grace contaminated the water in Woburn, \nMA. In my judgment, they knew what they were doing. It is clear they \nknew what they were doing. As I recall, a big civil judgment was \nrendered against W.R. Grace because it was clear they knew what they \nwere doing. They are now bankrupt. W.R. Grace shoved all their assets \nto another location so the plaintiffs in the suit against W.R. Grace \ncould not attach their assets--and all the shenanigans this company \nundertook for their own benefit and at the expense of the people in \nLibby.\n  The type of asbestos in Libby is particularly deadly, and so many \npeople in Libby are dead, dying, and sick because of this tremolite \nasbestos, an especially vicious, pernicious form of asbestos. This is \nnot regular asbestos, such as chrysotile, this was tremolite asbestos \nmined at Libby, MT, where the fibers are deeper and they are stronger. \nThey get in your lungs and they cause more damage and it takes longer \nto detect. It is that vicious.\n  The effect on Libby has been severe. Today, we know that nearly 300 \nresidents of Libby have died--300. It is a small town. Thousands more \nhave become sick with asbestos-related disease. That is 291 deaths in a \ncounty of 18,000. Lincoln County, MT, home to Libby, has the highest \nage-adjusted death rate due to asbestosis in the Nation.\n  Libby is an isolated community with limited access to health care. \nThe median household income in Libby in 2007 was $30,000. When I say \n``isolated community with limited access to medical care,'' what do I \nmean? There is just not that much there. And the company has reneged on \nits insurance policies. The company had mediocre insurance policies for \nfolks, but as time goes on, the company just backs off--backs off. It \nis really what is happening in the health care reform here. They \nrescind--renege on their policies for one reason after another. The \npoor folks, when they know they have asbestos-related--either cancer or \nother lung-related disease, they do not have the resources to go to get \nthe medical attention.\n  I have been at this for years. It is so frustrating, it is so wrong \nwhat has happened to the people of Libby, MT.\n  It is this combination of devastating characteristics that led the \nEPA Administrator in June to find that the public health emergency does \nexist at the Libby Superfund site. This finding was based on years of \nwork, having originally been recommended by the EPA in 2001.\n  I might say, I read the transcripts between EPA Administrators and \nOMB back in those years. The EPA Administrator under the Republican \nadministration recommended that this action be taken, but it was \nsquelched at the White House by OMB. The correspondence is clear. This \nis exactly what happened back then in a previous administration. That \nis why EPA has never used this authority, and the Agency indicates \nthere are currently no sites on the National Priorities List that come \nclose to the conditions at Libby.\n  It is worth highlighting a few parts of the Administrator's findings. \nLet me indicate what they are. The Administrator has said:\n\n       The Libby Asbestos Site is unique with respect to the \n     multiplicity of exposure routes [all ways this stuff gets to \n     them], the cumulative exposures experienced by community \n     members, and the adverse health effects from asbestos \n     exposure already present and documented in the residents.\n       Investigations performed by the Agency for Toxic Substances \n     and Disease Registry (ATSDR) have found hundreds of cases of \n     asbestos-related disease in this relatively small community. \n     ATSDR documented a disease and death rate from asbestosis in \n     the Libby area significantly higher than the national average \n     for the period from 1979-1998. The occurrences of disease are \n     not limited to vermiculite facility workers or their \n     families, but are spread throughout the population.\n\n  This is pervasive in the town--ballfields, tracks, lawns; it is \nawful.\n\n       Medical care in Libby has historically been limited due to \n     Libby's isolated location and economic situation, thus \n     reducing the chance of early detection and treatment of \n     asbestos-related disease.\n\n  This piece bears repeating:\n  Let me refine that point. For a long time, we have been talking to \nlung specialists across the country about the Libby tremolite asbestos, \nand we got just so-so responses about how dangerous it was. Why? \nBecause virtually none of those doctors had experience dealing with the \npernicious kind of asbestos we have in Libby, MT. It took a long time \nto get their attention. We finally got some doctors to say this stuff \nin Libby is wicked stuff. That is why, frankly, EPA has started to \nunderstand how bad this really is.\n  Essentially, the lack of access to health care services in Libby--I \nwill say it again--has actually worsened the effects of this \ncontamination. It just worked to their disadvantage.\n  The language before us today helps to solve this. It allows us to \nfulfill the commitment we made to the people of Libby when we passed \nthe Superfund Act 30 years ago. Heaven forbid, if in the future another \nSuperfund site like Libby emerges, the bill before us today will allow \nthe Secretary to use the authorities in this provision to fulfill our \ncommitment to provide health care services for those residents as well.\n  I can never talk about Libby without remembering my friend Les \nSkramsted. I mentioned his name a few moments ago. I first met Les in \nthe year 2000 at the home of Gayla Benefield. Les was there, Gayla was \nthere, and lots of other miners were there pleading for help, for some \nattention: We are dying. Someone pay attention to us. We are a small, \nisolated community up here in northwestern Montana. Please, someone, \npay attention to us.\n  This did get our attention. I was stunned by the stories they told. I \nwas talking to Les over coffee and huckleberry pie--a very popular pie \nup in Libby. Les was watching me very closely when I said: You bet, I \nwill help do something about this. He was very wary.\n  After his neighbors and friends had finished telling me their \nstories, I will never forget that Les came up to me and said: Senator, \na lot of people have come to Libby, and they told us they would help. \nThen they leave and nothing happens.\n  He told me, I remember, I think at that instant--you know, in life \nsometimes you find four, five, six, seven instances, man to man, \nwhatever it takes, you are going to make sure they get justice; \nwhatever it takes, whatever it takes. Such a commitment. That was one. \nI said to myself: Boy, I am going to do whatever it takes to take care \nof this because these people of Libby deserve justice. They have not \nreceived it.\n  He said: Senator, I heard you say that, but I will be watching you.\n  I knew he would watch. I knew that would help. I didn't actually say \nit because I was going to do it anyway. I accepted Les's offer, and I \nhave a big photograph of Les behind my desk.\n  Les passed away a couple or 3 years ago. I spent a lot of time with \nhim and his family at the hospital. I have a wonderful picture of Les \nSkramsted that reminds me what we have to do for the people of Libby \nbut also for all the people in the Nation, people like Les Skramsted. \nIt means that much to me.\n  I have not forgotten Les. I will not forget Les. That is why this \nprovision is in here. I think Les, right now, up there, may be smiling, \nsaying: Yup, he did not forget Libby, he did not forget Les. That is \nwhat this provision is all about.\n  This is a photograph behind me of Les Skramsted in Libby, MT. He is \nin a cemetery there, graves of lots of people in Libby who died. Les \nplayed a pretty mean guitar. He was a great guy--still is, always will \nbe.\n  I yield to my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, come snow or sunshine--day or night--we \nare close to sealing the deal to change our country for the better, to \nfinally hold insurance companies accountable, and\n\n[[Page S13652]]\n\nto make health care affordable for all folks in this country.\n  Right now we are all paying far too much for health insurance. Many \nof us can not get health insurance at all. And even worse, insurance \ncompanies don't always live up to their end of the bargain.\n  Sure, a lot of folks are happy with the health care they have.\n  Our doctors, nurses and hospitals and medical research are the best \nin the world.\n  But when you add it all up, many are paying too much for it. Or \nnothing for it. Too many lives are lost. Too much money is wasted. And \ntoo many folks are falling through the cracks.\n  They are calling out for help. I have heard their voices. Now I want \nyou to hear their stories. They are ordinary people who stand to lose \neverything unless we reform our health care system.\n  I support this health care reform bill because it saves lives. It \nsaves money. It saves Medicare. And it is tough on insurance \ncompanies--taking them to task to ensure affordable, fair coverage.\n  I have a perspective different than most of my friends in the Senate.\n  I am--and always will be--a third generation Montana farmer. My wife \nSharla and I do all the work on our farm. I am the guy sitting on the \ntractor.\n  A farmer knows a good year from a bad year. And I have had my share \nof bad years. In fact, for a few of those years--not long after our \nfirst kid was born--Sharla and I had to give up health insurance to \nmake ends meet. We had no other choice but to hope and pray for health \nand safety.\n  Thank God our prayers were answered.\n  Now, I have the honor of serving Montana in the Senate.\n  But mine is one of the thousands of real Montana families that has \nbeen forced to wing it, rather than depend on a health care system that \nworks. And that holds insurance companies accountable.\n  I know of a woman from Ravalli, MT, who cannot afford health \ninsurance because of her pre-existing condition. She and her husband \ngot letters from the insurance company telling them their premiums were \ngoing up, $500, to $600, to $700 per month. Through no fault of her \nown, her insurance just became too expensive. So she gave up.\n  This legislation will prevent that sort of nonsense in the insurance \nindustry from happening again. In this bill, a health insurer's \nparticipation in the exchanges will depend on its performance.\n  Insurers that jack up their premiums before the exchanges begin will \nnot be included. That is a powerful incentive to keep premiums \naffordable.\n  We all have friends and relatives who aren't fortunate enough to have \na job where health insurance is part of the deal. So they do what \nmillions of others are forced to do: they hope and pray they stay \nhealthy.\n  We have a problem. It is time for a solution using common sense and \nfiscal responsibility. And that is why I am going to vote for this \nhealth care reform bill, so we can save lives, save money, save \nMedicare. And so we can hold insurance companies accountable, so they \ndon't drop people when they are sick, or drive families into \nbankruptcy.\n  Because of tax credits, this bill is good for small businesses. It \ngives eligible small businesses access to up to 6 years of tax credits. \nThat will help small businesses buy health insurance for their \nemployees.\n  Because of tough new rules for the insurance industry, it is good for \nfamilies and kids.\n  And because of commonsense ideas like cross-State insurance markets, \nmore competition, and more choices, it is good for millions of \nAmericans who--until now--have had to rely on hope and prayers.\n  If we do not pass this bill, our entire economy could fall apart \nbeyond repair. Right now we are working hard to rebuild our economy, \nand it is working.\n  We are creating jobs and investing in the basic infrastructure needed \nto get our economy back out of the ditch. Fixing our broken health care \nsystem is part of that job.\n  Over the past few years, I have heard from thousands of Montanans \ntelling me about the need to fix health care.\n  One of them is Roxy Burley. Roxy owns a hair salon in Billings, MT.\n  She just bought a home. She works hard. But she just can't afford \nhealth insurance. So, she says, she is walking a tightrope. Her home \nand her business are on one side. Her health is on the other side.\n  If Roxy gets sick, she worries she will lose her home and her \nbusiness.\n  In Montana, our economy relies on people like Roxy Burley. We can't \nafford to have our economy walking a tightrope.\n  In this bill, Roxy will be protected from losing her home and \nbusiness. Her annual out of pocket expenses are capped at no more than \n$5,950 per year.\n  I want to share another story that hits home for me. It is the story \nof Mindy Renfro. She lives in Missoula, MT.\n  Mindy got breast cancer not just once, not just twice, not just three \ntimes--four times: Breast cancers, four different cancers.\n  The same cancer didn't come back. She got a different cancer each \ntime. The first two times, Mindy's insurance paid for her treatment.\n  The third time, the insurance company called her and said: We are \nsorry, but we are not going to pay. The underwriter, she says, \ndetermined her chances of survival were just too slim, so instead they \noffered to send a hospice nurse.\n  Mindy was a single mom in her early 40s, and she was simply not ready \nto check out. So she asked about her options. She was told if she \nwanted to start chemo, she would have to come up with more than \n$100,000 in cash. Her only option was to sell her home. Mindy and her \nchildren sold their home, and moved into an apartment. They packed up \nand moved out of their home so they could sell it and she could start \nthe treatment she needed to stay alive. After many years of trying to \nrepay that debt, Mindy recently declared bankruptcy.\n  I have heard many stories from folks in Montana who are in the same \nboat that Mindy is in. This isn't good business. This needs to stop. It \nis why I support this health care reform bill. I support it because \nunder this bill, Mindy and people like her wouldn't have to declare \nbankruptcy. She would have had insurance, despite her preexisting \ncondition of being a cancer survivor, and her annual out-of-pocket \nexpenses would have been capped at no more than $5,950 per year, not \nthe $100,000 in cash she needed to start cancer treatment. This bill is \nstrong and decisive and tough on insurance companies so they cannot \nsay, sorry, but no, when you get sick; so they cannot say, sorry, but \nno, if you have a preexisting condition.\n  Another story is about former ranchers Dan and Pat Dejong. This \npicture is of Pat. Dan and Pat used to own a cattle ranch in \nnorthwestern Montana. The ranch had been in their family for four \ngenerations. Dan and Pat couldn't afford health insurance. Then Dan was \ndiagnosed with cancer. To pay the bills they had to make the painful \ndecision to sell off their ranch.\n  I am going to tell you, when a piece of land has been in the family \nfor four generations, you develop an attachment to that piece of land. \nBut nonetheless when Dan got cancer, they had to pay the bills. They \nsold the family ranch. Under this bill, the Dejongs would have had \naccess to subsidies so that they could have afforded health insurance \nin the first place. They never would have had to sell the ranch to pay \nthe doctors' bills.\n  I want to read what Pat wrote to me about that experience:\n\n       The cancer ravaged Dan's body, but selling our ranch to pay \n     for medical costs broke his spirit.\n\n  Dan Dejong lost his battle with cancer 2 years ago. All his bills \nwere paid, but the ranch that had been in the family for four \ngenerations was gone, as well as Dan. After all that, Pat still cannot \nafford health insurance today.\n  Under this health care reform bill, getting sick won't force folks \nsuch as Dan and Pat Dejong to sell the land that has been in their \nfamily for generations. That is because it limits the amount of money \nyou would have to pay out-of-pocket to a rate you can afford based on \nhow much you earn. That means no Americans would have to sell their \nhomes or their family ranches to pay the medical bills.\n\n[[Page S13653]]\n\n  I know a lot of folks already have health insurance, and they are \nwondering, how is this going to affect me. Let me be clear: If you like \nyour plan, you get to keep it. If you don't, you can look for a more \naffordable plan that works best for you and your family. Everyone will \nhave access to affordable health insurance. Right now those with health \ninsurance are subsidizing those without.\n  The other day I struck up a conversation with a trucker back in \nMontana who told me: I don't need insurance. I don't want insurance. I \ndon't get sick. I asked: What happens if you get into an accident? You \nare a trucker; that is always a possibility. He said: All I have to do \nis go to the emergency room where they take care of me, no questions \nasked.\n  That is exactly the problem. When everybody is insured, costs will go \ndown, because no one will be paying extra to cover the folks who rely \non the emergency room for health care that they eventually never pay \nfor. It is common sense. It saves lives, and it saves money.\n  I have been on the phone with tens of thousands of Montanans over the \npast few weeks answering questions about health care. A lot of them \nwant to know how we are going to pay for this bill. How much will it \nincrease our debt?\n  It won't increase our debt one thin dime. In fact, it will lower our \ndeficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, $132 billion over the next \n10 years alone. It reduces the deficit even more in the decade after \nthat. The fact that this bill saves money is pretty important to me. It \ndoesn't add to the deficit. It cuts billions of dollars of government \nwaste. It requires a bigger chunk of your premiums to go directly to \nbetter health care instead of administrative costs and profits, it \nsaves money for families by lowering costs for everyone and by limiting \nthe amount of money you have to pay out-of-pocket for health care and \nby emphasizing wellness and prevention--the low-hanging fruit of health \ncare reform, and by holding insurance companies accountable so we don't \npay more than our fair share for the health care we need.\n  When you turn on the TV these days or open the newspaper, you see all \nsorts of spin about the health care reform and Medicare. It amazes me \nhow distorted the facts have become. I have read the bill. The plain-\nas-dirt fact is it makes Medicare stronger. All guaranteed Medicare \nbenefits stay as they are. They are just that--guaranteed. Seniors are \nguaranteed to keep their benefits, such as hospital stays, access to \ndoctors, home health care, nursing homes, and prescription drugs. How \ndo we make Medicare stronger? We make it stronger by getting rid of \nwasteful spending, by making prescription drugs for seniors more \naffordable, and by spending your money smarter.\n  Without this bill, Medicare will be on the rocks within a matter of \nyears. If we don't fix it now, it will go broke, leaving entire \ngenerations in the lurch. Millions of Americans have worked hard all \ntheir lives for Medicare benefits. They have earned it. That is why we \nare making Medicare better, not worse. That is common sense.\n  The same goes for VA health care. This bill does not affect VA health \ncare or TRICARE. I serve on the Veterans' Affairs committee. Over the \npast 3 years we have made good progress in delivering the promises made \nto veterans. We still have a lot of work to do, but this health care \nreform legislation takes us forward even further for America's \nveterans.\n  Finally, this bill preserves some of the most important parts of \nquality health care: the relationship between you and your doctor and \nthe freedom of choice you have as a patient. In Montana, as in many \nparts of the country, we don't tolerate the government snooping around \nour private lives or making personal decisions for us. Health care is \nno exception. This health care reform bill not only saves lives, it \nsaves money and saves Medicare. It keeps the government out of the exam \nroom and waiting room.\n  I go home to Montana about every weekend to visit with the folks and \nhear what is on their minds. I meet with doctors and nurses, hospital \nadministrators and regular folks from all over the State to hear their \nconcerns. Everywhere I go, health care is the No. 1 issue. It is clear \nthat the worst option is to do nothing at all. If that happens, \ninsurance companies won't be held accountable. As costs go up, health \ncare costs will continue to break families and people who need \ntreatment to stay alive won't get it.\n  I know a fellow farmer who worked some land back in Montana. When he \ngot sick, he had to sell off entire chunks of his family farm to pay \nthe bills, piece by piece. Piece by piece, I watched as he made painful \nsacrifices for his health care. Piece by piece, his livelihood was \nbroken apart. No American deserves that.\n  People are calling out for help, because a lot of folks are falling \nthrough the cracks. I say to them: We are listening. We hear you, and \nwe are doing something about it. That is why this is a good bill. It is \na bill I support. It will allow Americans to get the health insurance \nthey have needed, and the insurance will be affordable. It is the \nresult of a lot of hard work and working together to do what is right \nfor the country--for America's rural families, seniors, veterans, small \nbusinesses, family farms, and ranchers. The people of this country \ndeserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I was proud last night to have voted for \nthe health care bill. The reason is, as Senator Tester indicated, this \nbill accomplishes a whole lot. Before I go on to talk about what I want \nto focus on this afternoon, I do want to say there are a number of \nprovisions in the Senate bill I don't support and I hope we can improve \nin the conference committee by adopting the House language. One is the \nissue of the public option, with which the Presiding Officer has been \nso strongly involved. At the end of the day, it seems to me the \nAmerican people have been very clear. If they are not happy with their \nprivate insurance, they want the option of a Medicare type public \noption. I think we should give them that.\n  Furthermore, as we look at the soaring cost of health care, we \nunderstand that one important mechanism to control escalating health \ncare costs is a public option which provides real competition to \nprivate insurance companies that are only concerned about making as \nmuch money as possible. I know the Presiding Officer has worked very \nhard in that effort. I hope we can, in that regard, take the House \nlanguage which includes a public option.\n  The other area where I disagree with the Senate and agree with the \nHouse is on the issue of taxing health benefits for middle-income \nworkers. The House provision raises substantial funding by putting a \nsurtax on the very wealthiest people in the country, people who \nreceived huge tax breaks during the Bush years. That makes a lot more \nsense to me than taxing the health benefits of middle-income workers.\n  Having said that, I want to focus on one new provision that was \nplaced in the health care reform bill by Majority Leader Reid. I thank \nhim very much for his strong support for this concept. I also thank \nDick Durbin, Chuck Schumer, Patty Murray, the Presiding Officer, and \nthe entire Democratic leadership for their support.\n  That provision simply provides $10 billion over a 5-year period to \nthe Federally Qualified Health Center Program and the National Health \nService Corps. In my view, these two programs are some of the best and \nmost effective public health care programs in the United States. They \nenjoy widespread bipartisan support. President Bush was a supporter. \nJohn McCain, when he ran for President, was a supporter of community \nhealth centers. Many Republicans have spoken positively of community \nhealth centers, as have virtually all Democrats. The reality, however, \nis that both community health centers and the National Health Service \nCorps have been starved for funding for many years. We are finally, in \nthis bill, doing right by them.\n  I should mention, importantly, that while we have placed $10 billion \nin the Senate bill, in the House bill there is $14 billion. My strong \nhope, expectation, and belief--and I have talked to the White House \nabout this and the Senate leadership and House leadership--is that when \nthis bill is finally passed, we will adopt the House language which \ncalls for $14 billion.\n  Let me tell you why this money is so terribly important. In a few \ndays, the\n\n[[Page S13654]]\n\nSenate will be voting on final passage of a historic health reform bill \nthat will insure an additional 31 million Americans who have no health \ninsurance. That is a huge accomplishment. About half of the new people \nwho will get health insurance will be enrolled in an expanded Medicaid \nProgram. While this reduction in the number of uninsured is an \nessential step in achieving reform, we have to ask a very simple \nquestion: If 15 million more people go into Medicaid, where are they \ngoing to access the health care they need?\n  It is no secret that today Medicare is a strained program. When some \nof my Republican friends make that point, I have to say they are right; \nit is a strained program. That is why expanding community health \ncenters in the National Health Service Corps is so important.\n  We talk about the number of people uninsured--a very important \nnumber--46 million. But we do not talk about the number of people who \nevery day do not have access to a physician or a dentist on a regular \nbasis, and that number is close to 60 million. These are people who, \nwhen they get sick, cannot find a doctor. Where do they go?\n  Well, several things happen. They may end up going to the emergency \nroom, which is the most expensive form of primary health care we have--\nthat is where they go--or even worse, they do not go to any doctor at \nall. What happens is, they get sicker and sicker. Then they go \nstumbling into a doctor's office, and the doctor says: Why didn't you \ncome in here 6 months ago?\n  And the person says: I don't have any health insurance. I couldn't \nafford it.\n  Then they go to the hospital, and we spend tens and tens of thousands \nof dollars treating somebody who is now suffering in a way they should \nnot be suffering, at greater expense to the system than should have \nbeen the case. Now, what sense does that make?\n  Let me tell you the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is, \nthey walk into the doctor's office, and the doctor says: It is too \nlate. I can't help you anymore. You should have been in here 6 months \nago. I have talked to physicians who have told me about that. I suspect \nthe Presiding Officer has as well. That is why this year we are going \nto see 45,000 of our fellow Americans die because they do not have \nhealth insurance, and they do not get to the doctor when they should.\n  Now, one of the advantages of the community health care program is \nthat it is an enormously cost-effective program. One study recently \nreported that $20 billion is wasted every year in this country in \nunnecessary and inappropriate use of hospital emergency rooms for \nnonemergency care. When you walk into an emergency room--I do not know \nabout West Virginia--but in Vermont it is about $600. If you get that \nsimilar care for a nonemergency-type ailment, the cost is $100. So \nthink about all of the money we save--we save--when we have community \nhealth centers expanding all over the country.\n  One of the issues we have not focused on enough, in my view, in this \nwhole health care debate is the very serious crisis in primary health \ncare in general. The American College of Physicians, in a recent \nreport, warned that the Nation's primary care workforce--which it \ncalled ``the backbone of our health care system''--is, in its own \nwords, ``on the verge of collapse.'' That is the American College of \nPhysicians.\n  Over the past 8 years, for example, the number of family practice \nresidents fell 22 percent, while the overall number of medical \nresidents rose 10 percent. Currently--this is an extraordinarily \nfrightening statistic--only 2 percent of medical students interested in \ninternal medicine intend to pursue primary care as their specialty--2 \npercent.\n  This growing crisis was recently underscored in a report by the \nAssociation of Academic Health Centers, which warned that the country \nis rapidly running ``out of time to address what is out of order in our \nhealth workforce.''\n  The good news is that 20 million of those people who live in \nmedically underserved areas are fortunate to live where there are \nfederally qualified community health centers.\n  Let me explain a bit. What is a federally qualified health center--\nwhich exists in all of our 50 States? It is a center which says: If you \nhave no health insurance, you can walk in and do you know what. You \nwill pay not only for primary health care but for dental care--which is \na huge problem all over this country--for mental health counseling, and \nyou will get the lowest cost prescription drugs available in America. \nAnd if you do not have any health insurance, you get it on a sliding-\nscale basis. If you have Medicaid, you are welcome into the center. If \nyou have Medicare, you are welcome. If you have private health \ninsurance, you are welcome into these centers. Currently, these centers \nserve 20 million Americans in all of our 50 States.\n  Conceived in 1965 as a bold, new experiment in the delivery of \npreventive and primary health care services to our Nation's most \nvulnerable people and communities, community health centers are an \nenduring model of primary care for the country and are designed to \nempower communities to create locally tailored solutions that improve \naccess to care and the health of those they serve.\n  West Virginia centers will be different than Vermont centers, which \nwill be different than California centers because they are designed and \nlocally controlled to serve the needs of the local population.\n  By mission and mandate, community health centers must see all those \nwho seek their care regardless of health status, income level, or \ninsurance status. If you are rich, if you are poor, you will gain \naccess to these community centers. Nobody is tossed away. Today, these \nhealth centers are America's health care home to one out of every four \nlow-income uninsured individuals, one out of every six rural Americans, \nas well as one out of every seven Medicaid beneficiaries, and one in \nfour low-income people of color. We need to guarantee that as we expand \ncoverage, we expand community health centers as well. They are the one \nprimary care provider who will see those on Medicaid without \nrestrictions.\n  Furthermore, community health centers already employ so many of the \nfeatures of what we seek in the medical home model. They provide \nintegrated health care, which is what we are talking about.\n  A study recently by George Washington University--we are talking \nabout spending money. What is so exciting about this whole concept is \nyou are going to create more health care opportunities for people, and \nyou save money--save money--by keeping them out of the emergency room \nand out of the hospital. A study by George Washington University found \nthat patients using health centers have annual overall medical care \ncosts that are more than $1,000 lower than those who do not use a \nhealth center--$1,000. That translated to more than $24 billion in \nsavings for the health care system last year alone.\n  We are keeping people out of the emergency room, we are keeping \npeople out of hospitals, and we are keeping them from getting sicker \nthan they otherwise would be. That is why I am so pleased Majority \nLeader Reid has looked at this track record and concurred that we will \nguarantee--guarantee--funding of health centers over the next 5 years \nin order to provide health care to more people and to save money at the \nsame time.\n  Let me tell you in concrete terms what $14 billion--the amount of \nmoney that is in the House bill--will mean to the American people. What \nit will do is it will increase the number of people who have access to \ncommunity health centers, from the current 20 million to 45 million \nover a 5-year period--20 million to 45 million. We are more than \ndoubling the number of people who will be able to walk into a clinic \nfor health care, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs, primary \nhealth care--in 5 years going from 20 million to 45 million people.\n  This funding would create new or expanded health centers in an \nadditional 10,000 communities--10,000 communities--from one end of our \ncountry to the other. In some cases, entirely new federally qualified \nhealth centers would be established. In other cases, new satellite \ncenters would be created. In Vermont, for example, we have eight \ncommunity health centers. We have 40 total sites. That is true all over \nthis country.\n  But can you imagine, Mr. President, that in the United States of \nAmerica, within a 5-year period, 10,000 new community health centers in \nthis country\n\n[[Page S13655]]\n\nwould be established? People would not have to go 50 or 100 miles to \nfind access to health care. It would be there in their own community. \nIt would be in urban areas, in rural areas. This is extraordinary.\n  Now, these community health centers and the growth of these community \nhealth centers do not mean much unless we have the medical personnel to \nadequately staff them.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, everybody concludes we have a real \ncrisis in terms of access to primary health care in this country and \nthe number of physicians and dentists and nurses who serve in the \nprimary care area. What this language does, that we have just added, is \nit would--if we adopt the House numbers--triple funding in a 5-year \nperiod for the National Health Service Corps, which provides loan \nrepayments and scholarships to medical students.\n  For the University of Vermont Medical School, if my memory is \ncorrect--this is fairly typical for America--the average medical school \nstudent graduates with $150,000 of debt. Well, if you graduate with \n$150,000 of debt, what are you going to do? You are not going to do \nprimary health care. You are going to go into some fancy specialty and \nstart making a whole lot of money to pay off that debt. But what the \nNational Health Service Corps will be able to do is provide debt \nforgiveness and scholarships for an additional 20,000--an additional \n20,000--primary care doctors, dentists, and nurses. That is a lot of \nnew medical personnel that is going to get out into underserved areas \nall over America. That is a very exciting thought.\n  In short, when we more than double, in 5 years, the number of people \nwho have access to community health centers, and within that same \nperiod of time we add an additional 20,000 primary health care doctors, \ndentists, and nurses, we are talking about nothing less than a \nrevolution in primary health care in America--something which we have \nneeded for a long time.\n  So let me conclude by saying: I want to again thank the majority \nleader, Senator Reid. I want to thank Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Murray, and thank the Presiding Officer and the Democratic \nleadership for their support of this concept. As you know, this idea \nwas developed back in the 1960s with Senator Ted Kennedy, who developed \nthis concept in the first place. It has expanded, and now we are going \nto take it a giant step forward and, in the process, I think we are \ngoing to make a difference--a real difference--in improving the lives \nand the well-being and the access to health care of tens of millions of \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much. With that, I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would call to the attention of the \nleadership of the majority party that I have a unanimous consent \nrequest I wish to make. I am going to be visiting with my colleagues \nabout the issue of taxes on medical devices, so my unanimous consent is \nin regard to that. I hope people would observe that if there is an \neffort to block this motion I am going to make, I think it is an \nendorsement of the tax on medical devices such as the Berlin heart and \nhundreds of others that children across this country rely on.\n  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment in order to offer my motion to commit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. With regret, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is disappointing for those of us on \nthis side of the aisle to not be permitted to offer an amendment or \nmotion that is as important as this, so I will go ahead with my \nremarks.\n  This is another major problem in the Reid bill. Of the many taxes in \nthis bill, I am especially worried about the excise tax on medical \ndevices. Medical device technology is responsible for saving many lives \nand extending the overall life expectancy of people in the United \nStates.\n  In the United States, over 6,000 companies are in the business of \ndeveloping lifesaving medical products. The majority of these companies \nare very small businesses. Small business we tend to measure around \nhere as being those with less than 500 employees. So what will happen \nwhen the Reid amendment imposes a tax hike of $20 billion on these \ninnovative medical devices? I think that is something we ought to \nconsider if we are considering the quality of life in America and \nquality health care to preserve that life and extend life expectancy.\n  During the markup of the Finance Committee bill, I asked the question \nto the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan \nJoint Committee on Taxation--and let me emphasize the word \n``nonpartisan'' because these folks are professionals. So both of these \norganizations, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee \non Taxation, said these excise taxes will be passed on to consumers in \nthe form of higher prices and higher insurance premiums.\n  Also, I wish to emphasize on this chart a statement of the Chief \nActuary of the HHS. The Congressional Budget Office, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, and the Chief Actuary all say the tax gets \npassed on to consumers. Who are the consumers of these devices? Who is \ngoing to bear the cost of the new medical device excise tax? Well, it \nis quite a burden, so I am going to share some real-life stories here.\n  I will start by telling the story of the Tillman family, a family who \nwould bear the burden of this new medical device tax. At only 5 months \nold, Tiana Tillman had her life saved by a medical device. This story \nhas received a lot of attention because Tiana's father is a \nprofessional football player for the Chicago Bears. However, lifesaving \nstories such as this happen all across the country regularly.\n  When Charles Tillman reported to training camp in 2008, it wasn't \nlong before his coach told him that his 5-month-old daughter Tiana had \nbeen rushed to the hospital. When Charles got to the hospital, Tiana's \nheart rate was over 200 beats per minute. That doctor told Charles and \nhis wife Jackie that Tiana may not make it through the night. Tiana \nsurvived that night, and after a series of tests, she was diagnosed \nwith cardio myopathy, an enlarged heart that is unable to function \nproperly. Her condition was critical, and without a heart transplant \nshe would not survive. But finding pediatric donors is very difficult \nand many children do not survive the long wait time, so Tiana was \nimmediately put on an ECMO, a device that would help the function of \nthe heart while Tiana waited for a transplant.\n  However, ECMO is an old device that has many shortcomings. Infants \ncan only survive on ECMO for about 3 weeks, much shorter than the \naverage wait for a donor heart. ECMO also requires that the patient \ntake a paralytic medication which prevents a patient from moving and at \nthe same time that obviously weakens the body.\n  The Tillmans waited for one of two outcomes: Either Tiana would \nreceive a transplant or she would die waiting on ECMO.\n  But then the doctors told them about a new pediatric medical device \ncalled the Berlin heart. The Berlin heart is an external device that \nperforms the function of the heart and lungs. It is designed for a \nlong-term support to keep infants and young children alive for up to \n421 days while they wait for the donor heart--obviously a lot longer \nthan the 3 weeks on ECMO. So the Tillmans decided to move forward with \nthe Berlin heart.\n  After 13 days of being on ECMO without any movement, Tiana underwent \nsurgery to connect the Berlin heart. So we have pictures here that show \nwhat this is like. These two photos are of Tiana with the Berlin heart. \nYou can see that this device is run by a laptop at the foot of the \nhospital bed. It pumps the blood through her body, a job that her heart \ncould not perform on its own.\n  Unlike ECMO, the Berlin heart and its long-term support capabilities \nallowed the Tillmans some peace of mind while they waited for that \ndonor. The doctor said that the Berlin heart\n\n[[Page S13656]]\n\nhelped Tiana regain her strength because she was off the paralytic \nmedication and was finally able to move. Not long after Tiana was \nconnected to the Berlin heart, a donor was found and Tiana underwent an \n8-hour transplant surgery. The risky surgery was a success. Usually it \ntakes some time for the new heart to start working, but doctors said \nthat due to Tiana's strength, her new heart started working \nimmediately.\n  I wish to talk about the tax on devices such as this.\n  This picture shows Tiana today holding a football. That is Tiana \ntoday, and we shouldn't be surprised about her love for football, \nconsidering her father is a professional football player. She enjoys \nplaying on her swing set and watching her dad play football.\n  There are many people responsible for the successful effort to save \nTiana's life, but without the Berlin heart to keep her alive and help \nher to gain strength, they may not have had that opportunity.\n  What does this legislation have to do with this story about Tiana? \nWell, the Reid bill would increase costs for families such as the \nTillmans. In fact, the Reid bill would tax every pediatric medical \ndevice.\n  Pediatric devices aren't the only devices affected by the tax on \nmedical devices in the Reid bill. The Reid bill also taxes one of the \nmost important modern technologies: automatic external defibrillators. \nThe defibrillator is used to save people from sudden cardiac arrest, \nand that is the leading cause of death in this country. Each year, \nnearly 325,000 people die from sudden cardiac arrest. That is nearly \n1,000 deaths a day. Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart's \nelectrical system malfunctions and the heart stops beating abruptly and \nwithout warning. When this happens, the heart is no longer able to pump \nblood to the rest of the body, and for about 95 percent of the victims, \ndeath occurs. Once cardiac arrest occurs, the clock starts ticking and \nthe victim's proximity to a defibrillator could mean the difference \nbetween living and dying. As many as 30 to 50 percent of the victims \ncould survive if such a device is used within 5 minutes of sudden \ncardiac arrest.\n  Here we have the story then of Mari Ann Wearda. Mari Ann is a \nconstituent of the county I have lived my entire 76 years in, Butler \nCounty, IA. She is also a survivor of a sudden cardiac arrest, thanks \nto the prompt response of the Hampton Police Department and the \navailability of a defibrillator.\n  On July 26, 2002, Mari Ann pulled up to a stoplight in Hampton, IA. \nWithout any warning, Mari Ann experienced sudden cardiac arrest. As she \nslumped over the steering wheel, her car drifted across the road, \nclimbed the curb, knocked over a sign, and came to rest against a tree. \nShe was only minutes away from brain damage and death. At 11:38 a.m. \nthe police station dispatched Officer Chad Elness, who arrived at the \nscene 2 minutes later, at 11:40. When Officer Elness arrived, Mari Ann \nwas as blue as his uniform, according to his own report.\n  Officer Elness attached the defibrillator to Mari Ann and pushed the \nbutton, sending 200 joules of electricity through her heart. That was \none of the two shocks that Mari Ann required. Between the shocks, the \ndefibrillator prompted officer Elness to perform CPR. Twice he almost \nlost Mari Ann. But by 11:50 a.m., Mari Ann had a pulse and her color \nwas improving. At 11:52, just 11 minutes after the defibrillator was \nturned on, it had saved her life and was turned off.\n  Mari Ann then was taken by helicopter to Mercy Hospital, Mason City, \nIA, where she received care. One week later--just one week later--she \nwas back home with no permanent damage.\n  Defibrillators are only effective if they are used within minutes of \ncardiac arrest, which means that in order to save more lives, there \nneeds to be more of these devices. But do you know what this bill would \ndo about all that? It would increase the cost, meaning there would then \nbe fewer defibrillators.\n  We understand the laws of economics. If we increase a price, we get \nless of it. If we lower a price, we get more of it. So we are going to \nincrease the price of these devices. That would make it more difficult \nfor police departments, schools, libraries, churches, and other public \nplaces to purchase defibrillators, or for an individual to have one. If \nyou have to be within 5 minutes of their use, you can understand why \nthey have to be in every police department, school, library, church, \nand a lot of other places. Right now, only one-third of police \ndepartments are equipped with defibrillators. However, Mari Ann was \nlucky that the Hampton Police Department had already purchased the \ndevice.\n  Increasing the cost of defibrillators will make it more difficult for \ncommunities to make this lifesaving investment. We already have 62--\n62--defibrillator stations throughout the Capitol and the three Senate \noffice buildings. So you and I are protected, but we are going to put a \ntax on them for the people in the rest of the country. It seems as \nthough around here we have one set of morals and ethics for Capitol \nHill and another set of morals and ethics for the rest of the country. \nCongress clearly understands why having so many of these devices, the \nimportance of them and having them on hand to protect us and to protect \nour staffs and the million visitors who come to the Capitol.\n\n  I made a motion that was objected to, so I cannot go through with \nthat motion. My motion would have stopped this new Federal tax from \nincreasing the cost of defibrillators and hurting the chances of \nplacing the devices where they need to be--hopefully, within 5 minutes \nof people who need them. It is a disappointment my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle would not allow that motion to go through.\n  It is a sad state of affairs when the majority is not only blocking \nthe offering of the motions and amendments that will improve the bill \nbut also trying to ram through a bill before the American people even \nknow what is in it.\n  Yesterday, we heard things about Republicans having not offered \namendments. There are 214 Republican amendments at the desk. One would \nthink we would have a chance to offer more than a dozen or so--I doubt \nit is even a dozen at this point--on a bill that is going to \nrestructure one-sixth of the economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, may I ask, is it 10 minutes--what is \nthe procedural position as of now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority party controls the time until \n2:30 and there are no individual limits.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, for weeks we have been debating legislation that will \ndramatically and permanently reform our health care industry. It will \nimpact the life of every American, and it will add to our growing \nnational debt.\n  On Saturday, the majority leader filed an amendment increasing the \nsize of this bill. Early this morning at 1 a.m., we had a vote to \nproceed to the revised bill that makes a mockery of transparency and \npublic policy. Yet even though the majority took the opportunity to \namend the bill, it is clear the concerns of the American people were \nnot heard by my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  I was astounded to see this revised bill still contains $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in new taxes, $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts and mandates \nand penalties on individuals and businesses throughout our country at a \ntime when businesses are struggling, unemployment is up, and families \nare trying to make ends meet.\n  I wish to talk about the taxes. The revised bill has an additional \n$25 billion in taxes than the bill as introduced. We have been hearing \nfor weeks about families who are struggling to pay their mortgage, \nstruggling to find a job, struggling to pay their utility bills. Yet \nwhat do we find in this new bill? More taxes and more mandates.\n  The American people overwhelmingly oppose this bill, and just when we \nthought the final product could not get any worse, it does.\n  Under the revised bill, the taxes collected from individuals who \ncannot afford health insurance has been raised from $8 billion to $15 \nbillion--almost double. Why? Because the penalty for not purchasing \ninsurance has become more severe. If you cannot afford insurance, the \ntax is either $750 or 2 percent of your taxable income, whichever is \nhigher.\n  There are still taxes that begin next month, less than 2 weeks from \nnow.\n\n[[Page S13657]]\n\nLess than 2 weeks from now in this bill, $22 billion in taxes on \nprescription drug companies will start, and the public can expect to \nsee higher prices for medicines.\n  In 2011, we see $60 billion in taxes on insurance companies except \nfor companies in two particular States. That does not seem fair. \nFortunately, the Constitution's equal protection clause may have \nsomething to say about this gross situation. This will not stand the \ntest of the Constitution, I hope, because the deals that have been made \nto get votes from specific Senators cannot be considered equal \nprotection under the law.\n  If it does stand and the taxes start in 2011, people who have \ninsurance are going to pay higher premiums--even higher than what has \nbeen projected already.\n  In 2011, we also see the taxes on medical device manufacturers. So \nthe public can expect to see higher prices for devices--thermometers, \nblood sugar machines, canes, walkers--the things people need to stay \nhealthy. That is another $19 billion in taxes.\n  Then there is another round of taxes in 2013: $149 billion in taxes \non high-benefit plans; a 40-percent excise tax on the amount by which \npremiums exceed $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families; $87 \nbillion collected from a Medicare payroll tax. This tax is actually $33 \nbillion higher than in the prior bill. Individuals earning more than \n$200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000 are now assessed at a \ntax rate of 2.35 percent for a new Medicare payroll tax rather than \n1.45 percent. So if you are a couple earning $125,000 each, you have \nanother tax increase, in addition to possibly a tax on not having \ninsurance or a high-benefit plan.\n  Also, $15 billion will be collected by raising the threshold for the \nmedical deduction. To receive the medical deduction, you must now spend \n10 percent of your income on medical expenses rather than 7.5 percent. \nThis tax will impact those who have high medical costs or are suffering \nfrom a catastrophic or chronic illness.\n  This bill taxes those who have insurance and those who do not. All \nthese taxes are collected. All the taxes I have mentioned will be \ncollected before there would be the option that is the purpose of this \nbill. Whatever the insurance option becomes, it takes effect in 2014. \nAll the taxes I have mentioned start before 2014.\n  Senator Thune and I had a motion that would have sent this bill back \nto the committee and required that everything in this bill start at the \nsame time. So if the program starts in 2014, the taxes would start in \n2014. Under our motion, not one dime in taxes would be paid before \nAmericans are offered the insurance option in the bill. The motion was \ndefeated. Now the Democrats have revised their bill and the taxes \ncollected are even higher than the previous bill.\n  But do not forget the penalties to businesses that cannot afford to \noffer health insurance to their employees. A tax of $750 per employee \nis assessed. This at a time when unemployment has reached double \ndigits. We should be encouraging employers to hire new workers. Yet \nthis bill imposes $28 billion in new taxes on employers.\n  What will these taxes do to small businesses which create 70 percent \nof the new jobs in our country? In a letter sent to the majority \nleader, the Small Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care stated:\n\n       With its new taxes, mandates, growth in government programs \n     and overall price tag, the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act--\n\n  The bill we are discussing--\n\n     costs too much and delivers too little. . . . Any potential \n     savings from those reforms are more than outweighed by the \n     new taxes, new mandates and expensive new government programs \n     included in this bill.\n\n  That letter is signed, in addition to the Small Business Coalition, \nby associations such as the Farm Bureau, Associated Builders and \nContractors, Associated General Contractors of America, the National \nAssociation of Homebuilders, the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe National Automobile Dealers Association, the National Retail \nFederation, and more.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, which is the voice \nof small business, sent a letter expressing their strong concerns over \nthis bill. It says:\n\n       The current bill does not do enough to reduce costs for \n     small business owners and their employees. Despite the \n     inclusion of insurance market reforms in the small-group and \n     individual marketplaces, the savings that may materialize are \n     too small for too few and the increase in premium costs are \n     too great for too many.\n\n  That is the tax situation. How about the $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare \ncuts? They are still there. They were in the first bill, and they are \nthere now.\n  There are $120 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, which we know \nreduces choices for seniors. In my State of Texas, over 500,000 \ncurrently enrolled enjoy the benefits of Medicare Advantage. That is in \nmy State alone. Millions across the country like Medicare Advantage, \nbut many seniors, without a doubt, are going to lose this option.\n  Oddly enough, once again, one of the points in the new bill is, there \nwas an opt-out for certain States on Medicare Advantage cuts. So some \nStates are going to have the Medicare Advantage cuts while other States \nwill not.\n  The individual fixes for certain States, presumably to get the votes \nof certain Senators, do not pass the test of transparency. If you put \nit in the nicest way, it does not pass the test for fairness, for due \nprocess and equal treatment under the law, and it certainly does not \npass the test for what is the right way for us to pass comprehensive \nreform legislation.\n  The other health care cuts in Medicare would be $186 billion in cuts \nto nursing homes, home health care, and hospice providers.\n  Then there are the cuts to hospitals, approximately $135 billion in \ncuts to hospitals. The Texas Hospital Association has estimated that \nhospitals in my State will suffer almost $10 billion in reduced \npayments.\n  I have a letter from the Texas Hospital Association that outlines \ntheir concerns with these cuts and this bill and they are very \nconcerned. Here is one of the quotes from their letter. The Texas \nHospital Association says:\n\n       With a significant reduction in payments, hospitals may be \n     forced to reduce medical services. [H]ospitals . . . may be \n     forced to close or merge with another hospital, or severely \n     reduce the services they provide to their community. \n     Essential services, such as maternity care, emergency \n     services, medical-surgical services or wellness programs may \n     be reduced or entirely eliminated.\n\n  I have talked with so many hospital administrators and people on \nhospital boards, and they are very concerned about the cuts in this \nbill because most of them are on very thin margins. They are \nstruggling, especially in our rural areas. They are very worried there \nare going to be shutdowns of hospitals throughout our State and \ncertainly our country.\n  Our aging population is growing, so cutting payments to providers who \ntreat those patients, whether it is in hospitals or health care \nproviders, does not seem to be a way to reform Medicare.\n  Cuts in Medicare, and especially the payments for treating low-income \nseniors, will disproportionately impact rural hospitals which are the \nsafety net for health care outside the metropolitan areas. The Texas \nOrganization of Rural and Community Hospitals, which represents 150 \nrural hospitals in Texas, said in a letter:\n\n       We also fear the Medicare cuts as proposed could \n     disproportionately hurt rural hospitals which are the health \n     care safety net for more than 2 million rural Texans. Because \n     of lower financial margins and higher percentage of Medicare \n     patients, rural hospitals will be impacted more than urban \n     hospitals by any reductions in reimbursement. These proposed \n     Medicare cuts could have a devastating effect . . . which \n     could lead to curtailing of certain services. And the closure \n     of some of these Texas hospitals is a very real possibility. \n     . . .\n\n  How could anyone support a reform bill that will result in seniors \nhaving to drive 30, 60, 90 miles and more to get the care they need--\ncare that was accessible in their own community before this bill took \neffect?\n  Mr. President, what we have is a bill heavy with tax hikes, Medicare \ncuts, and government intrusion. This bill is being forced through \nCongress the week of Christmas because everyone knows this is not the \nreform that Americans want. The polls are showing that. We all know \npolls can have margins of error, and maybe they are not completely \naccurate, but the trend in the polls is clear: It has gone from people \nthinking that health care reform is a good thing and supporting it, in \nthe majority, to going down now to the point where the trend is clear \nthe\n\n[[Page S13658]]\n\nAmerican people now do not support this bill, they would rather have \nnothing, according to the latest polls, and have Congress start all \nover and do what they hoped it would do, and that is bring down the \ncost of health care not have this be a big government increase in debt, \ncuts to Medicare, and increases on taxes to small business and \nfamilies, especially at this time in our country's economic period.\n  My Republican colleagues and I have tried to offer fiscally \nresponsible alternatives to reform, allowing small businesses to pool \ntogether, increase the size of their risk pools, which will bring \npremiums down. If you have an exchange it would be fine unless you have \nso many mandates, such as we see in this bill, that are going to cause \nthe prices to stay up and even go higher because of all the taxes on \nthe underlying companies that are providing the health care.\n  Creating an online marketplace free from mandates and government \ninterference where the public can easily compare and select insurance \nplans would be a Republican proposal, something that I think would be a \npoint at which we could start having health care reform that would be \ntruly effective for America, if you didn't have the mandates that would \ndrive up the cost.\n  Offering tax credits to individuals and families who purchase \ninsurance on their own, that is a bill that we have put forward. Five \nthousand dollars per family would cut the cost and make it affordable \nwithout any government intervention that would be necessary.\n  Of course, medical malpractice reform could take $54 billion out of \nthe cost of health care by stopping the frivolous lawsuits, or at least \nlimiting them. Yet Republicans were really not at the table. The bill \nwas written in a room, with no transparency, no C-SPAN cameras, and no \nRepublicans. We did not have input into this bill. That is why it is a \npartisan bill. That is why the vote last night--or this morning at 1 \na.m.--was completely, 100 percent partisan. Why would a Republican vote \nfor a bill that goes against every principle we have--higher taxes, \nhigher mandates, and cuts in Medicare--and in which we had not one \namendment pass? We offered amendments, but there were hundreds of \namendments left on the table that we were closed out of offering \nbecause of the rush to pass this bill before Christmas.\n  Mr. President, Americans asked for reform; they deserve it. This bill \nis not the reform Americans hoped to get from a Congress that should \nhave acted responsibly but did not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as my colleagues on this side of the \naisle, I voted against the Reid health care bill last night because it \ncuts $470 billion from Medicare to create a brand-new entitlement \nprogram that will cost approximately $2.5 trillion over the next 10 \nyears--a price we cannot afford. It increases premiums for American \nfamilies who currently have health insurance and who are struggling to \nmake ends meet during tough economic times. It increases taxes on small \nbusinesses and individuals, which is a terrible idea, particularly at a \ntime when our economy is struggling and our job creators are struggling \nto be able to keep people on their payroll and possibly expand their \npayroll and hire people back and bring down the unemployment rate.\n  I want to talk about the way this bill came to pass--at least the \ncloture vote this morning at 1 a.m.--and I want to talk about the \nprocess. I recall when Senator Obama was running for President, he \ntalked about wanting to change politics as usual in Washington, DC. But \nI have to tell you, the majority and this administration have, in many \nways, confirmed people's worst suspicions about Washington politics as \nusual. They have taken it to a new level--and not a higher level; it is \na lower level.\n  As a matter of fact, the bartering for votes for cloture, the special \nsweetheart deals with drug industries, with Senators, in order to get \nthe 60 votes last night, does nothing more than confirm the worst fears \nand cynicism the American people have about the way Washington works.\n  We know this bill is a direct result of many special deals with \nspecial interest groups and their lobbyists. We heard the President say \nwhen he campaigned that he wanted to have a transparent process; that \nthis would take place in front of C-SPAN and at a roundtable so people \ncould see who was making arguments on behalf of the drug companies and \nthe insurance companies. But that rhetoric conflicts with the reality, \nwhere the drug companies and the insurance companies and others were \nnegotiating behind closed doors for sweetheart deals that ultimately \nended up getting 60 votes.\n  So it turned out it was the Obama administration that cynically said \none thing during the campaign and then, when it came to actually \npassing legislation, did completely the opposite. This is tragic, in my \nview, Mr. President. The American people want to believe in their \ngovernment. They want to believe their elected leaders are trying to do \ntheir best on behalf of the American people. But this process confirms \ntheir worst suspicions. No wonder public opinion of Congress is in the \ntoilet.\n  Rather than listening to the American people, the creators of this \nbill started cutting deals with special interests first and cut those \ndeals early. The White House struck a deal with the pharmaceutical \nindustry, as you know, which produced in part, as the New York Times \nreported, about $150 million in television advertising supporting this \nbill. This deal got 24 Democrats when we were debating the issue of \ndrug reimportation to switch their votes from their previous position \nagainst drug reimportation earlier this month.\n  Notwithstanding all the rhetoric about insurance companies, basically \nthis is a sweetheart deal with insurance companies because insurance \ncompanies will get $476 billion of your tax dollars and my tax dollars \nto pay for the subsidies and the insurance provided in this bill.\n  The hospital industry cut a special deal that provided them an \nexemption from the payment advisory board. Then there were groups such \nas AARP that purport to serve seniors as a public interest but, as we \nknow, primarily pocket money as a result of the sale of insurance \npolicies--insurance policies that are going to be necessary because of \ncuts in Medicare Advantage for 11 million seniors, just to name one \nexample.\n  This bill was the result of backroom deals with specific Senators, \npersuading them to vote for cloture, which has caused some people on \nthe blogs and the Internet to call it ``Cash for Cloture.'' In order to \nget 60 votes for cloture, we know one of the first examples of that was \nthe so-called ``Louisiana purchase.'' Charles Krauthammer said it well:\n\n       Well, after watching Louisiana get $100 million in what \n     some have called ``The Louisiana Purchase,'' she ought to ask \n     for $500 million at least. And that's because Obama said he \n     would end business as usual in Washington. So it's a new kind \n     of business as usual.\n\n  In other words, I guess the price has gone up. But as one business \nleader in Louisiana points out, notwithstanding the special sweetheart \ndeal for the State of Louisiana directing $300 million to the State, \nthe Medicare expansion alone will result in the taxpayers and the \npeople of Louisiana being a net loser.\n  We also know in order to get 60 votes, the majority leader had to cut \na deal with a Senator from Nebraska--the senior Senator from Nebraska--\nin order to get the vote for cloture. It has been widely reported that \nthe meeting with the senior Senator from Nebraska took place for 13 \nhours behind closed doors, after which they negotiated some language \nwhich, purportedly, no longer allowed the use of tax dollars to pay for \nabortions. But according to the Conference of Catholic Bishops and \nother pro-life groups, the language is completely ineffectual and it \nrestores or actually produces taxpayer-paid-for abortions for the first \ntime in three decades.\n\n  What else did the senior Senator from Nebraska get? Well, the State \nof Nebraska purportedly got a free ride from Washington's new unfunded \nMedicare mandates on the States. But, of course, we know every other \nState ends up paying for that sweetheart deal the senior Senator got \nfor Nebraska. What do Nebraskans think about it? Well,\n\n[[Page S13659]]\n\nask the Governor--Governor Dave Heineman--who said yesterday he had \nnothing to do with that bill, and called the overall bill bad news for \nNebraska and bad news for Americans. Governor Heineman said Nebraskans \ndid not ask for a special deal, only a fair deal.\n  We also know that in order to get 60 votes, the majority leader had \nto cut a special deal for Vermont. One Senator from Vermont threatened \nto vote against the bill, but then, lo and behold, the managers' \npackage included $600 million benefiting only that one State. The \nSenator who threatened to vote no decided to vote yes after that \nspecial deal was concluded.\n  The New York Times lists several other sweetheart deals that produced \nthis monstrous piece of legislation. The intended beneficiaries, \nthough, in many instances, were identified in a vague and sort of \ncryptic way, such as: Individuals exposed to environmental health \nhazards recognized as a public health emergency in a declaration issued \nby the Federal Government on June 17. Well, there is only one State \nthat would qualify for that, notwithstanding this sort of vague \ndescription designed to hide the ball and obscure what was actually \nhappening through another sweetheart deal as part of this bill.\n  Another item in the package would increase Medicare payments to \ndoctors and hospitals in any States where at least 50 percent of the \ncounties are ``frontier counties,'' defined as those having a \npopulation density of less than six people per square mile.\n  Then we know there was another $100 million sweetheart deal for an \nunnamed health care facility affiliated with an academic health center \nat a public research university in a State where there is only one \npublic medical and dental school. The Associated Press reports that the \nState that qualifies for that special deal is the State of Connecticut, \nwhere the senior Senator currently is in a tough reelection fight.\n  When asked about these special deals in the managers' amendment, the \nresponse of Mr. Axelrod--the architect of the campaign strategy for \nthis administration to bring change to Washington--was pretty telling. \nHe said: That is the way it has been; that is the way it will always \nbe.\n  Well, maybe in Chicago, but not in my State, and not in the heartland \nand the vast expansion of this great country where the American people \nwant us to come and represent our constituents and vote for what is \nright in terms of policy, not what kind of sweetheart deals we can eke \nout at the expense of the rest of the American people.\n  The very thing that is happening with this health care bill \ndemonstrates why Washington takeovers are such a terrible idea because \ninstead of health care decisions being made between patients and \ndoctors, health care decisions are overcome through a political process \nwhere elected officials choose winners and losers.\n  Politics has become a dirty word outside the beltway, and certainly \nwe can understand why. This process has only reconfirmed in the minds \nof many people that what we are doing here is not the people's business \nbut protecting special interests and special sweetheart deals. Rather \nthan making decisions about what is best for the American people, this \ndeal has been driven by deals with special interest groups and \nlobbyists. Rather than listen to constituents, individual Senators have \ndecided that their votes should be traded for tax dollars and other \nsweetheart benefits that go to their States. No doubt about it, this \nbill takes the power from individual Americans to make their own health \ncare decisions and transfers that to Washington, DC, and this new low \nlevel of politics as usual.\n  According to one recent poll that was reported today, Rasmussen, for \none State I will not mention by name, found only 30 percent of the \nrespondents to this poll favor this health care bill and 64 percent are \nopposed. The Senators from those States voted for the bill where only \n30 percent of their constituents reportedly support the bill. That is \nnot the only example.\n  You can only ask yourself why in the world would Senators vote for a \nbill when two-thirds of their constituents are opposed to it. Who must \nthey be listening to? Are they listening to the people whom they \nrepresent and who sent them here to Washington to represent them or are \nthey listening to the special interests or have they decided somehow \nthat they have become miraculously smarter than their constituents and \nthey know what is better for their constituents than what their \nconstituents know themselves?\n  This debate is not over. There is still a chance to vote against this \nbill. As Senator McConnell said last night, any single Senator on the \nother side of the aisle can stop this bill or every one who votes for \nit will own it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, let me start my comments today by \ncomplimenting the Senator from Texas. I thought he did an excellent job \nof shining the light on something that is now gathering a lot of \nattention because the managers' amendment is out and we can read the \nwords and we can start to understand the special deals that were cut to \nget the votes to make this happen. I applaud the Senator for standing \nhere so courageously.\n  My State, the great State of Nebraska, has been pulled into the \ndebate. I want to start out today by saying here on this Senate floor \nthat I am enormously proud of my State, probably like all Senators in \nreference to their State. I am enormously proud of the people of \nNebraska. I have gotten to know them well. I was their Governor. On a \nmore localized basis, I was also the mayor of Lincoln. I date my time \nin public service back to the time when I was Lancaster County \ncommissioner and a city council member in Lincoln. These are good, \ndecent, honorable people who are always looking to try to figure out \nthe right way of doing things.\n  I stand here today to acknowledge that and to tell all Nebraskans how \nproud I am to be here today. But I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues the reactions of Nebraskans to the special deal that got cut \nfor Nebraska that came to light over the weekend as the managers' \namendment was released and analyzed.\n  Less than 24 hours after the announcement of the special carve-out \nfor Nebraska, with virtually no warning, no preparation to speak of, \n2,000 people gathered in Omaha, NE, Nebraskans who, in one voice, cried \nfoul. Nebraskans are frustrated and angry that our beloved State has \nbeen thrust into the same pot with all of the other special deals that \nget cut here. In fact, they are outraged that a backroom deal for our \nState might have been what puts this bill across the finish line.\n  You see, I fundamentally believe that if this health care bill is so \ngood, it should stand on its own merits. There should be no special \ndeals, no carve-outs for anyone in this health care bill--not for \nStates, not for insurance companies, and not for individual Senators.\n  I stand here today and I find it is enormously ironic that advocates \nfor this bill, who worked overtime to vilify insurance companies, in \nthe last hours of putting this bill together struck a special deal with \ntwo insurance companies in Omaha, NE, that they would be carved out of \ntheir responsibility in this bill to pay taxes. I find it painful to \neven acknowledge that happened.\n  I said at the beginning of this debate that changes of this \nmagnitude, affecting one-sixth of our economy, must be fair and they \nmust be believed to be fair by the people. The special deal for Nevada \nwas wrong. I said that. In fact, one of the six reform principles I \npublicly outlined and took out to townhall meetings I stand by today. \nIt simply said: No special deals.\n  The special deal for Nevada was wrong, as is the carve-out for \nLouisiana. And the same applies for the backroom deal that was struck \nfor my State, the great State of Nebraska.\n  All of the special deals should be removed from this legislation. If \nthis bill cannot pass without the carve-outs and the special deals, \nwhat further evidence could we possibly need to draw the conclusion \nthat this is enormously bad policy? If you literally had to sit down in \nthe last hours of negotiations and strike a special deal, do we need \nany other argument about how bad the policy of this bill is for my \nState and the citizens of Nebraska?\n  Our Governor said it well: Nebraskans don't want a special deal. You \nsee, I went around the State for\n\n[[Page S13660]]\n\nmonths doing townhalls and listening to Nebraskans. They do not want a \nspecial deal. No Nebraskan came up to me and said: Mike, give me a \nspecial deal. You see, their request is simple: They want to be able to \nsee the doctor of their choice and to keep the current plan they have. \nThey want our job creators, our small businesses, to get our economy \nmoving and create jobs in our communities from large to small, free of \nthe $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes and fees this bill will keep on our \nemployers.\n  The managers' amendment does nothing to change the core problems with \nthis bill. The nearly $500 billion in Medicare cuts will be devastating \nto Nebraska. No special deal with an insurance company is going to make \nNebraskans feel better about that. No special deal to make the State \nbudget look better is going to make Nebraskans feel any better about \nthe Medicare cuts and the impacts on our hospitals, our nursing homes, \nour home health care industry, and our hospice industry. Nationally, \nGovernors--Republicans and Democrats--have stepped forward to say they \ncannot afford the unfunded mandates that come from Washington and drive \ntheir budgets into the red.\n  The special deal struck on abortion is enormously tragic and \ninsufficient. It breaks my heart. This is a far cry from the 30 years \nof policy by this U.S. Government. You see, when this is done and over, \nwhat we will be reporting to our citizens is that taxpayer funds will \nfund abortions if this bill passes. You see, no watered-down accounting \ngimmick will convince the pro-life community in my State otherwise. In \nfact, they have publicly said they feel betrayed.\n  I will wrap up with this. This bad deal is not sealed. There is time \nfor truly pro-life Senators to stand tall and say no. There is still \ntime for principled Senators to reject the carve-outs and to cast aside \nthe bad backroom deals. There is still time for Senators to listen to \nthe people and reject reckless Federal policy.\n  Fair treatment is not too much to ask of Washington. I know in my \nState, that is what they are asking for. I will firmly stand behind any \nSenator who has the courage to stop this train wreck. I will be the \nfirst to lead the applause. I am confident that the standing ovation \nfor that courageous Senator will extend all the way back to Nebraska \nand it will be deafening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would think one of the things we would have seen from \nthe majority at this point is a list of what the last two Senators were \ntalking about, all the earmarks that are in this bill, because I asked \nfor a parliamentary inquiry yesterday--I am not going to ask that \nagain--but, as we said yesterday, rule XLIV was adopted as part of a \nmajor ethics and reform legislation, adopted in 2007. It was part of \nthe Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. The Democratic \nleadership made it the first bill to be introduced when they took the \nmajority in 2007, taking control of Congress for the first time for a \nlong period of time. This bill passed by unanimous consent.\n  When rule XLIV was passed, the theory behind it was that we ought to \nhave total transparency on earmarks. It applies to floor amendments \nsuch as the pending Reid bill. It requires the sponsor of the amendment \nto provide a list of earmarks in that amendment.\n  Earmarks are provisions that provide limited tax benefits. Those \nwords, ``limited tax benefits,'' are words out of the rule. Another \nsubstitute language for limited tax benefits is ``congressionally-\ndirected spending items'' or ``earmarks,'' as they are generally \nreferred to by the public at large.\n  Given what a priority the new rule passed in 2007 was given and the \nimportance of it, one would expect that the majority leader would be \nmaking every effort to comply with it. One would think he would be \nwanting to set a good example in complying with the rule and disclosing \nthese earmarks. In order to assure transparency of these very narrow \nprovisions, such as what Senator Johanns just referred to, to get the \nvotes of specific Members of the majority party who probably would not \nhave voted for this bill, you would think that ought to be made public. \nThat is what rule XLIV is about. Of course, that burden under that rule \nis on the sponsor to provide the list.\n  Once again, I am going to ask the Democratic leadership to comply \nwith the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the minority has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13660-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 20 minutes to the chairman of the HELP Committee, \nSenator Harkin, and 18 minutes to the Senator from Colorado, Senator \nBennet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I guess I can say we crossed the Rubicon \nlast night at 1 o'clock. Reading some of the press reports, of course, \nmost of the news didn't have it because it occurred at 1 a.m. Some of \nthe different reports have been online this morning. It occurred to me \nthat a lot of people are missing the overall importance of what \nhappened last night. We can get into the fine tuning and the nitpicking \nand sort of the fear and the anger I hear from the other side. Every \ntime I listen to speeches over there, with the exception of the last \nspeaker, almost all the speeches I hear from the other side, it is \nfear, be afraid, be afraid. It is some built-up anger over there. I \nthink what happened last night is, we crossed a demarcation line, the \ndemarcation line of which on one side health care is a privilege. We \nhave been on that side of the line for a long time. On the other side \nof that line, health care is a right. We stepped across that line last \nnight. We are now in the process of saying health care is a right, an \ninalienable right of every American citizen.\n  Is that what so upsets my friends on the Republican side? I don't \nknow. Something is upsetting them. Because this is a momentous change \nwe are doing.\n  I keep hearing from Republicans they want us to deal in a bipartisan \nway. We tried all this year, both in the HELP Committee and in the \nFinance Committee. Senator Baucus bent over backward to accommodate. \nBut at every turn, Republicans said no, no, no, no, no--all year long. \nHow can you be bipartisan when the other side has nothing to offer? \nThere is no bill on the Republican side. There is a bill. It has about \nnine cosponsors--Senator Coburn, Senator Burr, maybe seven others, but \nnot every Republican is on that. I hear bits and pieces of this and \nthat every time I hear these speeches. Most of it is attacking what we \nhave done. I hear nothing positive from their side. It is very hard to \ndeal with a party that is in total disarray as the Republicans are. If \nthey had a bill they were supporting and that was supported by all of \nthem, such as the bill we have here which is supported by 60 Democrats, \nI think then you could find some reason for meeting and working things \nout. But since there is no one on that side who has a comprehensive \nproposal, it is hard to do that. We have had to kind of plow ahead as \nbest we can. We have not done this alone. In our committee, we met for \n13 days. We had 54 hours of markup. No amendment was denied. \nRepublicans offered over 200 amendments. We adopted 161 of them. That \nis pretty good. Yet in the end, every Republican voted against it. So \nit is not as if we didn't try and we didn't hold out an olive branch to \nwork with people to get a bill that was truly bipartisan. We did in our \ncommittees, both the Finance and HELP Committees. Now it has come down \nto fear and anger on the other side and some nitpicking.\n  My friend from Iowa--and he is truly my friend--was talking about \nsome provisions put in the bill for special reasons and so forth. I \nadmit fully and openly that I was part of that. Did I put something in \nthe bill that was sort of particular to my State of Iowa? Yes, I did. \nBut it doesn't just affect Iowa. There are several States in which we \nhave hospitals that are not as big as the big hospitals with the \nvolume. They are not so small that they are low-volume hospitals that \nget help. They are kind of in between. They call them tweener \nhospitals. We have eight of them in Iowa: at Grinnell, Keokuck, Spencer \nMunicipal, in Carroll, St. Anthony Regional; Muscatine; Fort Madison; \nand Lake Regional Hospital at Spirit Lake. There are a number of these \nin the United States. I forget the total number; not a large number, \nthey just fall in a place where they are too small for the big and too \nbig for the small. As a result, they have been getting a bad deal from \nMedicare reimbursement. There is a fix in this bill that will allow \nthem to get adequate reimbursement. I don't see anything wrong with \nthat. It is fixing a specific problem that the bureaucracy can't seem \nto quite get fixed. That is in the bill. I make no bones about having \nput that in there. I think it is a good deal. It is something that is \ngoing to help a lot of hospitals, not only in Iowa but a few other \nStates.\n  One of the things I wish to talk about today is something I have been \non for many years, and that is the huge amount in this bill on \nprevention and wellness. It has not been written about a lot. People \nhave been focused on the public option and the abortion issue and a few \nother items such as that. Perhaps one of the most profound parts of \nthis bill and the one I believe will do more to bend the cost curve, as \nthey say, than any other single thing is the provisions dealing with \nprevention and wellness. In the past I have said many times that we \ndon't have a health care system in America. We have a sick care system. \nWhen you think about it, if you get sick, you get care. But precious \nlittle is spent out there to keep one healthy in the first place. So \npeople get sick. You go to the doctor, the hospital. We patch and fix \nand mend and try to make them well.\n  Your mother was right, you know: Prevention is worth a pound of cure. \nWe have fallen far short of that in this country. There is a remarkable \narray of provisions in this bill that promote wellness, disease \nprevention, and public health. Together they will move us from a sick \ncare society into a genuine wellness society, into a true health care \nsystem, not just sick care. What better way to reform our health care \nsystem than to restrain health care costs by helping Americans to \nprevent chronic diseases, stay healthy and out of the hospital in the \nfirst place. Right now, as we have heard so many times, we spend more \nthan $2 trillion each year on sick care. But 4 cents of every dollar is \ninvested in prevention and public health. I submit this is a major \nreason why Americans spend twice as much per capita on health care as \nEuropean countries, but we are twice as sick with chronic disease. We \nspend twice as much as Europe on health care, but we are twice as sick \nwith chronic diseases.\n  The good news is that by ramping up the emphasis on wellness and \nprevention, we have tremendous opportunities to both improve the health \nof the American people and to restrain health care spending. That is \nthe aim of this bill which makes significant new investments in \nprevention. For example, our bill would ensure that seniors have access \nto free annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans under \nMedicare. We have never had that. For the first time seniors will have \naccess to free annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans \nunder Medicare. That is a big deal. So many seniors today, if they get \nsick, go to the doctor and get more pills. Now they will be able to go \nin, have their annualized checkup, see what is wrong, and have a \npersonalized prevention plan for each person under Medicare.\n  It will also encourage States to improve coverage and access to \nrecommended preventative services and immunizations under Medicaid. At \na minimum, States will provide Medicaid coverage for comprehensive \ntobacco cessation services for pregnant women. That is just the start. \nRight away, at a minimum, they have to do that. In addition, the bill \nrequires insurance companies to cover recommended preventive services \nwith no copayments or deductibles. This is critical because we know \nthat all too often people forgo their yearly checkups or essential \nscreenings because either their insurance companies don't cover them or \nbecause they have high copays and deductibles.\n  Another critical element in the bill essential to a sustainable push \nfor wellness is the creation of a prevention and public health trust \nfund. Typically prevention and public health initiatives are subject to \nunpredictable and unstable funding. This means that important \ninterventions, things such as education about nutrition and assistance \nfor smokers who want to quit,\n\n[[Page S13662]]\n\noften go unfunded from one year to the next. They get funded a little \nbit one year or cut the next; funded a little bit the next year, cut \nthe next. The prevention and public health fund in this bill will \nprovide an expanded and sustained national investment in programs that \npromote physical activity, improve nutrition, and reduce tobacco use. \nWe all appreciate that checkups and immunizations and other clinical \nservices are important. But this bill also recognizes that where \nAmericans live and work and go to school also has a profound impact on \nour health. That is why a number of provisions in the bill focus on \ncreating healthier communities with better access to nutritious foods \nas well as safe places to engage in physical activity.\n  A 2007 study by the Trust for America's Health found major savings \nfrom community-based prevention programs designed to increase levels of \nphysical activity, improve nutrition, and reduce smoking rates. This \nstudy concluded that a national investment of $10 per person per year \nin these kinds of community-based programs could yield net savings of \nmore than $2.8 billion annually in health care costs in the first 1 and \n2 years, more than $16 billion savings within 5 years, and nearly $18 \nbillion savings annually within 10 to 20 years, starting at $10 per \nperson per year.\n  More generally, this bill aims to give Americans the tools and \ninformation they need to take charge of their own health. For example, \nit requires large chain restaurants to post basic nutrition information \non the menu so consumers can make healthy choices. That is in this \nbill. It will start next year.\n  The bill also focuses on prevention and public health needs of a \nnumber of generally overlooked populations, including children, \nindividuals with disabilities, Americans living in rural communities, \nand certain ethnic minorities. For many months I have made the case \nthat it is not enough to talk about how to expand insurance coverage, \nhow to pay the bills--those are important--but it makes no sense to \nfigure out a better way to pay the bills for a system that is \ndysfunctional, ineffective, and broken.\n  We have to change the health care system itself, beginning with a \nsharp new emphasis on prevention and public health. We also have to \nrealize that wellness and prevention must be truly comprehensive. It is \nnot only about what just goes on in the doctor's office; it also \nencompasses community-wide wellness programs, about which I just spoke, \nthings such as building bike paths, walking trails, getting junk food \nout of our schools, out of the vending machines, making our school \nbreakfasts and lunches more nutritious, increasing the amount of \nphysical activity our children get, and so much more.\n  Some of this is going to be addressed in other bills. For example, \nnext year, in the Agriculture Committee, we will be reauthorizing the \nchild nutrition bill. That deals with school lunches and school \nbreakfasts. We need a major effort there to make our lunches and our \nbreakfasts more nutritious for our kids in school.\n  Next year, in the committee I chair, the HELP Committee, we are going \nto reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the so-\ncalled No Child Left Behind Act. There are a lot of things we are going \nto be doing on that. I see one of our committee members, the Senator \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Bennet, in the Chamber, a former superintendent of \nschools, who is going to play a key role in helping get that Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act through and refined and brought up to date \nwhere we will make some changes.\n  But there is one other part of that bill we have to focus on; that \nis, the amount of physical activity kids get in school. I talked many \ntimes both to Secretary Duncan and, before him, to Secretary Spellings \nabout this idea of No Child Left Behind. If we are not going to leave \nkids behind in terms of their writing and their math and their English, \nhow about not leaving them behind in terms of their health? Yet recess \nis gone. I saw a statistic this year that said 80 percent of elementary \nschool kids in America today get less than 1 hour of physical exercise \na week in school--80 percent get less than 1 hour a week.\n  Mr. President, I do not know about you, but I remember when I was in \nschool, in elementary school, we had an hour a day for recess. We had \n15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes in the afternoon, and a half hour \nat lunch. So there was 1 hour every day, and we had to go out and do \nstuff. We couldn't sit around and play with Game Boys and things like \nthat. So we got an hour a day of physical exercise. Well, we need to \nreinvigorate our schools to make sure they get that physical exercise.\n  So we have done a lot in this bill to move this paradigm toward a \nhealth care society rather than a sick care society. There is more to \ndo, as I said, in both the Education bill next year and in the \nAgriculture Committee in terms of the child nutrition reauthorization. \nBut in this bill we have made a great start. We have laid a great \nfoundation. I am just thrilled so many of the wellness and prevention \ninitiatives I have championed for so many years are included in this \nbill.\n  As I look forward to going to conference, we look forward to working \nwith the House to strengthen it even more and to put more emphasis on \nwellness and prevention.\n  Just about an hour ago or so, we had a press conference with the \npresident-elect of the American Medical Association, Dr. Wilson. I am \nproud of the fact that the American Medical Association has now \nendorsed our bill. As I said at the time, I said the doctors of America \nhave examined this bill, and they have made the right prescription: \nPass it. Pass the health care reform bill.\n  But Dr. Wilson, in his statement, made particular note of the \nwellness and prevention programs we have in this bill. He did not say \nthis, but I was thinking, when he was talking, that it made sense. \nDoctors want to keep people healthy. They do not want to see people go \nto the hospital. They would rather be working with their patients one \non one. How can they structure a patient's profile so the patient stays \nhealthy, does not get sick so often? That is what Dr. Wilson was \ntalking about: letting doctors practice medicine in a way that focuses \non a person's health and keeping them healthy.\n  As President Obama said in his speech to Congress early this year:\n\n       [It is time] to make the largest investment ever in \n     preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep \n     our people healthy and our costs under control.\n\n  That was the President of the United States in his State of the Union \nmessage. Well, President Obama has it right. It is one of the best ways \nto keep our people healthy and our costs under control, and that is a \nbig part of this bill. I do not know--I have not listened to every \nspeech made by the Republicans on the other side--but I hardly ever \nhear them talk about this, but it is a very important part of the bill.\n  So, Mr. President, we are changing the paradigm. We are going to \nextend quality, affordable health coverage to nearly every American. We \nare going to transform ourselves into a genuine wellness society, and \nwe are going to give our citizens access to a 21st-century health care \nsystem, one that is focused on helping us to live healthy, active, and \nhappy lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to first thank the Senator \nfrom Iowa for his leadership over many years, especially on prevention \nand wellness, and to see so much of this bill devoted to that is a real \ntestament to his efforts. So I thank the Senator for that.\n  Mr. President, a number of years ago, I left a rewarding job in \nbusiness because I had a chance to lend a hand to my community during a \nvery difficult time in Denver. The economy was slow and the city was \nfacing a record budget deficit. Our great mayor, John Hickenlooper, \nasked me to come be his chief of staff. It was not a glamorous job, but \nit was rewarding because we got results--not by seeking out what \ndivided the people of Denver, who were going through a very rough time, \nbut by reaching out time and time again to what the mayor called ``our \nalignment of self-interest.''\n  We fixed the city's budget, and then I had the chance of a lifetime \nto become the superintendent of public schools and serve our children \nand the people who work so hard every day to support them. I came away \nfrom that experience believing that much of the Republican and \nDemocratic ortho-\n\n[[Page S13663]]\n\ndoxies relating to public education are essentially useless to our \nchildren--and maybe worse--and that Washington as a whole has \nabsolutely no clue about what is going on in America's classrooms.\n  So it is fair to say I did not come to Washington with a partisan ax \nto grind. As is probably obvious to everyone around here--for good or \nfor ill--I am not a career politician. I did not come here to win \npolitical points so that someone else could lose. I am not interested \nin that. I am here as the father of three little girls with an abiding \nconcern we are at risk of being the first generation of Americans to \nleave less opportunity to our kids and our grandkids than our parents \nand grandparents left us. That prospect is shameful.\n  We are not the only Americans who have been working weekends and late \ninto the night recently. There are people in small towns and big cities \nall across America doing jobs much harder than ours, who are taking an \nextra shift before Christmas so they can afford that extra gift beneath \nthe tree--Americans who are unemployed in this savage economy and still \ntrying to make sure the kids know Santa remembered them.\n  These same people are reading their papers and watching their \ntelevisions wondering what in the world we are doing here in \nWashington. All they see are talking heads yelling at each other on \ncable news, needless partisanship paralyzing their government, and even \npeople praying that Senators will not be able to make votes.\n  I am not naive about politics, but I expected more. I will vote for \nhealth care reform because it is a step in the right direction. But I \nwill not go home and defend the actions of a Washington that is out of \ntouch, a Washington that is more interested in scoring political \npoints, more interested in the 278 health care lobbyists who used to \nwork for Members of Congress than it is in what our constituents have \nto say, a Washington that is more concerned with the millions being \nspent by big insurance companies than the thousands of dollars being \nlost by working families who are struggling to pay for coverage.\n  Columnists opposed to reform have criticized me for saying that I am \nwilling to lose my seat to enact meaningful health care reform. Now I \nam being asked why I did not negotiate a special deal with leadership. \nIn fact, there was a report this morning criticizing me because the \nNational Republican Senatorial Committee was rejoicing that I did not \nask for special favors. Only in Washington would someone be attacked \nfor not negotiating a backroom deal. Just because others choose to \nengage in the same tired Washington rituals does not mean I have to.\n\n  So I have a message for the columnists, the political professionals, \nand those back home: I am not happy about the backroom deals. I am not \nhappy that the public option was held hostage by people in our own \nparty. I do not support rewarding delay with special deals. I will let \nothers justify their vote and their tactics.\n  As for me, I am voting to provide coverage to 840,000 uninsured \nColoradans, voting to extend Medicare for our seniors and provide free \npreventive care for everyone, voting to close the prescription drug \nloophole and provide tax cuts to small business, voting to make health \ncare more affordable and eliminate exclusions based on preexisting \nconditions, voting for health care reform that is fully paid for.\n  The people in my State and in our country deserve better than a \npolitics that cares more about lobbyists and talk show hosts than the \npeople we represent. I am committed to delivering on that despite what \nthe political experts have to say. And, in the end, when the dust \nsettles and the stories focus more on substance and process, I am \nconfident Coloradans will see it the same way.\n  I also commit to the people of Colorado and the people of this \nChamber that I will do everything I can to make sure this bill is fully \npaid for. That is why I submitted an amendment that will ensure that \nhealth care will help pay down the deficit by forcing Congress to make \nadjustments if reform does not meet the cost estimates we have \nprojected.\n  I urge my colleagues and the leadership in the Senate to see to it \nthat this amendment is included in the conference report. If not, I \nwill fight to get it passed on its own. I believe so strongly in this \nbecause everyone here knows that keeping things the way they are is no \nlonger acceptable.\n  When I first started in the Senate, 800,000 Coloradans were without \nhealth insurance. That number has grown by 40,000 in the months we have \ndebated this bill. On average, 111 Coloradans have lost their health \ninsurance every single day. This number will only get worse if we do \nnothing. Our State has spent $600 million in the last year alone on \nuncompensated care.\n  Colorado's working families suffered double-digit health insurance \ncost increases year after year for the last decade. Many families have \nmade terrible sacrifices--no longer investing in their children's \nfutures, saving for a home, or carrying crushing credit card balances--\nall to pay for health care.\n  Small businesses pay 20 percent more for health insurance than large \nbusinesses do just because they are small.\n  I think back to the Coloradans who shared their stories with me \nduring this debate.\n  I remember Bob and Deb Montoya of Pueblo. They were torn between \nproviding health care for their small business employees and keeping \ntheir business afloat. Last year, their business paid out $36,000 to \ncover two families and one employee. They could not afford to give \ntheir other 12 employees health care or they would be literally forced \nout of business. So they dropped coverage for the 12 employees to keep \ntheir doors open.\n  Hollis Berendt owns a small business in Greeley and told me about her \ndaughter Abby who graduated from Colorado State University in 2004 and \nfound a job in New York with a large company. Her daughter's company \nmade her wait a year before she was eligible for health insurance, and \nduring that time Abby was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Hollis took \nout a second mortgage to pay for her daughter's bills and told me:\n\n       This experience brought to light, all too clearly, how \n     close we all are to losing everything due to a health issue.\n\n  I have spoken here before about a young boy named Alex Lange. Alex's \nparents' insurance company refused to cover Alex because he was 4 \nmonths old and 17 pounds. They said he had a preexisting condition, at \n4 months, of obesity.\n  Then there was 2-year-old Aislin Bates, whose parents' insurance \ncompany denied her coverage because she was underweight. One child too \nbig, the other too small. Today in America, you have to be just right \nto get insurance.\n  There was Peggy Robertson of Golden, CO, who was told she could not \nreceive coverage unless she was sterilized, Mr. President. She came and \nbravely testified in Washington about the need for reform. There was \nMatthew Temme of Castle Rock, who could not receive coverage because \nhis wife was pregnant, even though she had her own health insurance.\n  The sad thing is, there is nothing unusual about these stories. None \nof these people were trying to cheat or game the system. They were \ntrying to gain some peace of mind, some stability in their lives and, \ninstead, they wasted weeks of their lives fighting against insurance \ncompany bureaucracy and mounting bills.\n  We have debated health care reform for over a year. Some have been \nworking on these issues for decades. Killing health care reform under \nthe disguise of starting over is not an option. We cannot wait until \nafter the next election. We cannot wait until our economy recovers or \nuntil we have come home from Afghanistan to deal with our broken health \ncare system.\n  Now standing so close to the finish line, it is completely \nunderstandable that some Americans doubt whether this bill will improve \ntheir situation. They understand we cannot live with the current \nsystem. But they are also deeply concerned about our capacity to make \nit worse.\n\n  The special interests are using tried-and-true tactics that have been \nemployed over and over across the decades to prevent reform: phone \ncalls to scare seniors, direct mail to scare those already covered, \ntelevision ads to scare just about everyone else, and opponents of this \nreform in this body are trying every delay tactic permitted by the \nSenate rules.\n\n[[Page S13664]]\n\n  Amidst all this, there is still a reason to hope. After almost a \ncentury of trying, the Senate is very close to finally passing a \nmeaningful health care reform bill, a piece of legislation that while \nnot perfect, represents a substantial step forward from business as \nusual. We have a bill that does three important things: It saves money, \nit saves lives, and it gives families a fighting chance in their \nrelentless struggle with health insurance companies.\n  This bill will save money. It reduces the deficit by $130 billion \nover the first 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, and is projected to reduce the deficit by 10 times \nthat--up to $1.3 trillion--in the second decade. We will save $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion by improving the way we deliver services to our seniors. These \nsavings will prevent Medicare from going broke in 7 years by extending \nthe life of the Medicare trust fund.\n  This bill will save lives. It will extend health insurance coverage \nto 31 million Americans who don't have it today. Over 90 percent of \nAmericans will have health insurance coverage, the highest percentage \nin the history of the United States. For Colorado, that means over \n840,000 people who don't have insurance will now have access and \nanother 300,000 people who have insurance in the unstable individual \nmarket will be able to get affordable coverage through the new health \ninsurance exchange.\n  The Senate bill makes preventive services, such as breast cancer and \ncolorectal cancer screening, available without copayments. Now \nmammograms and colonoscopies, which can cost between $150 and $200, on \naverage, will be free as well for seniors--half a million seniors in my \nhome State alone. This means catching diseases earlier, promoting \nwellness, and saving millions of lives.\n  For our Nation's working families, this bill will also rein in the \nworst practices of private insurance companies. They will have to \ncommit to covering patients instead of gouging them for excessive \nprofits and overhead. Starting in 2011, if an insurance company doesn't \ngive you value for your dollar, they will have to refund you back the \ndifference. They will not be able to impose arbitrary lifetime limits \non consumers and punish you just for getting sick or deny you insurance \nbecause of a preexisting condition. The newest Senate bill does more to \ncontain costs, more to demand accountability and transparency from \ninsurance companies, and more to give consumers a better choice.\n  For my home State, in particular, I am glad the bill addresses other \ncritical areas. This reform does more for small business and small \nbusiness workers than ever before. Small business tax credits will \nbegin next year, giving eligible businesses a tax credit for 6 years to \npurchase health insurance for their employees. We have extended tax \ncredits for small businesses, allowing more than 68,000 small \nbusinesses in Colorado to buy health insurance.\n  This bill makes a significant investment in Medicare payments to \nrural areas. When I first joined the Senate, my first piece of \nlegislation called for a deficit-neutral reserve to address the \ndifferences in Medicare payments between urban and rural areas. This \nSenate bill recognizes the geographic differences between rural and \nurban areas and makes sure providers in rural Colorado that provide \nhigher quality at lower cost receive higher Medicare payments.\n  This bill also delivers on its promise to seniors. It doesn't use a \ndime of the Medicare trust fund to pay for reform and does not cut \nguaranteed benefits. That is why, on the first day of the health care \nreform debate, I introduced an amendment that would make sure seniors \nwill still see their guaranteed benefits, such as hospital stays and \nprescription drug coverage, no matter what changes we make in health \nreform. It was the most bipartisan piece of legislation we have had \nthis year, with 100 Senators agreeing health reform would not take away \nguaranteed Medicare benefits for seniors. For Colorado, that means half \na million Medicare beneficiaries will continue to have their guaranteed \nbenefits protected and preventive services free of charge through \nhealth reform.\n  I am very pleased Majority Leader Reid included a version of a piece \nof legislation I wrote based on the work in Mesa County, home of Grand \nJunction, CO. Currently, one out of every five Medicare patients who is \nreleased from the hospital in this country winds up back in the \nhospital in the same month they were released but not in Mesa County. \nThey have reduced the readmission rates at the hospital to about 2 \npercent, compared to the national average of 20 percent. That is 12 \nmillion patients who aren't receiving the care they need. In Mesa \nCounty, they have lowered readmissions by creating a transitional model \nthat makes sure that when patients leave the hospital, they do so with \na coach. That coach helps them go from the emergency room to their \nprimary care physician, their mental health provider, making sure they \nget the care they need over a period of time, making sure they don't \nforget their prescriptions, and making sure they have the guidance they \nneed to take responsibility for their own care. I am pleased the Senate \nbill compensates and reimburses hospitals and providers that set up \nmodels such as the one in Mesa County that actually saves money.\n  On another note, I wish to thank the Presiding Officer and my fellow \nfreshmen. Together, we worked hard to introduce a package of amendments \nto further contain costs and make our system more efficient. As I \ntraveled throughout Colorado on the August break, I heard from doctors \nand nurses who told me repeatedly all they wanted to do was work with \npatients, while all the government was doing was making them fill out \none form after another. When I came back, I was determined to do \nsomething to help cut the red tape and bureaucracy for these people so \nthey could spend more time with their patients. That is why, as part of \nthe freshman package, I introduced an amendment to put an end to \nmultiple forms, confusing codes, and unnecessary paperwork that burden \nproviders. If health plans don't follow the rules, they will suffer \nfinancial penalties. Our health care workers deserve better, and this \namendment gives them back time to spend with their patients.\n\n  Our freshman package rewards and emphasizes efficiency: one form to \nfill out, not 10; less red tape; fewer bureaucrats; a system that makes \nsense. Thanks to the leadership of the Presiding Officer, that package \nwas endorsed by the Business Roundtable, the AFL-CIO, and the Consumers \nUnion--proof that at least off this floor, there are still people from \nall different points of view who are willing to work together.\n  This bill also makes progress in the area of tort reform. It includes \nlanguage I worked on with Senators Baucus, Carper, and Lincoln to \ncreate a State grant program for States to develop, implement, and \nevaluate alternatives to tort litigation for medical malpractice \nclaims. The purpose of these grants is to limit litigation while \npreserving access to courts for patients and promoting strategies to \nreduce medical errors.\n  I know many in this Chamber take issue with one particular part of \nthis bill or another. I have my own issues with the bill. I am one of \nmany who have expressed their strong preference for a public option. \nBut I urge my colleagues to consider how much good this bill can do for \nthe American people--those with skyrocketing health care costs, small \nbusinesses forced with the impossible choice of helping workers keep \ntheir coverage or even just maintaining their business. To have the \nnonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office validate that in \nthe second decade we will have cut health care costs by up to $1.3 \ntrillion and that we will reduce the rise in costs of Medicare from 8 \npercent in the next two decades to 6 percent in the next two decades, \nwhile covering 31 million insured Americans, is truly groundbreaking.\n  We know what more time elapsing without fixing this system means for \nColorado's working families and small businesses. It means more double-\ndigit premium increases, less time to fix Medicare before it goes \nbankrupt in 2017, and more names added to the rolls of the uninsured. \nIt means another big win for the special interests, more people denied \ncoverage for preexisting conditions, and more small business employers \nwill have to make impossible decisions about covering their workers or \nkeeping their doors open.\n\n[[Page S13665]]\n\n  So let's reject business as usual. Let's look at the promise of this \nSenate bill as a whole. Let's put the pettiness, scare tactics, and \nobstruction aside. Reform is what is needed to control costs, give \npeople more choice, and provide support for our small businesses. This \npackage will reduce our deficit, and it does so by reforming the way we \nprovide health care.\n  We have much to do. Even before we were in the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression, during the last period of economic recovery, \nworking families' incomes in this country actually declined, the first \ntime in the history of the United States, the first time our economy \ngrew and left the middle class behind. At the same time, in my State of \nColorado and in all States across the country, the cost of health \ninsurance rose by 97 percent and the cost of higher education in my \nState went up by 50 percent. Finally, because of the short-term \npolitics practiced around here, we now have an annual deficit and long-\nterm debt that is cheating our children and constraining our choices.\n  We still have a lot to do to live up to the legacy that our parents \nand grandparents left us. It has taken me less than a year to \nunderstand that Washington still doesn't get it. I know we can do \nbetter, and despite so much evidence to the contrary, I believe we \nwill.\n  I believe we will because, in the end, the national creed that each \ngeneration of Americans has fought for and fulfilled--the idea \nexpressed in our Constitution that our responsibility lies not just \nwith ourselves but to our posterity--is so much more powerful than the \ntrivial politics that animate so many of the charges and countercharges \nthat ricochet around this building.\n  It is for this reason I urge my colleagues to come together and \nsupport this meaningful improvement in our health care system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, late last night, as my colleagues are \naware, the Senate took the important step to move forward on health \ncare reform. After all the work, the debate that has gone on for this \nentire year, we owe the American people a vote on this issue. We can't \nafford to ignore this situation anymore.\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been \ntalking about a lack of debate. I think anyone who has turned on C-SPAN \nfor the last few months will tell you there has been a lot of debate--\nnot only that, a number of Republican amendments were actually included \nin the original bill, the HELP Committee bill. When it came out, I \nbelieve it was something like 130 amendments that were included that \ncame from their side--and the Finance Committee as well.\n  I remember the first bipartisan meeting we had on health care reform \nwas something called Ready to Launch that the Finance Committee put \ntogether. I remember Senator Whitehouse and I were there. It was \nliterally a year and a half ago. So many of the ideas that are now \nincorporated in this bill that Senator Bennet from Colorado just so \neloquently went through are in this bill, so many of the bipartisan \nideas to kick off cost reform, to start rewarding high-quality care, to \nstart bringing down those costs in a way that gives us the high-quality \ncare.\n  We all know that rising costs are not sustainable. If we don't act, \nthese costs are going to continue to skyrocket.\n  So what was the vote about last night? The vote last night was to say \nwe are not going to put our heads in the sand anymore. We are not going \nto keep letting these costs go up.\n  Ten years ago, the average family was paying $6,000 a year for their \nhealth insurance. Now they are paying $12,000 a year. Well, 10 years \nfrom now, if we don't do anything about this, they are going to be \npaying $24,000 to $36,000 a year for their health insurance. Just look \nat these numbers. Look at where we are. In 1999, a single person was \npaying about $2,100 for their health care. They were paying for a \nfamily, $5,790 for their health care. Where are we now? Last year, in \n2008, a single person was paying $4,700 for their health care and then \na family was paying $12,680. Especially during this difficult economic \ntime when wages haven't been going up, people have been losing their \njobs, cutting back on their hours, and look what their health care \ncosts have been. It has been a higher and higher percentage of their \nfamily budget, a higher and higher percentage.\n  At the same time, health care expenditures are going up and up and \nup. In 1995, we were spending something like $12 billion and now it is \nway up to $2.5 trillion. This is the kind of money we are talking about \nwhen we look at why we have to do something to bend the cost curve. \nWhen people at home hear this term ``cost curve'' and they don't know \nwhat it means--well, this is exactly what it is: The cost curve has \nbeen going up and up and up for health care in America.\n  So $1 out of every $6 spent in our economy is on health care. Over 20 \npercent of our economy, by 2018, we believe, will be spent on health \ncare. American families can no longer afford it.\n  Who has been taking it the worst? Small businesses. They are paying \n20 percent more than large businesses for their health care. In a \nrecent survey, nearly three-quarters of small businesses that did not \noffer benefits cited high premiums as the reason.\n  These are little companies such as Granite Gear up in northern \nMinnesota and Two Harbors. I went up there and visited them. They are a \nthriving little company. They now have 15 employees. They are making \nbackpacks for our Nation's soldiers because they make such high-quality \nbackpacks. Do you know what the man who started that company told me? \nThat if he had known how much his health care would cost with his \nfamily of four--he did not have kids when he started the business--he \nwould not have started it today. He is paying $24,000 in Two Harbors, \nMN, for a family of four.\n  This is what it really means when you look at the numbers. Inflation \nusually raises the cost of most goods and services between 2 and 3 \npercent a year. What have health care premiums been doing? Health care \npremiums have been going up close to 8 percent a year, and that is an \nincrease Americans simply cannot afford.\n  What does this bill do? I was listening to some of the commentary and \ntaking part in it myself over the weekend. There seems to have been a \nlot of talk about these delayed benefits. Why don't we talk about the \nbenefits that are taking place right when the President signs this \nbill, within the first year of this bill?\n  The first thing is, if your kid loses their coverage because \nsomething goes wrong--if they get diabetes or if they have some \nchildhood disease--guess what. They are going to be able to get health \ncare. There is no longer a ban on preexisting conditions immediately, \nand then in later years that applies for adults as well but immediately \nfor kids.\n  Immediately, by 2011, within the first year of the bill, our seniors \nare going to be covered in that doughnut hole for their prescription \ndrugs. So many of them for so long--I know my own mother would complain \nabout this doughnut hole where they fall off a cliff and are not able \nto pay for their drugs because they do not have enough money. That will \nbe covered.\n  A number of the small business tax credits take effect by 2011. These \nare real benefits for the people of this country--real benefits.\n  The thing I care most about in this bill which Senator Bennet \ndiscussed is this idea of getting our money's worth for our health care \ndollars. What does this bill do? This new bill--we have taken a lot of \nthe good from the original bill and made things even better: $132 \nbillion off the deficit in the first 10 years and in the next 10 years, \n$1.3 trillion off the deficit. That was the most important thing to \npeople in my State when I went around. They said: We want to get rid of \nthese preexisting conditions, we want to make things better so we have \nbetter health care, but we want to make sure we do something about the \ndeficit, start doing something about costs.\n  As you know, Mr. President, Minnesota is a mecca for health care. We \nhave one of the high-quality, cost-efficient, low-cost States in the \ncountry. In fact, when we look at some of the numbers, one of my \nfavorite ones--and\n\n[[Page S13666]]\n\nmaybe this will be the last time I will say this before the end of the \nyear--is Mayo Clinic. They did a study out of Dartmouth, and they \nlooked at what Mayo did with chronically ill patients. What they found \nwas this: If other hospitals in the country simply use the same high-\nquality care Mayo uses--bring the family in, talk to them about what \nthe care should be for the patient--they talk to the patient and then \nfigure out what is the best course. They work as a team, like a \nquarterback with a team working with that quarterback. They do not have \n20 specialists falling all over each other; they work as a team. What \nthis study showed was this kind of health care for that subset of \nchronically ill patients in the last 4 years of their lives, the \nquality ratings were sky high for the Mayo Clinic. The families felt \ngood about how their loved ones were treated.\n  What Dartmouth found is if all the hospitals in the country followed \nthe same protocol, we would save, for this subset alone, $50 billion \nevery 5 years in taxpayer money, giving patients that Mayo health care, \ngiving them high-quality health care. It is counterintuitive to people. \nIf you go to a hotel and you pay the most, you are going to get the \nbest room with the best view. That has not been the same in American \nhealth care. In fact, there is an inverse relationship.\n  I see my friend from Ohio. Ohio has the Cleveland Clinic, and there \nis Geisinger. Those places that offer high-quality care also tend to \nhave some of the lowest costs.\n  Those are the incentives we are putting in this bill--incentives for \naccountable care organizations, incentives for that integrated care I \ntalked about instead of people running around with x rays to 20 \nspecialists, getting charged every single time, but then one specialist \ndoes not know what the other specialist is doing. They don't know what \nkind of drugs you are allergic to when you go in for surgery. This is \nbecause there is no communication. This bill promotes that integrated \ncare where you put the patient in the driver's seat so they have their \npick of a doctor. That is what we want--bundling of payment so you \nstart rewarding outcomes instead of the number of tests and procedures.\n  My favorite example of this came out of the Geisinger Clinic in \nPennsylvania, where they said: We are not that happy with how we are \ntreating diabetes patients. So instead of having everyone wait to see \nan endocrinologist, a doctor, we are going to have some of the routine \ncases see nurses, and the nurses will report to the doctors, and the \npatients will be happier because they will be able to see a nurse more \noften. The most difficult cases will be treated by endocrinologists.\n  They did that for about a year and looked to see what the results \nwere. Guess what. The patients were much happier because they were able \nto communicate one-on-one with the nurse. The doctors were able to \nhandle the most difficult cases and monitor the other cases. They saved \n$200 a month per patient with this kind of system. Higher quality care \nand better patient outcomes.\n  What does our system do when they see this kind of smart, cost-\neffective result for the doctors and for the system and for the \ntaxpayers? They actually are told: You get punished for this under our \nsystem. You are going to get a lot less money if you do something like \nthis. That is what I am talking about.\n  On hospital readmissions, we could save $18 billion a year. If you go \nin the hospital and you are treated, you want to go home. You don't \nwant to go back into the hospital because someone made a mistake or \nthey gave you an infection. Let's provide incentives--that is what this \nbill does--so that we reduce those hospital readmissions, make life \nbetter for the patient and at the same time reduce taxpayer money. That \nis what this bill is about.\n  Right now, fraud is $60 billion. I don't think anyone would believe \nthis. A senior who just depends on Medicare, right--we have to tell our \nseniors today that $60 billion a year is wasted on Medicare fraud, \ngoing to con men, going to people who set up storefronts and they get \nfake checks and they are not even real. That is where the money is \ngoing right now--down the tube, siphoned off by fraudsters. What this \nbill does is give the tools to improve that situation so that will not \nhappen anymore.\n  That is what we are doing with this bill. It is about reducing costs, \nit is about raising quality, and it is about saving Medicare so it does \nnot go in the red by 2017, giving it 10 more years and beyond because \nof the delivery system changes.\n  I am proud to support this bill. We continue to work for reform. As \nyou know, this is not just an end, this is a beginning. There will be \nmore work to do in the future, but we cannot put our heads in the sand. \nWe have to vote on this bill. We have to get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it has been said that a cynic knows the \nprice of everything and the value of nothing. I spent, as we all have, \nas the Senator from Minnesota has, as the Presiding Officer has, the \nlast 4 weeks listening to my colleagues come to the Senate floor to \ndescribe health reform legislation that bears no resemblance to what is \nactually before us. They take liberties with the cost of the bill. They \nseem to have no concept of the value of health care to a family who has \nit and to a family who does not have it. I guess they believe it is not \nimportant for us to get this done, it is not important for other \nAmericans to have affordable health insurance.\n  My colleagues are not at risk of losing their coverage. They can \nafford the health care they and their families need. So what is it to \nthem if another 14,000 people lose their insurance every day? Mr. \nPresident, 390 people every single day in my State lose their \ninsurance. What is it to them if people with preexisting conditions \ncannot get coverage, if women are overcharged for insurance, if the \nself-employed cannot afford the outrageous premiums they are charged, \nif too often American small businesses pay more for health coverage \nthan they earn in profits? What is it to them?\n  I have listened as Republican Senators have come to the Senate floor \nday after day to tell tales about health care reform and try to \nmanipulate public opinion by any means possible. I hear them mostly \nstalling: Slow down, not yet. They have done it since the Gang of 6 in \nthe Finance Committee met in June. No, actually they had begun to stall \neven before that when the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee \nbegan their deliberations, informal deliberations.\n  What they forget or what they do not want to think about, perhaps, is \nthat every day they stall, 390 people from Galion to Gallipolis, from \nBuckeye Lake to Avon Lake, from Ashtabula to Cincinnati, 390 people in \nmy State lose their insurance every day. Every day, we see 14,000 \nAmericans lose their insurance, and 1,000 Americans die every week \nbecause they do not have insurance. One thousand Americans die every \nweek because they do not have insurance, and on the other side of the \naisle they say: Slow down. What is the rush? Why do we have to move \ninto this?\n  They forget or maybe they just do not want to hear that a woman with \nbreast cancer is 40 percent more likely to die if she is uninsured than \nif she has insurance. Women with breast cancer are 40 percent more \nlikely to die if uninsured than if they have insurance. Yet they \ncontinue to say: Slow down.\n  I wish my friends on the other side of the aisle would actually meet \nsome of these people who do not have insurance. Let me put a human face \non this, if I can. Let me share three letters from Ohioans. I have come \nto the floor since July day after day reading letters from people \ndirectly affected by this health insurance situation, if you will. In \nmost cases, these are people who were happy with their health insurance \na year ago, and something happened in their lives--they got laid off \nand lost their insurance; had a child with a preexisting condition for \nwhom they could not get insurance; maybe they got sick and the cost of \ntheir health care was so high that the insurance industry cut them off, \nsimply eliminated their coverage. Let me read a couple of these.\n  Marie from Hancock County, OH:\n\n       My husband and I both have preexisting conditions and are \n     stuck paying $1,300 a month for health insurance. He has been \n     out of work for 2 years and we are living off the money that \n     we got when we sold our house. We are afraid to go without \n     insurance. We\n\n[[Page S13667]]\n\n     are in a fix and in our late middle ages and find ourselves \n     watching our retirement savings go down the drain. Please \n     fight for us and others like us.\n\n  Think about that. Does anyone in this Chamber, does anyone who comes \nto work as a Senator or down the hall as a Congressman--can any of us \nreally understand what this couple is all about, this couple from \nrural, smalltown Ohio paying $1,300 a month? How are they paying for \ntheir insurance? They sold their house so they could pay for their \nhealth insurance. They are in their late middle ages. I am guessing \nthey are probably in their late fifties, early sixties. They are not \neligible for Medicare.\n  So many people say to me through these letters and through my \nmeetings and discussions and when I am traveling around my State: I am \n63. I only have 2 years before Medicare because I trust Medicare. It is \nstable, predictable. It will be there for me, and it will help.\n  Instead, Republicans in this body, all 40 of whom even voted against \nthe bill last night--40 said: Stop. Don't even move forward on this \nbill. Do any of those 40 really understand people such as Marie from \nHancock County? Do any of them understand? Do any of them understand \nthat 390 people are losing their insurance every day in just one State? \nDo any of them understand that 1,000 people a week are dying in this \ncountry because they do not have insurance? Do any of them understand, \nany of the Members of Congress, the House of Representatives or the \nSenators, the 40 Senators who said no and stall and stall, saying: Not \nyet; can't do this yet; have to slow it down. Do any of them understand \nthat a woman with breast cancer is 40 percent more likely to die if she \ndoes not have insurance than if she does?\n  Charles from Cuyahoga County, the Cleveland area, writes me:\n\n       The hands-off-health-care people claim that many Americans \n     are very satisfied with their own health insurance. I am one \n     of those. I have Medicare. But I don't believe their \n     implication that health care reform is not needed. I think if \n     you were to really ask those lucky people who were somewhat \n     satisfied with their plan--a great majority would say they \n     support reform that would benefit everyone.\n\n  Charles understands. He is on Medicare. He understands the stability \nand predictability of the Medicare system.\n  I might add parenthetically that my Republican friends, all 40 of \nwhom last night said: Stop, slow down, stop, slow down, all 40 of them \nunderstand that their party overwhelmingly opposed the creation of \nMedicare. When they had a chance, they tried to cut it and privatize it \nin the nineties. Then when President Bush was sworn in, with Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate, they moved forward on their \ngiveaway to the drug companies and insurance companies in their \nattempts to privatize Medicare. Now they say they are all for Medicare.\n  Understand, Charles knows what this bill is going to do. It is going \nto strengthen Medicare. It is going to lengthen the lifespan of \nMedicare. It is going to give free physicals, once-a-year checkups, \ncolonoscopies, and mammograms for people on Medicare, and it is going \nto close the doughnut hole so fewer people will have to pay so much out \nof pocket.\n  Last letter. Raymond from Delaware County:\n\n       My wife and I had to drop our coverage because it cost us \n     $30,000. The country needs reform that bars insurance \n     companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums \n     on the basis of preexisting conditions. Health reform is the \n     right solution for the people of Ohio.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I just heard my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Ohio, say: I wish some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would understand families who don't have insurance.\n  I practiced medicine for 25 years, taking care of families in the \nState of Wyoming. During that time, I took care of all patients, \nregardless of their ability to pay. I will tell you, I believe, as a \nphysician who practiced medicine for 25 years--and as someone whom the \nObama administration has decided to completely ignore, as he did the \nother Senator of this Chamber who is a physician--that I know \nspecifically and personally about what happens to families who lose \ntheir insurance. My colleague and I know specifically what happens to \nfamilies who are on Medicaid, a health care program which my colleague \nwho is now leaving the Chamber after asking if anyone in this body \nunderstands people without insurance but not staying to hear the \ndiscussion for the next hour--making statements and then leaving--I \nunderstand those families. I understand the families on Medicare, I \nunderstand the families on Medicaid, I understand the families without \ninsurance, I understand the families worried about losing their \ninsurance, I understand about the families worried about disease.\n  My colleague from Ohio said: Do people understand women with breast \ncancer? Well, my wife is a--\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BROWN. I just wished to let the Member know I am still in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My wife was a breast cancer survivor, and her breast \ncancer was discovered in her forties by a screening mammogram. It was \nthat screening mammogram that saved her life because the cancer had \nalready spread. It had already spread to a lymph node. She had three \noperations, two bouts of full chemotherapy, radiation--35 treatments \nand all--all--because of the screening mammogram that saved her life. \nYet because of this bill that was brought to the Senate floor--with the \ngovernment knowing better than the rest of America, knowing what health \ncare ought to be given and shouldn't be given--all of a sudden what we \nsee is the government knows best, people don't know--her life would \nhave been lost because she is one of those 1,900.\n  So I understand, having practiced medicine, having lived that life as \na physician--taken care of people without health insurance and on \nMedicaid and Medicare and those worrying about losing their insurance \nwhen they lose their job--the implications. Yet I took care of all of \nthem, as did all my partners. We dealt with all these people, trying to \nhelp each and every one of them, regardless of their ability to pay. It \nis why we need health reform in this country that actually works on \navailability of care, affordability of care, access to care, and \nquality care. This bill that I voted against last night doesn't address \nthe needs of the country. It fails time and time again.\n  The President made a number of promises--a number of promises--to the \npeople of this country. He said people would see their insurance \npremiums drop by $2,500. Instead, the budget officers say: Oh, no, it \nis going to go up $2,100 for a family. Has the President not read the \nbill, not read the responses that have come from the Congressional \nBudget Office? Does he not see the difference there of $4,600 per \nfamily?\n  The President said this wouldn't add a dime to the deficit. Well, it \nis going to add a lot of dimes to the deficit. This is going to add $1 \ntrillion to the deficit. He said: Oh no, will not at all. Yet they \ndidn't do the doctor fix--the Medicare doctor fix. Now the Speaker of \nthe House says: Oh, we will handle that in January or February for $250 \nbillion, since they are not going to pay for it here.\n  The President said: Taxes will not go up on anybody making under \n$250,000 for a family. There are a dozen taxes in the bill that will be \npassed on to the American people. Now any teenager who goes to a \ntanning salon is going to get taxed 10 percent. I don't think any of \nthose people are making over $250,000 apiece.\n  The President said: People will not lose their coverage. Oh, they are \ngoing to lose their coverage. Many will lose the coverage they have, \ncoverage they like, because they have cut 11 million people on Medicare \nAdvantage--a program people like, a program my patients like. People \nwhom I have taken care of like it because there is actually an \nadvantage to the program. It is a program that deals specifically with \npreventive care. It is coordinated care. That is what happens with \nMedicare Advantage. The President doesn't like. They will lose their \ncoverage.\n  Of course, the President said we wouldn't see any cuts to Medicare. \nYet the bill says $500 billion of cuts to Medicare for the seniors who \ndepend upon Medicare.\n\n[[Page S13668]]\n\n  The President said we would have an open, honest debate. He said C-\nSPAN would be there covering the debates. Those of us with the most \nexperience--the two physicians, with 50 years in the practice of \nmedicine and taking care of families in this country--were completely \nexcluded--completely excluded--even though we offered to go to the \nWhite House and read the bill with the President.\n  So what do we have? What is the verdict of the American people on the \nvote that was taken in the dark of night--at 1 a.m. in the morning--a \nMonday morning vote, taken at 1 a.m. so the American people, hopefully, \naccording to the Democrats, would be asleep and not see what they were \ndoing to the American people? The verdict is the American people are \noverwhelmingly opposed--opposed--to the bill the Senate last night \nvoted 60 to 40 on cloture and decided to move ahead on.\n  The deals in the bill are absolutely astonishing: $100 million for a \nhospital in a State we still can't identify and no one is claiming, a \npayoff to one State, a payoff to another State, and then the cuts in \nMedicare for our seniors who depend on Medicare, a program that is \ngoing to go broke in the year 2017--not to save Medicare. Instead of \nsaving Medicare, to start a whole new government program.\n  I see my colleague from the State of Tennessee is standing, and he \nhas worked closely with people on Medicare in his home State. He is \nfamiliar with that and with Medicaid and he knows how difficult it is \nfor patients to get to see a doctor. With the cuts in Medicare, it is \ngoing to make it harder for those hospitals to stay alive and open in \nyour community, and for patients to get the kind of care they need.\n  So I would ask my friend from Tennessee: Are there concerns you have \nabout the cuts to Medicare and how they are going to impact on the care \nof people in your home State?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Wyoming and appreciate his \nleadership on this bill. It is of tremendous value to have within our \nbody two practicing medical doctors to help us interpret the effect of \nthis bill, which affects all 300 million Americans so dramatically.\n  We find, when we discuss this bill with our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, we sometimes become exasperated with one another \nbecause it seems like they are talking about one set of facts and we \nare talking about another set of facts. So what I would like to do is \ntake a moment and talk about Medicare.\n  If anyone is watching our debate, you hear the Democrats talk about \nthree things: We are saving Medicare, we are extending its length, and \nyou hear Republicans say they are cutting Medicare. So who is right?\n  Well, let me tell you why we talk about Medicare cuts. Medicare, of \ncourse, is a government program which 40 million seniors depend on. We \nall pay into it, and then when we get to be of a certain age we depend \nupon it for our medical care. For many Americans, it is very important. \nIt was established with broad bipartisan support in the 1960s.\n  What are the proposals that have to do with Medicare? Well, basically \nhalf this health care bill is paid for by reductions in the growth of \nFederal spending for Medicare. Those are Medicare cuts. Who says they \nare? Well, the President of the United States, for one, says we will \nhave no deficit from this bill. So the way we are going to do that, for \nthis bill, which the Congressional Budget Office figures show us will \ncost $2.5 trillion over 10 years when fully implemented, is basically \npaid for one-half by Medicare cuts and one-half by new taxes. Give the \nDemocrats credit for that, that helps to avoid a large part of the \ndeficit. The rest is done by sending a huge bill to States to help pay \nfor another big government program called Medicaid, but I will leave \nthat to the side for a moment.\n\n  The Medicare cuts which are reductions in the spending for Medicare, \nare $466 billion over the first 10 years and over a fully implemented \n10 years it is about $1 trillion in Medicare cuts. That is money coming \nout of the Medicare Program and going somewhere. Where does it go? \nWell, it goes to start a new program.\n  What is wrong with that? Well, one thing wrong with it is the \ntrustees of Medicare say that there is already more money coming out of \nMedicare than is being paid in, and by the year 2015 or 2017 it will be \ninsolvent. That means going broke. These aren't Republican trustees or \nDemocratic trustees, these are the men and women whose job it is to \nreport to the Nation on the condition of this program that takes care \nof 40 million people and their medical care.\n  Already we see that the Medicare Program is under some stress. The \ndoctors, for example, who serve Medicare are only paid about 83 or 84 \npercent as much as doctors who serve patients with private health care. \nAs a result of that, we have to come along year after year and \nappropriate more money to reimburse doctors who serve Medicare \npatients. If we do not do that, they will not be serving Medicare \npatients, and Medicare will become similar to Medicaid, the program for \nlow-income Americans, where about 50 percent of doctors will not take a \nnew Medicaid patient. It is akin to telling somebody: I am going to \ngive you a ticket to a bus line where the bus only runs about half the \ntime.\n  So what the Democrats are saying to us is that by taking $1 trillion \nout of Medicare over 10 years when fully implemented, and there is no \ndispute about that amount of money, and spending it to pay for this new \nprogram that is somehow good for Medicare and for the seniors who \ndepend upon it. I mean, they are suggesting we believe if you take $135 \nbillion from hospitals and $120 billion from the 11 million seniors who \nparticipate in Medicare Advantage and $15 billion from nursing homes \nand $40 billion from home health agencies and $7 billion from hospices, \nthat somehow that is good for seniors.\n  Perhaps it could be, if all that money were put back into Medicare; \nif the money were taken from grandma and spent on grandma. But no, this \nmoney is taken out and spent on a new program. The Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office--not a Republican, not a Democrat, the \nnonpartisan Director said, for the 11 million on Medicare Advantage \nthat one-half of their benefits will be diminished. That is what he \nsaid about these cuts.\n  Even when it is all said and done, we completely leave out the $\\1/4\\ \ntrillion that we need to appropriate to pay the physicians to serve \nMedicare patients. Because if we don't, their payments are going to be \ncut by 21 percent next year and fewer of them will see Medicare \npatients. We have already heard the Mayo Clinic, for example, is \nbeginning to restrict some patients on Medicare because they lost $840 \nmillion serving Medicare patients last year.\n  I have taken a few moments to talk about Medicare. That is just one \nthing wrong with this bill. But when you hear the other side say they \nare helping Medicare, and if you listen to what I said about how can \nyou take $1 trillion out of the Medicare Program--which is going \nbroke--when it is fully implemented over 10 years and claim you are \nhelping Medicare by starting a new program, I don't think that is \npossible. That is the source of the great concern on our side of the \naisle about this bill on that one issue.\n\n  I see the assistant Republican leader, the whip. I have heard a \nnumber of people say, and I will just propound this question and then I \nwill yield the floor, if I may, to the Senator from Arizona. But I have \nheard them say: Why are Republicans keeping everybody in here this \nweek? We want to go home and see our families.\n  We all want to see our families. But there is a reason this bill was \nsuddenly presented to us in the middle of the greatest snowstorm in the \nhistory of Washington in the month of December, and we were asked to \nstart voting on it in the middle of the night on the same day, and to \nfinish the work by Christmas. If I am not mistaken, and this is my \nquestion to the distinguished assistant Republican leader who has been \nhere a number of years, who is in the leadership and whose job is to \nhelp manage the floor: Is it not entirely the prerogative of the \nmajority leader of the Senate to schedule what comes up on the floor? \nIs that not his job? Isn't it true that if Senator Reid wanted to say \nlet's take this bill down, let's go home, let's let the people hear \nabout it, let's come back and vote on it after Christmas, after New \nYear, after Valentine's Day, could he not do that and\n\n[[Page S13669]]\n\nisn't that peculiarly his power and not our power?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to our colleague, as a general \nrule that is correct. The majority leader has two great powers that no \none else in the Senate has. One is the right of first recognition by \nthe Presiding Officer and the other is the power to set the schedule. \nThat power is limited by Senate rules, and it can be altered by \nunanimous consent. I can go on and explain a little bit to folks who \nare wondering why we would be in this predicament of voting on \nChristmas Eve based upon the majority leader's decision. If I can just \nproceed, I will do that.\n  All of these rather odd times for debates, 1 o'clock in the morning, \n7:20 a.m. in the morning, and so on, are as a result of the majority \nleader's decision to make sure that this bill is completed by \nChristmas. That is the precipitating cause for everything else that \nfollows because once he says the bill has to be completed by Christmas, \nthen he has to, in effect, count backwards on how long it takes to do \nthe various things the Senate rules say we have to do.\n  If there are three cloture motions filed--which is what the majority \nleader did; he filed three cloture motions simultaneously--under Senate \nrules certain timeframes then attach.\n  You have to take the vote with 1 day intervening between the filing \nof the cloture motion and the vote. If cloture is invoked, then 30 \nhours for debate is permitted after which there can be additional \naction by the Senate. So when the majority leader takes all that into \naccount, he finds that he has to vote at 1 a.m. in the morning, 7:20 \na.m, and so on.\n  He could change that, of course. He could change that by saying we do \nnot actually have to have the whole thing completed by Christmas. That \nis strictly an arbitrary date he set.\n  There have been some who said: Why don't we have a unanimous consent \nrequest to not put us through all of this and try to complete the \ndebate a couple of days earlier?\n  Republicans have said: Now wait a minute. You are telling us on the \none hand that the majority leader is saying we have to have this \ncompleted by Christmas, but since that is kind of tough on all of us, \nnow you are saying let's move that up a couple of days.\n  Republicans are saying: We have had barely enough time to consider \nthis bill as it is. We are not going to agree to move it up any more \nthan that. We don't like voting on Christmas Eve any more than you do, \nbut the answer to it is not making the time even shorter but, rather, \ntaking our time and doing it right. As the Senator from Maine has \npointed out, let's go home for the Christmas recess, stop and listen to \nwhat our constituents are telling us they would like to have us do, and \nthen come back and complete it. That could all be done by unanimous \nconsent. My colleague is correct that once the majority leader made the \ndecision that this has to be done by Christmas, then the time is pretty \nwell set by the Senate rules, absent a unanimous consent by the body \nthat would either extend the time or shorten that amount of time.\n  I would like to make another point, off that subject if I could, but \nif my colleague has another question in that regard I would be happy to \ntry to respond it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No, I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. I talked to the Senator from Wyoming. Of course, Arizona is \na State that has a lot of Medicare patients. Our State is hurt as much \nas any by the cuts to Medicare and particularly the Medicare Advantage \ncuts. We do not have the benefit that was extended to residents of \nother States, primarily the State of Florida, by a special provision \nthat was inserted into the bill. As a result, our constituents are \ngoing to suffer more than those of some other States.\n  But the more we read this bill--and one of the reasons Republicans \nhave not been willing to truncate this debate is that the more we read \nit the more we find in it that is troublesome. We found yesterday that \nthe Congressional Budget Office--actually the Congressional Budget \nOffice brought to our attention the fact that they had made a little \nmistake. I think it was a quarter of 1 percent in one of their \ncalculations. That quarter of 1 percent amounted to $600 billion. So a \nsmall error by the Congressional Budget Office can make a huge \ndifference to the people of America. That is $600 billion.\n  We also saw there were special provisions in the bill for residents \nof one particular State, and that has gotten quite a bit of attention \nlately. There has also been a dental/vision clinic in a State that has \nbenefited. I am still not sure we have figured out exactly what that \nState is, but I understand one of the Senators from Connecticut has \ntaken credit for it. I don't know if that is true. It is hearsay. If \nthat is incorrect, I can be corrected. But the more we see about it, \nthe more we realize that support for it was garnered, not on the merits \nbut on the basis of special favors done to certain Members.\n  My staff has indicated there is yet another one of these in the bill, \nand it has to do with so-called specialty hospitals or, as they are \nreferred to in the legislation, physician self-referral hospitals, that \nhave physician ownership.\n  Just a little bit of background on this. The Hospital Association \nthat is primarily representative of the community hospitals has been \npleading for a long time that they are not adequately reimbursed, and \nwe need to try to help them. I have been an advocate for that. I have \ntried to help them, for example, for reimbursement in the care provided \nto illegal immigrants, and we were successful in that.\n  But one area I departed from that is when they concluded the best way \nto help themselves was to hurt their competition. At that point I said \nno. Their competition is the physician-owned, self-referral hospitals. \nThese are generally specialty hospitals in a community that provide \nvery good care. While they do in one sense provide competition to the \ncommunity hospitals, they are all in the same boat in terms of the kind \nof reimbursement that Congress provides. What I have said is you should \nnot solve your problem by hurting your competition but having Congress \nsolve the problems that affect you both. I have been willing to try to \nhelp on that.\n  In this legislation what they have done, they struck a deal with the \nHospital Association to stop the competitors, the physician self-\nreferred hospitals, from building any more hospitals. You have to be \nunder construction by a certain date under the bill--it is February 10, \n2010. You have to have a provider agreement in operation--that is the \ntechnical term--or else you cannot go any further with your new \nphysician self-referred hospital. That is going to hurt a lot of \ncommunities. It turns out that some of the communities hurt were in a \nparticular State, the State of Nebraska.\n  Again, I have an affinity for Nebraska because I was born there, and \nI know a lot of people there. The Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Johanns, a \nlittle bit earlier today said he didn't think the special deals that \nwere created for the State of Nebraska were appreciated by Nebraskans \nwho stand more on principle and have the view that if something is bad \nfor Nebraskans and it is bad for the folks in other States, therefore \nit ought to be solved for all of the States, not just for the State of \nNebraska.\n  It turns out that is the case with this particular provision on page \n332 of the Reid so-called managers' amendment, which would extend the \ndate on which a hospital may have physician investment and a provider \nagreement in place for the purpose of being grandfathered. That date \nwas extended until August 1, 2010.\n  It turns out that helps, at least according to staff, at least three \nhospitals in the State of Nebraska--one in Omaha, one in Kearney, and \none in Bellevue. In fact, I will just quote briefly from an article \nthat Robert Pear of the New York Times did on this.\n\n       The Senate health bill, would impose tough restrictions \n     like the one passed by the House last month, would impose \n     tough new restrictions on referrals of Medicare patients by \n     doctors to hospitals in which the doctors have financial \n     interests. The package assembled by Mr. Reid would provide \n     exemptions to a small number of such hospitals, including one \n     in Nebraska.\n\n  He goes on to describe this and then quotes Molly Sandvig, executive \ndirector of Physician Hospitals of America, which represents doctor-\nowned hospitals, who said the change would benefit Bellevue Medical \nCenter, scheduled to open next year in Bellevue, NE.\n\n\n[[Page S13670]]\n\n\n       Under the proposal Ms. Sandvig said, ``doctor-owners can \n     continue to refer Medicare patients to the hospital'' in \n     eastern Nebraska.\n       ``Senator Nelson has always been a friend to our \n     industry,'' she said. ``But doctor-owned hospitals in other \n     states were not so fortunate. They would not meet the August \n     1 deadline.''\n\n  I would like to help all the physician-owned hospitals. I agree that \nall of them should have the same kind of support that was gained by the \nSenator from Nebraska for three specific hospitals in Nebraska. I \nunderstand, by the way, that three or four hospitals in Arizona would \nalso benefit from that. I think that is a great thing.\n  But instead of just benefiting the hospitals in a few States by \nmoving the date back to where you catch the ones in the State of \nNebraska, we ought to eliminate this requirement altogether because \nwhat you are going to do is prevent more competition from very high-\nquality hospitals in communities that can provide a real service to \nconstituents in all of our States, not just one State.\n  It is just one more example, I say to my friend from Tennessee, that \nthe more we read the bill and learn what is in it, the more we find \nthat the 60 votes for it were obtained less by persuasion and on the \nmerits of the bill than by special provisions that were inserted to \nassist folks in particular States.\n  As I said, I think if something is good for one State, it ought to be \ngood for all States. If it is not good for one State, it ought not be a \nrequirement on the other States as well.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, what you are hearing is what we are \nnoticing as Republicans take a look at the bill. I saw the majority \nwhip come onto the Senate floor a few minutes ago. Yesterday he was on \nthe floor and said the Republicans have not offered amendments to this \nbill, so I brought four amendments yesterday. The chairman of the \nFinance Committee objected.\n  One had to do with letting people on Medicare keep their own doctors \nor choose who they want to go to see for a doctor. The purpose of this \nwhat was called ``Medicare Patient Freedom to Contract'' is it ``allows \nMedicare patients the right to privately contract for medical services \nwith the physician of their choice.''\n  I ask my friend from Tennessee, who has just spoken about Medicare, \nwouldn't he think that patients who have been promised that they can \nkeep the health care they want should be able, or at least this Senate \nought to be able to debate an amendment about allowing Medicare \npatients the right to privately contract for medical services with the \nphysician of their choice? Wouldn't that seem fair?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Wyoming. \nI think it is important for the American people to know, the 400-page \namendment that was added to the underlying bill over the weekend is \nbeing presented to us in way that will not allow the bill to be \namended. So something that affects one-sixth of the economy, which we \nhave had a day and a half to read, which is part of an overall bill \nthat will raise taxes, cut Medicare, and send big bills to States could \nbe improved with amendments but cannot be amended under the current \nprocedure.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Another amendment--I see my colleague from South Dakota \nis here--is an amendment I offered on the floor of the Senate yesterday \nto protect individuals from skyrocketing insurance premiums. You may \nrecall the President of the United States said premiums--families in \nWyoming and other States, families across the country--health insurance \npremiums would go down $2,500 per family. Yet what I read and studied, \nand as I look at this, it says to me it looks like premiums will go up \ninstead of going down. Instead of going down $2,500, they will go up \n$2,100. I think for 90 percent of the families in this country, their \ninsurance premiums will either stay the same or go up more because the \nbill is passed than if we did nothing.\n  I ask my friend from South Dakota--I know he has been bringing forth \ninformation; I know he put a chart together on it--would there not be \nsome value in allowing the Senate to discuss an amendment because this \namendment basically said let the State insurance commissioners--because \nevery State has an insurance commissioner--let the State insurance \ncommissioner take a look at what happens to insurance premiums in their \nState. If the insurance commissioner finds that the premiums have gone \nup faster than the Consumer Price Index, then in that State where those \npremiums have gone up faster than the Consumer Price Index, all of \nthese laws and regulations and rules would no longer apply. The \nmandates, the rating rules, the benefit mandate, all of those included \nin the Reid bill would not apply.\n  Wouldn't that make sense, I ask my colleague from South Dakota? What \nis the Senator's understanding of this and should not we be allowed to \nat least discuss and debate that as a Senate when we have been promised \nas citizens of this country that premiums would go down?\n  (Mrs. HAGAN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the Senator from Wyoming is correct. Of \ncourse, we would like to offer amendments. I know the Senator from \nWyoming has deep experience in this field, being a practicing \nphysician, someone who brings great knowledge and background to the \ndebate and obviously has great insight about how this 2,100-page bill \ncould be improved upon. What we have here is the 2,100 pages that we \nstarted with, and this represents one-sixth of our entire economy. We \nare talking about reordering one-sixth of the entire economy. Saturday \nwe received an amendment, a 400-page amendment which nobody up until \nSaturday had seen. In fact, many of the Democrats hadn't seen it \neither, including members of the Democratic leadership. There was a \ndiscussion on the floor last week between Senator McCain and Senator \nDurbin in which Senator McCain said: They are writing this amendment \nbehind closed doors. We don't have any idea what is in it. The Senator \nfrom Illinois, the No. 2 person in the Democratic leadership, said: I \nam in the dark just like you are. You had a handful of people who were \nadding 400 pages of content to the 2,100 pages we already have.\n  In addition, there is another amendment that adds another 300. We are \ntalking about 2,700 pages that will reorder and restructure literally \none-sixth of the entire American economy. Right now what we are being \ntold is that we are not going to be allowed to offer amendments to that \nhumongous piece of legislation. When you get this much legislation \ncoming at you and receiving this on Saturday, not having the \nopportunity to read it for the first time, is why we have been saying \nwe need to push this back and not try to jam it through before the \nChristmas holiday. You find all kinds of things in these bills. \nSometimes people take credit for those being there. Sometimes they \ndon't. We have had a debate about some of the provisions that benefit \nspecifically Nebraska. You have this Medicaid provision that requires \nthe taxpayers of the other 49 States to subsidize and pay the Medicaid \nmatching share for the State of Nebraska which will cost millions and \nmillions of dollars. The Senator from Arizona mentioned this late add, \na $100 million item for construction of a university hospital which, \nagain, is being reported as being inserted by the Senator from \nConnecticut. You have all these sorts of deals that get made to try and \nget that elusive sixtieth vote that are now coming to light. The \nAmerican people have a right to know it. Frankly, Members of the Senate \nwho have to vote on this have a right to know what is in these volumes \nof pages, 2,700 pages, that will spend $2.5 trillion. The original \n2,100-page bill spent $1.2 billion per page, $6.8 million per word. It \ncreates 70 new government programs. This is a massive overhaul of \nhealth care delivery.\n  What it ought to be about is driving down the cost of health care for \npeople. In fact, we have heard a lot of discussion from the other side \nabout how this drives down the cost of health care. This bends the cost \ncurve down. They can say that, but the experts we rely on, the referees \nor the umpires, say otherwise. In fact, what the CBO has said is that \nthe cost curve would be bent up by this bill. The blue line on this \nchart represents the increasing health care costs year over year if we \ndo nothing. The blue line represents what we would be looking at if we \ncontinue on the current course which everybody here acknowledges is \nunacceptable. We all want to see the cost\n\n[[Page S13671]]\n\ncurve go down and see overall health care costs go down. But the ironic \nthing is, according to the CBO, the red line represents what happens if \nthe bill proposed by the Democratic majority actually becomes law. The \ncost curve is bent up. We will actually spend more on health care than \nwe are spending today, even the year-by-year twice the rate of \ninflation increases in health care premiums today.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is absolutely right to be offering \namendments to address the issue of premiums. This bill does not do \nanything to reduce premiums for most Americans. About 10 percent of \nAmericans, because of the subsidies in the bill, would get their \npremium costs reduced, but 90 percent--we are told by the CBO--would \nsee their premiums stay the same or go up. When I say stay the same, it \nmeans go up at the current rate of twice the rate of inflation. Worst-\ncase scenario, if you are buying your insurance in the individual \nmarketplace, you will see your insurance premiums go up above and \nbeyond this by 10 to 13 percent. Health care costs for 90 percent of \nAmericans, the best they can hope for, is the status quo which is year-\nover-year increases that are twice the rate of inflation. If you are \none of the unlucky who buys their insurance in the individual \nmarketplace, your premiums go up by another 10 to 13 percent. This \nought to be about driving down health care costs and getting premiums \nunder control.\n  The overall cost of health care in this country represents about one-\nsixth of our entire economy. If this bill passes, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, according to the Actuary of CMS, health \ncare spending will no longer be one-sixth of the economy; it will be \nmore than one-fifth. Because if this bill passes, health care spending \nwill go up to about 21 percent of our gross domestic product.\n  Tell me, what does this bill do then to get costs under control? If \nwe are driving up the cost of health care for individuals in the form \nof higher premiums, if we are driving up the overall cost of health \ncare as a percentage of our economy, why would we be jamming this thing \nthrough before the Christmas holiday, these 2,700 pages, spending $2.5 \ntrillion of taxpayer money, raising taxes on small businesses, which \nobviously have weighed in on this, and the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, which represents a lot of small businesses around \nthe country, has said, if enacted, this bill would cost us 1.6 million \njobs because of all the new taxes it imposes--you are raising taxes, \nwhen fully implemented, by about $1 trillion, cutting Medicare by about \n$1 trillion. After all that, what do you have? You have the same or \nworse insurance premiums for 90 percent of Americans. I argue that is a \nbad deal for the American people.\n  Coming back to the special deals, this is not the way to legislate. \nTo carve out deals, to go and try and find or buy or however you want \nto characterize it that sixtieth vote is essentially what we are \ntalking about. These are special goodies packed into this bill \nessentially because the majority decided that rather than trying to \ninclude Republicans and pass it with Republican votes, they had to pass \nit with all Democrats which meant that every one of the Democrats had \ntremendous leverage. Clearly, they decided to use it. There are lots of \ncarve-outs, lots of special deals in this that cost the American \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in additional spending simply \nbecause they wanted to get this done by an artificial deadline and \nwanted to do it with all Democratic votes.\n  I say to my colleagues, this process itself, when the American people \nfind out about particularly this latest deal, smells. I don't think \nthey are going to like it. I don't think they are going to like the end \nproduct when they find out it will raise insurance premiums.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I try to stay in close touch with the people of \nWyoming. I go home every weekend. We have not been able to do that the \nlast couple of weekends so I have had telephone townhall meetings. I \nknow the Senator from Tennessee has done the same. There is a way \npeople can push a button to indicate whether they are in favor or \nagainst. Ninety-three percent of the people of Wyoming are opposed to \nthe bill the Democrats are trying to jam through in the middle of the \nnight. I know the Senator from Tennessee has recently had telephone \ntownhall meetings with his constituents because he was not able to be \nhome personally with them. Maybe the Senator wants to share with us \nsome of the experiences he has had and some of the messages he has \nheard from the fine folks of Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the telephone townhalls are \ninteresting. This is the 21st consecutive day and the third weekend we \nhave been debating this bill. One would think we could probably do a \nbetter job of it, if we were going back home every weekend to hear what \npeople thought about what we were doing. But maybe the strategy has \nbeen to keep us here talking to each other, bring the bill up in a \nsnowstorm, pass it in the middle of the night and go home for \nChristmas, and the people won't find out what we are doing until it is \ntoo late. One way to find out is tele-townhalls. I was skeptical before \nI did one but it is a pretty interesting way to stay in touch with \npeople from Tennessee. You get on the telephone and an automated system \ncalls thousands of people and says: The Senator from Wyoming or \nIllinois or North Carolina or Tennessee wants to talk with you about \nhealth care. People can either stay on the phone when they get the call \nor they can hang up. What normally happens is a person stays on the \ncall, this time a surprisingly large number of people stayed on the \ncall, because of their strong interest in this issue.\n\n  The other night I did the phone call between 7:30 and 8:30. I called \nto about 18 west Tennessee counties, including Shelby, which is \nMemphis, and as reported to me by the service, about 30,000 people were \non the telephone sometime during that hour, with a maximum number of \n3,016 on the call at any one time. Someone might pick up the phone and \nsay: Senator Barrasso is on the phone. They might tune in for 15 or 20 \nminutes and then hang up. Maybe they have to cook dinner or the ball \ngame comes on. Maybe they get tired of talking to you, but they are on \nfor 15 or 20 minutes. During that time, I was able to take a number of \nquestions. After it was over, 563 messages from constituents were sent \nto my Web site.\n  It was interesting to me. People who know my history, know that to be \nelected Governor 30 years ago, I walked across the State of Tennessee. \nInstead of going to a Republican meeting or a rotary club, I would \nvisit with random people during my walk. It took me 6 months and I \nwould see 1,000 people a day. These random phone calls kind of reminded \nme of that. It was as if the people were randomly selected. They were \nnot on any Republican list or Democratic list or list of doctors or \npatients. They were just in the phonebook. They talked and acted like \nthey were normal citizens who I had interrupted after dinner, probably \nbecause it was 6:30 to 7:30 in that part of Tennessee. I was able to \nask those citizens three questions. I am not about to say this is a \nGallup poll of Tennessee, because I know that surveys like that have to \nbe done in a scientific way, but after being here for 21 straight days, \nnot able to go home because we have been debating this bill, these \nopinions are straws in the wind.\n  The first question was: Do you believe the Senate should rush to pass \nthis health care bill before Christmas? In this case, 943 people, 83 \npercent, said no, and 108 said yes; that is 9 percent.\n  Second question: Do you support the health care bill moving through \nthe Senate? On this one, 1,496 said no, or 75 percent. 352 said I don't \nknow, which is 18 percent, and 154 said yes, that is 8 percent.\n  No. 3: Do you agree that Congress doesn't do comprehensive \nlegislation well and ought to go step by step to bring health care \ncosts under control? On this question, 1,285 said yes, that is 80 \npercent, 14 percent said I don't know and 7 percent disagreed.\n  I have often heard our friends on the other side say: Where is the \nRepublican bill? My response has been, day after day, if you are \nlooking forward to seeing the Republican leader role a wheelbarrow in \nhere with a 2,700-page Republican comprehensive bill, you will be \nwaiting forever. We have a different approach. Our approach is to set a \nclear goal--reducing cost. The bill we are voting on increases costs. \nOur goal is to find five or six steps to go in the direction to \nreducing costs.\n\n[[Page S13672]]\n\n  Without going into detail, although the Senators from South Dakota or \nWyoming may want to, we focus on five or six steps that would clearly \nreduce health care costs. By that, I mean your premium, the cost of \nyour government. And once we do those five or six steps, we could go \non. We could do that without taxes, without mandates, without running \nup the debt, without a big bill with lots of surprises. Just to take \none example--and then I will yield to my friends from Wyoming and South \nDakota--one of those examples is the small business health care plan. \nThe current bill, the Democratic bill, has in it a credit for small \nbusinesses, but we would argue that by the time small business men and \nwomen get through paying the mandates and the taxes the bill also \nimposes, it is not going to be much help to them.\n  What we have is a bill that would allow small businesses to pool \ntheir resources. In other words, if you are a small business man or \nwoman and you have 60 employees and 2 get cancer, suddenly the costs of \nthose 2 employees prohibit you from providing insurance to the other \nemployees. But if you could pool your resources with small businesses \nall around the country, then the pool would be large enough that you \ncould offer insurance.\n  That proposal has been made by Senator Enzi. It has been through the \nHELP Committee. The Congressional Budget Office said it did not add to \nthe deficit. In fact, it reduces the deficit, and it would permit \n750,000 more employees of small businesses to be insured and their \npremiums would be lower than they otherwise would be. That is a single \nstep to moving toward reducing health care costs, but if we took that \nstep and the other steps we have proposed, that would be a good way to \nstart. We could do that together, and we would not have this partisan \nbill with so many questions and so many concerns.\n  So I wonder if my friends from South Dakota and Wyoming--I know they \nhave thought a good deal about this step-by-step approach toward \nactually solving the real problem of health care costs.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator will yield on that suggestion of small \nbusiness health plans, doesn't that enjoy wide support among small \nbusinesses in this country?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It clearly does. It enjoys widespread support \neverywhere, except the Senate. When Senator Enzi brought it up, it was \nrejected by our friends on the other side.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I might continue, the one thing that strikes me about \nthis proposal that, as I said before, now is, in totality, 2,700 pages, \nis that it does not enjoy any support from any small business \norganization that I know of. Maybe there are some out there I cannot \nspeak to. But I do know the organizations that represent small \nbusinesses that we are all well acquainted with--National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association \nof Manufacturers, the National Association of Wholesalers and \nDistributors, builders and contractors, electric contractors, franchise \nassociations--I can go right down the list--all say this does nothing \nto lower their costs. In fact, it increases the cost of doing business, \nincreases the cost of doing health care.\n  What they have argued repeatedly is one of the suggestions the \nSenator from Tennessee mentioned, that small business health plans \nwould drive their health care costs down, which is why they have been \nsuch strong advocates for this over the years.\n  I guess the other question I would ask of my colleague from Tennessee \nis, would an approach, a suggestion like small business health plans \nrequire tax increases that would hit small businesses?\n  Incidentally, the latest version with the managers' amendment, which \nwe just received Saturday, increases the tax increases in the bill that \nwere previously $493 billion and are now $518 billion. As the Senator \nmentioned, with the tax credit businesses get, they up that a little \nbit but not enough to help most small businesses in light of the $518 \nbillion in tax increases in the first 10 years, and when it is fully \nimplemented it will be about $1 trillion. But the payroll tax that is \ngoing to hit a lot of small businesses was increased dramatically in \nthe managers' amendment. The individual mandate was almost doubled in \nthe managers' amendment. So the taxes in the bill go up with this \nproposal.\n  I guess my question is, with all these tax increases that are going \nto have a crushing impact on small businesses, does a suggestion such \nas the one made by the Senator from Tennessee for small business health \nplans require tax increases or Medicare cuts, which is what is going to \nbe necessary to finance this 2,700-page behemoth?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. The answer is \nno. The difficulty with a big, comprehensive plan is it sounds good but \nhas lots of unintended consequences. If our real concern right now is \nreducing costs in health care, then the idea of a small business health \ncare plan that has no new taxes and no new mandates but creates \nopportunities for small businesses to pool their resources and offer \nmore insurance at a lower cost to their employees would seem a logical \nplace to start.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the Senator for his work on that issue. It is \na view I share, a proposal I have been a big advocate of going back to \nmy days in the House of Representatives and one which, as the Senator \nfrom Tennessee noted, has tremendous support among small businesses \nacross the country. About the only place it does not have majority \nsupport is here in the U.S. Congress because maybe it makes too much \nsense.\n  But it seems to me there are suggestions and solutions out there \nwhich do not require $\\1/2\\ trillion of tax increases on small \nbusinesses, which every small business organization has come out and \nsaid: It is going to drive up our cost of doing business, and at the \nend of the day, it is going to raise our health care costs--and does \nnot require these steep Medicare cuts that the Senator from Wyoming has \nalluded to over and over again and the impacts those will have on the \ndelivery of health care to seniors across this country but, rather, it \nwould bend the cost curve down without tax increases and Medicare cuts.\n  Another example of that, I would argue, would be allowing for \ninterstate competition, allowing people to buy their insurance across \nState lines, which is a suggestion we have made over and over on our \nside of the aisle. According to the Congressional Budget Office, both \nsmall business health plans and buying insurance across State lines \nactually would reduce health care costs and would do it without raising \ntaxes or cutting Medicare, which, to me, would make a lot of sense, \nespecially when you have an economy in recession, 10-percent \nunemployment, a $1.5 trillion deficit last year and another $1.5 \ntrillion deficit this coming year, and when you are talking about a \n$2.5 trillion cost in the growth of government here in Washington, DC, \nto implement these 2,700 pages.\n  Some suggestions along the lines of the one mentioned by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and some of these others would make a lot of sense, and \nI think they would enjoy tremendous support among small businesses, \nwhich create the jobs in this country, as well as among the American \npublic.\n  So I thank the Senator from Tennessee for pointing out one of the \nmany things Republicans are for and which we have tried to get in the \ndebate.\n  I know the Senator from Wyoming has advocated for many of these same \ntypes of initiatives and solutions. As he mentioned earlier, he was \nprepared to offer an amendment to address the issue of premiums, but it \nlooks as if we are going to be prevented from doing that.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Our friends at the University of Minnesota said that if \npeople were allowed to shop across State lines, shop around for \ninsurance that is better for them and their family and their personal \nsituation, we would have 12 million more Americans insured today than \nwe have now, without a single page of legislation. That is all we need \nto do: allow people to shop across State lines. But when we talk about \nand look at this bill, which has mandates, there is going to be a \nmandate for people to buy insurance.\n\n[[Page S13673]]\n\n  One of the amendments I tried to offer yesterday that I thought made \na lot of sense for young people was that for individuals under the age \nof 30 or for those making less than $30,000 a year, they would be \nexempted from the mandate, the individual mandate that they have to buy \ninsurance.\n  I was involved in a discussion on a college campus in a debate on \nthis topic, and in talking to the students, they were astonished to \nlearn--because they were not focused on this; they were focused on \ntheir studies and working--they were astonished that they are all going \nto have to buy, as a matter of law, if this passes, health insurance \nimmediately, and if they do not, they are going to have to start paying \na tax or a fine, depending on how you describe it.\n  So in my amendment, I said, for those up to the age of 30 and making \nunder $30,000 a year, let's exempt them from the mandate. That \namendment was rejected.\n  Then I said, well, if they are going to do this and force these \npeople to buy insurance, and if they do not buy insurance, they have to \npay these excessive fines or taxes--or however you want to define it--I \nsaid, how about that the penalties these people would have to pay, if \nthey choose not to buy insurance--because it is going to be a lot \ncheaper to not buy insurance and to just pay the tax--what if that \nmoney could go into a personal account so that person can then use the \nmoney to then buy insurance? So it would be kind of like a savings \naccount, so the money would be there for them to buy insurance. So \nindividual mandate penalties would accrue not to the government but in \na personal account, so they could purchase health insurance within a 3-\nyear period. The money would accumulate. That amendment was rejected as \nwell.\n  So we have lots of ideas, good ideas, to help people with affordable \ncare, available care, and yet one after another they have been rejected \nin a step-by-step process to try to find ways to solve the health care \ncrisis we know faces the country. All 100 Members of the Senate know we \nneed to find ways to make health care more affordable and to work on \nhigh-quality care.\n  It has been fascinating to see the dean of the Johns Hopkins Medical \nCenter and the dean of Harvard and those who have looked at this bill \nclosely say that the people who are supporting this are living in \ncollective denial, that this bill is doomed to fail, that it will raise \nthe cost of care, not lower the cost of care, and will do nothing to \nimprove quality.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator from Wyoming would yield on that point, \nthat is why I think day after day after day--and I have said--there is \na pattern emerging here in the Senate where the majority comes down and \nestablishes the need for health care reform, which we all acknowledge, \nand illustrates examples of those who have fallen through the cracks, \nwhich we all know examples exist--all of us have dealt with those in \nour individual States--and then proceeds to attack Republicans for not \nhaving their own ideas, which we have just mentioned there are lots of \ngood Republican ideas which do not raise taxes, which do not cut \nMedicare, and actually do something to reduce premiums. But that seems \nto be the strategy employed and the pattern that emerges in the \nrhetoric day after day down here from the other side.\n  The one thing I do not hear is them coming down here and talking \nabout what this 2,700-page bill is going to do to reduce health care \ncosts, because if we all submit to the experts on this--which, as I \nsaid earlier, the Congressional Budget Office is sort of the referee. \nThey do not have a political agenda, or at least they are not supposed \nto. The Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does \nnot have a political agenda, or at least they are not supposed to. They \nare sort of considered to be an umpire on this. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation, which looks at the distributional impacts of tax policy, is a \nreferee and is not supposed to have a political agenda in all this. \nThey all come to the same conclusions with regard to premium increases \nin this bill.\n  So if the overall objective is to reduce the cost of health care, and \nif, in fact, your legislation, according to all the referees, all the \numpires, all the experts, not only increases premiums for most \nAmericans but increases the overall cost of health care, which is what \nthey all conclude, it is pretty hard to come down and defend this \nproduct. That is why I think day after day they try to create \ndistractions and counterattacks as opposed to actually coming down and \ntalking about the substance of the bill because the substance of the \nbill does not accomplish the stated objective, which is to reduce the \noverall cost of health care and get premiums under control for families \nand small businesses in this country.\n  It is also hard, I would argue, because of the $518 billion of tax \nincreases that are in here and the unified opposition of the entire \nsmall business community, which creates 70 percent of the jobs in this \ncountry, to talk about how this can be anything but detrimental to job \ncreation. This is going to cost us jobs. I think every business \norganization has made that abundantly clear. And all the analysis of \nthis legislation that has been done comes to the same conclusion.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. When you take a look at what the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services has done, which is the group that oversees \nMedicare, they have said that 10 years from now, if this goes through, \nyou are still going to have 24 million uninsured, you are going to have \n18 million more on Medicaid, the program the Senator from Tennessee \nappropriately referred to as having a bus ticket for a bus that is not \ngoing to come, because that is what has happened. Half the doctors in \nthe country do not take care of patients on Medicaid because the \nreimbursement is so low that they cannot afford to continue to care for \nthose people. Five million people will lose the insurance they get \nthrough work, and health care costs will go up. The cost curve will go \nup instead of going down. But the whole purpose of this was to help \ndrive the cost down.\n  Then, additionally, they said that 20 percent of providers--20 \npercent of the providers--of health care in this country--and that \nincludes physicians, nurse practitioners, medical clinics, hospitals--\n20 percent of the providers in this country, under this plan, 10 years \nfrom now, will be unprofitable, unable to keep their doors open.\n  So we have heard about sweetheart deals. We have heard about taxes \ngoing up. We have heard about Medicare cuts. And what we have seen is \none promise after another made by the President that has been \nunfulfilled and actually reversed by the bill we see ahead of us.\n  So I ask my friend from Tennessee, wouldn't he agree that in the next \n2 days, the best thing for the country would be to have this bill not \npass the Senate and instead go back in a step-by-step way and regain \nthe trust of the American people?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I certainly do agree with that.\n  I think most Americans, when presented with a problem, would not try \nto change it all at once but would say: Let's identify the goal which \nis reducing costs and go step by step.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a column by David Brooks in the New York Times on December 18.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 18, 2009]\n\n                            The Hardest Call\n\n       The first reason to support the Senate health care bill is \n     that it would provide insurance to 30 million more Americans.\n       The second reason to support the bill is that its authors \n     took the deficit issue seriously. Compared with, say, the \n     prescription drug benefit from a few years ago, this bill is \n     a model of fiscal rectitude. It spends a lot of money to \n     cover the uninsured, but to help pay for it, it also includes \n     serious Medicare cuts and whopping tax increases--the tax on \n     high-cost insurance plans alone will raise $1.1 trillion in \n     the second decade.\n       The bill is not really deficit-neutral. It's politically \n     inconceivable that Congress will really make all the spending \n     cuts that are there on paper. But the bill won't explode the \n     deficit, and that's an accomplishment.\n       The third reason to support the bill is that the authors \n     have thrown in a million little ideas in an effort to reduce \n     health care inflation. The fact is, nobody knows how to \n     reduce cost growth within the current system. The authors of \n     this bill are willing to try anything. You might even call \n     this a Burkean approach. They are not fundamentally \n     disrupting the status quo, but they are experimenting with \n     dozens of gradual programs that might bend the cost curve.\n       If you've ever heard about it, it's in there--improved \n     insurance exchanges, payment innovations, an independent \n     commission to\n\n[[Page S13674]]\n\n     cap Medicare payment rates, an innovation center, comparative \n     effectiveness research. There's at least a pilot program for \n     every promising idea.\n       The fourth reason to support the bill is that if this \n     fails, it will take a long time to get back to health reform. \n     Clinton failed. Obama will have failed. No one will touch \n     this. Meanwhile, health costs will continue their inexorable \n     march upward, strangling the nation.\n       The first reason to oppose this bill is that it does not \n     fundamentally reform health care. The current system is \n     rotten to the bone with opaque pricing and insane incentives. \n     Consumers are insulated from the costs of their decisions and \n     providers are punished for efficiency. Burkean gradualism is \n     fine if you've got a cold. But if you've got cancer, you want \n     surgery, not nasal spray.\n       If this bill passes, you'll have 500 experts in Washington \n     trying to hold down costs and 300 million Americans with the \n     same old incentives to get more and more care. The \n     Congressional Budget Office and most of the experts I talk to \n     (including many who support the bill) do not believe it will \n     seriously bend the cost curve.\n       The second reason to oppose this bill is that, according to \n     the chief actuary for Medicare, it will cause national health \n     care spending to increase faster. Health care spending is \n     already zooming past 17 percent of G.D.R. to 22 percent and \n     beyond. If these pressures mount even faster, health care \n     will squeeze out everything else, especially on the state \n     level. We'll shovel more money into insurance companies and \n     you can kiss goodbye programs like expanded preschool that \n     would have a bigger social impact.\n       Third, if passed, the bill sets up a politically \n     unsustainable situation. Over its first several years, the \n     demand for health care will rise sharply. The supply will \n     not. Providers will have the same perverse incentives. As a \n     result, prices will skyrocket while efficiencies will not. \n     There will be a bipartisan rush to gut reform.\n       This country has reduced health inflation in short bursts, \n     but it has not sustained cost control over the long term \n     because the deep flaws in the system produce horrific \n     political pressures that gut restraint.\n       Fourth, you can't centrally regulate 17 percent of the U.S. \n     economy without a raft of unintended consequences.\n       Fifth, it will slow innovation. Government regulators don't \n     do well with disruptive new technologies.\n       Sixth, if this passes, we will never get back to cost \n     control. The basic political deal was, we get to have dessert \n     (expanding coverage) but we have to eat our spinach (cost \n     control), too. If we eat dessert now, we'll never come back \n     to the spinach.\n       So what's my verdict? I have to confess, I flip-flop week \n     to week and day to day. It's a guess. Does this put us on a \n     path toward the real reform, or does it head us down a valley \n     in which real reform will be less likely?\n       If I were a senator forced to vote today, I'd vote no. If \n     you pass a health care bill without systemic incentives \n     reform, you set up a political vortex in which the few good \n     parts of the bill will get stripped out and the expensive and \n     wasteful parts will be entrenched.\n       Defenders say we can't do real reform because the politics \n     won't allow it. The truth is the reverse. Unless you get the \n     fundamental incentives right, the politics will be terrible \n     forever and ever.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Most of us--we are pretty split up here: 60 there, 40 \nhere. They are for it, and we are against it, this bill anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we heard our Republican friends say it \nis very hard to defend our bill. Maybe it is hard for them, but it is \nnot hard for the American Medical Association, the AMA, which has \nendorsed our bill. It is not hard for the American Heart Association, \nwhich has endorsed our bill. It is not hard for the American Cancer \nSociety Action Network, which has endorsed our bill. The American \nHospital Association has endorsed our bill. Families USA, the Business \nRoundtable, the Small Business Majority--we hear colleagues say small \nbusiness opposes our bill. The Small Business Majority Organization \nsupports it. And how about the AARP, which represents our seniors, \nmillions of seniors. Those are a few. They not only defend our bill, \nthey support our bill.\n  This is indeed an important moment in our Nation's history as we \napproach a final vote on major health care reform legislation. I think \nwhenever you are trying to change something, you have to take a look at \nhow things are at the moment. So why is it we voted to change our \ncurrent system? There are certain numbers that I think explain it. The \nfirst number is 14,000. We know that every single day 14,000 of our \nneighbors lose their health insurance through no fault of their own. \nThey either lose their job, they can't afford to keep up the health \ninsurance or they have a condition and the insurance company walks away \nfrom them or they are priced out of the market. Fourteen thousand a \nday. That is cruel, and we need to change it.\n  Sixty-two percent of bankruptcies are linked to health care crises. \nWe are the only nation in the world where people go broke because they \nget sick.\n  If we do nothing, 45 percent of an average family's income will go \nfor premiums in 2016. I ask everyone to think about it, paying 45 \npercent of your income for premiums. It is not sustainable. What about \nfood? What about clothing? What about shelter? Can't do it.\n  We are 29th in the world in infant mortality. We come in behind Cuba. \nWe come in behind Singapore. We come in behind South Korea. We are 29th \nin the world on infant mortality because people don't have good \ninsurance or they don't have any insurance.\n  Fifty-two percent of women--fifty-two percent of women--don't seek \nthe health care they need. They either put it off or they never get it \nbecause they may not be insured or they are afraid of the copays. They \nare afraid of what it would cost. They may have limits on their \npolicies. We need to change that.\n  The United States spends twice as much on health care as most other \nindustrialized nations. So what is the message here? We spend a huge \namount. We are not doing very well in outcomes. By the way, I think we \nare 24th in life expectancy in the world--24th. We must do better.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues some of the letters and e-mails \nthat have been sent to me from Californians that personalize the \nstatistics I spoke about.\n  Mr. William Robinson wrote:\n\n       I am about to be laid off from the job I have had for 19 \n     years. My biggest fear is not being employed, but being able \n     to find and get affordable health care. I am 60 years old. I \n     have a preexisting condition that will for certain make it \n     impossible for me to buy health insurance.\n\n  Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert De La Cruz wrote:\n\n       We are at the point of losing our home because we have \n     spent our savings on medical and prescription drugs. I am 67, \n     retired, and my wife is 62. Because of the Medicare gap in \n     prescription drug coverage, we have had to pay $600 a month \n     on prescription drugs. It's a huge portion of our monthly \n     income. We will be selling our home shortly and perhaps \n     moving in with one of our children because there doesn't seem \n     to be any option.\n\n  Well, I want to say to Mr. De La Cruz: Help is on the way. If we get \nthe 60 votes we are forced to get--not 51, a majority, but 60 votes \nbecause of a Republican filibuster--if we get those 60 votes each time, \nthere is hope for you because we are going to fix that entire problem.\n  Mr. Ronald Kim says:\n\n       I am in the construction industry and my work is very slow.\n\n  He says he is in the design industry.\n\n       I am in danger of becoming financially ill and I am looking \n     for ways to stay healthy, and one way may be to eliminate my \n     medical insurance. It is a significant part of my budget. \n     This may, heaven forbid, lead me to financial ruin if I get \n     injured or sick. This is my situation.\n\n  I want to say to Mr. Kim: Help is on the way.\n  Ms. Madeleine Foot wrote--these are all Californians, my \nconstituents:\n\n       I recently turned 25 and I lost my health coverage under my \n     parents. I attempted to get coverage under a Blue Cross plan \n     created for young people my age, but because I had taken \n     medications, I was denied. I applied again for another plan, \n     was offered a plan with a $3,000 deductible, and it was $300 \n     a month on top of that. As a young person working in a \n     restaurant, repaying student loans and trying to make it on \n     my own, this is a huge financial burden. I cannot afford an \n     insurance that charges me so much and won't be any benefit \n     for me until I have shelled out a huge portion of my income.\n\n  To Madeleine Foot I say: Help is on the way, if we can break the \nRepublican filibuster.\n  Mr. John Higdon wrote:\n\n       As a self-employed person, I had a pacemaker implanted. The \n     cost was borne entirely by me at prices much higher than any \n     insurance company would have had to pay. That was a wakeup \n     call to get health insurance. I am told by every health \n     insurance company I have contacted that no one will offer me \n     health insurance at any price with a ``preexisting heart \n     condition.''\n\n  I wish to say to Mr. Higdon: Help is on the way.\n  Dr. Robert Meagher, a pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente for over 30\n\n[[Page S13675]]\n\nyears, do you know what he wrote and told me? That he has to fake--he \nis pressured to fake a diagnosis because when a parent comes in with a \nyoung child with asthma, they beg him not to write down asthma but \nwrite down bronchitis, because if he writes down asthma, that child \nwill have a preexisting condition and when she turns 21 she won't be \nable to get insurance. Imagine, in America, a physician being pressured \nto lie on a form because of a health care system that is so cruel.\n  So, Dr. Meagher, we are going to change things here if we can break \nthis filibuster.\n  Mr. Douglas Ingoldsby wrote:\n\n       I own a small business. I employ 11 people. I have been in \n     business in California since 1972.\n\n  He says:\n\n       I used to provide health care for all my employees and all \n     the members of their families, and if I want to remain \n     profitable enough to stay in business now, I can't do it \n     anymore.\n\n  He can only cover the employees, not their families. He feels \nterrible about it, and he says he may have to cut off his employees if \nprices keep going up.\n  I want to say to this fine small business owner: Douglas, help is on \nthe way.\n  Mrs. Linda Schumacher wrote--and this is the one I will close with in \nthis series of stories:\n\n       I am a Republican.\n\n  Let me repeat what she writes:\n\n       I am a Republican, and my husband and I are small business \n     owners. The Senators and Congressmen of both parties who are \n     against President Obama's plan have their own insurance, and \n     it is my understanding that it does not cost what we pay. \n     They do not understand what a huge expense this is. Please \n     listen to the middle class who are in our position or who no \n     longer have insurance. It keeps me up at night worrying. This \n     time the Republicans have it wrong, and they need to know. \n     Please push the health plan. The insurance companies only \n     care about the bottom line, not people.\n\n  I wish to say to Mrs. Schumacher: Thank you for putting aside party \npolitics, because this isn't about Republicans and it isn't about \nDemocrats and it isn't about Independents. It is about all of us \ntogether.\n  What happens now? We are hearing the polls, and the polls show \nAmericans don't want us to act. I understand why. There has been so \nmuch misinformation. Senator Durbin, our assistant majority leader, and \nI were talking about the misinformation that is on this floor from the \nother side day in and day out, and I believe much of it, if I might \nsay, is purposeful. If you listened to my Republican colleagues over \nthe past few days and weeks, they have trashed this bill and they have \ntrashed the process. Over the weekend the Republican leader said health \nreform is a legislative train wreck of historic proportions. That is a \ndirect quote.\n\n  Earlier this month Senator Coburn used more inflammatory language \nwhen he said to seniors--I am quoting Senator Coburn: I have a message \nfor you. You are going to die soon.\n  If you want to know what fearmongering is, that is the best example I \ncan give you.\n  I decided to go back and look at the past Congressional Records. I \nthought: Have Republicans spoken like this over the years every time we \nhave tried to do some health care, every time we have tried to make \nlife better for people, such as Social Security? I will let you be the \njudge.\n  In 1935, on the floor of the House of Representatives during the \ndebate on Social Security, Republican Congressman Jenkins of Ohio \nsaid--a Social Security bill, remember, which hadn't passed:\n\n       This is compulsion of the rankest kind. Do not be misled by \n     the title. The title says ``Old-Age Benefits.'' Shame on you \n     for putting such a misleading and unfair title on such a \n     nefarious bill. Old age benefits? Think of it. Oh, what a \n     travesty! . . . Mr. Chairman, what is the hurry? Nobody is \n     going to get a dime out of this until 1942 . . . what is the \n     hurry about crowding an unconstitutional proposition like \n     this through the House today?\n\n  If you listen to some of my colleagues, you will hear the same thing. \nWhat is the rush? As a matter of fact, they had four or five amendments \nto send it back to committee. What is the rush?\n  The rush is that 14,000 people are losing their health care every \nday. The rush is that 62 percent of bankruptcies are linked to a health \ncare crisis, and in 2016 our people will be paying almost half of their \nincome for premiums. Yes. We have to do this, and we started it 7 \nmonths ago, and 100 years ago Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican President, \nput it in his platform. What is the rush? What is the rush?\n  I wish to tell my colleagues about another Republican Congressman, J. \nWilliam Ditter of Pennsylvania. This is what he said during the debate \non Social Security:\n\n       . . . security for the individual, whether worker or aged, \n     will be a mockery and a sham.\n\n  This is what he said about Social Security.\n\n       And it will allot to our people the role of puppets in a \n     socialistic State.\n\n  That is what he said back then. I tell you, if you ask Republicans \nwho are getting Social Security, Democrats who are getting Social \nSecurity, Independents who are getting Social Security, they will all \ntell you the same thing: Keep your hands off it. It works. It is good. \nIt is fair. It is insurance.\n  It is what we did way back then.\n  In 1965, when Medicare passed, health care for those 65 and up, \nRepublican Senator Carl Curtis said:\n\n       It is socialism. It moves the country in a direction which \n     is not good for anyone.\n\n  Years later, we know Newt Gingrich when he was Speaker of the House \nsaid he wanted to see Medicare ``wither on the vine,'' his words.\n  In 1995, while seeking the Republican nomination for President, \nSenator Bob Dole said:\n\n       I was there in 1965 fighting the fight, voting against \n     Medicare, because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.\n\n  So when you hear our Republican friends say, Oh, my goodness, they \nare making a lot of savings in Medicare; this is bad for the seniors, \nplease, please, which party has stood for protecting our seniors? It is \nnot a matter of being partisan; it is just the fact.\n  The echoes of the past fill this Chamber.\n  I am convinced now in 2009 that hope and reason and determination and \ngood policy will triumph over fear and obstruction and the status quo.\n  Let's look at the immediate and near-term changes for the better that \npeople are going to have, because our colleagues say: Oh, we are \nraising revenues but there are no benefits right away.\n  Let's talk about what the benefits are. There will be a $5 billion \nhigh-risk pool immediately for people with preexisting conditions who \ncannot find insurance. There will be reinsurance for retirees, so if \nyou are retired and you are getting your health care benefit and \nsomething happens to your company, there will be reinsurance so you can \nstill get your benefits. We close that doughnut hole for the Medicare \nrecipients who fall into it and suddenly they cannot afford their \nprescription drugs. There will be billions of tax credits--billions--up \nto 50 percent tax credits for small businesses. That is why we have the \nsupport of so many small businesses. For new policies, no \ndiscrimination against children with preexisting conditions, and \nchildren can stay on their family's policy until they are 26 years of \nage.\n  What else are the immediate and near-term changes for the better? For \nnew policies, no lifetime limits, no more rescissions. They cannot walk \naway from you when you get sick. They are required to cover essential \npreventive health benefits such as mammograms. It prohibits \ndiscrimination by employers based on salary of their employees. An \nemployer cannot say: If you earn over $250,000, you get these great \nbenefits, but if you earn under $50,000, you get a worse array.\n  By 2011, standards for insurance overhead costs go into place. If \nyour insurance company spends too much on overhead and too much on \nexecutive pay, let me tell you what happens. They have to rebate to \nyou, the policyholder. We also see increased funding for community \nhealth care centers. This is going to make a huge difference. There \nwill be a national Web site to shop for affordable insurance. There \nwill be a long-term care program that is voluntary into which you can \nbuy. Insurance companies with unreasonable premium increases can be \nbarred from the exchanges that will be set up in 2014. So they will be \nmaking sure they do not increase your premiums beyond a reasonable \namount.\n\n[[Page S13676]]\n\n  This bill will benefit the insured in one way--I do not think people \nunderstand this--by 2014; 62 percent of families will no longer face \nunsustainable premium costs. If you are a family of four and make less \nthan $88,000 a year, you will never have to pay more than 9.8 percent \nof your income on health insurance premiums. This is an amazing thing \nmost people do not focus on. I just explained that the nonpartisan \nstudies show--and this is important--that they will be paying, the \naverage family, 45 percent of their income for health care. In 2014, \npeople in this country will not have to pay more than 9.8 percent of \ntheir income on health insurance; otherwise, they will get tax credits. \nThat is very important.\n  This bill is going to benefit our seniors. That is why it is endorsed \nby the AARP. We eliminate the prescription drug coverage gap. That is \nthe doughnut hole. We extend the life of the Medicare trust fund by 9 \nyears. We reduce waste and fraud in Medicare. We provide for free \nyearly wellness visits for seniors. This bill saves Medicare. This bill \nmakes our seniors stronger. They will have more benefits, and they can \nnever lose their guaranteed benefits.\n  Small businesses will be able to reduce their costs, again, by \ngetting immediate tax credits. In 2014, they will be able to access the \nexchange, as will self-employed people. They will have the power of big \nbusiness behind them as they go into those exchanges.\n  I want to talk about public interest provisions. I wanted a public \noption, let me be clear, because I felt it would keep the insurance \ncompanies honest. But let me tell you what we have in here that are \ndefinitely public interest provisions. We expand Medicaid. That is a \npublic plan to cover an additional 14 million people, and that starts \nin 2014. That is 1.5 million Californians. In my State, the Federal \nGovernment will pay the full fare for those added people for 3 years, \nand after that, far more than we get paid now. HHS will set the initial \nrules for the State exchanges. So those getting into the exchanges have \nto be fair. The OPM plan--that is the plan that will be part of the \nexchange--will be set up by the government, the Office of Personnel \nManagement.\n  Again, community health centers. A basic plan can be created by the \nStates, which I think is very important. I thank Maria Cantwell for \nworking so hard on that issue.\n  If people tell you we do not have anything to do with public options, \nthey are really not right. You have to look carefully at this bill.\n  I want to talk about the deficit. We reduce the deficit between 2010 \nand 2019 by $132 billion, and between 2020 and 2029, there is up to a \n$1.3 trillion deficit reduction, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. That is a nonpartisan office. This bill reduces the deficit. I \nam going to say it one more time. This bill reduces the deficit. And \nthe reason is, we invest in prevention, and that pays off. We finally \nwill be able to say to the insurance companies: Stop your gouging. And \nthat pays off. We do have competition now because we will have that \nspecial plan run by OPM, the State option Maria Cantwell put in there. \nThis is why we see the reduction, including taking the fraud and the \nwaste out of Medicare. We do not need fraud and waste.\n  Here is how I want to close. Health care coverage for all Americans \nhas been such an elusive goal for nearly a century. If you look at \nRepublican Presidents, Democratic Presidents, Republican Congresses, \nand Democratic Congresses, we have tried it over and over again, and \nthe status quo has always prevailed.\n  Our beloved friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, whom we miss so much, \nparticularly during a time such as this, fought for health care right \nhere on the floor from the moment he became a Senator in 1962 to the \nmoment he died. In an op-ed in the Washington Post this past Friday, \nTed Kennedy's wife Vicki wrote:\n\n       Ted often said that we can't let the perfect be the enemy \n     of the good.\n\n  I want to say to Vicki, she is exactly right. Each of us could write \nthis bill our way. Believe me, if I wrote a bill, to me it would be \nperfect. But to my friend in the chair, she would say: I can make it \nbetter. And all of us could. This is the legislative process. This is a \ngood bill.\n  Vicki goes on to say:\n\n       The bill before the Senate, while imperfect, would achieve \n     many of the goals Ted fought for during the 40 years he \n     championed access to quality, affordable health care for all \n     Americans.\n\n  He is not here to urge us not to let this chance slip through our \nfingers.\n  And she says:\n\n       So I humbly ask his colleagues to finish the work of his \n     life, the work of generations, to allow the vote to go \n     forward and to pass health-care reform now. As Ted always \n     said, when it's finally done, the people will wonder what \n     took so long.\n\n  I thank Vicki, not only for writing that wonderful editorial but for \nactually being in the Chamber when we took that first vote to break \ndown this filibuster.\n  I say to my colleagues, I am so proud that today we are moving closer \nto fulfilling the promise of health care for all Americans, including \nthe 40 million Californians I am so privileged to represent. I thank my \ncolleagues for all the work they put into this bill. I spent a lot of \ntime on it myself, and this moment is very poignant. I hope we pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, let me begin by commending the Senator \nfrom California for an outstanding presentation regarding this \nlegislation. I was listening to her in my office before I came over to \nthe Chamber. I listened to her over here. She laid out in a very \ncareful, deliberate, and thoughtful way the realities about this \nlegislation before us. I thank her for a terrific presentation.\n  I wish to pick up a little bit where she has left off. But let me \ninquire so I understand where we are. How much time is remaining on the \nmajority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 34\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me begin by saying I also listened to our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, particularly the Senator from South Dakota, just a \nlittle while ago. I was really struck by the chart they put up showing \nMedicare going up and up and up, and then they talk to Americans, \nbasically scaring them, trying to say: If you pass this bill, it is not \ngoing to do anything to reduce the crisis in Medicare down the road.\n  The reality is, that is all they present, is the scary picture of a \nfuture which they are not even describing accurately. They have had a \nyear and a half--a year and a half--that we have been working on this \nlegislation, since it was announced in the Finance Committee, on which \nI serve, and we held a day-long--I think a 2-day long conference over \nat the Library of Congress and within the committee where we began the \nwork, laying the groundwork and foundation for a new Presidency and for \nthe work that has gone on this year. Many of their Members took part in \nthat. So there is no secret here as to where we are.\n  This is a debate that has gone on in the United States of America \nsince Harry Truman was President of the United States and before. We \nall know that President Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican, put before the \ncountry the notion that every American should be able to have their \nsickness dealt with.\n  Nobody has ever contemplated that you ought to go bankrupt in order \nto have health care. But, as we know, we have more bankruptcies in \nAmerica--health care bankruptcies--every year than any other nation on \nthe planet. I think we are the only nation that really knows health \ncare bankruptcy. The stories we have heard--countless stories.\n  Earlier this morning--I guess to get my times correct--when we were \nhere at 1 in the morning, we heard the majority leader talk about those \nvery poignant, moving situations of individuals in Nevada. We heard the \nSenator from California. There are stories from every Senator, from \nevery State. Yet it is only this dividing line, right here down the \ncenter of this Chamber--it is only the Senators on this side of that \ndividing line who seem to be prepared to try to address this issue. The \nfact is, the managers' amendment, which is now the pending business \nbefore the Senate, brings us even closer to being able to address many \nof the major concerns we have.\n\n[[Page S13677]]\n\n  Senator after Senator has come to the floor and described the way in \nwhich this bill does not do everything we want it to do. I have been a \npassionate supporter, as was Ted Kennedy and a lot of our colleagues, \nof a public component of this plan. Why? Because I believe that is the \nbest way to create the kind of competitive pressure that will restrain \na group of insurance companies that have shown no predilection to \nrestraining themselves over these past years.\n  If you are for the status quo, then you will vote no, the way our \ncolleagues have voted. But the American people are not satisfied with \nthe status quo. People in America understand that health care costs are \nbreaking the backs of families. They are breaking the backs of \nbusinesses. They are a huge albatross around the neck of American \ncompetitiveness.\n  Many of our companies have a harder time competing because there is a \nhealth care premium tax, if you will, for the uneven distribution of \nbeing sick in America. Obviously, if you are sick in America, you get \ncare at some point in time. It may well be that point in time is when \nyou are on your deathbed or when you are so sick that you finally go \ninto the hospital, into an emergency room, and the emergency room \nbecomes your first contact with the medical system or it becomes your \nprimary care facility. We have almost 50 million Americans for whom \nthat is true--50 million Americans who don't have health care. So they \ndo not get an early screening, they do not get an early determination \nof what may be wrong with them. They do not get what somebody who has a \nhealth care plan gets, which may be a mammogram or a Pap smear or a PSA \ntest for prostate cancer, or any number of evaluations, perhaps early \ndetection of diabetes.\n\n  We spend almost $100 billion in the United States for unnecessary \ndialysis and/or amputations that take place because people weren't able \nto go to a doctor earlier and learn that they had a type of diabetes \nthat might have been able to be treated in a far less expensive and \ndramatic and personally costly way.\n  The word ``history'' gets thrown around in the Senate probably more \nthan it ought to. We often refer to something as being historic, where \nsometimes it is a reach. There is no question that we are on the \nthreshold of an unbelievably historic moment in the Senate. This is \nhistory we are living here now.\n  When I think of what we tried to do in 1993 and 1994, when President \nClinton was in office and we tried to pass health care--we got beaten \nback by false advertisements--Harry and Louise--scare tactics, and I \nmight add a plan that didn't quite pull the pieces together as \neffectively as we have. We have learned a lot of lessons since then. We \nhave had many fits and starts, with children's health care, \nportability, and trying to deal with certain gender discrimination or \nother discrimination within the systems. We have gotten little pieces \ndone. But all the time, the basics of the system have been without the \nreform necessary to bring down costs and make health care more \naccessible to more Americans.\n  So I have no doubt we are reaching a moment of historic importance \nhere. This is a moment where we are going to finally provide access to \nalmost all Americans. Thirty-one million Americans are going to gain \nhealth care coverage through this legislation when we pass it, and that \nwill bring us up to 94 percent.\n  To give an example, in Massachusetts, where we passed health care \nreform a couple of years ago, we mandated that everybody be covered and \nwe created a penalty for companies that don't offer the insurance, but \nwe have a pool that helps provide coverage to people who can't afford \nit. We now have 97.6 percent of all our citizens covered in the State \nof Massachusetts. The fact is the premiums in the individual market, \nwhich is where it is most expensive for Americans to go out and buy \nhealth insurance, went down by 40 percent. The premiums went down by 40 \npercent in Massachusetts for a quality of care that people love. The \npremiums in the rest of the country went up 14 percent. That is a 54-\npercent spread in the cost of premiums between those who got health \ncare reform and those who did not.\n  That is precisely what we are going to be able to provide Americans--\nbeginning to provide Americans with this. One of the reasons we can't \nprovide it as effectively as in Massachusetts is because there are \ncertain things we do in Massachusetts that the other side, or some \nfolks, have prevented us from being able to do here.\n  Let me sort of lay it out here. There are a couple of things that \nbother me about this. We keep hearing from our colleagues--and I heard \nthis from the Senator from South Dakota--that we are not going to be \nable to save money in the legislation we are going to pass. In fact, \nnothing could be farther from the truth. All of us know, as a matter of \ncommon sense, that many of the measures in this legislation are going \nto reduce the cost of health care, and one of the reasons is that the \nCBO analysis is generally limited to the Federal budget. It doesn't \nattempt to account for savings in the health care system that come from \npolicies that are implemented through reforms.\n  For example: The CBO found only $19 billion in government savings \nfrom transitioning toward post-acute bundled payments in Medicare. But \nrecent research in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that \nbundled payments--bundled payment, for somebody listening who doesn't \nunderstand, is when you take all the payments that come to a hospital \nor to the providers who provide the care, and the payments are all put \ntogether for the various services that you get and they have to decide \nhow to provide you those services in a cost-effective way based on the \nwhole universe of money that has been put on the table. It is different \nfrom what we do today, where we don't bundle it and say: Take care of \nthis patient, and all of your various parts have to fit into a whole. \nToday, we pay each of the separate parts without relationship to what \ntheir connection is to the total care of a patient. It is unbelievably \nwasteful, ineffective, sometimes redundant, it is noncommunicative, and \nthat is one of the reasons why in America we don't get the same \noutcomes for less money that people get in Europe or in some other \ncountries.\n  But we have learned from the New England Journal of Medicine, which \nis a highly respected medical journal, that the bundled payments for \nchronic diseases and for elective surgeries could reduce health care \nspending by as much as 5.4 percent from 2010 to 2019. Yet we don't \ncredit for that savings. They do not talk about it. But common sense \ntells us, because we have seen it where they have done these bundled \npayments, that you are going to reduce the costs.\n  In addition, even if such savings only applied to half of the \nspending in the health care sector, the result would be more than $900 \nbillion of savings over the next 10 years. If bundled payments get \nexpanded beyond the post-acute care, and even half of the potential \nsavings from bundled payments were realized in the Medicare Program \nduring the upcoming decade, these savings would translate to an \nadditional .2 percent of savings per year or reduction in program \nexpenditures, and that would be more than $190 billion between 2010 and \n2019.\n  I have talked about $1 trillion--$1 trillion--of savings that does \nnot even get formally presented to the American people as part of this \nprocess because of bureaucratic technical rules about what the budget \napplies to. Everybody on the other side of this aisle knows, as a \nmatter of common sense, if you look at the experience, the way it has \nalready been proven in the marketplace, and if you apply your thinking \nto this, we are going to reduce the cost of health care.\n  Similarly, large reductions in Federal health care expenditures are \nplausible from the combination of other delivery system reforms. A lot \nof Americans aren't aware of this, but here is what we have. \nAccountable care organizations. We don't have that today. Suddenly, we \nare going to have an accountability in the care organizations \ndelivering service. That is going to provide savings.\n  We have incentives to reduce hospital-acquired infections. One of the \nbiggest single fears people have today in America when they go to the \nhospital is that they are actually going to get an infection in the \nhospital, and the chances of coming up with a staph infection or some \nother kind of infection are very real and very high. There\n\n[[Page S13678]]\n\nare actually different practices between different hospital operations. \nI happen to know this on a personal basis because my wife recently had \nan operation in one hospital system and they had a certain procedure to \ntry to deal with the MRSA infection, and a certain washing and \ndisinfection process you went through, and I know other hospitals where \nthey do not do the same thing.\n  In addition, we are going to have health information technology \nreform adoption. There is going to be administrative simplification \nthat would standardize and streamline insurance paperwork. I mean, if \nyou go to the ATM machine and pull out some money, it is about a penny \nor half a penny per transaction. If you go to the hospital, where they \ndo not have technology managing the records and people are doing it, it \nis about $20 to $25 per transaction to pull the records. In the age of \ncomputerization and information technology, it doesn't make sense, and \nall of us know that. But we also know that because we are putting money \non the table and incentives in place to help do that, we are going to \nbe able to get additional savings; all of the savings that are on top \nof the $1 trillion of savings I have already talked about, and none of \nwhich gets measured when our colleagues come to the floor to say what a \nterrible bill this is.\n\n  CBO has also grossly underestimated savings in the past. I am not \npicking on CBO. They have had an incredibly hard job, and they have \ndone an incredible job. They have been completely overworked on any \nnumber of efforts, where we have been asking for models and analyses. \nBut it is automatic in a process that you are going to lose some \nthings.\n  According to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association:\n\n       In 1984, it was predicted that the Hatch-Waxman Act would \n     save our country $1 billion in the first decade. Now, generic \n     medicines save more than that every three days.\n\n  Every 3 days we do what was predicted to happen in savings every 10 \nyears. In the mid 1990s, the Congressional Budget Office released an \nanalysis showing that in 1994--the tenth anniversary of the Hatch-\nWaxman Act--annual savings of generics had reached approximately $8 \nbillion to $10 billion. The new data released showed that by 1999--15 \nyears after Hatch-Waxman became law--generics were generating $49 \nbillion in annual savings. In the last decade alone, generics have \nsaved consumers, businesses, State and Federal governments $734 \nbillion.\n  I haven't even talked about the wellness provisions or the prevention \nprovisions that are in here. When we start getting all of America more \ntuned in to the things we can do to prevent diseases by taking actions \nin our lives, our lifestyles, in our diet, and any other number of \nthings, we can bring the cost of health care down in America.\n  We keep hearing about the secrecy and how this legislation has been \nhidden from folks for a long period of time. Again, that is not true. \nThere is nothing in this legislation that we haven't been working on or \ntalking about or wrestling with in committee, out of committee, in \nhearings, in the public debate for over a year now. If the minority had \ntaken a little less time to have press conferences and spending their \ntime doing news conferences denouncing what they hadn't analyzed, they \nwould have a better sense they might have been able to read the \nmanagers' amendment on the Internet for over a month--excuse me, the \nmanagers' amendment was on the Internet on Saturday, and many of us \nlooked at it, because many of us have worked on provisions and we \nwanted to make sure they were in there. It wasn't hard to read it to \nsee what was and wasn't included in it. In addition, the underlying \nbill has been posted on the Web for over 1 month.\n  But the fact is the minority has made a fundamental political \ncalculation here. They do not want to work with us. In all the time we \nwere in the Finance Committee trying to mark it up, we never had people \ncome to us--as I often have here in the 25 years I have been here when \nyou are legislating seriously--and say, hey, if you include this or if \nyou work this a little or if you tweak this, I think I could support \nthis bill. There is just a fundamental political divide, a fundamental \nphilosophical divide. We are looking at a party whose opposition to \nhealth care for Americans is not new. My colleague from California \ntalked about it a few minutes ago. In 1935, they tried to kill Social \nSecurity and succeeded in preventing health care from being included in \nthe bill at that time. They argued in 1935 the same thing they argue \nnow.\n  Madam President, may I ask how much time we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. And is that predesignated? Is the 15 minutes remaining \npredesignated, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not by order.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, in fairness, I was not aware; I thought I \nhad the full amount of time, but I do not. I want the Senator from \nConnecticut to be able to share his thoughts also. Let me just say, and \nI will wrap it up here, that the insurance industry, which they sought \nto protect, survived the passage of the Social Security Act. In 1965, \nwe passed Medicare. Medicaid came afterward. They opposed it. They \nopposed Medicare, one of the most important programs in the United \nStates of America, that lifted countless numbers of seniors out of \npoverty. They said no. The insurance industry survived Medicare and \nMedicaid. They are doing very well.\n  According to CBO, the gross cost of the managers' amendment is, over \nthe next 10 years, $871 billion--less than the $1 trillion we started \nwith in our committee. But it buys a lot. I will talk at some time, \nperhaps tomorrow or afterward, about what this bill provides in \naddition. But I think it is critical for people to follow the truth, to \nlook for the facts, and to measure the reality of the positive ways in \nwhich this legislation will provide additional help to seniors, will \nreduce premiums for many Americans, will help people afford coverage \nwho do not have it today, will spread risks throughout the system more \neffectively, will improve care and delivery within the hospitals, will \nprevent people from being denied insurance if they have a preexisting \ncondition, will prevent them from being kicked off insurance they paid \nfor and thought they had when they get sick and they suddenly get that \nletter that says: Sorry, you are not covered anymore, and families go \nbankrupt--that is over. That alone is an enormous step forward for this \ncountry.\n  CBO has underestimated savings before.\n  According to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association . . . ``In 1984, \nit was predicted that the Hatch-Waxman Act would save our country $1 \nbillion in the first decade. Now, generic medicines save more than that \nevery three days.''\n  In the mid 1990s, the Congressional Budget Office released an \nanalysis showing that in 1994, the 10th anniversary of the enactment of \nHatch-Waxman, annual savings from generics had reached approximately $8 \nbillion to $10 billion.\n  The new data released showed that by 1999--15 years after Hatch-\nWaxman became law--generics were generating $49 billion in annual \nsavings.\n  In the last decade alone, generics have saved consumers, businesses, \nand State and Federal Governments $734 billion.\n  According to a December 14 report by the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisors: CBO's analysis is generally limited to the Federal \nbudget, and does not attempt to account for savings in the health care \nsystem more broadly from policies implemented through reform. For \nexample, the CBO found only $19 billion in Federal Government savings \nfrom transitioning toward post-acute bundled payments in Medicare. \nHowever, recent research published in the New England Journal of \nMedicine suggests that bundled payments for chronic diseases and \nelective surgeries could reduce health care spending by as much as 5.4 \npercent from 2010 to 2019. Even if such savings applied to only half of \nspending in the health care sector, the result would be more than $900 \nbillion of savings over the decade. If bundled payments were expanded \nbeyond post-acute care and even half of\n\n[[Page S13679]]\n\nthe potential savings from bundled payments were realized in the \nMedicare program during the upcoming decade, these savings would \ntranslate to an additional 0.2 percent per year reduction in program \nexpenditures, or more than $190 billion between 2010 and 2019.\n  Similarly large reductions in Federal health care expenditures are \nplausible from the combination of other delivery system reforms, \nincluding: Accountable care organizations, incentives to reduce \nhospital-acquired infections, health information technology adoption, \nand administrative simplification that would standardize and streamline \ninsurance paperwork. This will help cut down on the $23-$31 billion \ntime cost to medical practices of interacting with health plans and \ntheir administrators.\n  Another potentially significant cost saver within the Senate bill is \nthe Independent Medicare Advisory Board--IMAB. The IMAB would recommend \nchanges to the Medicare program that would both improve the quality of \ncare and also reduce the growth rate of program spending. The CBO score \nof the Senate bill estimates that the IMAB would reduce Medicare \nspending by $23 billion from 2015 to 2019, with the savings likely to \ncontinue in the subsequent decade. The IMAB has the potential to \nincrease the savings from many of the delivery system reforms described \nabove, which may not be fully captured by the CBO estimates for the \nreasons previously mentioned.\n  Taken together, the combination of Medicare- and Medicaid-related \nprovisions in the Senate's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nare estimated to reduce the annual growth rate of Federal spending on \nboth programs by 1.0 percentage point in the upcoming decade and by an \neven greater amount in the subsequent decade. These savings would \nincrease national savings and improve the long-run performance of the \nU.S. economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to declare and explain my \nsupport for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. First, I \ncommend Senator Reid and all those who worked so long and hard, \nincluding my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for \nall they have achieved in this legislation. The truth is, no piece of \nlegislation, as significant and complicated as this is, could possibly \nbe totally satisfying to every one of us. In the end, each one of us \nhas to ask ourselves: Do the positives in this legislation \nsubstantially outweigh the negatives? Are the things we like in the \nbill greater than the things that worry us? For me, the answer to both \nthese questions is yes, because this bill makes real progress on the \nthree important goals I have had, and I think most people have had, for \nhealth care reform.\n  First, most of us have wanted to stop the continuous increases in the \ncost of health care that burden every individual, family, business, our \nGovernment, and our economy. Second, we have wanted to regulate \ninsurance companies to provide better protections for consumers and \npatients. Third, we have wanted to find a way to make it easier for \nmillions of Americans who cannot afford health insurance today to be \nable to buy it tomorrow. I believe this bill makes real progress in \nachieving each of these three goals. Most importantly, it does so in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act not only does not add \nto our national debt, through new health care delivery reforms it will \nhelp reduce the debt by $130 billion over the first 10 years, according \nto the independent Congressional Budget Office. That figure could \nmultiply many times over during the second 10 years, thanks, in part, \nto the managers' amendment that incorporated stronger cost-containment \nproposals that several of us, across party lines, made to Senator Reid.\n  In addition, it is very significant that, according to the Actuary at \nthe Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, this bill will extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund for an additional 9 years. This act \nwill also take substantial steps toward creating a health care delivery \nsystem that pays for the quality of the care patients receive rather \nthan the quantity of care. I am proud to have worked with Members of \nboth sides of the aisle to include amendments that would do that.\n  For instance, Senator Collins and I introduced an amendment, parts of \nwhich were included in the managers' package, that will enhance \ntransparency for consumers so they can make more informed decisions in \nchoosing their health care providers and insurers. In fact, our \namendment will create Physician Compare, a new Web site where physician \nquality measures that exist now but are not known by the rest of us \nwill be posted for everyone to see and to use in the choice of \nphysicians. This will also create incentives, we believe, for doctors \nto provide high-quality, more efficient care.\n  I also cosponsored an amendment introduced by Senator Warner and some \nother freshman Senators that will contain costs even more. This \namendment creates prevention programs to help us understand how to \neffectively manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, and it requires \nprescription drug plans under Medicare Part D to offer medication \ntherapy management services to beneficiaries so they can better adhere \nto their prescription treatments. All that is progress on the first \ngoal that I and most others had, which is to reduce the cost of health \ncare without compromising--in fact, improving--its quality.\n  The second goal. If this bill passes, insurance companies, as Senator \nKerry said, will not only not be able to deny coverage if an individual \nhas a preexisting condition, they will not be allowed to rescind \ncoverage if you become sick, which is the outrageous reality today. \nThanks to changes made by the managers' amendment, insurance companies \nwill also be required to spend more of the premiums they collect on \nmedical expenses for patients rather than on administrative costs and \nprofits. That is real progress on the second goal I mentioned.\n  As for the third goal, the fact is attested to by the CMS Actuary and \nCBO, 31 million more Americans will be able to have health insurance as \na result of this legislation. We say that so often I think we forget \nthe power of it--31 million people who do not have health insurance \ntoday will have it after this bill passes. That is a giant step forward \nfor our society. It is not only the right thing to do, but it will also \neliminate the so-called hidden tax that each of us who has health \ninsurance today pays in higher premiums when someone who has no health \ninsurance gets sick and goes to the hospital to be treated. That is \nreal progress on the third fundamental goal of health care reform that \nI mentioned.\n  Is there anything in the bill that worries me? Of course, there is. I \nwould say, most of all, I worry that we, and future Congresses, will \nnot have the discipline to keep many of the promises we have made in \nthis bill to control costs by transforming the way health care is \ndelivered because some of these reforms are controversial and they are \ngoing to be opposed by some health care providers and health care \nbeneficiaries. Without the kind of discipline I have just mentioned, \nthis bill will add to our national debt or increase taxes. Neither of \nthose results is acceptable. If we stick to the contents of the bill, \nthis bill will cut health care costs and it will reduce our national \ndebt.\n  In my opinion, our exploding national debt is the biggest domestic \nthreat to our country's future. That is why I have said this bill must \nreduce that debt, not increase it. Accumulated debt is currently over \n$12 trillion, with our budget office estimating an additional $9 \ntrillion added in the next 10 years. That is unprecedented in our \nhistory. We are running up to the time when we can see a moment \npossible that we never thought would be possible, when our capacity as \na nation to borrow will be imperiled, when we will have to raise \ninterest rates so high it will constrict our economy and send us back \ninto a recession, worse than the one we are coming out of now.\n  We cannot bring the fiscal books of our Government back into balance \nby only making the health care system more cost efficient, but we will \nnever control our national debt without doing so. Medicare is in a \nparticularly perilous condition today. Without reform, the Medicare \ntrust fund will be broke in 8 years--broke. With tens of\n\n[[Page S13680]]\n\nmillions of baby boomers reaching the age of eligibility, we simply \nmust protect Medicare so it remains a viable program for both current \nand future generations.\n  This leads me to my firm opposition to the creation of a new \ngovernment-run insurance program and to lowering the age of eligibility \nfor Medicare to 55 years. That opposition was rooted in my very serious \nconcerns about our long-term national debt and the fragile fiscal \ncondition of Medicare. For any new government-run insurance program, \nincluding the Medicare extension-expansion idea, the moment premiums do \nnot cover costs the Federal Government--that is Federal taxpayers, the \nAmerican people--would have to pay the difference. That could easily \nput our Federal Government and the taxpayers on the hook for billions \nand billions of dollars in future liabilities and further jeopardize \nthe solvency of Medicare.\n  Because of the insurance market reforms in this bill and other \nmeasures--the creation of a new system of tax credits and subsidies for \npeople making up to 400 percent of poverty--the creation of a new \ngovernment-run health care, the so-called public option or the \nexpansion of Medicare to people under 65 is not necessary. Neither \nproposal would extend coverage to one person who will not be benefited \nby the new provisions of this bill, neither the public option nor the \nexpansion of Medicare. Yet both proposals would, in my opinion, lead to \nhigher premiums for the 180 million people who have insurance today and \nare struggling to afford the health insurance they have now because of \ncost shifting.\n  According to studies by the CBO, a new government-run insurance \nprogram, a public option, would actually likely charge higher premiums \nthan competing private plans on the exchange, and expanding Medicare to \ncover people 55 years or older would lead to additional cost shifting.\n  I know the removal of the public option from the bill in the Senate \ndisappointed and angered many Members of the Senate and the House, \nwhile I know it pleased and reassured others. I wish to say to those \nwho were not happy about the removal of the public option from this \nbill that I believe President Obama never said a public option was \nessential to the reform goals he set out to achieve and that most of us \nhave. When the President spoke earlier this year to the Joint Session \nof Congress, he said a public option is ``an additional step we can \ntake.'' An additional step, he said, but not an essential one. Then, he \nadded, ``The public option is only a means to that end.'' He concluded \nthat we should remain ``open to other ideas that accomplish our \nultimate goal.''\n  I am confident this bill accomplishes the goal the President and most \nof us set out to achieve without the creation of a brand-new \ngovernment-run insurance company or the further weakening of Medicare. \nThis bill, as it appears it will emerge from the Senate, is delicately \nbalanced. I understand the normal inclination in a conference committee \nwith our colleagues in the House is to split the difference. But \nsplitting the difference on this bill runs a real risk of breaking the \nfragile 60-vote Senate consensus we have now and preventing us from \nadopting health care reform in this Congress.\n  That would be a very sad ending. Rather than splitting our \ndifferences, I hope the conferees will adopt our agreements so we can \nenact health care reform this year. The rules of the Senate require 60 \nvotes to end debate on a conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional moment, \nmaybe 2 moments, to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Each Member of the Senate will have to decide once \nagain when this bill emerges from the conference whether he or she \nwants to be one of the 60 votes necessary to take up and pass the \nconference report. In this case my own sense of the Senate is the same \nas that expressed in the last few days by Senators Conrad, Nelson, and \nothers. If significant changes are made to the Senate bill in \nconference, it will be difficult to hold the 60 votes we now have. I \nhave two priorities that will matter a lot to me. The first is to \ncontinue and maintain the health care reforms that will improve the \ncost-effectiveness of our health care system and help reduce the \nnational debt. Second, I hope there will be no attempt to reinsert a \nso-called public option in any form in the conference report. That \nwould mean I will not be able to support the report.\n  I want to support it. I believe I am not alone in that opinion among \nthe 60 who supported the bill last night. Our exploding national debt \nis the biggest threat to our Nation's future. That means we must begin \nto make politically difficult decisions to reduce our debt. That means \nsaying no to some groups and some ideas, including some we would \notherwise support, because we simply cannot afford them.\n  A final hope about the conference report. Perhaps some will say it is \nnaive. I hope the conferees will find a way to produce a report that \ncan be supported by some Republican Members of the Senate and House. It \nis a sad commentary on this moment in our political history that so \nmajor a reform will be adopted with no bipartisan support. Hopefully \nthe conference will find a way, difficult as I know it might be, to \nconclude this long legislative journey with a bill that is not only \nworth supporting, as I believe the Senate bill now surely is, but also \nengages the support of Members of both parties.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that our time be extended in the \nsame amount as their time was extended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the majority has voted to cut off further \namendments to this bill. Senator Reid has used a procedural tool that \nprevents Republicans from offering amendments. Several of my Democratic \ncolleagues have come to the floor to argue that Republicans don't have \nany ideas on how to improve the bill. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Republicans have filed over 200 separate amendments. Yet the \nmajority is refusing to allow us to vote on any. On a bill that will \naffect the health care of every American and one sixth of the Nation's \neconomy, the majority has not allowed us to have more than 10 votes to \ntry to improve the bill.\n  This bill needs to be fixed. We know this bill currently will cut \nMedicare, raise taxes, and increase insurance premiums. If we had the \nchance to offer amendments, I believe we could make changes to fix the \nproblems. I filed nine amendments, but I have not been allowed to offer \nany. I believe any reform should reflect the following core principles: \nreducing health care costs so that all Americans get the quality, \naffordable care they need, ending discrimination based on preexisting \nconditions, ensuring everyone has access to at least catastrophic care, \npreserving the right of patients to choose the doctors and health \ninsurance plans that meet their needs, eliminating junk lawsuits and \nreforming our medical liability system, reducing health care costs for \nall Americans, improving patient safety, encouraging incentives for \nhealthy behaviors by allowing insurers to charge low premiums to people \nwho eat healthy, exercise regularly, and abstain from tobacco use, \nprotecting Medicare for seniors by ensuring that any savings found in \nMedicare, a program that is going broke, are used to strengthen that \nprogram, not to create new entitlements, and helping all Americans \nafford health care coverage by fixing the flawed Tax Code so that all \nAmericans can get tax benefits for purchasing health insurance.\n  Unfortunately, the bill fails to do these things. I know most Members \nagree on those principles for reform. The hard part is making the \nprinciples come to life by translating them into bill language. I did \nthat a few years ago when I introduced 10 steps to transform health \ncare. Once the bill was introduced, I went on a tour of Wyoming in \nMarch of 2008 and hosted town meetings to talk about health care to my \nconstituents. Some of the ideas I included in my 10 steps plan I also \nfiled as amendments to the Reid bill. We need to end discrimination \nbased on preexisting conditions. No one that has at least catastrophic \ncoverage should\n\n[[Page S13681]]\n\nbe denied coverage for a preexisting condition. Everyone should have \ncatastrophic coverage, but no one should be forced to buy anything. If \nsomeone does not at least have catastrophic coverage, then they should \nhave to pay more if they want coverage in the future.\n  Everyone should get the choices for health care that Senators get. \nSenators get to choose between competing private plans. So should all \nAmericans. Senators get the same choices as any other Federal employee. \nNo more, no less. The janitor in the building, the mailman, the forest \nranger, we all get the same choices. All choices are from private \ninsurance. The Federal Government does not have its own plan. Like \nother employers, the Federal Government does pay part of our health \ncare, but not all of it. Our choices allow us to pick a plan with a \nhigher premium at a lower deductible or a plan with a lower premium and \na higher deductible. Everyone should have these same choices, but they \nwould have to work for a company willing to make a contribution to be \npersonally willing to make that contribution and pay the remaining \npremium and deductible.\n  No matter how the health care reform bill comes out, there will not \nbe free insurance. Everyone will pay something. The amount we pay \nshould have a relationship to the choices we make. Insurance costs will \nonly come down if we are encouraged to make the best choices.\n  Speaking of choices, there is no reason shopping for health insurance \nshould be any more complicated than purchasing an airline ticket. \nEveryone should be able to fire up their computer and look up health \ninsurance options as they look up airline flights. Each State should \nset up a Web site or an exchange where consumers can find the listing \nof all the health insurance plans sold in their State. The public \nshould be able to pick their health insurance using the information on \nthe Web site. Each health plan would list what is covered, the premium, \nthe deductible, and the copay, not what Washington says they have to \nput on there. Every insurance company should be allowed to list their \nplan on any exchange, and the State could certify whether the plans \nmeet the minimum requirements and whether subsidies could be used for \nthose plans. There could also be ratings for how well the company \nprovides for its insured customers, but people could buy from any \ncompany, having been warned.\n  Everyone could use the transparencies of the exchange to find the \ninsurance that best suits them. Transparency would also bring the costs \ndown. Another thing that will bring down cost is changing the system \nfrom one that provides sick care to one that provides health care. One \nway to do this is to focus more on preventing preventable diseases. We \nknow that incentives to encourage changes in behavior can result in \nlower costs for patients and employers. We know this because 70 percent \nof all health care costs are driven by behaviors. If you provide \nincentives to change those behaviors, you have a potential decrease in \ncost of 70 percent of all of the health care costs for an organization.\n\n  Companies such as Safeway have designed plans that focus on personal \nresponsibility and provide targeted incentives that lead to behavior \nchanges that can reduce the risk of developing four of the most costly \nchronic conditions. Safeway's model, focused on four chronic \nconditions, can be attributed to 75 percent of all health care costs: \nCardiovascular disease, which is 80 percent preventable; cancer, some \ntypes are 60 percent preventable; type 2 diabetes, which is 80 percent \npreventable; and obesity. As a result, Safeway has seen their health \ncare costs remain flat over the past 4 years, while other employers \nexperience annual cost increases as high as 6.3 percent. This is a huge \naccomplishment for Safeway and its employees, and the employee \nsatisfaction is fantastic. Senator Harkin and I had an amendment that \nwould do that. It was inserted into the HELP Committee bill and then \npulled out without talking to us before it was printed in September. \nNever heard of that being done to Senators before.\n  Health care reform legislation should include the necessary \nprovisions to ensure that companies can continue to provide successful \nprevention programs that lead to better health and lower costs but also \nallow those programs to be replicated across public and private health \nprograms. We should encourage these programs and allow people to reap \nthe benefits of better health outcomes and lower health costs. \nAdditionally, people who smoke should have to pay more. People who \ndon't smoke should pay less. People should be encouraged to quit \nsmoking, start exercising, and eat healthy. To put it simply, allow \nfolks who follow healthy practices to pay less for their health \ninsurance.\n  People should be able to buy insurance across State lines. Companies \nshould be able to sell insurance anywhere in the United States. \nPolicies should be listed on the State exchanges with a disclaimer \nstating the policy is an out-of-State policy. The exchanges would also \nsay whether the policy meets minimum credible standards according to \nWashington and the State. Insurance commissioners in both the insurance \ncompany's State and consumer's State, each get their usual amount for \nthe sale--originators, because they can be consulted, and purchaser \nState, as they have to handle complaints.\n  We need to help small businesses. I have been working on health care \nreform for some time. Small business owners are seeing their insurance \npremiums go up and up every year. They need real help. What they don't \nneed is for the Federal Government to make their insurance even more \nexpensive. CBO says the Reid bill will drive up insurance costs for \nsmall businesses. I have proposed a bill that CBO scored as saving \nsmall businesses money by lowering their health insurance premiums by \nup to 6 percent.\n  Small business health plans allow businesses to join together through \ntheir trade association across State lines even nationwide so they can \nform big enough purchasing pools to effectively negotiate with the \ninsurance companies and providers. Ohio has enough people they were \nable to do this within their State. It is effective. It brought down \nthe cost of health care. They were able to save 23 percent just on \nadministrative costs. They were sure if I could get my bill through, \nthey would save even more by going across State borders. That is one \nthat has been in the lab. It has been proven to work. Not in the bill.\n  Small Business Health Plans, which was S. 1955, drafted by myself and \nSenator Nelson of Nebraska, former Governor and insurance commissioner, \nwas voted out of the committee in March 2006. On May 2006, cloture on \nthe bill was not allowed in the Senate by a vote of 55 to 43. I know \nhow tough health care reform is to pass. I had a majority of the votes \nbut not enough to begin debate. At the same time, Senator Snowe was \npoised to do a single amendment that would have solved the objection \nfor 80 percent of those who voted against it. Without cloture, that \namendment could not be offered. The Snowe amendment would have solved \nthe question of what health plan mandates would be required. The desire \nfor mandate clarification was the objection that had the disease groups \nworking against the bill. The insurance companies worked against the \nbill and successfully defeated other versions called associated health \nplans for over a decade. I was able to neutralize much of the insurance \nlobby.\n  By creating Small Business Health Plans, we can put small business \nowners in the driver's seat instead of the Federal Government or \ninsurance companies. Through their associations, small business owners \nwill have the kind of clout in the marketplace needed to negotiate \nhigh-value and high-quality health insurance for their members on a \nregional or even national basis.\n  Additionally, throughout the health care debate, we have heard \nDemocrats say we need a public option in order to keep insurers honest \nand to have more choices for Americans. However, the only place where \nwe don't currently have competition is for the millions of Americans \nwho are currently trapped in the Medicaid Program. Democrats believe it \nis OK to lock 54 million poor American people into Medicaid and have \nthem languish in a system that is broken and they are unwilling fix. \nTheir solution is to keep adding more Americans to this broken system. \nA 2007 Wall Street Journal article stated that Medicaid beneficiaries \nhave poorer\n\n[[Page S13682]]\n\nhealth than their peers with private insurance. A study published in \nthe Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that Medicaid \npatients were almost 50 percent more likely to die after coronary \nartery bypass surgery than patients with private coverage. Merritt \nHawkins found that in 15 major metropolitan areas and in seven \nparticular cities, including Washington, DC, Medicaid acceptance was \nbelow 50 percent.\n\n  A 2002 MedPAC report stated that 40 percent of physicians--let me \nrepeat that: 40 percent of physicians--will not treat Medicaid patients \nbecause of their concerns about reimbursement and the time and added \ncost of completing the billing paperwork. Even the Office of the \nActuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stated \nthat providers will accept more patients with private insurance than \ngovernment-run health care due to the more attractive private physician \npayment rates. If you cannot see a doctor, you do not have insurance, \nno matter what the special name.\n  As we increase dramatically the number of people eligible, we should \nfind a way to offer them regular insurance so they do not have the \nstigma of being on Medicaid. They should be able to choose between the \nusual Medicaid and a private policy with a subsidy.\n  Unfortunately, the Reid bill expands Medicaid, and the reason is \nbecause it is cheap. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it \ncosts 20 percent more to cover a person in the exchange, funded by \nFederal dollars, than through Medicaid, which is shared between Federal \nand State governments.\n  One of my amendments would change all of this. Senators and their \nstaffs all have the ability to choose between competing private plans, \nand I believe we should give that same kind of choice to low-income \nAmericans. Instead of trapping people in a broken Medicaid Program, my \namendment would provide individuals who would otherwise be enrolled in \nMedicaid through the expansion in this bill the right to choose to be \ncovered by Medicaid or a qualified private health plan offered through \ntheir State exchange. Every American should be able to choose to enroll \nin private insurance, and my amendment would provide real choice access \nto a network of physicians and fix this problem. It would also assure \nthem they would have coverage for an entire year, not just while their \nincome fluctuates.\n  On the topic of expanding government programs, I would also like to \nmention that if you save money in Medicare, it should only be used to \nhelp Medicare because it is already going broke. The current bill takes \nmoney from Medicare and uses it for other government programs. This \nbill takes $466 billion from Medicare and uses it to start new \nentitlements that have nothing to do with Medicare. Yet they start a \nnew commission to figure out where to make additional Medicare cuts in \norder to keep the system going--doesn't that seem counterproductive--\nafter limiting where the cuts can come from because of hidden deals to \nget support for the bill.\n  Whatever we do has to reduce costs for all individuals and be deficit \nneutral. It has to truly be paid for. Why does it have to be paid for? \nBecause America is going broke. We have maxed out the credit cards, and \nnow we are driving down the value of our money. We have to use honest \ncost, not gimmicks such as the doc fix delay or collecting revenues \nbefore the benefits kick in and showing years of revenue for a shorter \ntime benefit.\n  What ways can the government pay for anything? Unfortunately, they \ncan cut benefits, cut payments to doctors and other providers, increase \ntaxes, or cut waste, fraud, and abuse--which government seldom does and \neven more seldom does effectively--or, more honestly, allow a checkoff \nfor donations to other people's insurance--perhaps even a tax-free \ndonation--so people who want a bigger role in seeing that everybody has \ninsurance could directly participate. People who argue that it is \nimperative we extend health benefits to everyone should put their money \nwhere their mouth is. People should have an opportunity on their income \ntaxes to make an instantly deductible gift to the health care of \nothers. If the deductible size of the gift is a refund, then they would \nnot have to include a check.\n  On the subject of taxes, taxes have to be fair to everyone. Right \nnow, big companies can write off the health care they provide their \nemployees, so those employees are getting health care with zero income \ntax. Individuals who buy insurance pay income tax on all the money they \nuse to buy insurance. That is not fair.\n  I have covered just a few of the ideas I have. I have several more \nideas I have been talking about time and time again, none of which show \nup in the bill. These meet the promises that were made. The bill does \nnot meet the promises that were made.\n  Health care is too complicated and encompassing to be done by a \nsingle bill. I have never worked on a bill that affects 100 percent of \nAmerica. Adequately done, rather than assigning details to agencies, a \ncomprehensive bill has to contain details. Assigning the tough parts to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services makes it easier to \nlegislate, but you don't know what the final outcome will be. Done in \nsmaller incremental steps, the bill would be more understandable. More \nimportantly, with the huge, more comprehensive bill, the more people \nwho each don't like a particular part will defeat the whole bill over a \nfew parts.\n  We need to start over. We need to pursue a step by step, bipartisan, \napproach. We need to match up a Republican idea with a Democrat idea. \nWe need to leave out a Republican idea and leave out a Democrat idea. \nPursing this type of strategy, what I call the 80-percent rule, would \nlikely mean broad support from both sides. This would mean that the \nrigid ideologies of both sides would oppose such a bill, but I am \nconfident that majority of the American people would support a bill \nlike this.\n  We need health care reform, but it has to be done the right way. The \nbest way to reform our health care system is to do it step by step. We \nneed to start by focusing on the issues where we already have broad, \nbipartisan agreement.\n  I know how to pass bipartisan legislation. Since I came to the Senate \n13 years ago, I have worked with both Democrats and Republicans to \nreform our Nation's health care system. Over my years in the Senate, \nthere have been several times when I have worked across the aisle to \nget health care bills signed into law.\n  When I joined the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee was one of the more contentious committees. I believe that \npeople can agree on 80 percent of the issues 80 percent of the time \nand, if they leave the other 20 percent out, they can get a lot done. \nWith that in mind, Senator Kennedy and I worked to make it one of the \nmost productive and bipartisan committees, with a substantial number of \nbipartisan bills signed into law each year.\n  Whether it is the reauthorization of the National Institutes of \nHealth or the renewal of the Ryan White and PEPFAR programs for people \nwith HIV/AIDS here and abroad, I am committed to working across the \naisle on issues of importance. Working together, we got patient safety, \nmental health parity, and genetic nondiscrimination legislation over \nthe finish line. These proposals had been pending for years. We were \nalso able to have a strong bipartisan bill to overhaul the drug safety \nfunctions at the FDA. By working together, instead of against each \nother, we can achieve passage of many more pieces of critical \nlegislation.\n  Everyone agrees we need real changes that will allow every American \nto purchase high-quality, affordable health insurance. Not a single one \nof my Senate colleagues on either side of the aisle supports the status \nquo. The argument that Republicans support the status quo is simply \nfalse. We understand that the current system fails too many Americans. \nWe want to support reforms that will provide real insurance options to \nall Americans and help lower the cost of that insurance.\n  But I have said from the start of this year, and frankly throughout \nmy 13 years in the Senate, true reform should be developed on a \nbipartisan basis, so that the legislation will incorporate the best \nideas from both sides and will have the broad support of the America. \nThat should be a prerequisite for any proposal that will affect the \nnearly 20 percent of our Nation's economy and the health care of every \nAmerican.\n\n[[Page S13683]]\n\n  We have only had 10 votes on Republican amendments. It is not because \nRepublicans agree the status quo is acceptable or because we think the \nhealth care system works fantastically; quite the opposite. Republican \nMembers have filed 223 amendments to this bill. Unfortunately the \nmajority leader has blocked us from offering our amendments.\n  This bill is too important to get wrong. We need the opportunity to \nimprove this bill, and I would urge my colleagues in the Democrat \nleadership to allow us the opportunity to do so.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial by David \nBroder, ``One Is the Loneliest Number for President Obama,'' be printed \nin the Record. It mentions some of the editorials and key points of \neditorials that I put in my speech last night.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            One Is the Loneliest Number for President Obama\n\n                           (By David Broder)\n\n       In the last year or so of George W. Bush's second term, \n     commentators used to talk a lot about the conspicuous \n     scarcity of other Republicans willing to stand up and defend \n     him. I never thought we'd see Barack Obama face the same \n     problem before his first year was over.\n       But as Obama's approval scores (50 percent in the latest \n     Washington Post-ABC News poll) sink, it is getting harder and \n     harder to find a full-throated supporter of the president.\n       You need go no further from here than the op-ed page of \n     Thursday's Washington Post to see what I mean. Time was, and \n     not all that long ago, when the Post was thought of as the \n     ``liberal paper'' in Washington, a reliable advocate for the \n     kind of policies pursued by Democratic presidents.\n       Well, in the lead article on the op-ed page, a well-known \n     member of the president's party said that Obama's prize piece \n     of domestic legislation, the health care reform bill, has \n     been so compromised that as it stands, ``this bill would do \n     more harm than good to the future of America.''\n       ``If I were a senator,'' wrote Howard Dean, former governor \n     of Vermont and the chairman of the Democratic National \n     Committee during Obama's run for the White House, ``I would \n     not vote for the current health-care bill.''\n       Dean, who had been signaling his apostasy for some time, \n     was far from alone in clobbering Obama, just as the president \n     and Senate leaders were struggling to line up the 60 votes \n     needed to pass the ever-changing legislation.\n       Across the Post's prized real estate, conservative \n     columnist George F. Will gloated that the more Obama argued \n     for the bill, the less the public supported it. And from \n     across the aisle, Matthew Dowd, a former Democrat who served \n     as chief strategist for the younger President Bush, offered \n     congressional Democrats the free advice that they would be \n     better off themselves if the Republicans managed to block \n     Obama's bill.\n       It was left to my friend, E.J. Dionne, Jr., one of Obama's \n     most passionate journalistic advocates, to tell the Democrats \n     that they ought to mind their manners--and their words. The \n     increasing flak between moderate and liberal Democrats ``is a \n     recipe for political catastrophe,'' Dionne warned, his tone \n     suggesting that he thinks the Democrats are too far gone to \n     heed him.\n       But this wasn't the worst I saw that day. The worst came in \n     a news report of the year-end news conference by House \n     Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Asked how she would deal with next \n     year's looming tests of congressional Democratic support for \n     Obama's decision to send 30,000 more U.S. troops into the \n     Afghanistan struggle, she said, ``the president's going to \n     have to make his case'' himself. Reminding reporters that she \n     had told lawmakers in June, when funding was approved for \n     17,000 additional troops, that it would be the last time she \n     would ever lobby her members to back such a step, she made it \n     absolutely clear she felt no obligation of party loyalty to \n     support Obama on the most important national security \n     decision he has made.\n       The liberal legislator from San Francisco could not have \n     been plainer if she had added, ``You're on your own, \n     buster.''\n       With this as an example from the No. 1 Democrat on Capitol \n     Hill, one has to wonder why liberal Democrats are so furious \n     about senators such as Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson \n     negotiating their own deals with the White House on the \n     health care bill.\n       I think Obama deserves more help than he is getting from \n     his fellow Democrats in Congress, given the boost he provided \n     them in the last election, the difficulty of the problems he \n     inherited, and the stiff-arm he has received from the \n     Republicans.\n       But the reality is that, the closer the midterm election \n     comes, when they will be on the ballot and he will not, the \n     more members of Congress--and not just Pelosi--will judge \n     what is best for themselves and the less they'll be swayed by \n     Obama.\n       He may feel lonely now, but he ain't seen nothing yet.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that an \neditorial by George Will from the Washington Post titled ``The \nIndispensable Dispenser Opens Up'' be printed in the Record. It shows \nhow Medicare is left up in the air after the Reid bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Indispensable Dispenser Opens Up\n\n                            (By George Will)\n\n       Ryan Bingham has a unique way of describing his life.\n       ``Last year,'' he says, ``I spent 322 days on the road, \n     which means that I had to spend 43 miserable days at home.'' \n     Home is an Omaha rental unit less furnished than a hotel \n     room. He likes it that way.\n       Today he is where he feels at home, in an airport--glass \n     walls and glistening steel, synthetic sincerity and \n     antiseptic hospitality. Today he is showing Natalie, a \n     ferocious young colleague, how an expert road warrior deals \n     with lines at security screening:\n       Avoid, he says, getting behind travelers with infants \n     (``I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than 20 \n     minutes''). Or behind elderly people (``Their bodies are \n     littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate \n     how little time they have left on earth''). Do get behind \n     Asians: ``They're light packers, treasure efficiency, and \n     have a thing for slip-on shoes.''\n       Natalie: ``That's racist.''\n       Bingham: ``I stereotype. It's faster.''\n       Played with seemingly effortless perfection by the \n     preternaturally smooth George Clooney, Bingham is the cool \n     porcelain heart of the movie ``Up in the Air.'' It is a \n     romantic comedy, although Bingham begins immune to romance. \n     And the comedy is about pain--about administering it somewhat \n     humanely to people who are losing their jobs.\n       Bingham is a ``termination engineer.'' He fires people for \n     companies that want to outsource the awkward, and \n     occasionally dangerous, unpleasantness of downsizing. His \n     pitter-patter for the fired--``Anybody who ever built an \n     empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now''--rarely \n     consoles. But with his surgeon's detachment, he is more \n     humane than Natalie, who says this:\n       ``This is the first step of a process that will end with \n     you in a new job that fulfills you. I'd appreciate it if you \n     didn't spread the news just yet. Panic doesn't help \n     anybody.''\n       A confident young cost-cutter from Cornell, her brainstorm \n     is to fire people by videoconferencing. She tells one \n     desolated man:\n       ``Perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect your \n     career transition may have on your children. Tests have shown \n     that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply \n     themselves academically as a method of coping.''\n       Bingham considers his low emotional metabolism an \n     achievement, and in motivational speeches he urges his \n     audiences to cultivate it: ``Your relationships are the \n     heaviest components of your life. The slower we move, the \n     faster we die. We are not swans. We're sharks.''\n       The movie begins and ends with everyday people talking to \n     the camera, making remarkably sensitive statements about the \n     trauma of being declared dispensable. Some, however, recall \n     that the consequences included being reminded that things \n     they retained, such as their human connections, are truly \n     indispensable.\n       The opening soundtrack is a weird version of Woody \n     Guthrie's ``This Land Is Your Land.'' This hymn to \n     Depression-era radicalism is catnip for people eager to \n     tickle a political manifesto from any movie that has a \n     contemporary social setting.\n       But although ``Up in the Air'' might look like a meditation \n     on the Great Recession, it is based on a novel published in \n     2001, during the mildest recession since the Depression, and \n     written before that.\n       You must remember: In 2006, the last full year before this \n     downturn, when the economy grew 2.7 percent and the \n     unemployment rate was just 4.6 percent, 3.3 million people \n     lost their jobs to the normal churning of a dynamic economy. \n     This ``creative destruction'' has human costs, but no longer \n     is optional.\n       America has an aging population, and has chosen to have a \n     welfare state that siphons increasing amounts of wealth from \n     the economy to give to the elderly. Having willed this end, \n     America must will the means to it--sometimes severe economic \n     efficiency to generate revenues to finance the entitlement \n     culture. So ``Up in the Air'' is sobering entertainment for a \n     nation contemplating a giant addition to the entitlement \n     menu.\n       ``Up in the Air'' is two mature themes subtly braided and \n     nuanced for grown-ups. One is the sometimes shattering sense \n     of failure, desperation and worthlessness that overwhelms \n     middle-aged people who lose their livelihoods. The other is \n     that such shocks can be reminders that there is more to life \n     than livelihoods.\n       But not for Bingham. He is, in his fashion, content. In \n     E.M. Forster's novel ``Howards End,'' Margaret famously \n     exhorted, ``Only connect!'' Bingham would rather not.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, we have heard a lot about the\n\n[[Page S13684]]\n\nunsustainable mountain of government debt, bureaucracy, and spending \nthe Democratic majority intends to create in rushing their health care \nproposal through this Chamber. We have also heard a lot about how much \nof this they inherited. We need to remember that this Congress--both \nHouses of Congress--has been controlled by the Democratic Party for 3 \nyears now. The President does not write legislation or spend money; the \nCongress does. The only thing the Democratic majority has inherited is \nits own irresponsible spending.\n  Saturday's release of the final Democratic bill only increases \nAmerica's concern with this Congress, its shadow negotiations, and our \ngrowing debt.\n  Early this morning, all 60 Democrats voted to force all the taxpayers \nof this country to pay for bailouts and special favors for several \nStates. Rather than actually taking the time to put forth real health \ncare reform proposals that would increase Americans' ability to buy and \nown health care plans they could really afford, this plan forces over \n15 million Americans onto yet another bankrupt entitlement program, \nMedicaid.\n  While Medicaid is a State and Federal shared program, the Democratic \nmajority saw fit for the Federal Government to pay 100 percent of the \nMedicaid Program in the State of Nebraska under this legislation at the \nexpense of taxpayers in the other 49 States, who will now be forced not \nonly to deal with the loss of their freedoms under this huge government \ntakeover but to pay for special favors in other States.\n  This State bailout is not the only downside of the majority's health \ncare proposal; there is a laundry list we could go through. Just a few \ninclude that the working American taxpayers and their employers will be \ntaxed $500 billion over the next 10 years, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice has confirmed that nothing in this bill decreases the premiums \nfor Main Street Americans.\n  Seniors will see their Medicare benefits changed as a result of the \n$500 billion in Medicare cuts included in this bill, not to mention \nthat this bill turns a blind eye to the physician payment system that \nis woefully underfunded and vitally necessary to maintain the Medicare \nProgram and physician access for seniors. It does not matter how good \nthe insurance is we give our seniors if they cannot find a doctor who \nwill see them.\n  Another alarming part of this bill is it will, for the first time in \ndecades, force every American taxpayer to pay for abortion services.\n  Frankly, after reading this bill, it seems the only Americans who are \nnot going to be affected by the bill are Members of Congress, \npharmaceutical companies, and insurance companies.\n  Madam President, for all the mind-boggling numbers and devastating \nfacts we have heard about the majority's government takeover of health \ncare, this debate is about much more than health care. It is about how \nwe find ourselves in a situation where we are debating the best way to \ngive the government control over another big part of our lives and our \neconomy.\n  In the children's story of ``Hansel and Gretel,'' the children drop a \ntrail of breadcrumbs as they walk through the forest so they will be \nable to find their way out of the woods. But when the birds eat the \nbreadcrumbs, the children find they are lost in the dark and \nfrightening woods.\n  Well, lost in the woods is exactly where we find ourselves as a \ncountry right now. We know we are in trouble, but there is no clearly \nmarked path to get us back to where we were, and it is plenty \nfrightening.\n  In the past year alone, this Federal Government has taken over two of \nour largest automakers, our largest insurance companies, the largest \nmortgage company, and hundreds of banks. It has bailed out Wall Street \nand attempted to stimulate the economy by taking $1 trillion out of the \nprivate sector and spending it on wasteful government programs. It has \nthrown taxpayer money at people to encourage them to buy new cars and \nhouses. And it is looking at imposing massive new job-killing taxes on \nbusinesses in the name of reducing global warming--all in the middle of \na snowstorm.\n  One of the problems we have now in this country is, instead of asking \nif we should solve it, we are asking, how should we solve it? It is now \nconsidered a sign of admirable restraint to occasionally ask here in \nthis Senate and in this Congress, how much should we spend? And somehow \nwe started thinking that anything less than $1 trillion is a good deal. \nThere is not a pothole in America that most Members of the Congress do \nnot believe should be filled with an earmark from the Federal \nGovernment. There is not a bridge to nowhere, a flat tire, a skinned \nknee--there is nothing off limits for this Congress today.\n  This matters not just because of our unsustainable debt and the huge \namount of money we waste; it matters because every time we give a job \nto the government, we take away some control people have over their own \nlives, and we take away a little bit more of their freedom. In return \nfor letting government try its hand at solving a problem, we as \ncitizens cede our ability to try for ourselves to find a better way.\n  It is awkward to admit it, but my colleagues in Congress have led \nthis country into the woods, despite our oath of office. We swore to \nprotect and defend the Constitution of the United States and to bear \ntrue and faithful allegiance to it. The Constitution prescribes a very \nlimited role for the Federal Government. There is not a word in our \noath or in the Constitution about most of what we do. As we have \nwandered off the path of liberty, there are few crumbs left of the \nConstitution in the Halls of Congress to lead us out of the woods.\n  There is not a word in the Constitution about the government deciding \nwhat medical test private health insurers should pay for, nothing about \nthe government deciding how much executives on Wall Street should earn \nor what kind of lightbulbs or cars we should buy. There is nothing \nabout the thousands of parochial earmarks that fund local bridges to \nnowhere, golf courses, bike paths, sewer plants, and teapot museums. \nThere is nothing about these or many other things in the Constitution \nbecause they have nothing to do with the proper role of the Federal \nGovernment in a free society. But these are exactly the kinds of things \nour government spends its time and money on, and we do not even \nquestion anymore why that is.\n\n  Instead, it has gotten to the point where if we oppose the government \ndoing anything, we are accused of being opposed to getting it done. \nThat is patently absurd. If you really want to get something done and \nget it done right, the government is absolutely the last place we \nshould turn.\n  The tea parties, townhalls, and rallies affirm that the American \npeople are rethinking the appropriate role of the government in a free \nsociety. Hopefully, their discontent will be demonstrated in the 2010 \nelections. Only the American people can hold our elected Federal \nrepresentatives accountable for fulfilling their oath of office. In the \nhealth care debate, this means deciding exactly what role the \ngovernment should play to help people in the private sector find \nsolutions, instead of creating a monstrous new bureaucracy that puts \nthe government in charge of every decision.\n  But this debate is about much more than health care. It is a battle \nfor the heart and soul of America. It is a struggle between freedom and \nsocialism, between free markets and a centrally planned economy, and \nbetween ``we the people'' and an entrenched class of elite politicians.\n  The current debate over health care reform is a symptom of a bigger \nproblem in Washington. But it can be the catalyst for a wider debate \nabout the proper role of government in our lives. The same debate can \nlead us to a moment when Americans finally take a stand to return \ngovernment to its proper place--and we can all start finding our way \nout of the woods.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I am going to be joined by a number of my \ncolleagues, so I ask unanimous consent that we be able to have a \ncolloquy during the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I think many Members have to ask: Why are \nwe here? We are here because at 1 a.m. this morning, there was a \ncloture vote\n\n[[Page S13685]]\n\non the consideration of the Reid managers' amendment. I think it is \nimportant that we discuss what that means. It means there are going to \nbe no more amendments, no opportunity for any Senator from any State to \npropose a change to the bill. At some point, we will have an up-or-down \nvote on exactly what Senator Reid has presented to us.\n  But here is what we do know. We are going to steal $466 billion from \nMedicare. We are going to take that $466 billion away from hospitals, \nfrom hospice, from nursing homes, from home care, and, yes, a popular \ntarget up here--the insurance product many Americans have chosen, 20 \npercent of the seniors, Medicare Advantage. We are going to eliminate \nthat option. So this is one case where if you like your health care, \nyou are going to lose it.\n  The bill that we are considering and that will be voted on later this \nweek raises $519 billion in new taxes and fees--$519 billion in new \ntaxes. I might add for my colleagues, we are taxing tanning salons at \n10 percent. What in the hell does that have to do with health care? \nWell, the reason it is in there is because we dropped taxing Botox. \nHollywood saw this was not advantageous to have Botox taxed, so when \nthey dropped that, they had to find something else: poor tanning \nsalons, small businesses in every community across this country. We are \ngoing to actually tax the majority of Americans the President said he \nwould never tax: those under $200,000, the ones who can't afford to go \nto the beach every weekend; the ones who don't have a beach house. They \nare going to pay a 10-percent tax when they go to get a little bit of a \ntan. Well, when they do that, how far off are we from fining parents \nbecause we don't put a high enough SPF on our children, or are we going \nto start charging when we go to the beach because we get exposure to \nthe Sun? That is what happens when the government becomes a more \ndominant role in health care.\n\n  I might add: No doctor fix, something many of us have highlighted. In \nthe bill, there was a 1-year fix. Doctors are going to be faced with a \n21-percent cut in their reimbursements after this next 2 months. There \nwas a 1-year fix to it. It didn't do away with the problem. It didn't \nfix the whole problem. But now there is no 1-year fix. We have said in \n60 days doctors will be on their own.\n  Yes, there were some special deals--the cornhusker kickback, the \nwindfall for Nebraska. I have to admit that I was proud of my \ncolleague, Senator Johanns, who came to the floor and said: Let me \nassure you, the people in Nebraska have never asked for something \ndifferent than everybody else. They are willing to pay their share of \nthe way there. They haven't asked for it to be free for them and cost \neverybody else.\n  Yes, it will cost my constituents in North Carolina, and it will cost \nthe constituents in Nevada--well, it won't in Nevada. I think maybe \nthere is even a deal that affects them to some degree.\n  Is it fair? No, it is not fair. The fact that it wasn't fair was \ncalled: ``That is compromise.''\n  That is not compromise. We are here under an obligation to make this \nfair to all of the American people. But in this case, it is not.\n  Yes, there are 31 million Americans who are going to have health \ninsurance, 15 million of whom are delegated into Medicaid, the most \ndysfunctional delivery system that exists in the American health care \nsystem.\n  Yes, there is, for many States, an unfunded mandate to those States \nbecause after 5 years, for most States, except for those who got these \nspecial deals, the States are going to be responsible for some portion, \nan average of 10 percent of the cost of Medicaid.\n  Let me tell you what my Governor, Governor Bev Perdue of North \nCarolina, said earlier:\n\n       The absolute dealbreaker for me as governor is a Federal \n     plan that shifts costs to the States.\n\n  Well, we are shifting costs to the States, and she is nowhere to be \nfound now. But the people in North Carolina, the taxpayers of North \nCarolina are going to continue to be charged for this expansion of \nMedicaid when that is the most inefficient place for us to have put \nthese 15 million Americans who were promised health care.\n  While we do all this, according to the Chief Actuary of the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, 20 percent of our hospitals \nand nursing homes are going to go bankrupt. They are going to go out of \nbusiness because as the Chief Actuary said:\n\n       They would be unprofitable within the next 10 years as a \n     result of these cuts.\n\n  Hospitals, nursing homes, at a time that our senior population is \ngetting ready to explode as the baby boomers hit it, we are cutting \n$466 billion from Medicare, and we are starving the infrastructure of \nhospitals and nursing homes and hospice and home care.\n  What is going to happen to the providers? The Chief Actuary, again, \nsaid if we pass this plan, the result is providers will be unwilling to \nsee Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n  Today, 40 percent of providers don't see Medicaid patients. Does that \nmean it is going to be 50 percent or 60 percent or 70 percent? We are \nballooning a system that today is having a hard time finding providers. \nTo most of us that doesn't make sense, but that is what the Senate is \ngoing to do.\n  I might also add that the attempt was to expand coverage; and, yes, \nsure, in numbers, we are expanding coverage. But, if passed, the \nCongressional Budget Office says 8 million to 9 million individuals who \ncurrently have employer-based health care will lose that health care. \nEight million to nine million who currently have their health care will \nlose their health care with the passage of this bill. The net-net is \nnot real pretty, and when you look at the $2.3 trillion that health \ncare costs, you have to ask yourself, where is the beef? Where is the \nvalue in this?\n  As hospitals close, as nursing homes close, as providers don't see \nMedicare and Medicaid, ask yourself, have we really done something \ngood? Chances are, you will find out if we do nothing, if we do \nnothing, we will actually save money in the health care system.\n  The last fact: The Chief Actuary of Medicare said: If you pass this \nbill, the cost of health care will be $\\1/4\\ trillion more than if we \ndid nothing.\n  The President talked about bending the cost curve down. We are \nbending that cost curve up in this bill. We are bankrupting hospitals \nand nursing homes. We are chasing providers from seeing Medicare and \nMedicaid patients.\n  There are not too many things we can point to that are great about \nthis bill. That is every reason we should start over.\n  I know my colleagues are here to join in and to offer some \nperspectives, and I would ask them to chime in.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, let me just summarize a few problems I \nsee in the bill, and maybe even offer a few suggestions about what I \nthink we can do in a bipartisan fashion--kind of this step-by-step \napproach many of us have been talking about--instead of this massive \ngovernment takeover of our health care system.\n  This is a--I have lost track--I think somewhere around a 2,700-page \nbill with incredibly complex legal language. In the 400-page amendment \noffered the other day, when I was sitting there listening to the \nreading of it, I can't tell my colleagues how many times I was \nlistening to this and I thought: When the regulations are written to \nthat particular small part of the amendment, it could be incredibly \ncomplex with all kinds of unintended consequences. I thought about the \nburdens on small business and the record keeping that small businesses \nare going to have in this bill.\n  I think what is going to also happen with small business, there is \ngoing to be a great incentive--if you are a small business owner, the \ncomplexities are so much and you can get yourself in so much trouble, \nyou know what, I am just going to pay the fine. I will write a check to \neach one of my employees, but I am getting out of the health care \nbusiness. I am going to let them go out and find their own health care, \nwhether through the government exchanges or whatever it is, but I am \ngetting out. That is one of those unintended consequences that a lot of \npeople haven't focused on.\n  We talked a lot about this $500 billion-plus cut in Medicare. My \ncolleague from North Carolina mentioned that. Some of the biggest \nplaces--I had two grandmothers who were in hospice. Hospice care is the \nmost compassionate care we have today, and we are going to cut hospice \ncare. That actually puts dignity back into dying. That is just\n\n[[Page S13686]]\n\nunconscionable. The Congressional Budget Office says these cuts \nactually will be cuts in service because you can't just take money out \nof the system unless you make them more efficient. These cuts don't \nmake the system more efficient, they just take money out of the system, \nwhether it is out of hospice or nursing homes or the home care, but \nalso out of Medicare cuts.\n  We know there is $120 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage. The \nCongressional Budget Office said by 2016, 64 percent of the extra \nbenefits, whether those are prescription drugs or dental coverage or \nvision coverage, the seniors covered under Medicare Advantage are going \nto be cut 64 percent because of this legislation.\n  We also know there is around $500 billion in new taxes, and this is a \ncomplete violation of the President's promise during the campaign when \nhe said not one dime in new taxes will be raised on those individuals \nmaking less than $200,000 or families making less than $250,000. Yet in \nthis bill, of the $500 billion, 84 percent is paid by those people the \nPresident said wouldn't have their taxes raised by one dime.\n\n  We also know, because the Senator from North Carolina talked about \nit, this massive Medicaid expansion--I think it was the Democratic \nGovernor from Tennessee who said it was the mother of all unfunded \nmandates. Well, we have to look at this one way. If the sweetheart deal \nthat was made by the Senator from Nebraska--and, by the way, I agree \nwith you. Senator Johanns, who came to the floor, it takes a lot of \ncourage to say it isn't about just helping my State; it is about \nthinking about the whole country as well. He isn't asking for \nsomething--which most Senators do around here, ask for something just \nspecial for the State that the rest of the States have to pay for--but \nhe stood up with courage, and I think he deserves a lot of credit for \nthat.\n  But if all the other States now come back and say: We want the \nFederal Government to pay for our States and Medicaid, this bill is \ngoing to do one thing. It is either going to be a massive unfunded \nmandate on our States or this bill is going to massively balloon the \nFederal debt.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I have a question for both the Senator \nfrom North Carolina and the Senator from Nevada. Can the State of \nNevada or the State of North Carolina or the State of Nebraska or the \nState of Oklahoma be healthy if our country doesn't flourish? So no \nmatter what we do for our own States, if, in fact, we are not thinking \nabout the country as a whole, the best right thing for the country as a \nwhole, none of our States can flourish.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I think the Senator from Oklahoma has made a wonderful \npoint. Right now, my State is suffering terribly, not because of \nanything individually, such as we didn't get our fair share of \nsomething; my State is suffering because the whole economy is in the \ndoldrums and because we are such a tourist economy, construction \noriented, the housing industry, all of those things, and because the \ngeneral economy went down, my State is suffering.\n  So the Senator is exactly right. We should be looking at what is best \nfor the entire country. As John F. Kennedy said: A rising tide raises \nall boats. Well, if the whole country is doing better, whether it is on \nhealth care or whatever it is, instead of looking for something \nindividual for our States, you are exactly right. I think our \nindividual States will do better if the whole country does well.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an article that appeared today. It is a quotation from \nthe founder from the Daily Kos Web site. I will give it to the clerk in \na moment. I wish to read a quote from it:\n\n       I don't think this is a reform bill. I mean, I think it is \n     very clear this is not insurance or health care reform. What \n     it is is allowing more people, 30 million people, to buy into \n     an existing broken system. It is very important to keep in \n     mind that health insurance is not the same as health care. If \n     you go up to Massachusetts, they have a mandate as well. Last \n     year, in Massachusetts, 21 percent of the people who are \n     insured could not get health care because they could not \n     afford it.\n\n  That is somebody who is very well respected on the majority side, and \nit is something we have been saying, and they are saying the same \nthing. The fact is, what we are going to do is put 15 million people \ninto Medicaid that we know has worse outcomes, we know is an unfunded \nmandate on the States, and we know 40 percent of the doctors refuse to \nsee them. So you are not going to get to choose the doctor you want to \nsee. You are going to have State mandates in terms of what is available \nto you and what is not. So we have violated two of the key promises \nwith which to reform health care.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Moulitsas: We'll Get Killed in 2010\n\n       Markos Moulitsas, founder of the Daily Kos and an \n     influential leader of the Web-based political left, said \n     Sunday that Democrats are facing huge defeats in the 2010 \n     elections because the Obama administration has alienated the \n     Democratic Party's liberal political base with its escalating \n     involvement in Afghanistan, and its failure to push for \n     universal healthcare.\n       Speaking on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Moulitsas offered a \n     bleak scenario for House and Senate races next year.\n       Excerpts:\n       Mr. Gregory: Markos Moulitsas, I want to start with you. \n     You heard David Axelrod say this in keeping with the \n     president's principles; it is in keeping, the compromise on \n     health care, with the way the president campaigned on this. \n     And this is the bill, essentially, the reform that Americans \n     deserve. What do you say?\n       Mr. Markos Moulitsas: Yeah, I don't think this is a reform \n     bill. I mean, I think it's very clear, this is not insurance \n     or healthcare reform. What it is, it's allowing more people, \n     30 million people, to buy into the existing broken system. \n     It's very important to keep in mind that healthcare insurance \n     is not the same as health care. Insurance, not the same as \n     care, if you go up to Massachusetts, they have a mandate as \n     well, and last year 21 percent of people in Massachusetts \n     could not get health care because they could not afford it. \n     Even though they had insurance, the premiums--not the \n     premiums, the deductibles, copays and out-of-pocket expenses \n     were too high. So really, this isn't reform. It's expanding \n     the system, it's almost rewarding the existing system. Now, \n     what is important about this is that it actually puts the \n     federal government, plus America on the place to say health \n     care is a right, it's not a privilege to just those who are--\n     who can afford it or who are lucky enough to have a good job \n     that has good benefits. But as far as reform goes, I think \n     this is a long battle that we have ahead of us.\n       Mr. Moulitsas: Well, you can't talk about health care and \n     Afghanistan being distractions. They're the reasons that \n     Obama won the White House and Democrats won control of \n     Congress, including big, massive support from independents. \n     Independents know what they were voting for when they voted \n     for Obama and the Democrats. I think the problem with Obama's \n     numbers and, and Congress' numbers is that people voted for a \n     Congress and a president that was going to take on entrenched \n     interests. Now, Republicans had jumped off the Obama \n     bandwagon from day one. They were never on board. \n     Independents have sort of been unhappy because I think \n     independents really want results, and we haven't seen a lot \n     of results. We've seen a log of bickering, and most of it has \n     been internally within the Democratic Party, and I think \n     that's why they're turning off. And a lot of Democrats are \n     becoming disenchanted.\n       Mr. Gregory: . . . What does the president need to address \n     to keep his own party in line? Should there be personnel \n     changes in the White House? What do you think the left is \n     going to demand?\n       Mr. Moulitsas: Well, 2006 is going to be a base year. It's \n     going to be a base election.\n       MR. Gregory: 2010, you mean.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to also quote from what I think \nis a brilliant letter by a Dr. Robert Geist from St. Paul, MN, that was \nwritten as a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal today. The \ntitle of his letter to the editor is, ``The First Cost Controller Will \nBe Your Own Doctor.'' It is something I have been talking about since \nwe started this. The last thing we want to do in health care in America \nis to make it where the doctor is not a 100-percent advocate for the \npatient's best interest.\n  He quotes very directly the transfer. He said a previous article \nwritten:\n\n       . . . doesn't emphasize a potential stealth cost-control \n     aspect proposed in the bill. It will start pilot programs \n     that would transfer the gatekeeper role to doctors at the \n     bedside, a role currently held by ``payers'' (HMOs and \n     government-agency insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid).\n       The transfer will be via capitation fee payments, making \n     clinics ``responsible'' for the cost of care of ``insured \n     lives'' for one year. . . . The illusion of many pundits and \n     policy makers is that mini provider gatekeepers can control \n     costs after the very powerful payer gatekeepers--\n\n  That is, Medicare, Medicaid, and the large insurance companies--\n\n\n[[Page S13687]]\n\n\n     have failed for decades. The problem for patients is the \n     dilemma of all managed-care gatekeepers: cost, quality, \n     access; pick any two. It is not pleasant to think that one's \n     gatekeeper doctor will have to decide whether to order \n     surgery for your painful [worn out] hip or only to increase \n     the dose of--\n\n  Anti-inflammatories because they are worried about costs.\n  That is the key point. We are going to now separate physicians in \nthis country for doing what is best for the patient to meet the demands \nof the government.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. As a practicing physician, isn't this what the Senator \nsaw in his practice with HMOs?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is exactly why I am not a member of any HMOs.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Because we have kind of an insurance center system today, \nto a large degree, and now we are going to make that worse. Instead of \ngoing more toward a patient center, we are going to go from an \ninsurance center to a government center to where these government \nbureaucrats now start being in control of eventually what kind of care \nyou are going to get, what is paid for, and all that. We need to put \nthe doctor and the patient back at the center of our health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me finish this for a minute, if I might. Here is the \nsummarizing paragraph:\n\n       The economic reality is that no rationing of care supply \n     will ever control costs, when the problem is demand inflation \n     driven by popular insurance tax subsidies too sacred to \n     repeal. Consider that when federal fiscal ``necessity'' \n     overwhelms empty slogans,--\n\n  Our empty slogans--\n\n     scores of new bureaucracies created in [this bill] would be \n     able to implement Draconian rationing in collusion with \n     subservient insurance and ``provider'' corporations. The high \n     costs, as well as the rationing powers included in the more \n     than 2,000 pages of the ObamaCare Senate legislation are very \n     real.\n\n  Which is the point I have been making all along. I am going to spend \n30 minutes tomorrow talking about the rationing aspects of what we are \nabout to do as we pass this bill.\n  Mr. BURR. If I can comment to my good friend, who started on a quest \nwith me several years ago to try to put together a health care reform \nbill, I might say it was the first one introduced in the Congress in \nMay of this year on comprehensive health care reform--not that it is \nbetter than anybody else's, but I can honestly say today it was true \nreform. I think that is what Dr. Coburn is trying to say.\n  In this bill, it lacks reform. What do I mean by that? Their reform \nis to set up an advisory panel that if we exceed the costs we have \ndesignated for health care, they are going to cut the scope of coverage \nor the reimbursement. So either the array of coverage for a senior or \nfor an American is ``skinnied down'' or we cut the reimbursement to the \ndoctor or the hospital, and they call that reform.\n  What Dr. Coburn and I found out, as many other Members have, is if \nyou look at the successful companies across this country that have held \ndown their health care costs through doing real reform--paying for \nprevention and wellness in work, changing the lifestyles of the \nemployees--we saw companies that, for 4 years, had a 45-percent \nincrease in their health care. Where is any of that in this bill? Out \nof 2,700-plus pages, there is no attempt to do that. There is no \nattempt to try to affect the lifestyles through supporting chronic \ndisease management, prevention, and wellness, but we set up a lot of \nindependent advisory boards.\n  As a matter of fact, they were so scared that in the managers' \namendment, it is no longer called the Medicare independent advisory \nboard. It is called the independent advisory board. So the word \n``Medicare'' was dropped, not to signify that they are going to cut \nMedicare, but that is exactly what CBO and CMS have said. These will \nkick in. The question is, Are they sustainable or will Congress \nlegislatively override their authority to cut the spending?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If my friend will yield, there is one part--actually one \nof the best parts in this bill--but there are so many other bad parts \nof this bill and the Senator from North Carolina mentioned them, and we \nhave talked about a lot of them. The one place they actually have \nimproved our health care system is the part that allows people to have \nlarger discounts for healthier behaviors. Safeway was the model for \nthis. They have done the most work on this in the last 4 years. Today, \nthey can discount up to 20 percent of their health care premiums for \npeople who engage in healthier behaviors--for not smoking, for being \nthe proper body weight compared to their height, doing things such as \nthat. If they are a nonsmoker, they get a lower premium, and if they \neven quit smoking, Safeway pays for the cessation products. To be fair, \nthat is in the bill. Senator Carper and I got that in the Finance \nCommittee. We were able to get that amendment drafted.\n  The problem is, that is a tiny part of this bill. That should be a \nmajor focus of the bill. We should be able to buy insurance across \nState lines. Many of us have supported that--small business health \nplans, where small businesses can join together and take advantage of \npurchasing power. We all, on this side, almost everybody on this side \nof the aisle agrees with medical liability reform. The Congressional \nBudget Office said that would save $100 billion.\n  The bottom line is, what we have been focused on--and I appreciate \nthe efforts Senator Burr and Senator Coburn made in their bill last \nyear--is trying to address the No. 1 problem we have in health care in \nthe United States, which is costs. This bill does not address costs.\n  As a matter of fact, you said it in your opening remarks. Total \nhealth care costs actually, according to President Obama's CMS, go up \n$234 billion if nothing is done. If nothing is done, we actually save \nmoney on total health care spending. But with this bill, it actually \ngoes up by $234 billion.\n  Mr. COBURN. What we also know from the Congressional Budget Office is \nthat between 9 and 10 million people who today have insurance through \ntheir employer will actually lose it. They are going to lose their \ninsurance. That may be good or bad for them. But if you look at the \nincentives, the subsidy for people who do not get insurance through \ntheir employer, if you make $42,000 a year, today with your health \ninsurance through your employer you get a benefit of about $5,749 from \nthe tax system. But under this bill, you will be eligible for $12,500 \nworth of subsidy.\n  What do you think an employer is going to do? They are going to look \nat their employees and they are going to say: I have to pay this \npenalty if I don't offer this, but it is a significantly smaller amount \nthan what I am paying today. Therefore, I am going to make a decision \nto no longer offer health insurance, give my employees a small raise \nbecause the government is going to come in with $12,500 worth of \nsubsidies to put them in a ``private'' plan inside the parameters of \nwhat is in the exchange. How many people do you think it is going to \nshift?\n  What we are going to get is adverse selection. So the individual--\nlet's say I am working and I am making $42,000 a year and my employer \ndecides to do that and let's say I am 35 years old and I know available \nto me is $12,500. Even though my earnings may go up, I am still 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes better off.\n\n  I also know I will have to pay $3,000 or $4,000 of my own money to \nget that benefit. I will not cover myself because I know I can cover my \nlittle incidentals. If I get sick, they have to cover me in the \nexchange.\n  So we are going to see adverse selection in the insurance market, \npeople who are between 40 and 64 who are sick are going to pay far more \nfor their health insurance and people who are sick who are younger than \n40 are going to pay far more for their health insurance and everybody \nwho is healthy under 40 is going to say: This is an economic bonanza \nfor me. I am not going to buy insurance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I see our friend from South Carolina has joined us. He \nhas spoken eloquently about some of the sweetheart deals that have been \nmade in this plan to ``buy'' votes. Could the Senator from South \nCarolina address those?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I don't know if you could call it a sweetheart deal more \nthan it is just repugnant. The campaign in 2008 was about change we \ncould believe in. I do believe one of the reasons President Obama won \nis because he convinced young people in this country that if he got to \nbe President, this country was going to change\n\n[[Page S13688]]\n\nfor the better; we were going to do things differently, and that \nresonated with people.\n  Quite frankly, when we were in charge, as Republicans, we let people \ndown. We let things get out of control on our watch. Some of our people \nwound up going to jail. The Iraq war was not popular. So you had this \nnew, young, exciting, articulate figure come along and promise a new \nway of doing business. That is what hurts so much about this bill. The \nspecial deals the Senator just mentioned remind us all why Congress is \nin such low standing.\n  The 60th vote--how did they get it? Did they negotiate the 60th vote \non C-SPAN in a transparent manner promised in the campaign that we \nwould have negotiations on C-SPAN so that you, the American people, \ncould watch what was being given and what was being taken and there \nwill be no more backroom deals?\n  Here is what happened. They took one Senator who was the key guy and \nthey put him in a room. We had no access to that room and no Democrat \ndid either. After it is all said and done, here is what resulted from \nthose negotiations that were not on C-SPAN.\n  Nebraska is going to be the only State in the Union, ladies and \ngentlemen, that new Medicaid enrollees will be covered by the Federal \nGovernment. Every other State in the Union, when you sign up a new \nperson on Medicaid, because you are expanding the number of people \neligible for Medicaid, your State is going to have to make a matching \ncontribution.\n  In my State of South Carolina, with 12 percent unemployment, there is \ngoing to be one-half million more people eligible for Medicaid under \nthis bill than exists today. It will cost my State of South Carolina $1 \nbillion. But if you live in Nebraska, it doesn't cost you a damn dime \nbecause that is what it took to get a vote.\n  If that is change we can believe in, count me out. If that is OK with \nthe American people, I can tell you our best days are behind us. The \ninsurance companies in Nebraska got a deal that no other insurance \ncompany in the Nation got. Physician-owned hospitals in Nebraska got a \ndeal that nobody else got. Louisiana got $300 million to help with \ntheir Medicaid problems that nobody else got.\n  If you want your country to be run in a more businesslike fashion, \nthen you need to speak up. You have a chance between now and sometime \nin January, when this goes back to the House, to let your voice be \nheard.\n  To my good friend from Nevada, the special deals in this bill are not \nspecial. They are the same old crap we have been putting up with for \ndecades up here and that people thought was going to come to an end. It \nis going to hurt your children's ability to have half of what you have \nbecause they cannot make it because you are about to pass on a bill to \nthem they cannot pay.\n  What I hope will happen, I say to my good friend, the Senator from \nNevada, is that the people will take their government back. If you \nthink this deal from Nebraska is unacceptable, speak up and speak out \nand let the House Members know you want it changed.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank our colleague from South Carolina. I know we are \nabout to run out of time, but I wanted to go back to the Chief Actuary \nat Medicare because I think the way they analyzed the bill is \nabsolutely essential for the American people to understand what is in \nit.\n  The Chief Actuary, the President's Actuary, said:\n\n       The Reid bill funds $930 billion in new spending by relying \n     on Medicare payment cuts which are unlikely to be sustainable \n     on a permanent basis.\n\n  It gets to what Dr. Coburn said. By design, maybe this could work, \nbut there is not a will because there is not reform. We have spent a \nlot of money, and at the end of the day, it looks as if the only thing \nwe have done is tried to address waste, fraud, and abuse. For $2.3 \ntrillion, it seems as if you could bring more bacon to the table. It \nseems as if there would be a little more meat.\n  It seems as if there would be some substance there we could look at \nand say: Look at the improvements our health care system makes.\n  I know Dr. Coburn has said many times: If we do this wrong, what we \ndo is we chase innovation out of this country, out of our system, the \nbreakthroughs that go from maintenance to cure, the research on a bench \nthat finds us new ways to address diabetes where amputation and \nblindness are not in somebody's future. If we go backward, if we chase \nthat innovation out, we lock ourselves into not only the most costly \nhealth care but health care that achieves the least amount of quality \nfor future generations.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I wish to ask Senator Coburn to address, in the last \ncouple of minutes here--because he has spoken so eloquently about debt \nand the Congressional Budget Office saying this helps the deficit by \nsome $100 billion--how the taxes go into effect right away and that the \nspending doesn't go into effect, and how that kind of smoke and mirrors \nhappens all the time around here; how they try to hide various \nexpenses, and what this is going to do to our debt.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, the disappointing thing--and I have worked on this \nfor 5 years, since I have been here--is we are not honest with the \nAmerican people about how we account for things, and this bill is \nanother example of that. Let me give you the quantifications.\n  If you read the CBO report on this bill, they talk about it is highly \nunlikely we will ever actually make the Medicare cuts, because they \nhave never seen it done, and every time we have said it in the past, we \nhaven't done it, like the sustainable growth rate formula in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. So if you match up revenues and expenses, \nwhat you see is a $1 trillion tax increase, a $1 trillion cut in \nMedicare, and an increasing cost to the economy.\n  But because there is not the sustainable growth rate--the doctor fix \nin the bill--that is $247 billion not accounted for, and that is if you \nkeep physician wages frozen over the next 10 years. That is $247 \nbillion, probably closer to $300 billion. So that is $300 billion. The \nfact is we know the taxes that are going to be collected, people are \ngoing to pull down the cost, which is one of their hopes, and they are \ngoing to pay for it out of their pocket.\n  So we are going to see that insurance plans not reach the Cadillac \nlevel, and we are counting on revenues from that in terms of billions \nand billions and billions of dollars. But what they will do is change \nthe deductibles--and that is a hidden tax. Because if your deductible \ngoes up to keep your insurance from going too high, your tax goes up in \nactual expenditures. So your ability to invest and create additional \njobs--in other words, it cascades. The honest accounting for this is \nthat there is no way this saves any money. It will cost money.\n  The final point I will make is they won't put forward the cuts in \nMedicare that they are claiming in this bill. Because they know if they \ntruly do put forth the cuts, and patients feel it, they won't be back \nhere. So it won't happen.\n  I will go back to what Senator Burr started this out with. If you are \ngoing to start tomorrow and fix health care, what would you do? You \nwould attack costs. Why are things so costly? One is because there is \nno transparency in markets. There is no real connectedness to your \npocket. No. 3, there is no incentive for prevention of chronic disease \nor the management of it. In other words, we don't pay people to have \nless expensive outcomes. We won't incentivize better care in that way. \nWe won't incentivize prevention.\n  We have done a lot of this on Medicare--and I will talk about it \ntomorrow--but they have three different agencies within this bill that \nare going to ration care. They are going to make the decisions for you, \nand not just on Medicare and Medicaid. Everybody needs to understand \nthat. It doesn't just apply to Medicare and Medicaid, it applies to \nyour choice of your private insurance. The government is going to \nration your care.\n  We know that is true because they wouldn't allow an amendment to \nprohibit rationing. They all voted against the amendments in committees \nwhen we offered amendments to limit rationing. So we know the intention \nis to ration care. If that is how we are going to control costs, then \nBernie Sanders is right--go to a single-payer, government-run system. \nBernie Sanders' system is far better than this one--far better than \nthis one--if that is what we\n\n[[Page S13689]]\n\nare going to do. If we are going to ration care, let everybody know it \nupfront. Let's be absolutely honest about it.\n  If you are 75 years of age and need a hip replacement but the quality \nof your life is not all that great, we are going to say you can't have \nit. That is what we are going to do, because that is exactly what they \ndo in England. They have the National Institute of Comparative \nEffectiveness which makes an evaluation of what your worth is. And no \nmatter what your history, no matter what your family situation, no \nmatter your income, you can't have it.\n  Canada is getting around that, because they have said you get the \nright to buy what you want. Their Supreme Court ruled on that 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago. So we are seeing a two-tiered system developing in Canada, \nwhich ultimately will happen in this country--worse than what we have \ntoday.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will yield, though, if America does this \nwith our health care system, where will the Canadians come for their \nhealth care when they need it? When they get it rationed up there, they \nusually come to the United States.\n  Mr. COBURN. They will go to Thailand or India.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. But where will Americans go?\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for holding this colloquy, and I will \nmake one final point before I stop.\n  I don't doubt the motivation of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. They want us to fix this problem--the problem in health \ncare. But the problem is cost. If you don't fix cost, and you expand \nthe same broken system, you haven't fixed anything. You have added to \nthe cost.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the good doctor, and I thank the Presiding Officer, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the great debate we \nare having on historic health care reform, and I am reminded of the \nwords of a great Republican, President Abraham Lincoln. He said:\n\n       We cannot escape history. The fiery trial through which we \n     pass will light us down in honor or dishonor of the latest \n     generation. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we \n     must rise with the occasion.\n\n  That is what Abraham Lincoln said. It is time to rise to the occasion \nbecause our friends on the other side of the aisle have chosen to sit \non their hands and do nothing. They have no plan. They have chosen to \ndelay and obfuscate.\n  If you look back in history, during the great debates on Social \nSecurity in 1935 and Medicare in 1965, our friends across the aisle \nwere on the wrong side of history. But in the end, there was a minority \nthat chose to stand up for historic social legislation and vote their \nconscience. They were not driven by the far rightwing of their party or \nby radio talk show hosts who demand ideological purity and see any \nattempt to support health care reform as an abandonment of principle.\n  Each of us is rarely called to act on such significant legislation, \nand when we are, it is our solemn duty to put aside our idealogy--turn \noff Rush Limbaugh--and leave politics in the cloakroom. Our vote on \nthis ground-breaking legislation--comparable to Social Security and \nMedicare--will be one of the most significant votes in American \nhistory. It should not be driven by the hope of failure that the other \nside prays for, rather by the will to succeed for the American people. \nThis Congress will be remembered for this vote for generations to come, \nand our friends across the aisle will once again be on the wrong side \nof history.\n\n  We have heard the same tired arguments over and over. We heard those \narguments in 1935 against Social Security. We heard them again in 1965 \nagainst Medicare--the same arguments we hear today. History has a way \nof repeating itself. If past is prologue, historic health care reform \nlegislation will be signed into law despite the naysayers, the \nfearmongers, the panderers to those who see any attempt at compromise \nas defeat.\n  To our friends on the other side, this is no longer about \nlegislating, it is simply about obstructing. It is no longer about \ndoing what is right for the American people but about stopping us from \ndoing anything. It is not about finding common ground but drawing lines \nin the sand.\n  My friends on the other side have set up an army of straw men, as \nthey did on Social Security and Medicare, manipulating the facts to \ncreate the illusion of refuting the false claims they created in an \nattempt to score political points.\n  They stand up the socialist straw man, call the bill a government \ntakeover of health care, and make Americans fear it. Well, we say: \nLet's make sure the Bernie Madoffs of the world, and people like him, \nare not selling health insurance.\n  They wave the flag, stand up the un-American straw man, saying the \nbill is against old-fashioned American values and denounce it. We say: \nDon't you dare question our patriotism. Do not dare question our \ncommitment to doing what is right for the American people.\n  They stand up the death panel straw man, claiming the legislation \nwould kill grandma, and denounce it as inhumane. We say: Stop the \noutrageous misinformation and tell the truth to the American people.\n  They stand up the taxing straw man, and say health care reform will \nincrease taxes. We say: We are making health care entities, such as \ninsurance companies, pay their fair share.\n  They set up the spending straw man, and say the bill will indebt the \nnext generation, despite Congressional Budget Office estimates to the \ncontrary. We say: You can't pick and choose when to believe the \nCongressional Budget Office and stand by their numbers only when it is \nconvenient to your cause.\n  For instance, my friend Senator Gregg, the ranking member on the \nBudget Committee, touts CBO numbers even on his specific bill, when \nthey benefit his arguments, for example, on malpractice provisions. But \nnow my friends on the other side conveniently dismiss the Congressional \nBudget Office numbers showing our health care plan reduces the deficit. \nSo you can't have it both ways.\n  They bring along their partisan straw man, accusing us of drafting a \nbill or having votes in the middle of the night. We say: How quickly \nyou forget the 4 months that we waited for Republicans in the \nbipartisan Gang of 6, three Democratic Members, three Republican \nMembers, working, supposedly, to achieve a bipartisan effort in health \ncare reform. Four months. Four months we waited for them to work with \nus in a constructive way, and then they all walked away. So don't come \nback now and say you had no input in the process when you chose that \ncourse.\n  And, by the way, these votes that take place at the time they take \nplace are because the Republicans insist on stopping the process and \ndelaying it and drawing it out. So under the procedures, once we start \nthe process to finish that delay, it ends up at certain hours--30 hours \neach time from the moment we file a motion to say that is enough of the \ndelay, let us move forward. Whenever those 30 hours end, that is when \nwe have to have the vote. But they could consent to have that vote in \nthe fullness of the day and light. But no, they want to have the vote \nas late as possible, hoping that 60 Members who want to see progress on \nthis reform don't come to this Chamber and, therefore, cannot stop the \nfilibuster. They want failure, and then they clamor about the time \nthese votes take place.\n  Straw man after straw man. They have done nothing but block this \nlegislation, as they have throughout the year on other legislation. \nThey will do anything, say anything to delay, deny, and defeat health \ncare reform.\n  They are on the wrong side of history now, as they were in 1935 and \n1965. But the difference between 1935 and Social Security and 1965 and \nMedicare and today is that when the debates ended in 1935 and 1965, \nwhen the legislation was weighed on its merits, there were those few \nRepublicans who voted their conscience, those who did not march in \nlockstep to the demands of rightwing talk show hosts or in fear of tea \nparty anarchists.\n  In 1935 and 1965, there were a few on the other side, a few who voted \nfor Social Security and Medicare because they knew it was right for \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S13690]]\n\nBut in 2009 it appears there will be no votes for health care reform--\nnot one, not a single vote from the other side of the aisle.\n  The ideological differences were as intense then as they are now but \npure obstinate ideology did not prevail then as it will in this Chamber \nwhen we vote. Before Social Security was debated, President Roosevelt \nlaid out the changes in society and the reasons why we needed Social \nSecurity legislation before the Congress. He said then:\n\n       Security was attained in the early days through the \n     interdependence of members of families upon each other and of \n     the families within a small community upon each other. . . .\n       The complexities of great communities and of organized \n     industry make less real the simple means of security. \n     Therefore, we are compelled to employ the active interests of \n     the nation as a whole, through government, in order to \n     encourage a greater security for each individual who composes \n     it.\n\n  That is what he said about Social Security. That is why we needed \nSocial Security and why we realize today that without Social Security \nmore than half of our seniors in this country would be living in \npoverty--more than half--if the voices then in opposition had \nsucceeded.\n  Then the debate began. There is no mention of death panels but there \nwere those Republicans who raised similar straw men to the voices we \nhear today. A member of the New York delegation, a Republican, Daniel \nReed said:\n\n       The lash of the dictator will be felt, and 25 million \n     Americans will for the first time submit themselves to a \n     fingerprint test.\n\n  Another said:\n\n       The bill . . . invites the entrance into the political \n     field of a power so vast, so powerful as to threaten the \n     integrity of our institutions and pull the pillars of the \n     temple down upon the heads of our descendants.\n\n  John Taber, another member of the New York delegation, a Republican, \nraised the antibusiness straw man, saying:\n\n       Never in the history of the world has any measure been \n     brought here so insidiously designed as to prevent business \n     recovery, to enslave workers.\n\n  In this Chamber, in the Senate, Senator Daniel Hastings of Delaware, \na Republican, raised the death-of-a-nation straw man, saying that \nSocial Security would ``end the progress of a great country.''\n  In this debate we have seen the same army of straw men standing \nagainst us. They have claimed that health care reform is a government \ntakeover that will threaten the integrity of our institutions, when in \nfact we create an exchange of private insurance companies that people \nwill be able to pursue.\n  They say it will ``pull down the pillars of the temple on our \ndescendants'' and leave them in debt, that it will drive private health \ninsurers out of business and put a bureaucrat between doctors and \npatients.\n  We already have bureaucrats between doctors and patients. They are \nhealth insurance company bureaucrats between doctors and patients. The \ndifference is when the debate ended on Social Security in 1935, when \nthe shouts of socialism and un-Americanism had faded, a few, a minority \non the other side, had the political courage to cross the line and vote \nyes.\n  But there will not be a single vote from the Republicans in favor of \nthis bill, not a single vote. Our colleagues on the other side want \nnothing more than to stop this bill, period, pure and simple. It is \ntheir intention to stand en bloc for insurance companies and against \nany health reform that would protect American families from losing \neverything if they get sick. Their plan is just to say no; and once \nagain they will squarely be on the wrong side of history.\n  When President Kennedy and later Lyndon Johnson fought for Medicare, \nthose on the other side raised the same army of straw men they raised \n30 years earlier. They played the same game they are playing again now. \nSenator Curtis of Nebraska at that time voiced opposition in this \nChamber saying, ``Medicare is not needed.'' He was a Republican Senator \nof the time, Mr. Curtis of Nebraska, who said:\n\n       [Medicare] is not needed. It is socialism. It moves the \n     country in a direction which is not good for anyone, whether \n     they be young or old. It charts a course from which there \n     will be no turning back. It is not only socialism, it is \n     brazen socialism.\n\n  In the other body, Congressman Hall of Missouri called it ``an ill-\nconceived adventure in government medicine.''\n  Those were the Republican voices of the past on Medicare. What senior \nin this country today--which one of our parents or grandparents--\nbelieves those words of the past as they relate to their health care \ntoday? More straw men, more fear, more naysaying--all of it wrong then, \nall of it wrong now.\n  They said bureaucrats would come between doctors and patients. They \nare wrong. That is why it is interesting to see that today the American \nMedical Association, the Nation's doctors--the people who take care of \nyou when you are ill, the ones who follow your progress when you have, \nmaybe, a debilitating disease or a lifetime health challenge, your \ndoctor, the voice of your doctor, not any Members of the Senate, the \nvoice of your doctor in support of this historic reform--said:\n\n       This is a time of great opportunity for the American health \n     care system. We have the chance to substantially expand \n     health insurance coverage, implement insurance market reforms \n     that promote greater choice, affordability and security, \n     improve [this is the doctors speaking] the quality of the \n     care and help Americans live longer, healthier, happier and \n     more productive lives. To that end [the doctors of the nation \n     say] we urge all Senators to support passage of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended.\n  This is the Nation's doctors. This is your doctor who is telling the \nMembers of the Senate: Vote for it. They do not believe the line that \nbureaucrats are going to come between doctors and patients. They are \nwrong, those who are saying that.\n  They called Medicare unpatriotic and un-American. They were wrong \nagain. They said it would mean the rationing of health care. They were \nwrong. They made the same argument they have been making for 74 years, \nand they are still wrong.\n  In 1965, the champion of my conservative friends, Ronald Reagan, \nissued a 19-minute-long LP, for those of us who still remember that, a \nlong-playing vinyl recording at the time. It is past--gone. They are \nlike antiques now. But it was entitled ``Ronald Reagan Speaks Out \nAgainst Socialized Medicine.''\n  It featured an impassioned 2,000-word speech intended to get people \nto write to their Congressman against the idea of Medicare that was \nbeginning to make its way through the Congress. That was 1965. It was \nreferred to as Operation Coffee Cup, something of a precursor to \ntoday's tea parties. In his record message, Ronald Reagan said:\n\n       One of the traditional methods of imposing socialism on \n     people has been by way of medicine. . . .\n\n  Does it sound familiar, in the year 2009, in the debates we have \nheard here on the floor? When he became President, one of the pillars \nof his health policy was cutting benefits, in particular through \nincreased cost sharing for Medicare and Medicaid recipients. He was \nwrong then, just as our conservative friends are wrong now.\n  In the face of yet another landmark piece of legislation, is it \npossible there is not one of my friends on the other side who does not \nin their heart believe we need to pass this legislation for the good of \nthe American people, regardless of ideology? Is there not one of my \nfriends on the other side who will vote yes to help Americans who have \nlost their jobs and their health care and stand to lose everything if \nthey or a member of their family becomes ill?\n\n  My friends, saying no to accessible, affordable health care for the \nAmerican people is too big a price to pay for ideological purity. When \nI think of what this legislation will do, I cannot believe there will \nnot be one vote on the other side to provide competition and affordable \nchoices for every American, as this bill does; not one vote for greater \naccountability for health insurance companies; not a vote for more \nchoice and competition for consumers, for programs that will rein in \nhealth costs and make policies more affordable.\n  Is this bill perfect? No. But it is a great and historic foundation \nof reform. Yet there will not be one vote on the other side to improve \naccess to quality care for children, as this bill provides for, and the \nmost vulnerable among us, which the bill does. Not a single vote for \ntougher accountability policies, for health insurance companies that \nare included in this legislation? Not one vote to require insurers to \nspend more of the premium revenues on health care rather than on \nadministrative costs, executive compensation,\n\n[[Page S13691]]\n\nand boosting the bottom line? Not a vote to hold health insurers \naccountable for excessive rate increases? Not a single vote on the \nother side to immediately ban insurance companies from denying \nchildren--we hear a lot about the sanctity of life--coverage for a \npreexisting condition? Not one vote for expanding eligibility for tax \ncredits for small businesses and starting the health insurance tax \ncredit next year? That is why it is interesting to note that among the \nmany supporters of this, the Business Roundtable, they are quoted as \nsaying:\n\n       The proposed legislation is a step towards our shared goal \n     of providing high quality, affordable health care for all \n     Americans.\n\n  It is why the Small Business Majority says the managers' amendment, \nSenator Reid's amendment, ``includes new provisions essential for small \nbusiness protection and survival.'' That is the voice of business.\n  Not one vote for a bill that promotes competition for insurers and \nchoice for workers? Or to test alternatives to civil tort legislation \nthat emphasize patient safety, disclosure of health care errors, and \nresolutions of disputes? Not one vote.\n  Not one vote for people in my home State of New Jersey and every \nState who will see direct and immediate benefits from this legislation? \nNot a vote for every uninsured Jerseyan who has a preexisting condition \nand has been unable to find affordable health insurance in the \nmarketplace? The health of our families is not a commodity. It is not a \nprivilege for the wealthy. It is something everyone should be able to \nbe protected from without going broke.\n  Under this legislation, 1.3 million seniors in my home State will be \neligible for free preventive care for recommended services. Seniors \nwill also be eligible for free annual wellness visits to their doctors, \nand will be provided with a personalized prevention plan so they can \nstay healthy.\n  When this legislation is signed, we will have lived up to our promise \nto fill the doughnut hole, that gap in coverage under Medicare Part D, \nto provide affordable prescription drugs to over 227,000 seniors in New \nJersey and millions across the country so they will no longer have to \nchoose between paying their bills and taking the medication.\n  When this legislation is signed, over 850,000 New Jerseyans will \nqualify for tax credits to help them pay for health insurance, easing \nthe burdens, premiums, deductibles, and copayments. It will make tax \ncredits for up to 50 percent of health care premiums available to over \n100,000 small businesses in New Jersey. It will also put an end to the \nhidden tax that is passed along to everyone in my State through \nincreased premiums and costs to pay for the over $1 billion spent on \nuncompensated care in New Jersey.\n  This legislation includes a health insurance exchange that would \nprovide portability, security, and choice for 1.3 million New Jersey \nresidents who presently do not have any health insurance whatsoever. It \nwill increase the number of doctors, nurses, and dentists for the \n150,000 New Jerseyans, 2 percent of the population who live in areas \nwhere they do not have access to primary care because of a shortage of \nhealth care providers in their communities, yet there will not be one \nsingle vote for this legislation on the other side, not a single vote \nfor any of these health reforms to help hard-working families in my \nState and in States across the country.\n\n  This is the politics of no, pure and simple. I suppose it is nice to \nsay no to health care reform when you have the full protection of \nhealth care yourself. But it is wrong to say you are unwilling to \nafford the same protections to others. It is nice to say no to health \ncare reform when you and your family will not be denied coverage \nbecause of the privileged position you hold but wrong to let even one \nmother, one father hear that their child has been denied the medical \ntreatment they desperately need.\n  I say to my friends, how dare you stand in unison on the other side \nof the aisle and deny to others that which you so fully enjoy \nyourselves. How can you deny to others that which you so fully enjoy \nyourselves. It is inconceivable to me that when all is said and done, \nwhen our differences have been aired and debate has ended, that not one \nof my colleagues on the other side will see the historic nature of this \nlegislation. We can be proud of this legislation. I know when the dust \nsettles and the provisions of the bill become clear, America will be \nproud of it as well.\n  This landmark reform legislation includes State-based insurance \nexchanges, creating a fair, open, competitive marketplace for \naffordable coverage. It includes an amendment I proposed for long \noverdue consumer protections for emergency services. When you are \ngetting sent to a hospital, you are not thinking about calling your \ncompany and saying: Is this the right hospital? Am I going to be \ncovered without regard to prior authorization?\n  It requires insurance plans to provide behavioral health treatments, \nsuch as those for children who are autistic, as part of the minimum \nbenefits standard. It encourages investments in new therapy to prevent, \ndiagnose, and treat acute and chronic disease with a tax credit for \ninnovative biotechnology research. It ensures that minor children \nqualify as exchange-eligible and provides for the availability of \nchild-only health insurance coverage in the exchanges. It stops \ninsurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions, \nhealth status, or gender, and it ends the medical benefits shell game \nthat insurers have played with people's lives.\n  The bottom line is this legislation helps New Jersey and America. It \nis fair, balanced, and fixes a badly broken system. It is truly a \nhistoric piece of legislation and will be remembered as such. Yet every \none of my colleagues on the other side will vote no. They will stand \nagainst all of it, all I have talked about, firmly, once again, on the \nwrong side of history.\n  Let me conclude by saying, as I have said before, and I will say \nagain, history calls on us to stand up on rare occasions for what is \nfair and just and right for the American people. This is one of those \noccasions. This is a time to look into your heart, a time to see beyond \nyour own political interests, your own hard ideology, and look at the \nlives of millions of Americans. Think about the millions of families on \nMain Street, in every community, where a child wakes up in the middle \nof the night to a parent who cannot afford to get them the basic care \nthey need. Ask yourself: What is the right thing to do?\n  This is a time to do what is right for America. It requires more than \nparliamentary maneuvers to slow the process. It requires more than \nshrill voices raised under the banner of free market values at the \nexpense of fundamental human values. It requires doing what is right \nfor the millions of American families who have lost their jobs and \ntheir health care, those who have suffered from the economic policies \nof the last 8 years and now find themselves hurting. This is a time to \nremember them, a time to remember every mother who cries herself to \nsleep at night because she lost her job, lost her health care for \nherself and her infant and could lose everything she struggled for in \nher life, if she gets sick.\n  I say again to my friends, how dare you deny to her the protections \nthat you so fully enjoy yourself. How dare you turn this into a \nparliamentary game of delay, deny, and defeat. Those who have \ncontinuously said no to any attempt at health care reform and yes to \nthe needs of the insurance industry believe that the business of \ngovernment is business. But for all of us who know the business of \ngovernment, what it really is, it is about people. It is about those \nwho send us here. It is their lives, their hopes, their dreams for a \nbetter life for themselves and their families. This is an opportunity \nto stand up for them. This is an opportunity to take care of their \nhealth care. This is an opportunity to show whose side you are on.\n  Are you on the side of those families or are you on the side of the \nspecial interests that would have you vote no, or the ideological \ninterests that would have you vote no against these families? This is \nhistoric legislation. I am afraid our friends on the other side will \nonce again, as they did in Social Security and Medicare, find \nthemselves on the wrong side of history.\n  I intend to be on the right side of history and to vote yes on this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the progress \nmade\n\n[[Page S13692]]\n\non health care reform, as well as stress the fact that we must press \nforward. Americans face out-of-control health care costs, great \ninequalities in access to care, eroding benefits, and the ever-\nincreasing threat of losing their health insurance. While it has not \nbeen an easy task to reach a consensus, we find ourselves very close to \nfixing our health care system and extending access to health insurance \nto over 31 million Americans.\n  I have heard from countless South Dakotans whose stories illustrate \nthe urgent need for reform. Just as the diseases and health care \nemergencies they face cannot be postponed, it is imperative we forge \nahead and deliver reforms that will improve their health and security.\n  I would like to share the story of Susan from Rapid City, SD, a 57-\nyear-old woman who has nearly depleted her savings and plans to sell \nher home in order to pay her bills and medical expenses. Her husband \npassed away several years ago and she now survives on his modest \npension. After exhausting COBRA health insurance, she bought the only \nprivate health insurance policy she could afford. She was forced to \naccept several riders for her preexisting conditions, arthritis and hay \nfever, so her insurance ``won't cover the problems that will soon need \nattention.'' She also has to pay out-of-pocket for most her \npreventative screenings and primary care because she has not reached \nher $5,000 deductible. She writes, ``I feel I am paying $250 a month \nfor unreliable health insurance.'' Until she reaches Medicare age or \ncan qualify for Medicaid, her only option is to sell down her assets to \npay the bills.\n  Like millions of Americans, Susan is vulnerable in the non-group \nhealth insurance market, where coverage is often expensive, inadequate \nand certainly not guaranteed. ``Without the security of group \ncoverage,'' she notes, ``I am very vulnerable and am one illness away \nfrom a catastrophe.'' Several provisions in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act will help Americans like Susan gain access to \nquality, affordable health insurance.\n  Under the Senate reform bill, all health insurers will be prohibited \nfrom using preexisting conditions to deny health care and it will be \nillegal for them to drop coverage when illness strikes. Health \ninsurance exchanges will create an accessible marketplace for Americans \nto shop for the best plan to meet their needs. Health insurers will \noffer national plans to all Americans under the supervision of the \nOffice of Personnel Management, the same entity that oversees health \nplans for Members of Congress. Tax credits will be available to make \ninsurance more affordable for those who need assistance, and the choice \nof doctor will be protected. These health insurance market reforms \ndemand greater accountability from insurance companies while creating \nmore choice and competition for consumers.\n  Despite a commitment by some to kill reform and defend the status \nquo, I am confident the strong consensus on the urgent need for reform \nwill prevail. The cost of inaction is too great.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the health insurance provider annual fee in \nthe so-called merged Senate health care reform bill did not distinguish \nbetween nonprofits and for-profit insurance companies in this country, \nalthough our current tax law properly does make the distinction.\n  I urged that the managers' package modify the fee to continue to \nrecognize the distinction.\n  Imposing the annual fee on true non-profits, particularly those with \nhigh pay-out rates to beneficiaries, would have pushed many of those \ntrue non-profits into deep financial difficulties and would have caused \nsignificant hardships on the families who rely on their services.\n  Some nonprofit insurers have not maximized the amount they pay out in \nmedical expenses to beneficiaries. That is why I urged the managers to \ninclude in the managers' package a provision exempting from the tax \nonly those nonprofits with very high payout rates. Those good \nperformers are committed to their policyholders rather than to profits \nfor stockholders, which is the goal of the for-profits. Those good \nperforming nonprofits are unable, as a result, to absorb the fees.\n  The managers' amendment specifies two ways for nonprofits to be \nexempt from the fee.\n  The first way for a nonprofit insurer to be exempt from the fee: one, \nit can not refuse to insure anyone in the State and is the State's \ninsurer of last resort; two, its premium prices are regulated by its \nState insurance regulator; and three, it must pay out in medical \nexpenses 100 percent or more of its premium revenues in the individual \nmarket.\n  The second way for a nonprofit to be exempt: the nonprofit insurer \nmust pay out a very high percentage of its premium dollars--at least 90 \npercent--in medical expenses in each of the three major market \nsegments: individual market, small group market, and the large group \nmarket; and it also must have an even higher overall payout rate of at \nleast 92 percent. A nonprofit that compresses its margins that far \nbeyond its peers for the benefit of its policyholders also warrants the \nexemption.\n  These exemptions continue the distinction that our tax law has \nrecognized--that true nonprofit insurance providers should not be \ntreated the same as their for-profit counterparts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after months of arduous work, the Senate \nwill finally take the first significant step toward bringing needed \nreforms to health care in this Nation. Opponents of reform have wasted \nmuch of the public's time by provoking arguments over their distortions \nabout what health reform means. Opponents have tried to demonize the \nplan, and have claimed it will never work. We have overcome weeks of \ndelay tactics employed by the minority--inexplicably, the most recent \ndelay due to a filibuster against a bill to provide funding for our \ntroops. These are the tactics of obstruction, and further demonstrate \nRepublicans' efforts to maintain the status quo.\n  Is this the exact bill that any one of us would have written? \nProbably not. I remain disappointed that the managers' amendment before \nus today strips the bill of a public insurance option to compete with \nprivate plans and does not include a provision I have sponsored to \nrepeal the antitrust exemption for health insurers and medical \nmalpractice insurers. I believe both of these provisions would go far \nin providing fair competition into the health insurance market.\n  But in looking at this bill as a whole, I believe it stands by the \ncore principles I sought at the beginning of this debate. It gives \nAmericans affordable access to health care coverage, it reduces costs \nfor families, businesses and government, and it protects consumers' \nability to choose doctors, hospitals and insurance plans.\n  The managers' amendment introduced by the majority leader \nincorporates many important changes to the underlying legislation that \nwill improve the bill. It includes several provisions that I have long \nsupported and promoted.\n  Vermont has always been a national leader in expanding access to \nhealth insurance. In coordinating care, offering comprehensive coverage \nto children, and developing a system of electronic health records, \nVermont has been at the forefront of reform. It is no surprise that for \nthe third year in a row Vermont has been ranked the healthiest State in \nthe Nation.\n  Unfortunately, a provision included in the underlying bill to expand \nMedicaid coverage nationwide threatened to penalize Vermont by \nexcluding the State from increased Federal funding, solely because \nVermont acted early to do the right thing. We can all share the goal of \nincreasing access to essential medical services by expanding Medicaid \ncoverage nationwide, but we should not penalize States such as Vermont, \nwhich demonstrated the initiative to expand its Medicaid Program early.\n  Senator Reid's amendment, however, remedies the anomaly in the \nunderlying bill, and will allow Vermont to access additional Federal \nfunding when the Medicaid expansion goes into effect. I thank Senators \nReid and Baucus for working with me to ensure that Vermont's efforts to \nexpand coverage to low income individuals is not set back by inequities \nin the underlying legislation.\n  The managers' amendment also incorporates a vital antifraud amendment \nSenator Kaufman and I, as well as Senators Specter, Kohl, Schumer,\n\n[[Page S13693]]\n\nand Klobuchar, introduced, derived from the Health Care Fraud \nEnforcement Act which we introduced earlier this fall.\n  This antifraud initiative builds on the impressive steps the \nadministration has already taken to step up health care fraud \nprevention and enforcement, and on the real progress represented by the \nantifraud provisions adopted by the Finance and HELP Committees and \nincorporated into the leader's health care reform bill. I was glad to \ncontribute to those efforts, and I am glad we are now going even \nfurther.\n  The Kaufman-Leahy provision will provide prosecutors with needed \ntools for the effective investigation, prosecution, and punishment of \nhealth care fraud. By making modest but important changes to the law, \nit ensures that those who drain our health care system of billions of \ndollars each year, driving up costs and risking patient lives, will go \nto jail, and that their fraudulent gains will be returned to American \ntaxpayers and health care beneficiaries.\n  For more than three decades, I have fought in Congress to combat \nfraud and protect taxpayer dollars. This spring, I introduced with \nSenator Grassley and Senator Kaufman the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct, the most significant antifraud legislation in more than a decade. \nWhen that legislation was enacted, it provided law enforcement with new \ntools to detect and prosecute financial and mortgage fraud. Now, as \nhealth care reform moves through the Senate, I am glad we are taking \nsteps to do all we can to tackle the fraud that has contributed greatly \nto the skyrocketing cost of health care.\n  The scale of health care fraud in America today is staggering. \nAccording to even the most conservative estimates, at least 3 percent \nof the funds spent on health care are lost to fraud--more than $60 \nbillion a year. In the Medicare Program alone, the General \nAccountability Office estimates that more than $10 billon was lost to \nfraud just last year. While Medicare and Medicaid fraud is significant, \nit is important to remember that health care fraud does not occur \nsolely in the public sector. Private health insurers also see billions \nof dollars lost to fraud. That fraud is often harder for the government \nto track. Private companies have less incentive to report it, and in \nsome cases, are responsible for the fraudulent practices themselves. \nReining in private sector fraud must be a part of any comprehensive \nhealth care reform.\n  The Kaufman-Leahy provision makes a number of straightforward, \nimportant improvements to existing statutes to strengthen prosecutors' \nability to combat health care fraud. The bill would increase the \nFederal sentencing guidelines for health care fraud offenses. Despite \nthe enormous losses in many health care fraud cases, offenders often \nreceive shorter sentences than other white-collar criminals. This lower \nrisk is one reason criminals are drawn to health care fraud. By \nincreasing the Federal sentencing guidelines for health care fraud \noffenses, we send a clear message that those who steal from the \nNation's health care system will face swift prosecution and substantial \npunishment.\n  The provision provides for a number of statutory changes to \nstrengthen fraud enforcement. For example, it would expand the \ndefinition of a ``Federal health care fraud offense'' to include \nviolations of the antikickback statute and several other key health \ncare-related criminal statutes, which will allow for more vigorous \nenforcement of those offenses, including making their proceeds subject \nto criminal forfeiture. It also clarifies the intent requirement of \nanother key health care fraud statute in order to facilitate effective, \nfair, and vigorous enforcement.\n  The managers' amendment also includes our provision amending the \nantikickback statute to ensure that all claims resulting from illegal \nkickbacks are considered false claims for the purpose of civil action \nunder the False Claims Act, even when the claims are not submitted \ndirectly by the wrongdoers themselves. All too often, health care \nproviders secure business by paying illegal kickbacks, which needlessly \nincreases health care risks and costs. This change will help ensure \nthat the government is able to recoup from wrongdoers the losses \nresulting from these kickbacks.\n  The Kaufman-Leahy measure gives the Department of Justice limited \nsubpoena authority for civil rights investigations conducted pursuant \nto the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act. This provision \nallows the government to more effectively investigate conditions in \npublicly operated institutions, such as nursing homes, mental health \ninstitutions, and residential schools for children with disabilities, \nwhere there have been allegations of civil rights violations.\n  These changes will strengthen our ability to crack down on fraud and \nwill ultimately result in significant savings that will make health \ncare more efficient and more affordable.\n  I am also pleased Senator Reid's amendment includes a key reform to \nthe False Claims Act that Senator Sanders, Senator Grassley, and I have \nproposed. By fixing the False Claims Act's public disclosure provision, \nwe can ensure that we fairly and appropriately empower whistleblowers \nto come forward to expose fraud, which is a crucial way to save the \ngovernment money and ensure the health and well-being of Americans.\n  We all agree that reducing the cost of health care for American \ncitizens is a critical goal of health care reform. We in Congress must \ndo our part by ensuring that, when we pass a health care reform bill, \nit includes all the tools and resources needed to crack down on the \nscourge of health care fraud. This provision is an important part of \nthat effort.\n  I am also very encouraged that the amendment before us includes a \nmeasure I proposed with Senator Brown to expand Federal Tort Claims Act \nmedical malpractice coverage for free medical clinics. This expanded \ncoverage will help free clinics across the Nation continue to provide \nand improve a critical safety net for many Americans.\n  In 1996, Congress enacted legislation to cover volunteer medical \nprofessionals in free clinics with medical malpractice liability \ninsurance through the Federal Tort Claims Act. This coverage protects \nvolunteer medical staff against liability by substituting the Federal \nGovernment for an individual defendant. But without any explanation in \nthe legislative history, the coverage enacted in 1996 failed to provide \ncoverage for others who are essential to the operation of free clinics, \nsuch as nonmedical staff, contractors, board members, and the clinic \nitself. As a result, free clinics must use scarce funding to purchase \ninsurance on the private market to fill this gap. This lack of \ncomprehensive coverage for free clinics is inconsistent with the \ncoverage provided to community health centers, which benefit from \ncoverage for all employees. This provision will remedy this \ndiscrepancy.\n  This measure will have no impact on the legal rights of a patient \ninjured by a medical error; any victim of medical malpractice will \nstill be able to pursue a remedy for an injury under the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. Instead, this amendment will free up scarce resources that \nare currently being used to purchase liability insurance on the private \nmarket. Informal estimates indicate that this amendment could save free \nclinics across the country $15 to $20 million a year. These are funds \nthat will be redirected to providing essential medical services to low-\nincome and other Americans in need. For example, as a result of this \namendment, the Viola Startzman Free Clinic in Wooster, OH, will save \n$17,000 a year. The Americares Clinic in Stamford, CT, will save \n$31,000 each year. Our hard-working free clinics in Vermont will save \n$12,000 each year and will be able to put those savings toward helping \nVermonters in need of health care services. For free clinics operating \nthrough volunteerism and private donations and in a difficult economy, \nthese are substantial sums that if devoted to the care of Americans in \nneed will have a significant positive impact.\n  And the savings realized through this amendment will cost the \ntaxpayers little if anything. Free clinics do not perform high-risk \nprocedures such as obstetrics or surgeries, and thus are subject to a \nlesser risk of liability. Since 2004, when funds were first \nappropriated and set aside to cover any claims against free clinic \ndoctors, no claims have been filed. The bottom line is that this \namendment represents significant value to Americans in need of\n\n[[Page S13694]]\n\nhealth care services at little cost to the government and the taxpayer.\n  I thank Senator Brown for his support as a cosponsor, and I thank the \nmajority leader, Senator Harkin, and Senator Baucus for working with me \nto make this amendment part of the historic legislation before the \nSenate.\n  Over the course of the past month, I have listened to many of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle. It is not surprising that \nfrequently they have argued for one of their pet proposals--medical \nmalpractice reform. For as long as I have served in this Chamber, I \nhave fought against court-stripping measures that limit American's \naccess to their justice system. I have also fought to protect the \nsovereignty of States to make rules for their own justice systems. \nMedical malpractice claims are based on State law and for the most part \ntake place in State courts. I find it curious that some of the same \nSenators who pledge loyalty to federalism and the sovereignty of the \nStates under the tenth amendment are some of the same Senators who are \nso aggressively pushing for a Federal ``one-size-fits-all solution'' \nfor the justice systems in our 50 States.\n  The managers' amendment includes a provision addressing malpractice \nliability that has been introduced on a bipartisan basis several times \nover the past few years. I support this provision because it respects \nthe States' primary role in adjudicating the claims of patients injured \nor killed by medical errors. I also support this provision because it \nresists the notion that ``one-size-fits-all'' when it comes to \nlitigation issues and it includes the necessary safeguards for \npatients. I note for the Record that several States' efforts to reform \nmedical malpractice liability have been struck down as \nunconstitutional. For example, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, \nKansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and \nWisconsin have all enacted caps on damages associated with medical \nmalpractice claims. And all of those State laws were struck down as \nunconstitutional for good reason. I am heartened that no such amendment \nwas seriously considered in this Chamber because such arcane measures \nhurt our children, our senior citizens, and stay-at-home moms. The Wall \nStreet Journal has reported on this clear fact when it pointed out that \nthese caps deprive these groups of access to justice. If we create \nFederal caps on their ability to recover from serious injuries we are \ntelling them that they are worth less because they are retired or they \nchoose to stay home and raise a family or are young children. This is \nnot fair. I know that no doctor wants to harm a patient, but the \nsolution is not to take away the rights of patients who are seriously \ninjured.\n  The provision in the managers' amendment does not encourage draconian \ndamages caps and does not dictate what reforms States must consider. \nImportantly, however, it does include specific patient protections that \nmust be in place before a State can receive a grant for liability \nreform measures. To the extent that States can pass measures that \nimprove patient safety as well as expedite damages recovery for \nvictims, those reforms will truly improve our health care system.\n  I am disappointed, however, that the Health Insurance Antitrust \nEnforcement Act, which I introduced in September, was not part of the \nmanagers' amendment, and will not be part of the Senate's health reform \nlegislation. That legislation would repeal the antitrust exemption for \nhealth insurers and medical malpractice insurers, and is an integral \npart of injecting competition into the health insurance market.\n  While there are differing views on the best way to inject competition \ninto the health insurance market, we can all agree that health and \nmedical malpractice insurers should not be allowed to engage in \nblatantly anticompetitive practices, such as colluding to set prices \nand allocating markets. My repeal would ensure that basic rules of fair \ncompetition will apply to insurers, and is nonpartisan.\n  My amendment was cosponsored by 23 Senators, and has support from a \ncross-section of consumer rights organization. I look forward to \nworking to include this repeal when the Senate and House conference to \nreconcile their versions of the legislation.\n  The managers' amendment will improve the underlying bill, and I hope \nmy fellow Senators will support its passage so we can move toward final \npassage of the bill. Each day that passes without reform, 30 more \nVermonters lose their health insurance. We know our current health \nsystem is unsustainable. That threatens not only our health security, \nbut also our economic security. Doing nothing has been seen as an \noption before, but it simply is not an option now.\n  I hope now we can work together to pass a bill that will give \nmillions more Americans access to quality, affordable health care. We \nshould reject the tactics of delay and the efforts to obstruct, and \nremember that the Senate should be the conscience of the Nation. With \nthe Christmas season upon us, our constituents are looking to us to do \nthe right thing. We should adopt this amendment, advance this \nlegislation, and work to send it to the President without undue delay.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, one longstanding priority of mine has \nbeen to improve Medicare payments for hospitals known as tweeners. They \ntend to have too many beds, so they can't qualify as critical access \nhospitals, but they do not have sufficient volume to operate viably \nunder Medicare's prospective payment systems. There are a number of \nthese tweener hospitals in Iowa.\n  Working closely with the Iowa Hospital Association and individual \nIowa hospitals over the years, I introduced, last Congress, the Rural \nHospital Assistance Act of 2008, S. 3300, which would improve the low-\nvolume adjustment for hospitals under Medicare's hospital inpatient \nprospective payment system. This improvement would enable tweener \nhospitals to benefit from this adjustment.\n  In fact, the low volume adjustment provision in the Finance \nCommittee's health reform bill, S. 1796, and the Reid substitute to \nH.R. 3590 is the language that I crafted. This language was crafted \nwith the intention of benefiting all Iowa tweener hospitals. I was \nassured by the Iowa Hospital Association that this language would do \nso, and they supported it.\n  Unfortunately, after the Finance Committee markup of S. 1796, I \nlearned from the Iowa Hospital Association that the language they \noriginally supported would not benefit all Iowa tweener hospitals. I \nwas informed that several Iowa tweener hospitals had Medicare \ndischarges in excess of the maximum in the provision, which was 1,500.\n  In an attempt to make sure that all Iowa tweener hospitals benefit \nfrom this provision, I filed an amendment that would increase the \nmaximum number of Medicare discharges from 1,500 to 1,600. This \namendment was also offset. My staff was successful in working with the \nmajority staff to include my amendment in the manager's amendment to \nthe Reid substitute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on Monday morning at 1 a.m., I voted no on \nthe cloture motion to the latest Reid managers' package, which was only \nmade available Saturday, because I am adamantly opposed to this $2.5 \ntrillion government-run health care system with its $\\1/2\\ trillion \nincrease in taxes on Americans and nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to \nMedicare to help pay for it. I am opposed to public financing of \nabortion this bill allows. I am opposed to a facade of health care \nreform that in no way seriously addresses tort reform and will only \nincrease premiums and the cost of health care for all Americans. I am \nopposed to the special deals for only certain States in this bill to \nbuy off votes. I am opposed to the special deals for only certain \nStates in this bill to buy off votes. I am opposed to the increased \nburden of at least $26 billion on States including Oklahoma mandated \nunder this bill. I am opposed to no serious effort at all to include \nany amendments from Republicans. Republican amendments to block tax \nincreases, block cuts to Medicare, impose tort reforms, try to impose \nsome kind of discipline on the government take-over of health care in \nthis country, among other amendments and motions have failed by nearly \nparty-line votes. I am opposed to this bill, and most importantly, the \nAmerican people are opposed to this bill. They know this bill is a \ncomplete disaster. The next few votes leading up to the final vote on \nthis package are all procedural votes, and I will be opposed to them\n\n[[Page S13695]]\n\nall. But all 60 Democrats will vote for them. Democrats do what they \nare told. The votes include accepting this new Reid managers' package, \ncloture on the original Reid substitute, accepting the original Reid \nsubstitute, cloture on the underlying bill, and finally the final \npassage of his colossal mistake. Since I am opposed to each one of \nthese votes, I will not remain in Washington to vote against these \nprocedural maneuvers since that will have the same effect as voting no, \nand will return to vote against final passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13695-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, on December 31, 2009, the current \nbiodiesel tax credit will expire. This tax credit increases domestic \ndemand and provides an incentive for U.S. producers to increase \ninvestment and output. It is essential in producing biodiesel and \nallowing it to compete with petroleum diesel. Without the tax credit, \npetroleum marketers will be unwilling to purchase the more expensive \nbiodiesel, and demand will be heavily reduced.\n  As all of my colleagues know, the biodiesel tax credit provides a $1-\nper-gallon credit for biodiesel made from soybean oil or yellow grease \nand animal fats. The original version of this tax credit was passed in \n2004 and has been extended twice, most recently in October 2008.\n  As a result, the U.S. biodiesel industry has grown significantly over \nthe past several years, providing not just jobs but also the green jobs \nthis administration and many of my friends on the other side of the \naisle have so adamantly supported. However, the combination of volatile \ncommodity prices and weak motor fuel demand caused by the current \nrecession has severely affected the biodiesel industry for the worse \nand therefore increases our urgency to extend the credit today.\n  In Kentucky, public school districts, universities, National and \nState parks, local governments, and the Transportation Cabinet are \nusing biodiesel blends. These institutions and many Kentucky employers, \nincluding manufacturers in Kentucky, will be hurt beginning on January \n1 if we allow this tax credit to expire. One executive of a biofuel \nmanufacturing facility wrote to me to say:\n\n       The $1-per-gallon tax incentive is truly the difference \n     between the survival and collapse of this important industry. \n     Without this tax incentive, thousands of jobs will be lost \n     with plants closing down almost immediately after January 1. \n     And the nation will lose a vital link in its effort to reduce \n     our dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  As we continue our important business, I implore my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to work to get the extenders finished this year \nand to include the renewal of the biodiesel tax credit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13695-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               LIU XIAOBO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the \nindictment and trial by Chinese authorities of Mr. Liu Xiaobo for \n``incitement of state subversion.'' The evidence cited in support of \nthe charges were Mr. Liu's essays and association with Charter 08, a \nframework for democracy, human rights and the rule of law that was made \npublic a year ago this month.\n  That document was signed by Mr. Liu and some 300 other intellectuals \nand activists. Thousands more people have since added their names, most \nof them from inside China. I am told that Charter 08 is widely regarded \nas the most significant democratic reform movement in China in a \ndecade.\n  The charges against Mr. Liu are very disappointing. They illustrate \nhow little has improved in China regarding tolerance for freedom of \nexpression. I am informed that the Chinese Government has decided to \nbring Mr. Liu to trial, that international observers are permitted \nunder Chinese law, and this is consistent with international legal \nstandards on the openness and transparency of legal proceedings. I \nmention this because I am aware that former Governor of Pennsylvania \nand U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh has expressed a strong \ninterest in attending the trial as an observer, to show support for Mr. \nLiu and to convey the concern that he and others around the world have \nfor the larger implications of this case.\n  The arrest of Mr. Liu demonstrates a continuing, disturbing trend in \nChina. As Governor Thornburgh has written:\n\n       in recent years, China's leaders seemed to be tolerating \n     changes in the legal system. The number of private lawyers \n     and law firms has grown exponentially. Lawyers and citizens \n     energetically began pursuing rights in court. A ``wei quan,'' \n     or ``rights defense'' movement, grew up around lawyers and \n     activists seeking to use the laws on the books, and the \n     institutions allowed by law, to assert and defend human \n     rights without challenging the underpinnings of China's \n     communist system. Such efforts were tolerated at first, and \n     there were even modest signs of greater professionalism in \n     the communist judicial system.\n       Unfortunately, initial signs of progress have given way to \n     serious setbacks. Many lawyers who take on politically-\n     sensitive cases have been subject to a kind of backdoor \n     disbarment, finding it impossible to renew their licenses. \n     Some lawyers have been the target of surveillance, confined \n     to house arrest, the victims of physical attacks, raids and \n     confiscation of their property. Law firms and other groups \n     pursuing law in the public interest have been shut down.\n       Moreover, there has been an alarming increase in the use of \n     ``subversion'' or state security charges leveled against \n     activists. These cases have become a substitute for the old \n     ``counter-revolutionary'' crimes. Others convicted on such \n     grounds include Hu Jia, the AIDS activist who also criticized \n     abuses surrounding the staging of the Summer 2008 Olympic \n     Games and Huang Qi, who posted public information on his \n     website about the government's response to the Sichuan \n     earthquake.\n       Liu's prosecution requires a serious response from the \n     United States. Cooperating with China on other issues like \n     the environment or North Korea does not mean we must silence \n     ourselves when it comes to the rights and freedoms of China's \n     citizens. Indeed, we are unlikely to get meaningful \n     cooperation on any issue when we appear weak in defense of \n     our principles, which as President Obama has said many \n     times--most recently in his speech accepting the Nobel Peace \n     Prize--are universal principles.\n\n  I agree, and hope the Chinese authorities reconsider this case, \nrelease Mr. Liu, and dismiss the charges against him. There are so many \nissues on which we want to expand our cooperation with China, but the \npersecution of courageous Chinese citizens who are guilty of nothing \nmore than exercising rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights hinders that cooperation and China's own development.\n  If the charges are not dismissed, and Mr. Liu is brought to trial, \nhis trial should be attended by outside observers including top \nofficials of the U.S. Embassy and Governor Thornburgh. I hope the \nDepartment of State and our diplomats in Beijing will assist Governor \nThornburgh, including in obtaining a visa and access to the trial. It \nis important that the Chinese Government, and the Chinese people, know \nhow strongly we deplore what is being done to Mr. Liu, and what it says \nabout the need for China to meet its own commitments to respect \ninternationally recognized human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13695-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13695-S13696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIVE AMERICAN APOLOGY RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, I want to speak about a matter of \nsignificance to our Nation. As part of the Defense appropriations bill, \nCongress has enacted an apology to our Native Peoples for the \nhistorical wrongs that our Nation has committed against them. I am \nproud to have served as a cosponsor of the stand-alone apology \nresolution, S.J. Res 14, and commend Senators Brownback, Dorgan, and \nInouye for ensuring this needed apology will be made.\n  From the beginning, Native peoples welcomed early colonists at \nPlymouth Rock and in Virginia, and in my home State of Hawaii, the \nKingdom of Hawaii extended the aloha spirit to our visitors. During the \nAmerican Revolution, the United States entered into military alliances \nwith Indian nations to secure assistance in winning our independence. \nAs a nation, we pledged to respect the rights of Indian nations to \nself-government, self-determination and territorial integrity.\n\n[[Page S13696]]\n\n  Our Constitution recognizes native nations as prior sovereigns, with \na continuing right to self-government in the Indian commerce, \napportionment, treaty and supremacy clauses. The United States entered \ninto 370 treaties with Indian nations and treaties of peace, friendship \nand commerce with the Kingdom of Hawaii. In many ways, the United \nStates broke these treaties and engaged in acts of war against our \nNative peoples, taking lands by force, displacing Native peoples and \nleaving them in poverty and suffering. At times, the United States \ninformed indigenous, Native peoples that their continued residence on \ntheir original lands would be considered an act of war against the U.S. \nand if they did not leave, U.S. military forces commenced wars, \nimprisoned and killed Native leaders and people, and tragically, at \nplaces like Sand Creek and Wounded Knee massacred Native men, women, \nand children.\n  Congress and the executive branch enacted laws and policies that took \nNative children out of their homes and forced them to attend boarding \nschools, far from their families in an effort to suppress Native \ncultures and languages. Our Nation denied Indian nations religious \nfreedom. And these wrongs did not end in the 19th century. The United \nStates continued to take Native lands for various purposes, and in many \ncases has failed to safeguard Native lands, waters, and resources.\n  For these things, our Nation should and now does apologize. I commend \nmy colleagues, Senator Brownback, Senator Dorgan and our Senate \nAppropriations chairman, Senator Inouye, for leadership on this \nimportant and historic apology. I know from experience that an apology \ncan bring healing and reconciliation. Congress passed the Native \nHawaiian Apology Resolution, Public Law 103-150, in 1993 and it has had \na profound impact.\n  I encourage President Obama to issue an apology to our Native peoples \nthat truly reflects the many wrongs that we should apologize for to \nNative peoples. The strength and resilience of our indigenous people, \nAmerica's first people must be acknowledged. Despite the many \ntransgressions made against our Nation's first people, American \nIndians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians continue to make \nmeaningful contributions to the United States. This apology will be a \nhistoric act that can bring reconciliation and healing between our \nNative peoples and the American people as a whole.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would also like to highlight a \nsection of this conference report that means a great deal to many \nAmerican Indian tribal leaders in this country, to several of my \ncolleagues and to me personally, the Native American apology \nresolution.\n  I am very pleased to report that with the addition of this language \nin the defense appropriations conference report, we--the United States \nof America--will officially apologize for the past ill-conceived \npolicies and maltreatment by the United States toward the Native \npeoples of this land.\n  With the passage of this language, we, as a Nation, will reaffirm our \ncommitment toward healing our Nation's wounds rooted in a difficult \npast of Federal-tribal relations and work toward establishing better \nrelationships rooted in reconciliation and forgiveness.\n  Native Americans have a vast and proud legacy on this continent. Long \nbefore 1776 and the establishment of the United States of America, \nnative peoples inhabited this land and maintained a powerful physical \nand spiritual connection to it. In service to the Creator, Native \npeoples sowed the land, journeyed it, and protected it. The people from \nmy State of Kansas have a similar strong attachment to the land.\n  Like many in my State, I was raised on the land. I grew up farming \nand caring for the land. I and many in my State established a \nconnection to this land as well. We care for our Nation and the land of \nour forefathers so greatly that we too are willing to serve and protect \nit, as faithful stewards of the creation with which God has blessed us. \nI believe without a doubt citizens across this great Nation share this \nsentiment and know its unifying power. Americans have stood side by \nside for centuries to defend this land we love.\n  Both the Founding Fathers of the United States and the indigenous \ntribes that lived here were attached to this land. Both sought to \nsteward and protect it. There were several instances of collegiality \nand cooperation between our forbears--for example, in Jamestown, VA, \nPlymouth, MA, and in aid to explorers Lewis and Clark.\n  Yet, sadly, since the formation of the American Republic, numerous \nconflicts have ensued between our government, the Federal Government, \nand many of these tribes, conflicts in which warriors on all sides \nfought courageously and which all sides suffered. Even from the \nearliest days of our Republic there existed a sentiment that honorable \ndealings and a peaceful coexistence were clearly preferable to \nbloodshed. Indeed, our predecessors in congress in 1787 stated in the \nnorthwest ordinance:\n  ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed toward the \nIndians.''\n  Today we live up to this goal, today, we right a wrong that has been \ncommitted in this Nation.\n  This amendment extends a formal apology from the United States to \ntribal governments and Native peoples nationwide--something we have \nnever done; something we should have done years and years ago.\n  Further, this resolution will not resolve the many challenges still \nfacing Native Americans, nor will it authorize, support or settle any \nclaims against the United States. It doesn't have anything to do with \nany property claims against the United States. That is specifically set \naside and not in this bill.\n  What this amendment achieves is recognition, honor, and the \nimportance of Native Americans to this land and to the United States in \nthe past and today and offers an official apology for the poor and \npainful path the U.S. Government sometimes made in relation to our \nNative brothers and sisters by disregarding our solemn word to Native \npeoples. It recognizes the negative impact of numerous destructive \nFederal acts and policies on Native Americans and their culture, and it \nbegins--begins--the effort of reconciliation.\n  Apologies are oftentimes difficult, but like treaties, go beyond mere \nwords and usher in a true spirit of reconciling past differences and \nhelp to pave the way toward a united future--a future that transcends \nthe individual but strives to reach into eternity. The notion of the \ncreation of the ``Beloved Community'' that Dr. King spoke of . . . that \nmy good friend representative John Lewis speaks of is very appropriate \nat this moment for this time. ``The end is reconciliation, the end is \nredemption, the end is the creation of the beloved community.'' This is \nour goal; this is my hope for our Nation united as one people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13696-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13696-S13697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUNT ANNE IS 100 YEARS OLD TODAY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today is a momentous day in the history \nof the Specter/Shanin family. My aunt Anne Shanin Kleiman is 100 years \nold.\n  My Tante Annie, that's the Jewish name for Aunt Annie, is the younger \nsister of my mother, Lillie Shanin Specter. Annie is an outstanding \nscholar who published a book on Hebrew poetry.\n  She was the first person who taught me about Israel. She traveled to \nIsrael before Israel was declared a state, when it was called \nPalestine. She sent me a beautiful wooden camel as a starting point to \ndescribe Biblical Canaan which later was called Palestine and is now \nIsrael.\n  Annie married a distinguished scientist/chemist, Dr. Morton Kleiman, \nand had two brilliant children, Dr. Adina Sue Kensky and Dr. Jay \nKleiman who has two accomplished children and two adorable \ngrandchildren.\n  During the Depression when times were very tough and my family was \nstruggling, Annie loaned my father $500, an act of real generosity in \ntough times. Over the years, I have visited her many times, sought her \nadvice, savored her excellent cooking, and enjoyed her company.\n  My first visit was to Chicago, where she has lived for many years. \nThere I saw the marvels of the World's Fair. I rode in a scary cable \ncar over Lake Michigan and was hoisted on to the stage by my father on \na sideshow with an Indian chief. This occurred in the midst of the \nDepression when my family was en route from Wichita, KS,\n\n[[Page S13697]]\n\nwhere we had lived, to Philadelphia, PA, to live with my father's \nsister because my father could not earn a living in Kansas.\n  Recently, not unexpectedly, Annie has become infirm. When I have \nvisited in recent years, it has been difficult to talk to her, but last \nnight we had a nice conversation over the phone.\n  Her longevity has set a remarkable family record evidencing good \ngenes and setting a Strom Thurmond-like target to emulate. She is a \nwonderful woman, a wonderful aunt, and a wonderful role model.\n  Happy Birthday, Tante Annie!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13697-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RECOGNIZING ESTABROOK'S\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with Christmas just a few short days \naway, we have all witnessed the signs of the season popping up in our \nneighborhoods. From vibrant wreaths and Christmas trees to wind-blown \nsnow banks, these peaceful symbols provide many of us with a comforting \nfeeling of home. Today I recognize a small Maine nursery that grows its \nown beautiful poinsettias, and supplies many other seasonal flora, to \naccentuate the beauty of the Christmas season.\n  Estabrook's has been a reliable family-owned, full service garden \ncenter for more than 50 years. Located in the coastal town of Yarmouth, \nEstabrook's grows fresh plants in its over 20 greenhouses and outdoor \ngrowing areas. The company also operates seasonal locations in \nScarborough and, beginning earlier this year, in Kennebunk. Home to an \nabundance of trees and shrubs, perennial and annual flowers, and seeds \nfor growing vegetables, Estabrook's also carries a variety of gardening \nsupplies, such as chemicals, fertilizers and tools. In an effort to \nbetter inform its customers about the wonders of gardening, Estabrook's \nuser-friendly website offers a variety of tips and best practices \nregarding caring for flowers and plants.\n  To properly celebrate the holidays, Estabrook's provides its clients \nwith an abundance of seasonal items. For example, during the Christmas \nseason the nursery creates stunning fresh centerpieces and grows its \nown brilliant red poinsettias. Additionally, aside from Christmas trees \nand wreaths, the company stocks a variety of garlands, roping, and \nother timely decorating supplies and ornaments to bring home the \nmemorable sights and smells of the season.\n  Beyond its role as a stellar nursery, Estabrook's prides itself as \nbeing an extraordinarily active member of the local community. The \ncompany has widely promoted the Herbie Project, an undertaking to save \nNew England's largest American Elm Tree, known to locals as Herbie. \nThis initiative is particularly noteworthy given that Yarmouth has lost \nroughly 800 American Elm trees to Dutch Elm Disease over the past fifty \nyears. Additionally, Estabrook's has donated its gift certificates, \ncleverly known as ``Estabucks,'' to community efforts, including the \nHoliday Boast N Toast Auction to benefit the Yarmouth Chamber of \nCommerce's Scholarship Fund and YarmouthCAN, a nonprofit that assists \nthose needing a helping hand. The nursery has also taken great strides \ntoward creating the Yarmouth Community Garden, which raises vegetables \nthat are then donated to the area's disadvantaged individuals and \nfamilies.\n  A well-known and trusted name in the community for over half a \ncentury, Estabrook's is a valued business in the town of Yarmouth \nbecause of its longstanding dedication to quality greenery and its \nvisible presence in civic endeavors townwide. I thank everyone at \nEstabrook's for their caring and kind commitment to others, and wish \nthem a happy and safe holiday season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13697-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SOUTH DAKOTA SCHOOL OF MINES AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the South Dakota \nSchool of Mines and Technology, which will celebrate their 125th \nanniversary in 2010.\n  Located in Rapid City, the South Dakota School of Mines and \nTechnology has been a national leader in preparing world-class \nengineers and scientists since 1885. Graduates design, construct, and \noperate the most modern technology to meet complex challenges such as \nclimate change, bioenergy, mineral extraction and processing, advanced \nmaterials, environmental quality, and national defense. School of Mines \nalumni are held in the highest regard by their fellow leaders in \nindustry, consulting, government, health, research, and education.\n  The School of Mines is proud to be a leading partner in bringing the \nDeep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory, DUSEL, from an \nextraordinary vision to a phenomenal reality. The longstanding \nconnections between the School of Mines and the Homestake Mine began in \n1885 when the university was established to meet the growing research \nneeds of the mining industry, led by Homestake. These connections \ncontinued when nearly a decade ago, the School of Mines helped champion \nthe conversion of the mine into a national laboratory. Today, as we \ncontinue to prepare leaders in engineering and science, we are \ncollaborating with our colleagues to transform Homestake into a world-\nclass laboratory to further exceptional research and discoveries not \nyet imagined.\n  Rugged individuals and pioneers in engineering and science founded \nthe School of Mines' intellectual environment more than a century ago. \nThe university's faculty, staff, students, and alumni carry on that \ntradition today. In 2010, the School of Mines celebrates 125 years of \naward-winning faculty, staff, and students collaborating to solve \nissues of critical importance to South Dakota, the nation, and the \nworld.

A bill to make improvements to certain loan programs under \nthe Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Helping Small Business Succeed Act of 2009. My legislation will \nmake it easier for small businesses to access credit, credit which they \ndesperately need to be able to cover their costs, grow their \nbusinesses, and create jobs.\n  Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country, \nresponsible for 60 percent of new jobs created. The Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania alone has 978,831 small businesses, which bring economic \nopportunities to diverse groups of people, innovate new technologies, \nand provide valuable services to their communities. Of these small \nbusinesses, 236,775 are small employers who represent 98.4 percent of \nPennsylvania's employers and 49.9 percent of its private-sector \nemployment. It is not an understatement to say that small businesses \nand their ability to grow are vital to the health of Pennsylvania and \nof the Nation.\n  Earlier this month, the Labor Department released jobs figures \nindicating that unemployment has dropped from 10.2 percent in October \nto 10 percent in November, and that the economy shed only 11,000 jobs, \nwhich was well below analysts' expectations. While these numbers are \nencouraging, leading economists such as Joseph Stiglitz have stated \nthat recovery will be slow unless we continue to take strong measures.\n  When I voted for the stimulus, we were facing a recession that could \nwell have developed into a full-fledged depression like we faced in \n1929. The stimulus provided $630 million to the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, to guarantee private sector loans to small \nbusinesses, which allowed the SBA to raise its loan caps, and increased \nSBA guarantees from 75-80 percent to 90 percent in its two major \nbusiness loan programs. These provisions have proven effective in \nproviding credit to small business, but more needs to be done. My \nlegislation permanently increases the loan limit from $2 million to $5 \nmillion on 7(a) loans, from $1.5 million to $5.5 million on 504 loans, \nand from $35,000 to $50,000 on microloans.\n  Simply raising loan limits is not enough, however. Raising the SBA's \nguarantee will increase commercial lenders' willingness to provide \nloans because it reduces the risk undertaken by lenders. My legislation \nraises the maximum loan guarantee percentage to 97.5 percent, which \nwill quickly and efficiently incentivize the existing network of \nfinancial institutions to make affordable loans to small business. \nAdditionally, my legislation extends the waivers for the 7(a) borrower \nfees and the 504 borrower and bank fees, which were enacted as part of \nthe stimulus package, until 2011.\n  Finally, my legislation authorizes the SBA to declare certain \ncommunities ``economic disaster areas'' and to provide further \nassistance to small businesses within these areas. The economic \nsituation in many towns across America has risen to emergency levels. \nUnemployment in some counties in Pennsylvania has risen as high as 12 \nand 14 percent. My legislation will provide the SBA with greater \nflexibility to use its funds to target areas of the country where the \nlevel of unemployment exceeds the national level and where small \nbusinesses have been hit the hardest.\n  According to the October 2009 Special Inspector General Report to \nCongress, taxpayers have seen $73 billion in TARP funds returned so far \nwith a 10 percent return on their investment. As of September 30, 2009, \n$9.5 billion in interest, dividends, and other income has had been \nreceived by the federal government. My legislation uses this revenue, \nderived from investments made through TARP, to pay for these urgently \nneeded adjustments.\n  Small businesses need access to credit and they need it now more than \never, if they are to weather current economic conditions. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to provide further assistance to \nthe small business community and to help restore their ability to \ncreate jobs and stimulate our economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2921. A bill to provide for the conservation, enhanced recreation \nopportunities, and development of renewable energy in the California \nDesert Conservation Area, to require the Secretary of the Interior to \ndesignate certain offices to serve as Renewable Energy Coordination \nOffices for coordination of Federal permits for renewable energy \nprojects and transmission lines to integrate renewable energy \ndevelopment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCalifornia Desert Protection Act of 2010.\n  I strongly believe that conservation, renewable energy development, \nand recreation can and must coexist in the California Desert--and this \nlegislation strikes a carefully conceived balance between these \nsometimes competing concerns.\n  The key provisions of this bill would designate two new national \nmonuments--the Mojave Trails and the Sand to Snow National Monuments.\n  It would add adjacent lands to the Joshua Tree and Death Valley \nNational Parks and the Mojave National Preserve; designate 5 new BLM \nwilderness areas and protect 4 important waterways, such as the \nAmargosa River and Deep Creek, as Wild and Scenic Rivers; improve the \nprocess to permit large-scale wind and solar development on suitable \npublic and private lands in the California desert; and enhance \nrecreational opportunities in the desert, while ensuring that the \ntraining needs of the military are met.\n  This bill is the product of painstaking discussions with key \nstakeholders--including environmental groups, local and State \ngovernment, off-highway recreation enthusiasts, hunters, cattle \nranchers, mining interests, the Department of Defense, wind and solar \nenergy companies, California's public utility companies, and many \nothers. I am grateful for all of their efforts.\n  The bill is divided into two titles.\n  The first title primarily covers conservation, recreation, and other \npurposes.\n  The second title of the bill covers renewable energy development on \nsuitable lands.\n  Taken together, this bill will shape the future of the Southern \nCalifornia Desert, and I believe it can serve as a model for future \nefforts to balance renewable energy development and conservation.\n  As of today, this bill has been endorsed by: the California \nWilderness Coalition; the Wildlands Conservancy; the Wilderness \nSociety; the National Parks Conservation Association; Friends of the \nRiver; Cogentrix Energy; Edison International, parent company of \nSouthern California Edison; Friends of Big Morongo Canyon Preserve; \nFriends of the Desert Mountains; Mojave Desert Land Trust; Desert \nProtective Council; Amargosa Conservancy; Death Valley Conservancy; the \nCities of Barstow, Desert Hot Springs, Hesperia, Indio, Palm Springs, \nSan Bernardino and Yucaipa; Riverside County Supervisor Marion Ashley; \nSan Bernardino County Supervisor Neil Derry; Imperial County Supervisor \nWally Leimgruber; Coachella Valley Association of Governments; \nSummerTree Institute; and Route 66 Preservation Foundation.\n  The California Desert Protection Act, which was enacted in 1994, was \na sweeping piece of legislation aimed at\n\n[[Page S13700]]\n\nconserving some of the most beautiful and ecologically significant \nlands in my home State.\n  The law created Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park \nand the Mojave National Preserve, as well as 69 desert wilderness areas \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM.\n  Collectively, it protected over 7 million acres of desert lands, \nmaking it the largest land conservation bill in the lower 48 States in \nU.S. history.\n  To this day, it remains one of my proudest accomplishments since \njoining this body.\n  Much has changed since the passage of the California Desert \nProtection Act. Many of the impediments that prevented conservation of \nother pristine desert lands in the area no longer exist.\n  Department of Defense concerns with designating some wilderness areas \nnear Fort Irwin have been resolved.\n  Many mining areas inside national parks and potential wilderness have \nclosed.\n  Grazing allotments on both BLM and National Park Service land have \nbeen retired by willing sellers.\n  Hundreds of thousands of acres of privately owned land has been \ndonated to or acquired by the Federal Government.\n  Yet even as these issues were resolved, new challenges have emerged. \nThere are now competing demands over how best to manage hundreds of \nthousands of acres of public lands in the desert.\n  Some believe the lands should be used for large-scale solar and wind \nfacilities and transmission lines. Others would like to conserve \ncritical habitat for threatened and endangered species.\n  Some would like more acreage available for grazing or for off-road \nrecreation.\n  Finally, some would like to see additional lands made available for \nmilitary training and base expansion.\n  Earlier this year, I learned that BLM had accepted applications to \nbuild vast solar and wind energy projects on former railroad lands \npreviously owned by the Catellus Corporation. These lands had been \ndonated to the Federal Government or acquired with taxpayer funds for \nconservation.\n  I believe the development of these new cleaner energy sources is \nvital to addressing climate change, yet we must be careful about \nselecting where these facilities are located. The current process \ndoesn't work because it allows energy firms to propose the sites for \nrenewable energy development, including land donated or acquired \nspecifically for conservation.\n  Approximately $45 million of private donations--including a $5 \nmillion land discount from Catellus Corporation--and $18 million in \nFederal Land and Water Conservation grants was spent to purchase these \nlands, with the intent of conserving them in perpetuity.\n  As the sponsor of the legislative provisions that helped secure the \ndeal to acquire the roughly 600,000 acres of former private land, I \nfound the BLM's actions unacceptable.\n  We have an obligation to honor our commitment to conserve these \nlands--and I believe we can still accomplish that goal while also \nfulfilling California's commitment to develop a clean energy portfolio.\n  That is the purpose of this legislation.\n  The first title of the legislation is geared towards the goal of \nconserving the Desert's sensitive ecosystem.\n  First, this bill will ensure that hundreds of thousands of acres of \nland donated to the federal government for conservation will be \nprotected by creating the Mojave Trails National Monument. This new \nmonument would cover approximately 941,000 acres of Federal land, which \nincludes approximately 266,000 acres of the former Catellus-owned \nrailroad lands along historic Route 66. I visited the area earlier this \nyear and was amazed by the beauty of the massive valleys, pristine dry \nlakes, and rugged mountains.\n  In addition to its iconic sweeping desert vistas and majestic \nmountain ranges, this area of the Eastern Mojave also contains critical \nwildlife corridors linking Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave \nNational Preserve. It also encompasses hundreds of thousands of acres \ndesignated as areas of critical environmental concern, critical habitat \nfor the threatened desert tortoise, and ancient lava bed flows and \ncraters. It is surrounded by more than a dozen BLM wilderness areas.\n  The BLM would be given the authority to both conserve the monument \nlands, and also to maintain existing recreational uses, including \nhunting, vehicular travel on open roads and trails, camping, horseback \nriding and rockhounding.\n  The bill also creates an advisory committee to help develop and \noversee the implementation of the monument management plan. It would be \ncomprised of representatives from local, State and Federal Government, \nconservation and recreation groups, and local Native American tribes.\n  Before I go on to the other conservation provisions in the bill, I \nwould like to address one important issue--and that is what should be \ndone about some of the proposed renewable energy development projects \nproposed for lands included in this monument.\n  Although it is true that the monument will prevent further \nconsideration of some applications to develop solar and wind energy \nprojects on former Catellus lands or adjoining lands in the monument, \nit is important to note that of the proposals in question, not a single \none has been granted a permit nor is a single one under review at the \nCalifornia Energy Commission or under formal NEPA, National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, review at BLM.\n  To ensure that creation of the monument does not unnecessarily harm \nthe firms that worked in good faith and invested substantial time and \nresources to produce renewable energy in California, the legislation \nwill offer these companies an opportunity to relocate their projects to \nfederal renewable energy zones currently being developed by the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  Additionally, the monument would not prevent the construction or \nexpansion of necessary transmission lines critical to linking renewable \nenergy generation facilities with the electricity grid.\n  Second, the bill would establish the ``Sand to Snow National \nMonument,'' encompassing 134,000 acres of land from the desert floor in \nthe Coachella Valley up to the top of Mount San Gorgonio, the highest \npeak in Southern California.\n  The boundaries of this second, smaller new monument would include two \nAreas of Critical Environmental Concern: Big Morongo Canyon and \nWhitewater Canyon, the BLM and U.S. Forest Service San Gorgonio \nWilderness, the Wildlands Conservancy's Pipe's Canyon and Mission Creek \nPreserves, and additional public and private conservation lands, \nincluding two wildlife movement corridor areas connecting the \nPeninsular Ranges with the Transverse Ranges.\n  This area is truly remarkable, and would arguably be the most \nenvironmentally diverse national monument in the country. It serves as \nthe intersection of three converging ecological systems--the Mojave \nDesert, the Colorado Desert, and the San Bernardino mountains--and is \none of the most important wildlife corridors in Southern California.\n  This monument designation would protect 23.6 miles of the Pacific \nCrest Trail and the habitat for approximately 240 species of migrating \nand breeding birds, the second highest density of nesting birds in the \nU.S. It also serves as a home and a crucial migration corridor for \nanimals traveling between Joshua Tree National Park, the oasis at Big \nMorongo, and the higher elevations of the San Bernardino Mountains.\n  I would like to make one additional point, and that is that despite \nits ecological significance, this area is not particularly well-known--\nlargely because it is managed by a number of distinct entities, \nincluding the BLM, Forest Service, National Park Service and private \npreserves and conservation agencies. So, the monument designation would \nhelp to attract more attention to one of California's natural gems.\n  Third, the bill establishes new wilderness and allows more \nappropriate use of lands currently designated as Wilderness Study \nAreas.\n  The 1994 California Desert Protection Act extended wilderness \nprotection to many areas in the desert, yet several areas near Fort \nIrwin were designated as wilderness study areas in order to allow the \nbase to expand.\n\n[[Page S13701]]\n\n  Now that Fort Irwin's expansion is complete, it is time to consider \nthese areas for permanent wilderness designation.\n  The bill protects approximately 250,000 acres of BLM land as \nwilderness in five areas. These areas contain some of the most pristine \nand rugged landscapes in the California desert.\n  Beyond Fort Irwin, the bill also expands wilderness areas in Death \nValley National Park, 90,000 acres, and the San Bernardino National \nForest, 4,300 acres, inside the Sand to Snow National Monument created \nby this bill.\n  The bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing \nwilderness study area designation in response to requests from local \ngovernment and recreation users. This will allow the land to be made \navailable for other purposes, including recreational off-highway \nvehicle use on designated routes.\n  Fourth, this bill would create the Vinagre Wash Special Management \nArea.\n  The agreed-upon designation for this area in Imperial County, near \nthe Colorado River, was reached after careful discussion with key \nstakeholders.\n  Although the land possesses some wilderness characteristics, there \nare also competing interests. The Navy Seals currently use some of this \narea for occasional training. Additionally, many local residents enjoy \ntouring the rolling hills in the area by jeep.\n  Through the combined efforts of conservation groups, local residents \nand county government, and the Department of Defense, a compromise \nconservation designation was developed.\n  For the land known as the Vinagre Wash, the bill will create a \n``special management area'' covering 76,000 acres, including 12,000 \nacres of former railroad lands donated to the Federal Government.\n  Of these, 49,000 acres are designated as potential wilderness and \nonly become permanent wilderness if and when the Department of Defense \ndetermines these lands are no longer needed for Navy Seal training.\n  This designation will permit the area to continue to be accessed by \nvehicles and be used for camping, hiking, mountain biking, sightseeing, \nand off-highway vehicle use on designated routes and protect tribal \ncultural assets in the area.\n  Fifth, the bill adds to or designates four new Wild and Scenic \nRivers, totaling 76 miles in length. This designation will ensure they \nremain clean and free-flowing and that their immediate environments are \npreserved. These beautiful waterways are Deep Creek and the Whitewater \nRiver in and near the San Bernardino National Forest, as well as the \nAmargosa River and Surprise Canyon Creek near Death Valley National \nPark.\n  Sixth, the bill includes adds approximately 74,000 acres of adjacent \nlands to the three National Parks established by the 1994 California \nDesert Protection Act.\n  The bill adds 41,000 acres in Death Valley National Park. This \nincludes former mining areas where the claims have been retired and a \nnarrow strip of BLM land between National Park and Defense Department \nboundaries that has made BLM management difficult.\n  The bill adds 30,000 acres in the Mojave National Preserve. This land \nwas not included in the original Monument because of the former Viceroy \ngold mine. However, the mining operations ceased several years ago, and \nthe reclamation process is nearly complete. Additionally, a 2007 \nanalysis by the Interior Department recommended that this area would be \nsuitable to add to the Preserve.\n  The bill adds 2,900 acres in Joshua Tree National Park. This includes \nmultiple small parcels of BLM land identified for disposal on its \nperiphery. Transferring this land to the Park Service would help \nprotect Joshua Tree by preserving these undeveloped areas that border \nresidential communities.\n  Seventh, the bill designates new lands as Off-Highway Vehicle \nRecreation Areas.\n  One of the key goals I have strived for in this bill is to find \nbalance to ensure that the many different needs and uses in the desert \nare accommodated with the least possible conflict. Some of the most \nfrequent visitors to the desert are the off-highway recreation \nenthusiasts.\n  In California alone, there are over 1 million registered off-highway \nvehicles, many of which can be found exploring thousands of miles of \ndesert trails or BLM designated open areas.\n  However, in order to meet military training needs, the Marine Corps \nis studying the potential expansion of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat \nCenter at Twentynine Palms into Johnson Valley, the largest OHV area in \nthe country. I strongly support providing our troops with the best \npossible training, but if the Marines need to expand the base into \nJohnson Valley, this could have potentially resulted in the loss of \ntens of thousands of acres of OHV recreation lands.\n  But over the past year I met with Major General Eugene Payne, \nAssistant Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics, and \nBrigadier General Melvin Spiese, Commanding General, Training and \nEducation Command, to discuss this issue, and I am very grateful for \ntheir efforts to consider base expansion options that would preserve \nmuch of Johnson Valley for recreation.\n  As the result of those meetings, the Marine Corps has committed to \nstudying an alternative that would allow for a portion of Johnson \nValley to be used exclusively for military training, a portion \nexclusively for continued OHV recreation and a third area for joint \nuse. While the environmental review process must first be completed, I \nam hopeful that this option will prevail for the benefit of the Marines \nand recreational users of Johnson Valley.\n  The lesson learned from Johnson Valley is that, despite the vast size \nof the California desert, there are relatively few areas dedicated to \nOHV recreation, and even those areas face increasing competition from \nother types of uses. These areas are important not only to the hundreds \nof thousands visitors who enjoy them, but also to the local economy \nthat depends on their tourist dollars. Additionally, by protecting \nthese areas, we also protect conservation areas by providing \nappropriate places for OHV recreation.\n  So, this bill will designate five existing OHV areas in the Mojave \ndesert as permanent OHV areas, providing off- highway groups some \ncertainty that these uses will be protected as much as conservation \nareas. Collectively, these areas could be as much as 314,000 acres, \ndepending on what, if any, of Johnson Valley is ultimately needed by \nthe Marines.\n  This section of the bill also requires the Secretary of the Interior \nto conduct a study to determine what, if any, lands adjacent to these \nrecreation areas would be suitable for addition. This will help make up \nfor some of the lost acres in Johnson Valley should the Marines decide \nto expand there.\n  Finally, this title of the bill includes other key provisions that \naddress various challenges and opportunities in the California desert, \nincluding: state land exchanges.\n  There are currently about 370,000 acres of state lands spread across \nthe California desert in isolated 640 acre parcels. Because many of \nthese acres are inside national parks, wilderness, the proposed \nmonuments or conservation areas, they are largely unusable. The bill \nseeks to remedy that problem by requiring the Department of the \nInterior to develop and implement a plan with the state to complete the \nexchange of these lands for other BLM or GSA owned property in the next \nten years. These land exchanges will help consolidate the state lands \ninto larger, more usable areas that could potentially provide the state \nwith viable sites for renewable energy development, off- highway \nvehicle recreation or other commercial purposes.\n  The bill ensures the right of the Department of Defense to conduct \nlow-level overflights over wilderness, national parks and national \nmonuments.\n  The bill requires the Department of the Interior to study the impact \nof climate change on California desert species migration, incorporate \nthe study's results and recommendations into land use management plans, \nand consider the study's findings when making decisions granting rights \nof way for projects on public lands.\n  The bill requires the Secretary to ensure access for tribal cultural \nactivities within national parks, monuments, wilderness and other areas \ndesignated within the bill. It also requires the Secretary to develop a \ncultural resources management plan to protect a sacred tribal trail \nalong the Colorado\n\n[[Page S13702]]\n\nRiver between southern Nevada and the California-Baja border.\n  In order to ensure that donated and acquired Catellus lands outside \nthe Mojave Trails National Monument are maintained for conservation, \nthe bill prohibits their use for development, mining, off-highway \nvehicle use, except designated routes, grazing, military training and \nother surface disturbing activities. The Secretary of the Interior is \nauthorized to make limited exceptions in cases where it is deemed in \nthe public interest, but comparable lands would have to be purchased \nand donated to the Federal Government as mitigation for lost acreage.\n  So, all of these provisions, when taken together, would serve to \ncomplement the lasting conservation established by the California \nDesert Protection Act--while ensuring that other important local uses \nare maintained in appropriate areas.\n  The Mojave Desert is a spectacular national treasure worthy of \nprotection, but it is also a unique national solar resource.\n  The Mojave has more than 350 sunny days per year; has large flat \nvalleys and mesas; is close to major transmission lines and millions of \nelectricity consumers in Southern California; and lies above 4,000 feet \nin elevation, where the sun is strongest.\n  There is no question that we need to harness the desert's plentiful \nsolar energy--but in order to do that, we need to cut through a \nbureaucratic backlog of stalled permits, and ensure that development \noccurs on the most appropriate lands.\n  That is exactly what the second title of this legislation is intended \nto do.\n  For too many years the promise of utilizing desert lands to produce \nclean, renewable solar power was out of reach. The up-front technology \ncosts were too expensive, while coal was deemed to be cheap and \nplentiful.\n  But the economics of solar power began to shift in the right \ndirection in 2005, when Congress established a 30 percent investment \ntax credit for solar power facilities, a provision I championed. I was \nproud to work with Senator Snowe and other members of the Senate \nFinance Committee to extend this tax credit through 2016 during the \nlast Congress.\n  On December 17, I introduced new legislation with Senator Merkley to \nmake sure solar companies can fully realize the benefits of these tax \nincentives.\n  The other chief roadblock to developing solar in the desert has been \nthe broken permitting process.\n  The Federal Government has failed to focus wind and solar development \non appropriate lands where it can be readily permitted.\n  There are currently more than 110 applications to develop more than \n42,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity on BLM land in the \nCalifornia desert.\n  Until very recently, nothing was done to evaluate these development \nproposals.\n  All but a few proposals have not even begun the formal environmental \nreview process required by the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA. \nThe BLM has been slow to direct development towards disturbed lands or \nto discourage proposals on lands acquired for the purpose of \nconservation.\n  Wind developers have had to wait more than three years to receive \npermission to measure the wind above public lands.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has told renewable energy developers \nseeking to use disturbed private lands that they would need to develop \ncomplex habitat conservation plans for their projects, a process \nexpected to take nine years.\n  Contrast that with the recent announcement from Interior Secretary \nKen Salazar, who has pledged that the BLM will complete permitting of \n10 ``fast track'' solar projects on public lands by December 2010.\n  So, the good news is that this administration has taken steps in the \nright direction to encourage this important shift to renewable energy.\n  But it is critical, nonetheless, that this legislation is enacted in \norder to codify and build upon these improvements to the permitting \nprocess and help establish the transmission lines needed to carry \ncleaner energy from the desert to consumers.\n  Key provisions of the bill: first, the bill will require BLM to put \npersonnel in place focused exclusively on renewable energy development \nin the desert, make the staff accountable to Congress, and provide a \nreliable stream of funding to expedite the review of applications.\n  The BLM began establishing renewable energy permitting offices \nearlier this year, but this legislation would codify this new \nadministrative policy, establish that the offices have a clear \nCongressional mandate, and ensure that they will focus specifically on \nrenewable energy development in each state with significant wind and \nsolar resources on public land.\n  These offices would be funded from the existing BLM permit \nimprovement fund--a fund which is currently only available to supervise \nthe permitting for oil and natural gas development.\n  It makes sense that this fund should go towards providing cleaner \nenergy sources as well.\n  Second, the bill would help cut through the backlog of pending \nrenewable development applications with a ``use it or lose it'' \napproach.\n  This would replace the ``first come-first serve'' approach the BLM \ncurrently employs.\n  The legislation would establish strict deadlines for developers to \nconduct necessary biological and cultural studies, ensure connection to \nthe grid, and develop a plan for water. This would ensure that serious \ndevelopment proposals are moved to the front of the line--and help put \nan end to unfettered speculation on desert lands.\n  Third, this legislation will expedite the application process for \nsolar development on private lands.\n  When I toured the desert last spring, I asked developers why they \nwanted to develop pristine public lands, instead of using private \nlands.\n  The answer shocked me: they told me it was easier to permit a project \non pristine public land than on private lands.\n  We need to ensure that it takes no longer to review an application to \ndevelop private lands than it does to develop public lands--without \ninfringing upon important environmental regulations.\n  So, the bill would establish a pilot mitigation bank program--a new \nidea based on successful desert protection efforts in Nevada, wolf \nprotection efforts in New Mexico, and Coral Reef protection efforts in \nthe Caribbean.\n  The mitigation bank program would be a win-win, both accelerating \npermitting and coordinating endangered species protection efforts.\n  Developers seeking to utilize private lands would be able to \ncontribute to a mitigation fund, instead of negotiating the terms of \nendangered species mitigation, which the Fish and Wildlife Service \nrecently predicted would take nine years.\n  The interest from the funds contributed by developers would be used \nto better manage endangered species habitat in specific mitigation \nzones of federal land that would be permanently set aside for species \nprotection.\n  The principal in this fund would be used to purchase new pristine \nhabitat when it became available.\n  This Mitigation bank program would be run by BLM, and the Fish and \nWildlife Service would consult with the BLM on renewable energy project \nreview, just as they do now for renewable energy proposals on public \nland.\n  This would help level the playing field between public and private \nlands, and it could cut down the time it takes to permit projects for \nprivate lands considerably.\n  Fourth, the legislation would require the BLM, the Forest Service, \nand the military to complete Environmental Impact Statements to develop \nrenewable energy on the lands they oversee.\n  This has two benefits.\n  First, it ensures that Federal land managers will proactively plan \nthe use of public lands--instead of allowing private industry to make \nthese de facto decisions.\n  Federal land managers will be required to identify renewable energy \ndevelopment areas where development is in the public interest through \nthe programmatic EIS process. This will help avoid the sort of site-\nspecific environmental conflicts that can delay projects for years.\n  The second benefit of this provision is that it will result in a \nformal evaluation of whether public land currently managed by the \nmilitary will also be\n\n[[Page S13703]]\n\nconsidered for solar development, instead of concentrating this \ndevelopment only on BLM land. There are currently approximately 3 \nmillion acres of California desert that are managed by the military, \nand much of this land could be developed for renewable energy \nconsistent with the military mission.\n  By requiring the military to evaluate the impacts of a program to \ndevelop its solar resource, the legislation ensures that all available \npublic lands are properly considered for renewable energy development \nin California.\n  Fifth, this legislation expedites the permitting of temporary \nmeteorological measurement devices.\n  In California, it sometimes takes a wind developer three years to get \na permit simply to measure wind speed. Such barriers to research are \nunnecessary and unwise, and this legislation assures that this type of \nresearch qualifies for existing categorical exclusions from complex \nenvironmental reviews.\n  Sixth, the legislation would provide grants and loan guarantees to \ninnovative electricity transmission technologies that will reduce the \nneed to build massive, visually and environmentally disruptive \ntransmission lines in the desert.\n  Finally, the legislation would return 25 percent of the revenue \ngenerated by new renewable energy projects to the State, and 25 percent \nto local county governments. This would ensure that these entities have \nthe resources to support permitting, public lands protection, and local \nconservation efforts.\n  Bottom line: The permitting process is broken. It is not facilitating \nsolar and wind development where it belongs. This legislation intends \nto fix that.\n  It may surprise my colleagues that I am introducing such \ncomprehensive legislation to ensure the protection of California's \ndesert heritage, the development of our renewable resources, and the \ncontinued enjoyment of desert recreation.\n  After all, I am not from the desert. I have lived in or near San \nFrancisco for most of my life.\n  But over the years I have come to truly appreciate California's \nsweeping desert landscapes.\n  I remember my first visits to the desert years ago. It was treated \nlike a waste dump. It was full of abandoned cars. Old appliances \nlittered the landscape.\n  But we have worked very hard to clean it up.\n  We have worked to make sure that the vast vistas and pristine desert \nhabitat are respected by humanity, and that we give to our children a \nhealthier, more beautiful desert than we inherited.\n  But if we are to remain successful in the long run, we must not only \nprotect the desert land itself, we must also protect the broader \nenvironment from the ravages of climate change, and we must offer \neconomic opportunity to those who live in these areas.\n  That is the purpose of this legislation. There are many places in the \nCalifornia desert where development and employment are essential and \nappropriate.\n  But there are also places that future generations will thank us for \nsetting aside.\n  I have worked painstakingly with stakeholders to ensure that this \nlegislation balances sometimes competing needs.\n  This bill, if enacted, will have a positive and enduring impact on \nthe landscape of the Southern California desert, and I hope it will \nstand as a model for how to balance renewable energy development and \nconservation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13703-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 382--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF OBSERVING THE \n   NATIONAL SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH FROM JANUARY 1 \n  THROUGH FEBRUARY 1, 2010, TO RAISE AWARENESS OF, AND OPPOSITION TO \n                             MODERN SLAVERY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. \nBrownback) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 382\n\n       Whereas the United States has a tradition of advancing \n     fundamental human rights, having abolished the Transatlantic \n     Slave Trade in 1808 and having abolished chattel slavery and \n     prohibited involuntary servitude in 1865;\n       Whereas because the people of the United States remain \n     committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a \n     national imperative to eliminate human trafficking, which is \n     the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or \n     obtaining of persons for labor or services through the use of \n     force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to \n     involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery, and \n     the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, fraud, or \n     coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act \n     has not attained 18 years of age;\n       Whereas to combat human trafficking in the United States \n     and globally, the people of the United States, the Federal \n     Government, and State and local governments must be aware of \n     the realities of human trafficking and must be dedicated to \n     stopping this contemporary manifestation of slavery;\n       Whereas beyond all differences of race, creed, or political \n     persuasion, the people of the United States face national \n     threats together and refuse to let modern slavery exist in \n     the United States and around the world;\n       Whereas the United States should actively oppose all \n     individuals, groups, organizations, and nations who support, \n     advance, or commit acts of human trafficking;\n       Whereas the United States must also work to end slavery in \n     all of its forms around the world through education;\n       Whereas victims of modern slavery need support in order to \n     escape and to recover from the physical, mental, emotional, \n     and spiritual trauma associated with their victimization;\n       Whereas human traffickers use many physical and \n     psychological techniques to control their victims, including \n     the use of violence or threats of violence against the victim \n     or the victim's family, isolation from the public, isolation \n     from the victim's family and religious or ethnic communities, \n     language and cultural barriers, shame, control of the \n     victim's possessions, confiscation of passports and other \n     identification documents, and threats of arrest, deportation, \n     or imprisonment if the victim attempts to reach out for \n     assistance or to leave;\n       Whereas although laws to prosecute perpetrators of modern \n     slavery and to assist and protect victims of human \n     trafficking, such as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act \n     of 2000 (division A of Public Law 106-386; 114 Stat. 1466) \n     and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-457; 122 Stat. \n     5044), have been enacted in the United States, awareness of \n     the issues surrounding slavery and trafficking by those \n     people most likely to come into contact with victims is \n     essential for effective enforcement because the techniques \n     that traffickers use to keep their victims enslaved severely \n     limit self-reporting;\n       Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of the effective date \n     of the Emancipation Proclamation;\n       Whereas February 1 is the anniversary of the date that \n     President Abraham Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending \n     the 13th Amendment to the States for ratification, to forever \n     declare that ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude . . \n     . shall exist within the United States, or any place subject \n     to their jurisdiction'' and is a date which has long been \n     celebrated as National Freedom Day, as described in section \n     124 of title 36, United States Code;\n       Whereas, under its authority to enforce the 13th Amendment \n     ``by appropriate legislation,'' Congress in the Trafficking \n     Victims Protection Act of 2000 updated the post-Civil War \n     involuntary servitude and slavery statutes and adopted an \n     approach known as the ``3P'' approach of victim protection, \n     vigorous prosecution, and prevention of human trafficking; \n     and\n       Whereas the effort by individuals, businesses, \n     organizations, and governing bodies to commemorate January 11 \n     as Human Trafficking Awareness Day represents one of the many \n     positive examples of the commitment in the United States to \n     raise awareness of and to actively oppose modern slavery: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports--\n       (1) the goals and ideals of observing the National Slavery \n     and Trafficking Prevention Month from January 1 through \n     February 1, 2010, to recognize the vital role that the people \n     of the United States have in ending modern slavery;\n       (2) marking this observance with appropriate programs and \n     activities culminating in the observance on February 1 of \n     National Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of title \n     36, United States Code;

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 382 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 382) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of observing National Slavery and Trafficking Prevention \n     Month from January 1 through February 1, 2010, to raise \n     awareness of, and opposition to, modern slavery.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will take an \nimportant step to raise awareness of human trafficking, a form of \nmodern-day slavery. The resolution, introduced by myself and Senators \nCornyn, Cardin, and Brownback, observes National Slavery and \nTrafficking Prevention Month from January 1 through February 1 to raise \nawareness of, and opposition to, modern slavery and human trafficking. \nThis bipartisan resolution was passed unanimously today by the Senate.\n  Human trafficking is a crime in which persons are forced to work \nagainst their will in sweatshops, prostitution rings, farm labor, \nprivate homes, and other enterprises. The traffickers use force, \nthreats of force, and coercion to ensure that their victims believe \nthey have no other choice but to work for their captors.\n  The resolution resolves that Congress supports (1) the goals and \nideals of observing the National Slavery and Trafficking Prevention \nMonth from January 1 through February 1 to recognize the vital role \nthat the people of the United States have in ending modern slavery; (2) \nmarking this observance with appropriate programs and activities \nculminating in the observance on February 1 of National Freedom Day; \nand (3) all other efforts to raise awareness of and opposition to human \ntrafficking.\n  This resolution recognizes the month of January as significant for \nmodern slavery and human trafficking. January 1 is the anniversary of \nthe effective date of the Emancipation Proclamation and February 1 is \nthe anniversary of the date that President Abraham Lincoln signed the \njoint resolution sending the 13th amendment to the States for \nratification.\n  In addition, it recognizes that January 11 is a day that many have \nchosen to commemorate human trafficking. In the 110th Congress, I \nsponsored a concurrent resolution that passed the Senate supporting \nJanuary 11 as a National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness.\n  In 2007, California passed a resolution, signed into law by Governor \nSchwarzenegger, designating January 11 as National Day of Human \nTrafficking Awareness. The Los Angeles City Council and the Los Angeles \nCounty Board of Supervisors did the same for the county of Los Angeles.\n  The issue of human trafficking has become particularly problematic in \nCalifornia. San Diego is an international trafficking gateway city used \nto traffic foreign children into the U.S. The United Nations has listed \nMexico as the No. 1 exporter of exploited children into North America.\n  From 1998 to 2003, more than 500 people from 18 countries were \nensnared in 57 forced labor operations throughout California. These \nstatistics only represent the cases that were discovered. Frequently, \nhuman trafficking goes undetected because the victims are not only \nafraid of their traffickers, but they have been taught by their \ntraffickers to fear U.S. law enforcement.\n  Congress has acted to broaden the tools available to prosecute \nperpetrators of modern slavery and to assist and protect victims of \nhuman trafficking. It has enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct of 2000 and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008.\n  California has taken a leadership role in identifying and prosecuting \nhuman trafficking cases. For example, San Diego received one of the \nfirst grants to train local law enforcement on identifying and \nprosecuting human trafficking. The U.S. attorneys offices in Oakland, \nLos Angeles, and San Diego have all created antitrafficking task \nforces.\n  Using these tools, this August five people in California were \nsentenced to Federal prison, all receiving multidecade sentences for \ntheir roles in an international sex trafficking ring that lured young \nGuatemalan women and girls into the Los Angeles area and forced them \ninto prostitution.\n  In this distressing case, the defendants intimidated and controlled \ntheir victims by threatening to beat them and kill their loved ones in \nGuatemala if they tried to escape. At least three of the defendants \nrestrained the victims by locking them in at night and blocking windows \nand doors to prevent their escape.\n  In another recent case in Walnut Creek, CA, a woman was found guilty \nof trafficking a nanny from Peru. For nearly 2 years, the victim was \nforced to cook, clean, and take care of the family's children through \nfalse promises of pay. The victim was eventually able to escape, with \nthe assistance of local residents and officials and parents at a local \nelementary school.\n  Human trafficking is a pervasive global crime, with nearly 1 million \npeople trafficked across international borders every year. According to \nthe State Department, roughly 80 percent of the victims are women and \nchildren.\n  I believe that it is vital that we work together as a nation to \neliminate human trafficking and prevent the victimization of the most \nvulnerable members of society.\n\n[[Page S13705]]\n\n  Awareness of the issues surrounding slavery and trafficking by those \npeople most likely to come into contact with vulnerable populations is \nessential for effective prevention and prosecution of this frequently \nhidden crime.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this resolution to help \nraise awareness of modern day slavery.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 382\n\n       Whereas the United States has a tradition of advancing \n     fundamental human rights, having abolished the Transatlantic \n     Slave Trade in 1808 and having abolished chattel slavery and \n     prohibited involuntary servitude in 1865;\n       Whereas because the people of the United States remain \n     committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a \n     national imperative to eliminate human trafficking, which is \n     the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or \n     obtaining of persons for labor or services through the use of \n     force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to \n     involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery, and \n     the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, fraud, or \n     coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act \n     has not attained 18 years of age;\n       Whereas to combat human trafficking in the United States \n     and globally, the people of the United States, the Federal \n     Government, and State and local governments must be aware of \n     the realities of human trafficking and must be dedicated to \n     stopping this contemporary manifestation of slavery;\n       Whereas beyond all differences of race, creed, or political \n     persuasion, the people of the United States face national \n     threats together and refuse to let modern slavery exist in \n     the United States and around the world;\n       Whereas the United States should actively oppose all \n     individuals, groups, organizations, and nations who support, \n     advance, or commit acts of human trafficking;\n       Whereas the United States must also work to end slavery in \n     all of its forms around the world through education;\n       Whereas victims of modern slavery need support in order to \n     escape and to recover from the physical, mental, emotional, \n     and spiritual trauma associated with their victimization;\n       Whereas human traffickers use many physical and \n     psychological techniques to control their victims, including \n     the use of violence or threats of violence against the victim \n     or the victim's family, isolation from the public, isolation \n     from the victim's family and religious or ethnic communities, \n     language and cultural barriers, shame, control of the \n     victim's possessions, confiscation of passports and other \n     identification documents, and threats of arrest, deportation, \n     or imprisonment if the victim attempts to reach out for \n     assistance or to leave;\n       Whereas although laws to prosecute perpetrators of modern \n     slavery and to assist and protect victims of human \n     trafficking, such as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act \n     of 2000 (division A of Public Law 106-386; 114 Stat. 1466) \n     and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-457; 122 Stat. \n     5044), have been enacted in the United States, awareness of \n     the issues surrounding slavery and trafficking by those \n     people most likely to come into contact with victims is \n     essential for effective enforcement because the techniques \n     that traffickers use to keep their victims enslaved severely \n     limit self-reporting;\n       Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of the effective date \n     of the Emancipation Proclamation;\n       Whereas February 1 is the anniversary of the date that \n     President Abraham Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending \n     the 13th Amendment to the States for ratification, to forever \n     declare that ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude . . \n     . shall exist within the United States, or any place subject \n     to their jurisdiction'' and is a date which has long been \n     celebrated as National Freedom Day, as described in section \n     124 of title 36, United States Code;\n       Whereas, under its authority to enforce the 13th Amendment \n     ``by appropriate legislation,'' Congress in the Trafficking \n     Victims Protection Act of 2000 updated the post-Civil War \n     involuntary servitude and slavery statutes and adopted an \n     approach known as the ``3P'' approach of victim protection, \n     vigorous prosecution, and prevention of human trafficking;

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join many of my \ncolleagues in supporting a resolution designating January 2010 as \n``National Mentoring Month.''\n  We all agree that young people need a supportive environment based on \nstructured and trusting relationships with adults. The world is more \ncomplicated for children today than it ever was when I was growing up. \nMentors can help young people through the difficult periods, help them \nsee the difference between right and wrong, alleviate their doubts and \nconcerns, and answer their questions frankly. Mentors can dramatically \nimpact a young person's life by providing the support and encouragement \nthat children need in order to grow into responsible, caring adults.\n  This resolution recognizes the value of volunteering time to make a \ndifference in the life of a child. A growing body of research has shown \nthat high-quality programs can make all the difference and help \nstudents in need achieve the type of future they might never have \nthought possible. Children with mentors are shown to improve in school \nperformance and attendance. Also, they are more self-confident, have \ngood social skills, and above all else, they are motivated to reach \ntheir full potential. Unfortunately, a severe shortage of volunteers \nhas left over 15 million young people without mentors.\n  National Mentoring Month highlights the needs and goals of mentoring \nin this country and honors the contributions of the many volunteers \nacross the country that are currently connecting with youth in such \nprograms. Next month, nonprofit organizations, schools, businesses, \nfaith communities, and government agencies--led by the National \nMentoring Partnership and the Harvard School of Public Health--will \njoin together to encourage adults to serve as mentors for our young \npeople. Programs must be expanded to recruit more volunteers to help \nfill the mentoring gap. Mentoring has successfully helped many children \nin this country and we must work together to expand such valuable \nprograms. I urge the Senate to approve this resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 383) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 383\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a \n     dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and \n     encouragement to facilitate a young person's social, \n     emotional, and cognitive development;\n       Whereas continued research on mentoring shows that formal, \n     high-quality mentoring focused on developing the competence \n     and character of the mentee promotes positive outcomes, such \n     as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, \n     and career development;\n\n[[Page S13706]]\n\n       Whereas further research on mentoring provides strong \n     evidence that mentoring successfully reduces substance use \n     and abuse, academic failure, and delinquency;\n       Whereas mentoring, in addition to preparing young people \n     for school, work, and life, is extremely rewarding for those \n     serving as mentors;\n       Whereas more than 4,700 mentoring programs in communities \n     of all sizes across the United States focus on building \n     strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United \n     States are in solid mentoring relationships due to the \n     remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the \n     thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas in spite of the progress made to increase \n     mentoring, the United States has a serious ``mentoring gap'', \n     with nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;\n       Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors bring State and local leaders together to \n     support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of \n     efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and \n     making the most of limited resources to benefit young people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2010 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'' will help call attention to the critical \n     role mentors play in helping young people realize their \n     potential;\n       Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more individuals and organizations, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith \n     institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring \n     across the United States; and\n       Whereas National Mentoring Month will, most significantly, \n     build awareness of mentoring and encourage more people to \n     become mentors and help close the mentoring gap in the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2010 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults and students who are already \n     volunteering as mentors and encourages more adults and \n     students to volunteer as mentors; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     National Mentoring Month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities that promote awareness of, and volunteer \n     involvement with, youth mentoring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13706-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I wanted to take some time to talk \nabout the health care bill before the Senate which the majority leader \nis anxious to get passed before Christmas. I suspect that he knows if \nthis bill sees too much light of day, he could lose 1 or 2 of his 60 \nvotes, and that is why his managers' amendment was kept under wraps so \nthat no one knew anything about it until the last minute.\n  On our side of the aisle, we would like to hold off until after \nChristmas to give all Members of the Senate and the American people a \nchance to review this legislation. Obviously, this is not going to \nhappen. I think that is unfortunate.\n  When you compare the number of days we spent debating this bill to \nother major pieces of legislation that have come before this body in \nrecent years, the Democrats' haste is obvious.\n  For example, in 2002, I was very much involved in the legislation \nthat created the Department of Homeland Security. We spent 19 days over \n7 weeks on the floor debating that bill. We took 20 votes on amendments \nduring the debate. The final result was bipartisan. Ninety Members of \nthe Senate voted for it.\n  Tragically, for the American people, unlike other important health \ncare-related bills such as the Medicare Modernization Act that garnered \nwide bipartisan support, this bill is nowhere near bipartisan and did \nnot receive a single Republican vote for cloture at 1 this morning, and \nonly one Republican in the House of Representatives supported it.\n  In my humble opinion, the way this bill was negotiated behind closed \ndoors, and without the input of Members from both sides, will sour \nrelations and bipartisan discussion on other major issues to come \nbefore the Senate, such as debt and deficit reduction--notably \nbipartisan legislation that I have been working on very closely with \nSenators Gregg and Conrad, a comprehensive energy bill, reauthorization \nof the surface transportation bill, climate change legislation, and--\nvery important--a jobs bill.\n  The problems facing our country are too serious for business as \nusual, each side one-upping the other for political advantage, with the \n2010 elections casting shadows on what we should be doing for the \nbenefit of our country, at a time when this Nation is as fragile as I \nhave seen it in my entire life.\n  Our future and the future of our children and grandchildren is in our \nhands. Our constituents and the world are watching. Our credibility and \ncredit are on the line, and so is our economic and national security, \nand, quite frankly, our leadership position in the world. We need fewer \npartisans in this body and more statesmen.\n  Last week I came to the floor to remind my colleagues and the \nAmerican people about the fiscal realities that face our Nation and \nexplained how this health reform legislation, which is now likely to \npass based on this morning's cloture vote, would make an unsustainable \nfiscal situation even worse.\n  Let me remind you as we stand right now that our Nation's debt has \nexceeded $12 trillion for the first time in our history. In fact, from \n2008 to 2009 alone, the Federal debt increased 19 percent, boosting \nnational debt as a percentage of GDP from 70 percent last year to 84 \npercent this year. We have not seen this kind of debt-to-GDP ratio \nsince the end of the Second World War.\n  We have amassed a staggering $70 trillion in unfunded obligations \nover the next 75 years or an estimated $600,000 per American household.\n  Our Medicare Program is already on shaky footing with $37 trillion in \nunfunded future Medicare costs, and the Medicare trust fund is expected \nto be insolvent by 2017. Frankly, this is why I am disappointed the \nSenate failed to support Senator Gregg's amendment we considered \nearlier in this debate to ensure that the savings achieved by\n\n[[Page S13707]]\n\nMedicare cuts would be used to ensure the viability of the program, and \nnot new entitlements.\n  I ask my colleagues, can our Nation take on new programs and costs \nwhen we cannot pay for what we are doing right now? Our Nation's fiscal \npicture is not pretty. Our obligations to our entitlement programs are \nexploding. If we keep going the way we are, our debt will double in 5 \nyears and triple in 10.\n  Our budgets are unbalanced as far as the eye can see. Last year we \nborrowed $1.4 trillion, and 50 percent of our debt is in the hands of \nforeign countries. The American people get it. They already know the \nFederal Government is the worst credit card abuser in the world, and we \nare putting everything on the tab of our children and grandchildren.\n  They are not the only ones. Internationally, our creditors are \nconcerned. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has noted:\n\n       We have lent a huge amount of money to the United States \n     and of course we're concerned about the security of our \n     assets and, to be honest, I am a little bit worried. That's \n     why here I would like to urge the US to keep its commitment \n     and promise to ensure the safety of Chinese assets.\n\n  That is what he said to the President--anybody who goes to China \ntoday. They are worried about the fact they have lent us a lot of money \nand maybe they might not get it back.\n  While the international community understands our crisis, somehow \nCongress does not get it. Here we are considering a bill that, when \nfully implemented, spends more than $2 trillion over 10 years to \nrestructure our health care system.\n  I respect my friends on the other side of the aisle, but the \nassumptions they make are optimistic about the cuts in this bill, \nespecially when one considers this body's propensity for acting in a \nfiscally irresponsible manner.\n  Frankly, our history on the so-called doc fix is illustrative. We \ncontinue to kick the cost of fixing Medicare payments for physicians \ndown the road, instead of dealing with its more than $200 billion cost.\n  The bill before us does not even have the 1-year fix that the \noriginal bill had included. My friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave decided to put it off and deal with it in a separate measure \nbecause it would make this bill even more expensive.\n  As congressional observers have noted, we continue to put off the \ndifficult choices. The fact is, Congress is not willing to take short-\nterm pain for long-term gain. This is my 11th year, and it is the same \nold story year after year.\n  This brings me back to the health care bill. I have heard all the \narguments of why health care reform is needed, and--do you know \nsomething--I agree with most of them. Frankly, there are a number of \nincremental things we could do today to make real improvements in our \nsystem in a bipartisan way. In fact, I encourage my colleagues to take \na look at some of the proposals contained in the alternatives offered \nby my colleagues, including Senators Wyden and Bennett.\n  These and other legislative proposals include things we can do on an \nincremental basis to improve our system, such as making it easier for \nsmall business to group together to reduce their health care costs; \npassing medical liability reform, where we have more tests being taken \nbecause doctors are afraid of being sued; increasing flexibility in the \nprivate market so people have more options and can choose insurance \nproducts that best meet their needs; implementing policies that \nencourage wellness and prevention; eliminating the fraud and abuse that \nhave and will continue to plague our public health care programs; \neliminating the ability of insurance companies to deny people insurance \ncoverage because of preexisting conditions; or eliminating the caps \nthat insurance companies put once an individual reaches a certain \namount.\n  Instead, we are going to pass a massive new spending bill that does \nlittle to fix our problems in the long run. What too many of my \ncolleagues do not understand is there are limits to what government can \ndo. There are limits on what government can do. When I was mayor of the \ncity of Cleveland, Governor of Ohio, people would come to me with ideas \nto expand programs and services. Often, even though I saw the merit of \nthese proposals, just like I see the merit of a lot of the suggestions \nwe need to have in terms of health care, I knew we did not have the \nmoney to pay for these proposals, especially because we had to balance \nour budgets. In those situations, I had to be honest and say no.\n  It is the same thing here. I am sure the Presiding Officer has people \ncoming into his office every day saying: I want you to help with this \nworthy cause. I sit, I listen patiently, and I say to them: If what you \nare asking me to do means we are going to have to borrow money, and it \nis going to be paid for by our children and grandchildren, what do you \nhave to say? Nine times out of 10, they say: No. Thank you very much, \nSenator. And they go out the door. They get it. They understand that.\n  Unfortunately, Congress does not get it. It is not just my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, folks. No one's hands are completely \nclean. That is the way it is. We just keep on going the way we are, \nkeep going down the road.\n\n  Here we are in the worst recession since the Great Depression. \nMillions of Americans are out of work. Others lucky enough to have a \njob are wondering if they will be next to be laid off or fired. In my \nState of Ohio, the unemployment rate is 10.6 percent. Yet we are \ntalking about health care reform, cap and trade, which will put \nunsustainable burdens on doing business in this country and make it \nmore difficult to get this economy going again.\n  What people in this country want is to go back to work and have some \nassurance that their jobs are safe. The best way to give them security \nand access to health insurance is to get them back to work.\n  We should not be asking our Nation's businesses to take on new tax \nburdens in the current recession. Yet this bill before us would impose \n$28 billion in new taxes on employers--$28 billion. Furthermore, the \nlegislation creates a new Medicare payroll tax that will likely hit \napproximately one-third of the small businesses in this country, which \nemploy some 30 million Americans. These new taxes are likely to \nsignificantly hinder these engines of job growth.\n  Another troubling tax that will impact businesses in my State is the \ntax on device manufacturers. I have heard from one of our Ohio \ncompanies that this tax could force it to move its operations overseas \nto keep its doors open. In fact--this is unbelievable--according to the \ncompany's own calculations, the new device tax will exceed 100 percent \nof its domestic earnings and research and development budget. It has \nnothing to do with their profitability. They say: You are this \nbusiness. You have a percentage of it, and we are going to lay the tax \nright on your back.\n  Ohio cannot afford to lose these jobs to another country at any time \nbut certainly not right now in this struggling economy. But this is \njust the beginning for businesses, large and small. The bill will add a \nwhole new, never seen before, layer of bureaucracy on our businesses. \nThink about that. Small and even large businesses are already \noverwhelmed with management and paperwork demands as a result of \ngovernment mandates. Many of them have to hire multiple tax attorneys \nand accountants to help them navigate the Federal laws and their tax \nobligations.\n  I cannot help but wonder how many businesses, both large and small, \nwill have to hire new ``benefit managers.'' There is an area where we \nwill create some new jobs. We are going to hire benefit managers to \nhelp them keep track of the new requirements to ensure they are \noffering the appropriate benefits or paying the appropriate fine. What \na nightmare.\n  No one has mentioned the thousands of additional Federal workers. \nNobody has talked about it. When we did Part D of Medicare, they had to \nhire over 500 people at CMS. So we will have to hire all kinds of \npeople, including--listen to this--at the Internal Revenue Service. I \nbet you would have a hard time finding an American who thinks it is a \ngood idea to get the IRS involved in delivering our Nation's health \ncare.\n  The worst thing we can do is borrow another $2.3 trillion, create \nadditional Federal programs, and put a bigger burden on the engine of \njob creation. I find this especially troublesome after hearing the \nChief Actuary at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\n\n[[Page S13708]]\n\nlast week report that under the original Reid health care bill costs \nwould go up, not down. In fact, according to his analysis, the Federal \nGovernment would spend $234 billion more on health care if this \nlegislation became law than without it--$234 billion more with this \nlegislation than what we are spending right now.\n  It is not just the Federal Government. As I discussed in some detail \nlast week, most States will have new fiscal obligations of about $26 \nbillion under this bill. If you are not lucky enough to be from one of \nthe States, such as the Cornhusker State or another State that got a \nspecial deal in this legislation to get the Democratic leadership's 60 \nvotes, your Governor is going to be hit with a portion of the cost of \nexpanding the Medicaid Program to cover all individuals up to 133 \npercent of the Federal poverty level.\n  In the State of Ohio, we have had 154,000 more people come on \nMedicaid just with the current extent of poverty, and to go to 133 \npercent, it is going to be incredible.\n  As a former Governor of Ohio, former chairman of the National \nGovernors Association, and past chairman of the National League of \nCities, I am very familiar with what unfunded mandates can do to State \nand local governments.\n  By the way, there is a point of order that lies against this bill as \nan unfunded mandate in terms of local and State government, and also \nbusiness. The American people should understand that the new State \nobligations under the Medicare expansion will mean less funding, OK, \nless funding for primary and secondary education, higher education \nprograms, roads and bridges, county and local government projects, and \nsafety service programs run by their States. In fact, I used to call \nMedicaid the Pacman that gobbled up our State budget dollars.\n\n  So let's look at this. You take the side over here of Medicaid, but \nthen what you do is you expand that, and it is going to be more \nexpensive, and then you look around and you say: We have great needs \nwith secondary and primary education. The kids are complaining about \nthe fact that tuition is going up for our institutions of higher \neducation. Our local government officials are complaining because the \nState and local government funds that are going to them are not \navailable to them because all of this money is flowing in this \ndirection. In other words, under the Reid bill, we will put more stress \nand further unfunded mandates on the States, making our health care \nfiscal picture even worse than it would be without doing anything at \nall. This doesn't make any sense.\n  As I have often said--in fact, when I was Governor, I said--Gone are \nthe days when public officials will be judged by how much they spend on \na problem; the new realities dictate that we work harder and smarter \nand more with less. In fact, I remember giving my state of the union \naddresses or state of the State addresses in Ohio, and they used to \ntake a pool about how many times I would say ``harder and smarter and \nmore with less.'' That is what our States are doing but not the Federal \nGovernment--not the Federal Government, oh, no. States are raising \ntaxes and cutting but not the Federal Government. We are just in there \nborrowing and borrowing and borrowing as if there will be no tomorrow.\n  The costs incurred by our children and grandchildren as a result of \nthis bill will be a crushing blow to their futures--a future that is \nalready ominous because of this body. In other words, what we are \nsaying to them is we are putting the cost on their credit card.\n  You are in a new world where the competition is going to be keener \nthan ever. We have all kinds of competitors that we didn't have when I \nwas growing up, so they are going to have to work harder. Then we are \ngoing to say to them: By the way, your taxes are going up. We are going \nto put a burden on your back because we weren't willing to pay for or \ndo without during the time we were in a position of responsibility.\n  Another legacy I am upset about leaving for our children and \ngrandchildren is the public funding of abortion. The other day, I \nexplained to an individual that since Roe v. Wade, we have had over 40 \nmillion abortions--40 million abortions. Yet I have friends of mine who \nare wanting children, and they are going to China, they are going to \nRussia, they are going to other places to find those children, but here \nin the United States over 40 million abortions. Unfortunately, the \nlanguage that was inserted in the managers' amendment does not protect \ntaxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortion. In fact, the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops and National Right to Life have said the \nlanguage, and thus the bill, is unacceptable and should not move \nforward.\n  Turning back to the fiscal arguments against this bill, one of my \ncolleagues said yesterday that those of us on this side of the aisle \nwho argue we cannot afford this bill are being disingenuous and we are \nengaging in scare tactics, even asking when the ``lying time''--from a \ncolleague on the other side--the ``lying time'' for this side of the \naisle will stop. Well, we will see. We will see. I am not going to be a \nMember of the U.S. Senate in 2012, but if God gives me the health and \nthe energy, I will certainly be around to remind people who was telling \nthe truth and who was not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President:\n  Does rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate provide that on a \nmeasure or motion to amend the Senate rules, the necessary affirmative \nvote shall be two-thirds of the Senators present and voting?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Further parliamentary inquiry: Is it also the case that \non numerous occasions, the Senate has required a two-thirds cloture \nvote on bills that combine amendments to the Senate rules with other \nlegislative provisions that do not amend the rules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would require a two-thirds vote.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I have numerous examples here. We did it twice this year \non S. 2349, and I could read those, but I will spare the Chair all of \nthese. I am just trying to get at a concern we have.\n  Am I correct that with respect to these bills, there was a \ncombination of legislative provision and rules changes, and the Chair \nruled that because there--and I am referring to earlier this year, \nthose I referred to where we required the two-thirds cloture. Am I \ncorrect on these previous bills that with respect to the bills, there \nwas a combination of legislative provisions and rules changes, and the \nChair ruled that because there were rules changes, a two-thirds vote \nwas required?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there were changes to the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate, a two-thirds vote would have been required to invoke \ncloture.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  Am I also correct that the Senate has required a two-thirds cloture \non amendments to bills, where the amendments combine legislative \nprovisions and rules changes? I have a number of references to bills \nwhen this was done, if there is any question, and I have given them to \nthe Parliamentarian for consideration. Is there an answer? I mean, I \nknow there have been amendments to bills that we required two-thirds \nbecause they include rule changes. I just wanted to get a confirmation \nfrom our Parliamentarian.\n  Is that, in fact, the case, where two-thirds cloture on amendments to \nbills have been required to have a two-thirds vote because of the rules \nchanges included in them?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would have to check that for a \nfuture answer.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I believe the Parliamentarian does have references for \nwhen this has been done. I am quite certain it has.\n  But as the Chair has confirmed, rule XXII, paragraph 2, of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate states that on a measure or motion to \namend the Senate rules, the necessary affirmative vote shall be two-\nthirds of the Senators present and voting.\n  Let me go to the bill before us because buried deep within the over \n2,000 pages of this bill we find a rather substantial change to the \nStanding Rules of the Senate. It is section 3403, and it begins on page \n1,000 of the Reid substitute. These provisions not only amend certain \nrules, they waive certain rules and create entirely new rules out of \nwhole cloth.\n\n[[Page S13709]]\n\n  Again, I will skip over some examples, but let me read a few of these \nprovisions that amend the Senate rules which are contained in section \n3403 of the Reid substitute.\n  Section D titled ``Referral:''\n\n       The legislation introduced under this paragraph shall be \n     referred by the Presiding Officers of the respective Houses \n     to the Committee on Finance in the Senate and to the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Ways \n     and Means in the House of Representatives.\n\n  The bill creates out of whole cloth a new rule that this specific \nbill must be referred to the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Another example under section C, titled ``Committee Jurisdiction:''\n\n       Notwithstanding rule 15 of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, a committee amendment described in subparagraph (A) \n     may include matter not within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Finance if that matter is relevant to a proposal \n     contained in the bill submitted under subsection (c)(3).\n\n  Clearly a rule change.\n  So there is no pretense that this bill is being referred under the \nrules to the committee of jurisdiction. Now it is allowing the Finance \nCommittee to add whatever matter it wants to the bill regardless of any \nrules regarding committee jurisdiction. And for a good measure, the \nbill even specifically states that it is amending rule XV.\n  Let me just skip over a number of other examples referring to rules \njust to try to get to the point here because it goes on and on, and I \nhave pages here.\n\n  There is one provision that I found particularly troubling, and it is \nunder a section C titled ``Limitation on Changes to This Subsection:''\n\n       It shall not be in order in the Senate or in the House of \n     Representatives to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, \n     or conference report that would repeal or otherwise change \n     this subsection.\n\n  This is not legislation. This is not law. This is a rule change. It \nis a pretty big deal. We will be passing a new law and at the same time \ncreating a Senate rule that makes it out of order to amend or even \nrepeal the law. I am not even sure it is constitutional, but if it is, \nit most certainly is a Senate rule. I don't see why the majority party \nwouldn't put this in every bill. If you like your law, you most \ncertainly would want it to have force for future Senates. I mean, we \nwant to bind future Congresses.\n  This goes to the fundamental purpose of Senate rules, to prevent a \ntyrannical majority from trampling on the rights of the minority or of \nfuture Congresses.\n  Therefore, I would like to propound a parliamentary inquiry to the \nChair. Does section 3403 of this bill propose amendments to the \nStanding Rules of the Senate? Further parliamentary inquiry: Does the \ninclusion of these proposed amendments to the Senate rules mean that \nthe bill requires two-thirds present and voting to invoke cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The section of the proposed legislation \naddressed by the Senator does not amend the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, and therefore its inclusion does not affect the number of votes \nrequired to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Is the Chair aware of any precedent where the Senate \ncreated a law and in doing so created a new rule that--and I am quoting \nfrom our bill:\n\n       It shall not be in order in the Senate or in the House of \n     Representatives to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, \n     or conference report that would repeal or otherwise change--\n\n  Such law?\n  Is the Chair aware that we have ever put this type of binding \nlegislation on future Congresses in a bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is quite common to do that.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I would ask the Chair to get those references, if the \nParliamentarian would, to us.\n  Mr. President, another parliamentary inquiry: If this new law will \noperate as a Senate rule, making it out of order for Senators to \npropose amendments to repeal or amend it--I have been in Congress 11 \nyears. I have never heard of an amendment being called out of order \nbecause it changes something that was done before. How is that \ndifferent than the types of Senate rulemaking for which our \npredecessors in their wisdom provided a two-thirds cloture vote? This \nseems to be a redefinition of words, in my mind.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the Parliamentarian is going to \nredefine words, as I am afraid he has done as part of this process \nbefore. But this is truly historic that we have included rules changes \nin legislation, and yet we are ignoring a rule that requires a two-\nthirds cloture vote to pass it. I believe it is unconstitutional. I \nbelieve it subverts the principle we have operated under, and it is \nvery obvious to anyone that it does change a rule. It is clear that our \nrules mean nothing if we can redefine the words we use in them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will note that it is quite common to \ninclude provisions affecting Senate procedure in legislation.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Is there a difference between Senate procedures and \nrules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes\n  Mr. DeMINT. So the language you see in this bill that specifically \nrefers to a change in a rule is not a rule change, it is a procedure \nchange?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Then I guess our rules mean nothing, do they, if we can \nredefine them.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/21/senate-section/article/S13709-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 7 A.M.
