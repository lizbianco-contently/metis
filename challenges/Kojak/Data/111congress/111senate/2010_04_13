Madam President, things were very hectic when the health \ncare legislation passed. At the end of that work period, I acknowledged \nthe contribution of several staff members to helping Congress pass \nhealth care reform--the most significant domestic policy legislation in \na long time. There were so many valuable players on this team that it \nwas inevitable, in the haste of things, that perhaps I would forget \nsomeone who was very important. I did that extemporaneously and tried \nto go over all my staff, but I had many things running through my mind, \nand I inadvertently left off one of the key players on my staff who \nworked so hard; that is, a man by the name of Bruce King, who worked so \nactively on health care, especially as it related to reconciliation. \nMore importantly, he is a good person, a fine human being, and the \nAmerican public is fortunate that people as talented and as selfless as \nhe have chosen public service.\n  Bruce came to my office after, among other things, serving in a \nsenior role for two distinguished Senators from New Jersey--Senators \nLautenberg and Corzine. He did that for more than a decade. He also \nserved as staff director for the Senate Budget Committee. He graduated \nfrom Tulane University and Stanford School of Law and attended the \nprestigious London School of Economics, so his academic background is \nreally sensational. He was one of the first people I hired when I \nbecame Democratic leader, and it turned out to be one of the best \ndecisions I made for the people of Nevada and the country. He is very \neasy to work with, very bright, and very helpful all of the time.\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\n  He has staffed me so well on so many issues in the last 6 years. He \ndid an especially exceptional job on the reconciliation bill we put \ntogether to make improvements on the Senate-passed health care bill. \nReconciliation is perhaps the most complicated process the Senate \nundertakes, and thanks to Bruce and the staff of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, we produced a reconciliation bill that both helped millions \nof Americans and remained consistent with arcane and complex Senate \nrules.\n  I wish to publicly acknowledge Bruce and thank him for all he has \ndone on health care and countless other issues for the people of Nevada \nand the people of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2216-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, a lot of smart people have thought \nabout how to prevent a repeat of the kind of financial crisis we saw in \nthe fall of 2008. We have heard plenty of ideas. But if there is one \nthing Americans agree on when it comes to financial reform, it is \nabsolutely certain they agree on this: Never again--never again--should \ntaxpayers be expected to bail out Wall Street from its own mistakes. We \ncannot allow endless taxpayer-funded bailouts for big Wall Street \nbanks. That is why we must not pass the financial reform bill that is \nabout to hit the floor.\n  The fact is, this bill wouldn't solve the problems that led to the \nfinancial crisis; it would make them worse. The American people have \nbeen telling us for nearly 2 years that any solution must do one \nthing--one thing: It must put an end to taxpayer-funded bailouts for \nWall Street banks. It must put an end to taxpayer-funded bailouts for \nWall Street banks. This bill not only allows for taxpayer-funded \nbailouts of Wall Street banks, it institutionalizes them. Let me say \nthat again. This bill not only allows for taxpayer-funded bailouts for \nWall Street banks, it actually institutionalizes them. The bill gives \nthe Federal Reserve enhanced emergency lending authority that is far \ntoo open to abuse. It also gives the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation and the Treasury broad authority over troubled financial \ninstitutions without requiring them to assume real responsibility for \ntheir mistakes. In other words, it gives the government a backdoor \nmechanism for propping up failing or failed institutions.\n\n  A new $50 billion fund would be set up as a backstop for financial \nemergencies. But no one honestly thinks--no one honestly thinks--that \n$50 billion would be enough to cover the kinds of crises we are talking \nabout. During the last crisis, AIG alone received more than three times \nthat from the taxpayers--three times that. Moreover, the mere existence \nof this fund will ensure that it gets used. The mere existence of the \nfund will ensure that it gets used. And once it is used up, taxpayers \nwill be asked to cover the balance. This is precisely the wrong \napproach.\n  Far from protecting consumers from Wall Street excess, this bill \nwould provide endless protection--endless protection--for the biggest \nbanks on Wall Street. This bill would provide endless protection for \nthe biggest banks on Wall Street. It also directs the Fed to oversee 35 \nto 50 of the biggest firms, replicating on an even larger scale the \nsame distortions that plagued the housing market and helped trigger a \nmassive bubble we will be suffering from for years. So imagine this: If \nyou thought Freddie and Fannie were dangerous, how about 35 to 50 of \nthem?\n  Everyone agrees on the need to protect taxpayers from being on the \nhook for future Wall Street bailouts, but this bill would all but \nguarantee that the pattern continues. We need to end the worst abuses \non Wall Street without forcing the taxpayer to pick up the tab. I \nrepeat: We need to end the worst abuses on Wall Street without forcing \nthe taxpayer to pick up the tab. That is what Republicans will be \nfighting for in this debate. The taxpayers have paid enough already. \nTaxpayers have paid enough already. We are not going to expose them to \neven more pain down the road.\n  The way to solve this problem is to let the people who made the \nmistakes pay for them. The way to solve the problem is to let the \npeople who made the mistakes pay for them. We won't solve this problem \nuntil the biggest banks are allowed to fail.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2216-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pending before the Senate is the \nquestion of whether we are going to extend unemployment compensation to \nthe unemployed across our Nation. It is an issue which recurs in the \nSenate with some frequency, and it baffles me why we continue to argue \nover this question. We have 8 million people actively unemployed and \nanother 6 million long-term unemployed people. We know many of them \nhave lost their jobs because of this recession through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  If my colleagues have taken the time, as I have, to meet with these \npeople, they know they are in desperate straits. There are \napproximately 4 or 5 unemployed people in America for every available \njob. When I sit down and listen to the stories of how they are applying \nonline for job after job after job--a great week for them is if one or \ntwo potential employers even follow through with an e-mail of inquiry \nabout their background. It is a frustrating, fearful existence, and it \nis one that is made no easier by the actions of the Senate.\n  We have been lurching from month to month, creating uncertainty as to \nwhether we are going to send these people a check to live on--a basic \nunemployment benefit check of some $300 a week. Consider how any of us \ncould survive, and even some with families, with that meager amount of \nmoney. The argument is made on the other side of the aisle by many that \nwhen you give people $300 a week--$1,200 a month--it just makes them \nlazy and they stop looking for jobs. I wonder how many in this Chamber \ncould live on $300 a week for everything--rent, utilities, maybe a \nmortgage payment, school clothing, kids' shoes, food--the basics. And \ndon't forget that most of these people, when they lost their jobs, also \nlost their health insurance. So they live not only in fear of not \nfinding a job but in fear that tomorrow morning a diagnosis or an \naccident can devastate everything they have ever saved for in their \nlives. Yet every 4 or 5 weeks we go through this drill on the floor of \nthe Senate about whether we are going to help these people.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle say this is all about the \ndeficit. We have to get serious about this deficit, and here is our \nopportunity: unemployment benefits for those unemployed across America. \nThis is where we will make our stand for fiscal sanity. Where were they \nwhen the last President asked us for a bank bailout of $800 billion? \nHow many on that side of the aisle were saying to President Bush: I am \nsorry, we can't bail out banks because we have a deficit. I don't \nremember hearing that argument. When it came to bank bailouts, the \nother side of the aisle, by and large--not all of them but by and \nlarge--voted for hundreds of billions of dollars for banks in distress. \nBut when it comes to unemployment compensation to help families in \ndistress, then we have to really consider this deficit.\n  I am troubled by this. We know that when natural disasters strike our\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\nStates, we rally to the victims. We rally to their needs and we say: \nTake care of the immediate challenge. We will deal with the budgetary \nissues at the appropriate time, but let's take care of the emergency. \nYet when it comes to unemployment compensation and health insurance for \nthe unemployed, many on the other side of the aisle don't consider that \nan emergency. It would be an emergency if they had to live on $300 a \nweek and it was cut off. It would be an emergency if they had no health \ninsurance. Why do we do this? I think we are a better Nation. We should \nbe a better Senate than to turn our backs on people truly in need, and \nthat is what is going on here.\n  We have to urge our colleagues to come forward with amendments, if \nthat is what they want, offer the amendments and debate them, which is \ntheir right in the Senate.\n  But then let's get on with it. Let's have a final vote. Let's give \nsome security and peace of mind to the people who have lost their \nunemployment benefits because of the objections of one Senator. That is \nright. One Senator stood and objected and 21,000 Americans lost their \nunemployment benefits last week; 21,000 will lose them this week, and \nin my State 16,000 a week are falling off unemployment, 16,000 people \nwho will not receive that $300 check.\n  What are they going to do? Well, I think we should respond to this \nneed immediately, and we ought to take into consideration the fact that \nwhen it comes to this recession, there are some positive things, some \ngood news, not nearly enough of it. Too many people still unemployed.\n  The unemployment figures, though very slightly better, show at least \nwe are moving on the positive side of the ledger. We need to do so much \nmore. Every single Senator on the other side of the aisle who is voting \nagainst unemployment benefits also voted against President Barrack \nObama's efforts to put money into our economy and bring us out of this \nrecession. It is starting to work. I hope it works soon.\n  We know what this devastation did to us. We lost some $17 trillion in \nvalue across America because of this recession. That is more than 1 \nyear's gross domestic product, the sum total value of all the goods and \nservices produced in America in 1 year. We lost that in this recession. \nMany of us felt it personally in our savings accounts and retirement \naccounts. A lot of people felt it as their businesses strained and some \nfailed. Others felt it when they lost their jobs and had no place to \nturn--$17 trillion dragged out of this economy.\n  The President came in and said: Let's put a stimulus bill in, a bill \nfor reinvestment in America. First, let's give a tax cut, the largest \ntax cut to working families that we have seen in recent times. Then \nlet's provide a safety net for those who lost the jobs and State and \nlocal governments still struggling and, finally, let's invest in some \nprojects that we will build for America's future: school construction \nand highways and airports and a variety of things.\n  I went to Spring Valley, IL, over the break. It is a small town. But \nthey were celebrating because $4\\1/2\\ million from the President's \nstimulus package was going to make it to Spring Valley, IL, to build \nsewer lines which they have needed for decades.\n  As we had a press conference in this tiny town, where a weekly \nnewspaper and radio station showed up, there were people lining the \nstreets in front of their homes saying: Thank you. Our homes have been \nflooded out every time we have had a serious rainfall in this town. Now \nwe are going to have storm sewers here, and local people are going to \nwork to build them. The jobs are not going to be exported. The jobs are \ngoing to be right here in America, good-paying jobs.\n  So those investments are going to pay off for Spring Valley, for \nIllinois, and for this Nation for a long time to come. When it came \nright down to it, only a handful of Republican Senators would even help \nus pass that important measure.\n  After this, we are going to have the financial regulatory reform \nbill. It is going to be a fight because, you see, the very banks and \nfinancial institutions which dragged us into this recession are \nfighting tooth and nail to stop the reform and regulation we need to \navoid a repeat of this crisis.\n  Shame on us if, at the end of the day, we do not put enough oversight \nand regulation into law to protect Americans from another recession \nsuch as this one. A lot of mistakes were made. Some were made by \ngovernment, but a lot were made by the private sector which, in their \nexcitement and greed, got involved in some policies which were \nindefensible.\n  We have read now--there are more and more books coming out analyzing \nthis situation--that many financial institutions took advantage of the \nopportunities presented to them. They took advantage of a lot of \npeople.\n  One of the important parts of financial regulation is to make sure we \nare going to have a cop on the beat, a consumer protection agency. Oh, \nthe business interests are howling over this. The banks are howling \nover this notion that we would have an agency that literally looks out \nfor the consumers of America. Have you ever been through a real estate \nclosing with a stack of papers about this tall and they turn the corner \nof each of the pages and say: Keep signing. About 20 minutes from now, \nwe are going to hand you a check and that home will be yours.\n  About halfway through you pause and you say: What am I signing?\n  Oh, standard forms. The government requires it. Just a lot of \npaperwork. Keep rolling.\n  Off you go. Buried in one of those papers may be language that could \ndestroy you financially. I am not making this up, because prepayment \npenalties on mortgages trapped a lot of people into these exploding \nsubprime mortgages and they could not get out. They lost their homes, \nthey lost their savings, they lost everything, and they filed for \nbankruptcy because of one sentence in one form in a stack of papers \npushed at you at a real estate closing.\n  Is it too much to ask that we have one agency of government, one \nagency that keeps an eye out for those tricks and traps which lure \npeople in and can destroy them financially? How many of us have taken \nthe time with our monthly credit card statement to flip it over and \nread the back page, that faint print, tiny line after tiny line that is \nalmost impossible, even for someone who went to law school, to \nunderstand?\n  Virtually none of us do that. How many of us take a careful look at \nthose letters you get from the credit card companies which kind of \nannounce maybe the interest rate is going up?\n  Well, the fact is, even those with good education, even with business \nbackgrounds, we might struggle to understand what all this means. The \nterms keep changing. Is it not appropriate we have at least one agency \nof government that steps back and says: This should not be allowed. \nThis violates public policy.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission makes sure the toaster you \nbought at the store is not going to catch fire in your kitchen. The \nFood and Drug Administration makes sure the food you buy at the store \nis safe to eat. They make sure the pills you bought through the \npharmacy are going to be safe and effective. Is it too much to ask that \nwe have one agency, one watchdog oversight agency, that takes a look at \nall the financial information that is thrown at American families and \nbusinesses every single day?\n  My old friend, Dale Bumpers, former Senator from Arkansas, had a \nsaying that applies here. They say, of the financial institutions and \nconsumer protection, they hate this like the devil hates Holy water.\n  The notion that there would be one agency looking out for consumers \nand families across America when it comes to financial instruments, \ncredit card applications and mortgages, that, to me, is very basic. I \nam working on several amendments with my colleagues on financial \nregulatory reform that Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina and I are \ninterested in. She is going to take the lead on an issue she worked on \nin North Carolina in the legislature; that is, these payday loans, \ntitle loans, same day loans. These are awful.\n  The States that try to regulate them find that no matter how they \nwrite the law, within a matter of days, these organizations and \ncompanies find a way to scoot around it, to charge people\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\noutrageous interest rates for small loans which most of them default on \nbecause it is impossible to pay back. They roll over and roll over and \nfinally they cannot pay them. Then they face foreclosures and the kind \nof seizures of property that many of us are aware of. That, to me, is \nan outrage.\n  Years ago, Senator Talent, a Republican from Missouri, heard from the \nPentagon that these payday loan operations, those fly-by-night loan \noperations, were undermining our military because they were parking \nthemselves outside military installations and making these loans. When \nour men and women in uniform got dragged into them, they became \nfinancially insolvent to the point where some had to leave the \nmilitary, they were so broke.\n\n  So we made it a matter of policy across the United States that these \npredatory lenders could not lend money to military families. We said: \nAs a matter of law and national security, we were going to stop their \nbusiness with military families. But we did not protect the rest of \nAmerica, and we should.\n  Senator Hagan has an amendment to deal with that. Senator Sanders of \nVermont is going to address the issue of what is a fair interest rate \nin America. Should there be a limit? I think there should. I do believe \nthere should be. I have my own bill. He has his. Between us, we hope \none of them will pass, to establish that at least there is a limit to \nhow much you can be charged in interest on a loan you take out.\n  This is a critically important bill that is going to come up soon. \nSenator Dodd, of Connecticut, has done a great job. He is the chairman \nof the Banking Committee. He will be bringing this bill to the floor. \nSo far we have had no Republican support. There have been some \nindications in the media recently that they are now interested in the \nbill. We welcome them if they want to come on board and help us pass \nit.\n  But if they do not, if they want to stand for these financial \ninstitutions, to just say no when it comes to reform and regulation, \nthen that is a debate worth engaging in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I rise to describe the catastrophic flood damage in \nmy home State of Rhode Island and to ask all my colleagues, to appeal \nto my colleagues, for swift action to deliver to our families and \nbusinesses badly needed aid.\n  Rhode Island saw more rain last month than any month on record: over \n16 inches, with over 5 inches of rain falling on March 30 alone. The \ndevastation wrought by these storms exceeds anything in living memory.\n  Meteorologists who have reviewed this are calling it the most \ndamaging storm to hit the ``Ocean State'' since the Great September \nGale of 1815, a monstrosity of a storm that tossed ships through the \nstreets of Providence and carried out to sea the shops on Newport's \nLong Wharf.\n  Rhode Island's floods of March 2010 could not have come at a worse \ntime. They struck a Rhode Island already weakened by the worst \nrecession we have seen since the Great Depression. Even before the \nrecent flooding, unemployment in our State stood near 13 percent and \nhomelessness was on the rise. We have already experienced 27 months of \nsevere recession. For a year, we have been in the top three States for \nunemployment.\n  It is too soon yet to estimate the full economic impact of the March \nflooding, but it is clear the flooding's economic damage will be \nprolonged and severe.\n  The peak storm of March 30 and 31 brought commerce in the entire \nregion to a halt. Route I-95, the main artery that connects the major \ncities of the New England and Middle Atlantic States, was closed for 2 \nfull days, flooded out, following a surge of the Pawtuxet River.\n  The river, which has a flood level of 9 feet, crested at its alltime \nhigh, almost 21 feet on March 31. It is hard to overstate the \nimportance of this highway to Rhode Island's economy because it is not \nonly a regional artery, but it is the main commuter artery for our home \nState.\n  Similarly, Amtrak's Northeast service was closed for 5 days due to \nflooding of the track in our State.\n  This next picture shows the Warwick Mall. It is one of the largest \nshopping centers in the State. It was completely flooded following the \nunprecedented rainfall of March 30 and 31. You can see the top of a car \nright up to the hood. You can see the entry is completely flooded. \nThere are thousands of Rhode Islanders who work at the mall, others use \nthe mall, many have kiosks who sell within the mall. Suddenly, with \nvery little warning, they are temporarily unemployed.\n  I toured this complex with its owner, Aram Garabedian, just after the \nwater had gone down. The water was only about an inch deep when we were \nthere. You could still see--it says ``Food Court.'' You could still, in \nthe food court, some of the flooding was vanilla and some of the \nflooding was chocolate because of the ice cream stores that had lost \ntheir power and melted into the flood.\n  Mr. Garabedian and his workers are in the middle of a heroic job \ncleaning up, and they are determined to reopen as soon as possible. But \nit could be weeks or even months until all those stores are back in \nbusiness. Those, of course, are weeks and months when families who \ndepend on paychecks from this mall will need to survive on unemployment \nbenefits; unemployment benefits, I might add, with which our friends on \nthe other side are trying to interfere.\n\n  Some store owners doubt whether they will be able to reopen at all. I \nrecently held a telephone townhall during which a store owner named \nKathleen told me about the damage to her store in the mall which had \nbeen in business for 25 years. Her payment counter and her register \nwere destroyed. The drywall in her store was ruined. Little if any of \nthe merchandise or fixtures appear to be salvageable. Kathleen's flood \ninsurance company has claimed that her damage is not covered. She said \nif she doesn't receive some grant assistance from the government, she \nwill not be able to reopen, after 25 years.\n  We can see from this picture the scale of hardship that business \nowners are facing as they begin to clean up their stores. It is \ndifficult to relay in a single speech the extent of the devastation \nwrought by the floodwaters. Flooding in places where, as I went around \nthe State, the thing I heard more than anything else was: 35 years I \nhave lived here, never even water in the basement, and now look at \nthis.\n  I wish to take a few more minutes to show some pictures that \nrepresent the damage. These were taken as I toured throughout the State \nin the immediate aftermath of the storms. This is the Natick pumping \nstation which sits near a river bank in west Warwick. It is the sewage \ntreatment plant overwhelmed by the floodwaters and largely submerged. \nThe flooding crippled the station's ability to process sewage and \ncaused essentially all of the untreated waste that would have gone \nthrough it to flow out into local waterways. This station was \nsubmerged. The Warwick sewage treatment plant was submerged, and \nBristol's sewage treatment plant was also inundated. The Warwick \ntreatment plant became really part of the river. It just flowed right \nthrough and across it. So for days Rhode Island's floodwaters were \ncontaminated with raw sewage.\n  On March 30, I visited Glen Rock Reservoir in south Kingstown with \ntown manager Steve Alfred. As we can see, the reservoir has overflowed \nthe banks of this dam and has washed out this section of Old Usquepaugh \nRoad. This is a very typical photograph of the sort of road damage we \nare going to see from the flooding in Rhode Island. When we have water \nlike that flowing as white water over a road, one can imagine what \ndamage it does to the road. Our infrastructure requirements to rebuild \nfrom this are going to be very considerable.\n  At the height of the rains, Providence Street, a main road in west \nWarwick, a small, largely working class, great Rhode Island town which \nwas probably, per capita, hardest hit of any of the towns, its main \nstreet looked more like a river than a road. This picture shows local \nemergency workers out rescuing people who had been flooded into their \nhomes and apartments, driving them through the street with a boat and a \njet ski. It is not often\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\nthat one sees local emergency workers driving down the streets of Rhode \nIsland towns on boats and jet skis, but that is what it took to get the \nresidents out who had been trapped by the unprecedented floodwaters.\n  The day after the rain subsided, the flooding was still substantial. \nThis is the scene behind a local mechanic's shop on Elmwood Avenue in \nCranston. As we can see, the garage building is almost entirely \nunderwater. Nearby I was able to see cars and trailers for this \nmechanic's shop just under the surface. Later on when the water came \ndown, I could see that under this were cars. The water is right over \nthe roof of the cars and so they are not visible now, but what I \nthought was an empty parking lot was filled with cars. I went back and \nsaw it later when the waters had gone down.\n  Here is a different shot of Elmwood Avenue, looking across to an old \nmill complex filled up through the ground floor. The floodwaters are \nnot only covering the road itself but the entire parking lot and into \nthe mill building itself. The local residents obviously were distraught \nby this kind of damage. The bridge that is down below this, the \nWellington Avenue bridge, thankfully, held against the pressure of the \nwater rushing past and over it. But two other bridges in Coventry and \nNorth Providence were so damaged by the flow of the water past and over \nthem, they have been condemned and have to be completely rebuilt.\n  I went up to Cumberland to visit Mayor Dan McKee and to see some of \nthe damage there. His first responders took us in this boat out to Hope \nGlobal, which is a company on the banks of the river. It is the \nBlackstone River this time, not the Pawtuxet. This river was the cradle \nof the Industrial Revolution. The famous Slater Mill in Rhode Island, a \ntrue spark that lit off America's Industrial Revolution, was a \nriverside mill that used the rivers for power. Historically, Rhode \nIsland's working waterfront has been a riverfront where mills up and \ndown the Blackstone, up and down the Pawtuxet, up and down other rivers \ntook advantage of water power. Then, as we moved from water power to \nelectric power, they stayed. But they stayed very vulnerable to the \nrivers. So from Hope Global down to Ashaway Line and Twine \nManufacturing Company and Bradford Printing and Finishing, down near \nWesterly, the riverside businesses in Rhode Island were swamped and \nflooded.\n  Now businesses that had existed for generations, that employed many \nhundreds in each plant, lie submerged and silent and out of work.\n  One of the things that impressed me during the course of my visit was \nthe resilience and courage shown by Rhode Islanders. We took this \npicture at the Okonite Company. It was also covered by the floodwaters, \nbut it was nice to see both the American and the Rhode Island flags \nflying high, notwithstanding the devastation that surrounded them. This \nstruck me as a fitting example of the perseverance and resilience of \nRhode Islanders responding to this crisis. It is often true that trying \ntimes bring out the best in people. Certainly this flood brought out \nthe best in many folks in Rhode Island.\n  Everywhere I have traveled in the days since the floods began, I have \nseen neighbors helping neighbors, and I have witnessed the \nextraordinary diligence and courage of the municipal workers, the first \nresponders, the police and fire folks, public works, literally all \nmunicipal employees who worked long hours, wet hours, cold hours, tired \nhours helping their communities.\n  A couple in Westerly had to evacuate their home in 30 minutes as the \nfloodwaters picked their house up off its foundation. Amazingly, after \nall they had been through, they were still more concerned for their \nneighbors than for themselves. They wrote to me:\n\n       . . . as tough as things are for now, we see so many of our \n     neighbors that had no insurance and they lost everything. \n     Many of the people who were renting apartments were given \n     five minutes to evacuate. As we were leaving, we took all of \n     the food from our fridge and were able to distribute it to \n     some of the folks running for cover. Life seems to throw lots \n     of curveballs and you never anticipate when you get up in the \n     morning that you will be homeless by the afternoon but Mother \n     Nature has a mind much her own.\n\n  I want to point out that the word on the Rhode Island State flag is \n``hope.'' As I look at this picture and see the flag flying high amidst \nthe devastation from the flood below, I am reminded of countless acts \nof kindness and generosity, indeed hope, which have accompanied the \ntroubling, sad, and difficult events of recent weeks. The flooding has \ndestroyed homes, closed businesses, and ended jobs, but the people of \nRhode Island have stood up remarkably well. Spirits are strong. But the \njob of rebuilding roads, bridges, sewage treatment plants, public \nfacilities, homes, and businesses is a colossal and daunting task for a \nState 27 months into severe recession.\n  Now we in Rhode Island need help from the Federal Government to \nfulfill that hope and to help us rebuild. Just as Congress was quick to \nrespond in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and following the \nflooding in Iowa and North Dakota in 2008 and 2009, I ask my colleagues \nto work with my senior Senator, Jack Reed, and I to bring needed \nassistance to Rhode Island as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, may I be advised when I have spoken for 7 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2219-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2219-S2220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise to talk about the judicial \nconfirmation process, given the fact that President Obama will soon be \nnominating someone for the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice \nStevens. There has been a lot written about this subject. It would be \nuseful, at least from my standpoint, to clarify or elucidate how I view \nthis and how I think a lot of my colleagues do on both sides of the \naisle.\n  The question of a filibuster arises. The best way to put into context \nwhat folks mean when they talk about judicial activism as potentially \nbringing about a filibuster is to at least describe what I think about \nthat. All of us in the Senate, whether we have supported a filibuster \nor not, would agree that all else being equal, it is not something we \nshould do for judicial nominations, especially for a Supreme Court \nnomination. There has not been a successful filibuster of a Supreme \nCourt nomination, thankfully, despite the fact that the last two \nnominees--especially the last nominee to the Court by President Bush, \nthere was an attempt to filibuster, and even then-Senator Obama, now \nPresident Obama, participated in that attempt.\n  What would cause Senators to not just vote against a nominee but \nactually go so far as to try to prevent the nominee from receiving a \nvote up or down?\n  There is this concept of extraordinary circumstance that evolved \nabout 4 years ago when the so-called Gang of 14, seven Republicans and \nseven Democrats, agreed that it would not be appropriate to filibuster \na judicial nominee except in extraordinary circumstances. That is where \nthat phrase ``extraordinary circumstance'' came about.\n  There are a lot of Members of the Senate who believe one of those \nextraordinary circumstances could be a situation where a nominee is \nparticularly activist in the sense that it would appear that he or she \ngoes on to the bench with preconceived notions about specific kinds of \nsocietal issues or questions that may come before the Court and a bias \ntoward resolving those matters one way or the other, as opposed to \nsimply taking the facts of each case and reading the law to see what \nthe precedents of the Court are, what the statute is, if there is a law \ninvolved, and deciding the case on the merits of that specific case \nirrespective of the judge's views about the question from a political \nor philosophical standpoint.\n  There are a couple of recent examples I wanted to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues which illustrate the kind of activism to \nwhich I and some of my colleagues would object.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from Vermont, \nwas quoted in Politico today as making a statement which I think \nillustrates the issue well. Senator Leahy is quoted as saying this, \nthat he thinks one of the questions to the potential nominees is going \nto be this: ``Do you share our concern about the fact that the court\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\nalways seems to side with the big corporate interests against the \naverage American?''\n  Aside from the fact that I think that is not a fact, that the Court \nalways sides with big corporate interests against the average \nAmerican--that is, obviously, a very politically charged statement--the \nquestion is, Is it really appropriate to ask a potential judicial \nnominee whether that nominee is going to side with big corporate \ninterests or whether the nominee would want to side with some other \nkind of interest in the litigation? Well, I think it is appropriate to \nask whether the nominee has biases one way or the other that would \npreclude him or her from deciding a specific case on the merits of that \ncase as opposed to whether, from a general philosophical standpoint, \nthat nominee would be on the side of big corporate interests or always \nagainst the big corporate interests.\n  When Chief Justice Roberts was before our committee, he was asked a \nquestion like this, a question about whether he thinks it would be \nappropriate to rule for the big guy or the little guy, and I think he \nsaid it correctly. He said: If the law supports the big guy, then the \nbig guy should win the case. If the law supports the little guy, then \nthe little guy should win the case. You do not go on the bench with an \nidea that: I am always going to rule against the big guy or--commenting \non Senator Leahy's statement here--I am going to rule against big \ncorporate interests. That presents a dilemma, by the way, where you \nhave corporation A suing corporation B. I do not know how you are going \nto resolve that if you are always going to rule against big corporate \ninterests.\n  But the point is, to go on the bench with that attitude would be \nwrong. The big corporation might have the right law and facts in a \nparticular case. In another case, the person suing or being sued by the \nbig corporate interest might have the law and the facts on their side. \nThat should be the determination of how the case comes out, not your \npreconceived notions--for example, your intention to always rule \nagainst ``big corporate interests.''\n  Here is another example: One of my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee on a television program said he wanted to see a nominee who \nwould be hard on Executive power. We have three branches of government: \nthe executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The Constitution sets \nup a delicate balance among those three branches of government, and \nthere is a constant tension between the powers exerted by the branches \nand against the branches. Those tensions result in litigation \nsometimes.\n  Sometimes there is a claim that the Executive is taking too much \npower unto himself. That charge was made against virtually every \nPresident who, in my memory, has ever served. It certainly is being \nmade against the President today. But you do not go on the bench with \nthe notion that: If a case ever comes before me involving a contest of \nwhether the Executive has the power to do something versus the \nlegislature, for example, I am going to rule against the Executive, I \nam going to be hard on Executive power. That would be wrong. You do not \neven know what the facts of the case are and what the precedents might \nbe relating to those particular facts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate it.\n  I will conclude with this particular example: You want a judge who is \ngoing to be on the Court to say: I understand the balance of power. I \nhave read the law, and I understand the precedents that relate to this \nparticular kind of fact pattern. And based on the law and based on \nthese facts in this particular case, I believe that either the \nExecutive should have the power or not. But I do not come to that \nconclusion based upon a preconceived political, ideological notion that \nwe need to rein in Executive power any more than I believe we should \nrein in legislative power or judicial power.\n  This is what a lot of us mean when we talk about judicial activism. \nIt is the difference between someone who comes to the Court with firmly \nheld philosophical beliefs that would cause that individual to be more \npredisposed to rule on the basis of those beliefs than on the facts of \nthe case or the law in any particular situation. So when my colleagues \non the Democratic side say they are looking for a nominee who will have \na penchant for ruling in a particular way in particular cases, you will \nsee objections from people like me who will say: No, that is wrong. \nThat is activism. That is basing decisions on ideology rather than on \nwhat the law is.\n  I will conclude by saying this: The President has it fully within his \npower to nominate a candidate for Supreme Court Justice who generally \nhas been seen as deciding cases based on their merits rather than from \nan ideological perspective. But to the extent the President chooses \nsomeone who has been very active politically and has expressed strong \npolitical views or who from the bench has seemingly made decisions \nbased upon a preconceived ideological notion rather than on the basis \nof the facts and law to come before him or her, in that situation, \nthen, you would tempt opposition and potentially even a filibuster \ndepending upon how serious the situation was or how extraordinary it \nwas, to cite the particular phrase.\n  So I hope that sort of sets the groundwork here for our evaluation of \nthe President's nominee and for a public understanding of the \ncircumstances under which some of us would oppose a nominee and under \nwhich perhaps even, in an extraordinary situation, a filibuster would \nresult. I certainly hope that is not the case, that that does not \nhappen.\n  I am sure the President realizes that if he nominates someone who \ndoes come clearly to the attention of the Senate from a perspective of \nevenhanded justice, that nominee will be treated fairly, that the \nprocess could move much more quickly, and that the outcome can be much \nmore favorable.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this week President Obama is scheduled \nto visit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Many Americans expect the \nPresident to explain his vision for human space flight in the decades \nahead. I would say this vision is long overdue.\n  One year after celebrating its 50th anniversary, as well as the 40th \nanniversary of the first Moon landing, the White House has proposed a \nbudget that will force NASA to abandon its historic role in space \nexploration. The administration has stated its intention to terminate \nNASA's Constellation Program, our Nation's flagship endeavor to return \nAmericans to the Moon and beyond. After $9 billion invested over 7 \nyears, the President would leave NASA adrift and without a mission. I \nhope the President will announce that he has thought better of that \ninitial decision, and this morning I would like to take a few minutes \nto explain why I think he should do so.\n  Texas is proud of our close connection with NASA's human space flight \nprogram, and we recognize how it has helped transform the greater \nHouston area into a high-tech leader. Johnson Space Center has helped \nsend astronauts into space for nearly four decades. We would love for \nthe President to visit the Johnson Space Center and see how we have \nhelped our astronauts complete their missions and return home safely.\n  We remember the region endured several years of challenges following \nthe termination of the Apollo Program in 1974. We saw some of the \nbrightest minds at the Johnson Space Center end their careers. The \nfuture of the entire industry seemed uncertain.\n\n  NASA Administrator Charles Bolden was recently quoted as saying:\n\n       With all due respect to everybody who opposes the budget--\n\n  In other words, the cut of the Constellation Program--\n\n     a very serious and real concern is the jobs.\n\n  Now, he was correct in one way: the cancellation of Constellation, \ncombined with the retirement of the space shuttle, could cost the \nregion as many as 7,000 direct jobs, according to the Bay Area Houston \nEconomic Partnership. With all due respect to General Bolden, Texas \nsupport for human space flight is not merely based on parochial \nconcerns. We understand the local economic impact would be nothing \ncompared to the strategic opportunity cost for the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\n  For one thing, the end of the Constellation Program will increase our \ndependence on Russia to transport Americans to the International Space \nStation--a space station built with billions of American taxpayer \ndollars. Earlier this month, NASA signed a $335 million contract with \nRussia that will cost our country nearly $56 million per seat on \nRussian spacecraft--or about $8 million more per seat than what NASA \npaid in 2007. So we are literally having to depend on Russia to \ntransport American astronauts to the International Space Station. Many \nAmericans are already concerned about this arrangement. Many Americans \nsuspect the Russians will raise the price once the shuttle program is \nended because we will be completely dependent on them to transport our \nastronauts. Indeed, the head of the Russian space agency recently \nstated his eagerness to renegotiate costs to access the International \nSpace Station following the retirement of the space shuttle.\n  Soon, Russia will not be the only nation to surpass the United States \nin human space flight. The governments of China and India have also \naccelerated their investments. All of these nations are investing in \nhuman space flight not only because they want their flags to be the \nfirst on Mars but also because they know those investments will \ngenerate a good return.\n  Innovations that will help humans survive and thrive in space will \nlikely create as many spinoff technologies in the 21st century as we \nsaw in the first decades of the space age. If we do not incubate these \nlife-supporting technologies here in America, our children will have no \nchoice but to import them from other countries. Apollo 13 astronaut Jim \nLovell put it this way. He said the end of the Constellation Program \n``will have catastrophic consequences on our ability to explore space \nand the spin-offs we get from space technology.'' He said: ``They \nhaven't thought through''--talking about the administration's proposed \ncut in the Constellation Program--``the consequences.'' I think that is \ncorrect.\n  The White House has said it believes the private sector can play a \nlarger role in space exploration, and I would say they are right--to a \npoint. We certainly want to encourage private investment and public-\nprivate partnerships in the development of space technologies. We want \nto help NASA become an even better partner with aerospace \nentrepreneurs. Leveraging the potential of the private sector is no \nless an imperative in space exploration than it is in other fields of \ninnovation. But NASA cannot pass the baton of human space flight to a \nrunner who is still trying on its shoes. The private sector requires \nyears of further development before it can send a human being to the \nMoon or compete with America's international rivals.\n  The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel--a group of independent experts \ncreated by Congress--reported in January that:\n\n       No manufacturer of Commercial Orbital Transportation \n     Services is currently qualified for human-rating \n     requirements, despite some claims and beliefs to the \n     contrary.\n\n  The panel has warned:\n\n       To abandon the [Constellation program] for an alternative \n     without demonstrated capability or proven superiority is \n     unwise and probably not cost effective.\n\n  NASA was assigned the constellation mission for the same reason it \ntook on Apollo: It remains the only entity in our country capable of \ngetting the job done.\n  So what should President Obama say when he visits the Kennedy Space \nCenter this week? I would like to offer just a few thoughts.\n  First, I hope President Obama would recognize the tremendous \nuncertainty his administration has created by proposing to end the \nConstellation Program without identifying a viable alternative.\n  Second, he should make clear that Congress has the last word on the \nConstellation Program--which we do--and that NASA will follow the \ncurrent law during this fiscal year and every year Congress continues \nto fund the program.\n  Third, I hope he would articulate a clear vision for the future of \nhuman space flight in our country, and that vision would include a \nclear exploration mission, a timeline, goals, and a destination. And I \nhope his vision would include a new commitment to the Constellation \nProgram, which remains America's best bet to ensure America's continued \nleadership in human space exploration.\n  Fourth, I hope he would make a budget request that will fund this \nvision and that it will carefully be aligned with this exploration \nplan.\n  Just yesterday, a number of American heroes made clear what a vision \nfor American space flight should look like. More than two dozen former \nastronauts and flight directors, as well as a former NASA \nAdministrator, wrote an open letter to the President. They wrote, in \npart:\n\n       America's greatness lies in her people: she will always \n     have men and women willing to ride rockets into the heavens.\n       America's challenge is to match their bravery and \n     acceptance of risk with specific plans and goals worthy of \n     their commitment.\n       NASA must continue [to be] at the frontiers of human space \n     exploration in order to develop the technology and set the \n     standards of excellence that will enable commercial space \n     ventures to eventually succeed.\n\n  I hope President Obama listens to those words. I hope the President \nlistens to Congress, which has given broad bipartisan support to the \nConstellation Program over many years. And I hope he listens to the \nmillions of Americans who understand that human space flight represents \nour Nation's future, not merely its past.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, President Obama is going to travel to \nFlorida where many expect him to discuss the adverse reaction to his \nproposed budget for NASA and possible alternative options for the \nfuture of America's manned space exploration capability. I know members \nof the NASA family and everyone living in communities that directly \nsupport the space program--from Maryland to Utah to Florida to Alabama \nto Louisiana and Texas--are, at the very least, uncertain about the \nPresident's budget proposal and how it would affect America's \nleadership role in space exploration. I share those concerns. Every \nAmerican should share those concerns, because it will determine our \nrole in science, space, research, exploration, and so much that will \ndetermine our future economically and in security.\n  I hope the President has heard the concerns that have been raised \nsince the budget was proposed and that he will take the opportunity to \nmeet with the individuals who have worked hard to keep America in the \nforefront of space exploration for the last four decades. I also hope \nthe President will recognize that he has an opportunity to reach out on \na truly bipartisan basis for a new plan for NASA's future that \nprioritizes scientific research, protects our $100 billion investment \nin the International Space Station, and ensures that America retains \nindependent human space flight capability.\n  Last month, I introduced legislation that would provide such a \nframework. Identical companion legislation has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representations by Suzanne Kosmas, a Democrat from Florida, \nBill Posey, a Republican from Florida, and others. This can be a \nstarting point for bridging the differences between the President's \nproposal and the views of many in Congress. We may miss this \nopportunity to work together to build on America's legacy of space \nleadership unless the administration looks at its current approach and \nmakes some alterations.\n  The budget proposal put forward by the administration has created an \nunnecessary choice between the President's plans for increased research \nand development and the necessary transition to the next generation of \ntechnology on the one hand and maintaining a viable space station and \nan American human space flight capability over the next few years on \nthe other. We can do both.\n  Let me be clear why I believe the President should make his visit to \nFlorida the beginning of a renewed discussion on the country's civil \nspace program. I believe the President's advisers, in reaching for a \nbold new direction for NASA, failed to take into account some very \nimportant realities of our space program. The decision made in 2004 to \ndiscontinue the shuttle program at the end of 2010 was based on an \nInternational Space Station service end date of 2015. Two years ago \nthis\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\nCongress, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote, enacted the NASA \nauthorization bill of 2008, which stated that the space station should \nbe kept in service until at least the year 2020. In the bill, we also \nrequired NASA to ensure that the capability to continue shuttle flights \nin support of the space station should be preserved for a period of \ntime to give the new administration a chance to consider its plan for \nNASA.\n  The Obama administration ordered a full review of U.S. human space \nflight plans as part of its 2010 budget request and eventually deferred \na final proposal until the 2011 budget request. One of the important \npoints made by the review committee, chaired by the eminently qualified \nNorman Augustine, was that the space station should be extended until \n2020, which is what Congress has already said is the policy of our \ncountry. The President's proposal accepts the recommendation which is \nconsistent with the 2008 bill and which I believe is vital to making \nfull use of the scientific research capacity that is only just now \nbeing made available with the completion of the space station assembly. \nHowever, I remind my colleagues that the space station was designed and \nbuilt with the idea that the shuttle would be available to keep it \nsupplied and maintained, and to be able to bring large replacement or \nspare parts up should they be needed in order to keep the space station \nfunctioning. The parts and equipment being flown on the last three \nremaining shuttle flights were selected from over 1,400 total items \nbased on what would be needed for the station to be extended until \n2015.\n  So while I commend the decision to extend the life of the station \nuntil 2020, flying the remaining shuttles scheduled for this year \nbefore completing an analysis of the station's needs based on a 2020 \nservice date would surely be a mistake. We need to determine the parts \nand equipment needed to extend the station's life and ensure we have \nthe capability to deliver them to the station. If we were to end the \nshuttle program as scheduled this year, we would be dependent on the \nRussian Soyuz vehicle and other possible cargo vehicles which lack the \ncapability that the shuttle provides. Now let me remind all of those \nwho are interested in the cost that using the Soyuz costs over $50 \nmillion per person. Probably a minimum of six per year--well, six over \na 2-year period, so at least three per year--would be about $150 \nmillion a year. This is $150 million that we could be using to extend \nAmerica's capabilities for its crewed vehicle that we have on the \ndrawing boards--the Constellation program. We could be putting that \nmoney to our use rather than paying the Russians for the Soyuz, for \nusing their vehicle. The President's proposal fails to recognize this, \nthereby endangering our ability to sustain the station until 2020. My \nlegislation would address this deficiency by keeping the shuttles as an \noption at a reduced rate of two flights per year, but only until it can \nbe determined that the station has parts and equipment on hand to keep \nfunctioning until 2020 in the absence of the shuttle's capability.\n  The President's proposal also relies on a still emerging commercial \nspace industry to develop the launch and crew-carrying capability to \nreplace the shuttle. I support the development of a commercial \ncapability, but as a supplement to a NASA capability, and with the \ndevelopment--and proving out--of a cargo capability. We should take \nthis first step in commercial development before committing our entire \nnational human space flight effort to launch systems that would be \nanother generation beyond the cargo capabilities currently being \ndeveloped.\n  I remind my colleagues that much of the ``business case'' for a \ncommercial system is based on the assumption of a viable space station. \nIf the risk to station survivability presented by the President's \nproposal is not addressed, the case for investment in a commercial \nsector may weaken and the development of these capabilities may not \neven materialize. If this happens, America would have no long-term \nspace flight capability and would need to rely completely on other \nnations for access to space. If an accident or technical issue results \nin the Russian Soyuz being unavailable for any extended period of time, \nthe space station would very likely have to be abandoned and deorbited \nwithin a matter of months. Taking that level of risk is entirely \nunacceptable for a nation with our history of space leadership.\n  A nation with our heritage of stretching beyond the possible and \nreaching for the heavens deserves more. We need an approach that \nensures the sustainability of the station, facilitates the transition \nto a replacement for the shuttle, and reduces the gap in our Nation's \nability to reach space. My legislation would address these issues by \nallowing for the extension of shuttle if needed for station \nsustainability and authorizing the accelerated development of a NASA-\nowned replacement to the shuttle such as a shuttle-derived design using \nexisting systems and capabilities and the current contractor workforce, \nwhich might be available in time to shorten our reliance on other \nnations for access to space after the shuttle is retired. All of this \ncan be done while allowing for the change in NASA's long-term mission \nand the increase in scientific research and technology funding \nenvisioned in the President's proposal. Simply moving--and this is how \nwe can do it within a budget that does not increase spending--we can \nmove the remaining shuttle flights scheduled for this year into 2011 \nand 2012, and adding the backup flight already prepared as a \ncontingency would provide enough flexibility to complete the analysis \nof station needs and guarantee a cargo capability for an additional 2 \nyears. It is possible to accomplish even this modest but critical goal \nwhile holding the line on spending at the level in the President's \nbudget. That is key, that we can do this within the President's own \nbudget, yet extend our capabilities to have our control over the \nshuttles that would provide the space station what it needs to continue \nas we assess the needs to go on until 2020.\n  The principles necessary to bridge the gap between the President and \nMembers of Congress have been set forward by my legislation that has \nalso been introduced in the House. All that is needed to align these \nprinciples with the President's goals and existing budget realities is \na willingness to make the effort and take the same risks that have been \nhallmarks of our Nation's commitment to space exploration. The \nbipartisan foundation is there to make a cooperative effort.\n  I stand ready to work with the President to bridge the differences \nbetween his budget proposal and the views of many in our Nation and \nmany in Congress that the proposal places too much faith in unproven \nprivate sector alternatives to a NASA-managed replacement for the space \nshuttle and does not address the critical need to ensure the full and \ncomplete utilization and return on the investment in the International \nSpace Station. For the sake of our Nation's space program and future \ngenerations of space pioneers, I hope when the President returns from \nhis trip to Florida, he will accept my invitation to work together on a \ncomprehensive space flight proposal that is worthy of our Nation and \none that I think all of us who have worked on this issue for years--I \nam the ranking member of the Commerce Committee and I have been the \nchairman of the Space Subcommittee. I know we can do this. Senator \nNelson of Florida, Senator LeMieux of Florida know this issue so well. \nWe can do this if the President will work with us to come forward with \na plan that is budget responsible and has the capability to extend our \nshuttles and make sure we utilize the investment we have already made \nin the space station.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2222-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2222-S2224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL REFORM\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak a little bit about one of \nthe major issues which we are about to take up here in the Senate and \nwhich has been discussed at considerable length throughout this \ncountry, and especially here in Washington, over the past 2 years as we \nhave dealt with the financial crisis, and that is the issue of fiscal \nreform and financial reform.\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\n  The country went through a traumatic experience of inordinate \nproportions.\n  We were on the verge in the fall of 2008 of having our entire \nfinancial industry implode, and not only the big financial systems in \nNew York City and around the country, but Main Street America was \nclearly at risk and had the potential to suffer massive damage.\n  That cataclysmic event didn't occur because we as a Congress and the \nadministrations of President Bush and of President Obama took some very \nbold and aggressive action in the way of coming in and stabilizing the \nfinancial industry of this country. As a result, we did not have the \ntype of events that were predicted.\n  Some had said if the financial institutions had been allowed to \nunravel, we would have been into another Depression-like period. One \nformer Secretary of the Treasury projected that unemployment could have \ngone as high as 25 percent. Obviously, we have been through a difficult \ntime. The recession has caused great harm. Americans have been under \ntremendous financial stress. But the damage that might have occurred \nhas been muted to some degree by the actions we took. Now we are at \nleast getting the TARP money back with interest from the banking \nindustry. We are not getting it back from the automobile industry or \nAIG, but from the banking industry we are getting it back with \ninterest, and we are going to actually make money for the American \ntaxpayer, the stockholders in these various entities we had to support.\n  The question remains, how do we avoid this type of event occurring \nagain. That involves a lot of different actions that should be taken, \nbecause the causes of this event were multiple. One of the causes was \nclearly that the Federal Reserve kept interest rates too low for too \nlong and made money too readily available. Another cause was the \nCongress's own decision throughout the 1990s and the early part of this \ndecade to basically promote--and in some instances force--lending for \nthe purpose of buying homes, when the people buying the homes didn't \nhave the wherewithal to support the obligation they were undertaking. \nThe homes in many instances didn't have the value at which they were \nassessed. There was an assumption of appreciation that would occur that \nnever occurred.\n  A third cause was plain, old-fashioned, horrible, and sometimes \nillegal underwriting, where people were essentially putting out loans \nin a totally inappropriate manner. Then those loans were being \nsecuritized. I have described it as an inverted pyramid, where possibly \nthe person who was giving the loan was just interested in the servicing \nfees of making the loan, in the origination fees of making the loan, \nnot in the actual obligations of the loan, and then the loan ending up \nbeing securitized out in the market. You had all sorts of counterparty \nliability and multiple structure built on top of this one loan that \nbasically didn't have either the asset value or the capacity of the \nindividual to pay it back. That was the systemic event that was a \nfunction of bad underwriting.\n  So what can we do to correct this? Well, one thing we can do, \nobviously, is reform our financial structure in this country. It \nclearly wasn't up to the regulatory needs that were necessary, and \nthere was clearly a lot of activity occurring in the financial markets \nthat was wrong and inappropriate. There is this huge discussion going \non now, bills have made their way through the House, and there has been \na proposal from the administration--in outline form at least--and there \nis one from Senator Dodd and specifics that have been brought forward \nin the Banking Committee. There is going to be a major attempt to \nreorganize our financial institutions.\n  I think that as we go down this path we have to be thoughtful and \nconstructive. There is this fervor of populism sweeping across our \nNation on this issue. The fires have been fanned by the White House and \na lot of other people in a very inappropriate way. Populism isn't a \ngood way to try to address something as complex as this type of issue. \nIt is sort of like a beach ball bouncing down the beach that is caught \nup in the wind. That is the way this financial reform effort seems to \nbe going forward. There is not a lot of thought behind it--just a lot \nof energy and talk, with ideas that may be politically attractive but \nin the end will probably do more harm than good.\n  Our goal should be three things: One, we should reform the systems. \nWe need to put into place, to the fullest extent we can, changes in the \nway we regulate the financial structure so we avoid a future systemic \nevent. It is pretty hard to project what the next systemic event will \nbe, but we know what the last one was and we should be able to correct \nthose problems. We can anticipate to some degree what the next events \nmay be, and we should try to do that.\n  Second, we should recognize that we are in a competitive world, and \nthat what we do in the United States to structure our financial system \nis going to determine whether the United States remains competitive \nwith other nations that have sophisticated financial systems. It is \nvery important that in doing this we not push offshore American jobs \nand American capital, because it becomes too onerous to manage capital \nand create jobs in the United States in the financial sector. We, in \nfact, should have as one of our goals--the first goal being addressing \nthe system's risk--the desire to make America the best place in the \nworld and the soundest place in the world to create capital and credit, \nso that the engine that drives our economy--remember, our economy is \ndriven not by the government. I know the President says the more you \ngrow government, the more prosperity you get, and he is certainly \ntrying to prove it, but that is not what drives our economy. What \ndrives our economy is entrepreneurs, people willing to take risks, the \ninitiatives by Americans to create jobs. You cannot do that unless you \nhave credit, and you cannot do it unless you can get capital.\n  One of the great geniuses of our system, which has made us more \ncompetitive than the rest of the world, is that we have always been a \nplace where capital and credit have been readily available to \nresponsible people and risk-takers. We need to keep that atmosphere. \nWhen we are finished with this process, we should have a regulatory \nregime that addresses the issue of systemic risk and at the same time \nsays to the world: bring your capital here; this is the best place to \nmake a loan and underwrite entrepreneurial spirit.\n  Third--and this is tied to the second--we need to remember this is \nabout Main Street, about making sure that on Main Street in America \npeople have the wherewithal to take that risk, and to get that job, and \nto buy that house, but that they have it in a context of a sound \nbanking system, one that is a supportive and strong one, and a sound \nfinancial system--not one that has been forced to retract as a result \nof excessive regulations being put on it here in Washington.\n  If we approach this in a thoughtful way, a pragmatic and constructive \nway, rather than this populist fervor, where we say everybody on Wall \nStreet is evil, and everybody in banking is evil, and everybody who \nmakes loans is evil--which seems to be the philosophy or theme around \nhere--if we take a more constructive and thoughtful way, we will \nactually end up with a much stronger and better nation. Often these \nperiods of populist fervor--and we have had a lot of them--Huey Long, \nWilliam Jennings Bryan--the list is long. Those folks usually end up \ncutting off their nose to spite their face. These ideas sound good and \nhave a nice jingoistic ring to them, but in the end it undermines the \nability to do the basic purpose, which is to make America more \nprosperous and create more opportunity for Americans and create more \njobs.\n  This is not an issue that needs to be partisan. We have a lot of big, \ncomplex questions here to address. With the exception of one, as far as \nI can tell, none of them has any partisan flavor to them of any \nsignificance. First, of course, is what do you do about ``too big to \nfail.'' First, it should not exist. There should be no business in this \ncountry that is too big to fail. Basically, any company, any business \nthat makes bad decisions should not have some implied guarantee that it \nis going to be bailed out by the Federal Government or the American \ntaxpayer. If you make a bad decision and put your financial house at \nrisk, your stockholders should pay the price; your secured bondholders \nshould pay the price,\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\nnot the American taxpayers. I think there is agreement on that.\n  On our side of the aisle we have some good ideas on how you end ``too \nbig to fail.'' As a practical matter, they are better ideas than have \nbeen put out by anybody else so far. But they are not partisan ideas. \nThey are just good, sound policies as to how you accomplish this. It \ncould be done. The best ideas have been put forward in a bipartisan \nway, by Senator Warner from Virginia and Senator Corker from Tennessee. \nThat is the first issue. We should be able to reach a comprehensive \nagreement on that.\n  Second, of course, is how do you manage risk and structure our \nregulatory regime so they can see that risk coming and take action. I \nthink there is consensus on both sides of the aisle. Basically, you set \nup some sort of risk council, where you bring key regulators in and \nmake sure there is communication, you try to end the stovepipes, and \nyou try to cross-fertilize the information, and you don't allow \narbitraging regulators so people don't go out and hire the cheapest or \nweakest regulator. There is not much difference of opinion on that. We \ncan reach agreement on that.\n  Third, of course--which is huge here--is the question of derivatives, \nwhich are very complex. There is no simple answer to this question, on \nthis issue, when you look at the detailed language. What is the purpose \nof derivatives? It is to basically give the market liquidity, to make \nsure you have the ability to put out the credit, to make sure that when \nsome business in America needs to protect itself from a downside risk \nit sees coming at it, it has the capacity to buy that type of \nprotection in the market, that type of insurance. They are extremely \nimportant instruments for the purpose of basically being the insurance \nand the oil that makes the American machinery of entrepreneurship and \njob creation work. Big companies and smaller companies need them, but \nespecially big companies need these instruments. They need to have them \nreadily available in a way and in a form that makes them usable.\n  I have been working with Senator Reed from Rhode Island for a number \nof months on almost all the technical issues of how to make the \nderivatives market stronger, better, and more sound, basically get more \nliquidity and transparency. On almost all issues we have a pretty good \nagreement and sense of where we can go. If we continue to work on it, \nhopefully, we can reach a complete agreement. We do have an issue on \nthe question of mandated exchange treatment of derivatives, which I \nthink can be resolved--I hope. It is not a partisan question. It is a \nquestion of how you do it best. That is the approach we should take.\n  Last is the issue of regulatory structure. Who should regulate what? \nThat is a question of how best you line up the regulators to make sure \nthere isn't regulatory arbitrage where people try to shop for the best \nregulator. I strongly believe the Fed needs to be a major player in the \nregulatory structure. The Fed has shown itself to have the depth and \nprofessionalism and the resources to regulate effectively. I hope we \nwould end up with a structure that would recognize that fact. I think \nthere is general agreement on structure that can be reached here. \nAgain, I think we can reach an understanding.\n  The issue where we have significant differences is consumer \nprotection and how you deal with that. On our side, most of the folks \nstrongly believe you cannot separate consumer protection from safety \nand soundness. The regulators who have the responsibility for safety \nand soundness should have the responsibility for consumer protection, \nand it should be at the same level so there is no question that the \nconsumer receives the same type of attention and support that the \nregulators put into trying to make sure the banks the consumers get \ntheir loans from are safe and sound. When you separate the two and set \nup a freestanding, autonomous consumer agency, you create significant \nissues on safety and soundness. The purpose is to make our financial \nsystem stronger, not weaker. A separate independent consumer agency \nwith potentially a political agenda or social justice agenda, which has \nnothing to do with safety or soundness, could easily undermine safety \nand soundness of the banking industry, especially the community banks--\nremember, these are the folks on Main Street--essentially creating an \natmosphere where loans have to be made to people not based on safety \nand soundness but based on a social or political agenda of whoever runs \nthe consumer agency that is independent and autonomous. It makes no \nsense. But, again, this is an issue that can be resolved.\n\n  There have been good ideas put forward by Senator Shelby. At one \ntime, we almost had an understanding between Senator Shelby and Senator \nReid on this issue. So this is no reason, in my opinion, to stop the \nprogress on getting a bipartisan, comprehensive bill. The only thing \nthat stands between us getting a bipartisan, comprehensive bill, \nstopping that progress, is this political issue; the fact that the \nadministration has two paths it can take. It can take the path where we \nreach a comprehensive, thoughtful, constructive bill that basically \ndoes what we need to do in the area of protecting the financial \nstructure of this country from systemic risk and make sure we have the \nmost competitive financial markets in the world and protect Main Street \nand make Main Street viable, allow people to get loans on Main Street, \nit can pursue a bill such as that or it can pursue a political bill, \ncarrying the banner of populism forward on the theory that somehow they \nwin points by doing that.\n  They may win short-term political points. I don't think they do, \nactually. But in the long term, the effect that will have on our \ncapacity to produce credit in this country for Americans who need \ncredit in order to do things such as buy houses, send their kids to \ncolleges, or basically just start a business and create jobs, it will \nbe dramatically chilling, to be kind.\n  We will see a lot of the institutions which compete in this Nation \nhaving to go overseas. We will see a lot of companies that need to use \nderivatives in order to make their products salable and make sure they \nare not hit with unexpected cost increases or events which are out of \ntheir control unable to buy those instruments or obtain those \ninstruments in the United States, so they will have to go overseas. We \nwill see credit markets where consumers will end up paying higher \ninterest rates because they are basically paying for people who are not \npaying back their loans at a much higher rate, so the good performers \nend up paying for the bad performers, which inevitably ends up costing \nthe good performers much more in the way of their credit.\n  These are the results of a populist tact, and they are not good \nresults, in my opinion. They are not constructive. They are so \nunnecessary because we really have within our grasp the capacity to \nreach an agreement, pretty much across the board, on all the major \nissues that affect the question of financial stability and to try to \naddress what happened in late 2008 in a constructive way.\n  I am hopeful that will be the course that is taken, that we do have a \nconsensus approach rather than a confrontational approach, and that we \ndo have an approach which understands that our first obligation is not \nto get votes, not to win a political fight, not to have a jingoistic \nsaying that resonates at election time but, rather, to make America \nstronger, more economically sound, more vibrant, and a place where when \none wants to create a job, one has the capacity to get the credit to do \nit. That should be our goal. I hope we will pursue this regulatory \nreform effort in that manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer would well \nunderstand from his own experience, West Virginia is mourning the loss \nof 29 brave miners who died last week--most of whom never knew what hit \nthem--when a devastating explosion tore\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\nthrough the Upper Big Branch Mine in Montcoal, WV. It has brought the \nwhole State to a dead halt. Even though it may never be possible to \nfully grasp the magnitude of this tragedy or to ease the pain of this \ndevastating loss, we in West Virginia believe strongly in the power of \nprayer and in the grace of God. That has been important this week and \nwill be in the weeks to come. We hold onto it--that feeling--and we \noffer it to one another and to the families, friends, and fellow miners \nwho are grieving.\n  We revere our miners--the men and women who put their lives on the \nline every single day to provide for their families and bring light and \nheat to millions. They live in obscurity. They work underground. Nobody \nknows much about it around the rest of the country, but it is heroic \nliving, and they make this country work.\n  We offer a heartfelt thanks to the rescue workers who risked their \nown lives. Our rescue teams, and the entire West Virginia community, \nnever gave up hope and continued to forge ahead in their mission. They \nknow and understand when they volunteer for this dangerous work that at \nsome point in time they will be called upon to put their own lives on \nthe line in the mine. That is what a rescue worker is all about--\npushing the edges. How much methane is there, how far can you get in, \nhow much dust is there, what can you see, does he or she have enough \noxygen? They did so selflessly and fearlessly, and they have, as you \ncan imagine, my deepest respect.\n  Even in one of our darkest hours, America has seen the very best of \nWest Virginia--binding together, drawing solace from each other with \ntears and with mutual love. This is who we are. This is Appalachia. It \nis the sense of oneness, always against so many odds. The odds are \nalways stacked against us. Maybe that is why I am so proud to represent \nthem--always fighting uphill, others not knowing much about you, not \nnecessarily paying a lot of attention to you but strong, good people. \nSo it is this sense of oneness that sets us apart, in my mind, and why \nI am so proud to be a West Virginian.\n  We are all too familiar with this agony. I know the Presiding Officer \nis. We have been here before--with Sago, with Aracoma. When our worst \nfears are realized, as they were in this terrible tragedy, we know we \nmust find a way through the searing pain and the loss because that is \nthe way it is in our Appalachia--central Appalachia.\n  Everybody understands that mining has always been risky, but it can \nbe made safer by people who want to make it safer. That will often \nstart with the person who is in charge of the company. Safety is about \na company doing the right thing. Safety is also about the State and \nFederal Government stepping in and toughening up our laws where that \nneeds to be done. It is about providing the resources and the people to \nenforce those laws.\n  Let me give an example. Currently, the Federal Mine Safety and Health \nReview Commission has 14 administrative law judges. If this year's \nbudget request is enacted, they will have 18. They will go from 14 to \n18. Those 18--and right now those 14--administrative law judges, \ntogether, face a backlog of more than 16,000 cases, containing 82,000 \nviolations. That is incomprehensible to me. It is ridiculous, but it is \ntrue and it is unacceptable.\n  In the aftermath of Sago, I was proud to coauthor the MINER Act, \nalong with Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Mike Enzi from \nWyoming. This was, in fact, the only significant Federal mine \nlegislation since 1977, which meant that we had gone 30 years without \npassing significant mine safety legislation. That doesn't tell the \nwhole story, but it certainly tells some part of the story.\n  The bill was not perfect, but it did tackle the core problems we \nfaced at Sago, which was a different kind of mine. It was a very rural \nmine, a much smaller mine than this huge mine in Raleigh County, WV. \nBecause of this bill, we now require that mines have flame-resistant \nlifelines to guide miners out in an emergency. If you have an \nexplosion. There is dust everywhere. You cannot see anything. So you \nput in sort of like a handrail, and you hold on to it and you just \nfollow that because you cannot see where you are going. That will lead \nyou to the mine mouth or perhaps to an elevator, if it is still \nworking, that will allow you to get out.\n\n  We require refuge chambers that are now located in mines to protect \nminers if they cannot evacuate. Those are safe havens that have oxygen \nand food. There are stores of breathing devices along the escape \nroutes--part of the law now.\n  We have new flammability requirements for new belt equipment. I know \nthat is mining jargon, but I lay it before the Senate. Yet despite \nthese important improvements, we mourn now another disaster of a very \ndifferent kind. More lives were lost. We ask: How can this be? Again?\n  Everything we know at this time tells us this accident did not have \nto happen. This explosion could have and should have been prevented. If \nyou are asked by a coal miner: Does an explosion have to happen? The \nanswer is, no; it is preventable. Yes, that is easy to say and hard to \ndo. But in the real world of serious work in mine safety, it is \npreventable. Miners do not have to lose their lives.\n  So our responsibility now is to learn from this new and terrible \nincident. We have to look at it carefully. We cannot rush to judgment. \nI am going to explain a couple of things that are being done. We do not \nknow exactly what went wrong at Upper Big Branch mine but I promise you \nwe will demand answers, and we will get answers.\n  MSHA, which is the Mine Health and Safety Administration, will \nconduct a complete investigation into this tragedy, and that will tell \nus a lot. The agency's quick response and leadership after this \nexplosion has been, in my judgment, highly commendable.\n  Right now, what we do know is we need to enforce aggressively the \nprovisions of the MINER Act that we passed several years ago in 2006 at \nall mines. Where they are needed, we must put new laws in place, \nunderstanding that mine operations are different. Some mines try to do \nthe right thing, others try less hard. It is a hard job.\n  I am concerned that the enforcement process today moves much too \nslowly, and that hurts the good operators as well as helping the bad \nones, even when the circumstances demand the most urgent response.\n  Today, mine safety operators can stop operations in a mine or part of \na mine whenever they see imminently dangerous violations. That is in \nthe eye of the beholder, of the inspector, which means they have to be \ngood people and well trained.\n  Once the operator has addressed that problem, then there is no longer \na violation and mining can continue. But these inspectors also look for \na very interesting phenomena called ``patterns of violations.'' For \nthat they have to look back over the last several years in a particular \nmine or a particular part of a mine to find out if there has been a \npattern of violation, which, in and of itself, might not rise to the \nlevel of imminent danger, but could indicate that the mine needs to \nimprove its safety.\n  If they find a pattern, these Federal inspectors, they should be able \nto impose higher fines. If it is not corrected, they should be able to, \nas they are now, shut down a mine or just part of a mine where there is \na particular problem. This mine where the explosion occurred was huge. \nIt had numerous double-digit entrances into different parts of the \nmine. It was huge.\n  But, anyway, closing down a mine or part of a mine does not always \nwork that way because companies have found a loophole in this part of \nthe law, the part dealing with so-called ``patterns of violations.'' \nThey just keep contesting and appealing. They appeal and they appeal \nright on up to Federal court. They appeal the decisions to prevent the \nfinding of a pattern. That is why they do it. If you do not want \nsomething to happen, if you do not want to pay a fine, you have been \ncited for a violation, you have been cited for a fine. But if you \nappeal it, if you appeal it long and keep appealing, then, if you get a \njudgment against you, you go to the next court higher up, you do not \nhave to either pay a fine or change the way you operate.\n  The number of appeals has increased dramatically from just 6 percent \nof total violations in 2005 to 27 percent last year. With such a \ntremendous backlog of cases and limited manpower, the average appeal \ntook 587 days to finalize last year, which is bad for everybody. Some \noperators have\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\ntaken advantage of this loophole, preventing government action and \nimposing a serious risk to the miners' safety.\n  West Virginians can rest assured that I plan to press this issue \naggressively. We are already taking steps to get to the bottom of this. \nI am glad that President Obama has been involved, and he has called a \nlot of folks, including miners' families. He has requested a full \nreport to him on what Federal investigators have learned about the \ndisaster, and it is going to happen this week.\n  Now, maybe that is too early. They may not know everything yet. But \nhe wants to be kept abreast of what is happening. I have asked, and \nothers, for a full briefing on the findings for West Virginia's \nCongressional Delegation. I decided that was not selfish; I decided \nthat was the right thing to do. I want to know what the President \nknows, and that is going to happen.\n  I have requested that MSHA conduct a top-to-bottom review of all mine \nsafety violations all across the country so that we can get a sense of \nperspective of where we are in this mine and others in other States. \nAnd I have also requested hearings and oversight investigations from \nthe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. They \nwere kind enough to allow me to sit with them during the hearings \nregarding the MINER Act so that I could contribute what I know.\n  In closing, I wish to say our coal miners have lost too many brothers \nand too many sisters. Coal mining has always been dangerous, and it is \na common story in West Virginia--southern West Virginia particularly--\nwhich is where I first went, where there is so much coal mining that \nmothers do not want their sons to go into coal mining. But there they \nare living up a hollow, up a creek. No other work is available, and \nthey can get paid $60 to $70,000 for doing this job after some \ntraining.\n  What are they meant to do? What if it is a mine which does not have \nany kind of representation which allows people to tell somebody in \nauthority that something is not being done safely?\n  Well, we have mines where the operators use intimidation. If somebody \ntries to do something like that, they are out of a job. There are all \nkinds of ways to do that. And while we all know their journey is a \ndangerous one, our coal miners must know that everything is being done \nto keep them safe. That is why I am standing here, simply to say that.\n  We have a solemn, urgent and, I think, sacred obligation in Congress \nto find the truth, do it fairly and carefully, and take action in their \nhonor. These men have given us all they can, and we must honor this \nsacrifice.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now on the temporary extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits. This bill will help millions of \nAmericans who are struggling to feed their families, struggling to pay \nthe bills.\n  Take, for example, a single father from Missoula, MT. He has been out \nof work for weeks. He exhausted his State benefits, and he is now \nreceiving Federal extended benefits. He called the Montana Unemployment \nInsurance Claims Processing Center, and he said if his unemployment \ninsurance benefits are not extended, he does not know how in the world \nhe is going to take care of his daughters. He continues to search for a \njob. But for now, unemployment insurance benefits are the lifeline for \nhim and for his family.\n  Unemployment benefits help him to pay the bills for his daughters. \nUnemployment benefits help the single dad from Missoula and also help \nmillions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, have fallen \nvictim to this Great Recession.\n  As we meet today, benefits have lapsed for 200,000 Americans. Another \n200,000 Americans could lose their benefits, too, if we do not pass \nthis bill this week.\n  Unemployment benefits help our unemployed neighbors. In helping our \nneighbors, we also help to keep open the neighborhood grocery store and \nthe neighborhood gas station. In helping our unemployed neighbors, we \nalso help to keep houses out of foreclosure. In helping our unemployed \nneighbors, we also help the economy.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that extending \nadditional unemployment benefits would have one of the largest effects \non economic output and unemployment per dollar spent of any option. The \nCBO chart behind me tells us how effective increasing aid to the \nunemployed can be.\n  The CBO analyzed the effectiveness of a number of job creation \nproposals. For each policy, the CBO estimated the number of jobs \ncreated for each dollar of budgetary cost. You will see on the chart \nbehind me, there are 11 policies the CBO analyzed. Increasing aid to \nthe unemployed is ranked first. It is No. 1, at the top of the chart. \nYou can see it with the blue line. Among all these policies, increasing \naid to the unemployed is the most effective. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says it will create the most jobs per dollar of budgetary cost. \nIt is the most efficient and creates more jobs. Other policy options \nare much less cost effective.\n  CBO also says each dollar spent increasing aid to the unemployed \ncould increase the gross domestic product by up to $1.90. That is \nalmost double per dollar spent. Why is increasing aid to the unemployed \nso effective? Let's ask ourselves that question. Well, households \nreceiving unemployment benefits spend their benefits right away. They \nhave to. They are spent. That spurs demand for goods, demand for \nservices. That boosts production, and that leads businesses to hire \nmore employees.\n  Unemployment benefits are essential to bridging the gap between \nlosing one job and finding another, and it has become increasingly \ndifficult to find that next job. In February, there were 2.7 million \njob openings. In the same month, there were 15 million Americans out of \nwork. That means there are about five and one-half job seekers for \nevery job opening--over five.\n  It is no wonder it is hard for people who are unemployed to find \njobs. This chart behind me tells the story. Prior to the Great \nRecession, there were fewer than two job seekers for every open \nposition. Now there are five and one-half. Let me repeat that. Prior to \nthe Great Recession--you can see it on this chart with the red line \nover to the left--there were fewer than two job seekers for every job \nthat was open, every position that was open. That was back in December \n2007. Now, if you look at the red line that goes to the right, there \nare five and one-half.\n  It is important we extend unemployment benefits. We need to bridge \nthat\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\ngap between jobs. Getting unemployment benefits is not living high on \nthe hog by any stretch of the imagination. The average unemployment \nbenefit is $335 a week. The average cost of a loaf of bread is $2.97. \nThe average cost of a gallon of milk is $2.72. Diapers for just one \nbaby can cost up to $85 a month. These days, $335 only stretches so \nfar.\n  We need to keep our unemployed neighbors from falling into poverty. \nWe need to figure out how best to create new jobs for unemployed \nworkers. One way we could do that is to help foster job growth, and \nthat is by using the unemployment insurance program to create the right \nconditions for job creation. In that vein, I am holding a hearing in \nthe Finance Committee tomorrow to explore ways to use the unemployment \ninsurance system to help Americans get back to work. Let's reform this \nsystem. Let's modernize it. Let's make it work better.\n  States and experts have great ideas for how we can improve the \nunemployment insurance system. They have ideas about how it can save \nand create more jobs. For example, some States are creating new jobs \nthrough subsidy programs. Montana has a job subsidy program and has put \nhundreds of people back to work. Using funds from the Recovery Act, \nthis program helps employers to pay for the cost of creating new jobs. \nAcross the country, thousands of people are benefiting from job subsidy \nprograms.\n  But right now, it is essential we pass a temporary extension of \nunemployment benefits. It is essential we help Americans put food on \nthe table. It is essential to pay the bills while they continue to look \nfor work. It is essential for people such as Jeremy from Flathead \nCounty, MT.\n  Jeremy is a wildland firefighter. He is receiving unemployment \nbenefits for the first time in his life. Fighting wildfires is seasonal \nwork. Typically, Jeremy can find another job during the off-season, but \nthis year he has been unable to find employment. Jeremy's benefits \nlapsed on February 28. That is when Congress failed to extend \nunemployment benefits. Jeremy has been left hanging. It is not right to \nleave Americans in this position.\n  So let us extend unemployment insurance benefits for Jeremy the \nfirefighter. Let us extend this vital lifeline for this single dad from \nMissoula and for his daughters who depend on him. Let us enact this \ntemporary extension of unemployment insurance without delay.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill that \nis currently before the Senate which would provide for a temporary \nextension of unemployment benefits, COBRA coverage, and prevent a \nsevere cut to provider reimbursements under Medicare. The bill would \nalso extend the National Flood Insurance Program, which expired on \nMarch 28 at midnight. Each of these provisions is important in its own \nright, and each will help our economy to move forward.\n  The long-term unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of \npeople in the workforce who have been out of work for more than 6 \nmonths and are still looking for jobs. That rate reached 4.3 percent of \nthe workforce in March; that is, 4.3 percent are out of work for 6 \nmonths and cannot find employment. Our Nation's overall unemployment \nrate is still at 10 percent.\n  Maryland's unemployment rate continues to rise, reaching 8.3 percent \nin February statewide, up from 7 percent in February 2009. In 11 of our \ncounties, nearly one-half of the counties in Maryland, the unemployment \nrate exceeds the national rate. In Baltimore City, it is 11.2 percent. \nIn Dorchester County, it is 12.9. In Worcester County, it is an \nastonishing 18.8 percent--more than double the statewide percentage. In \nthese counties, the situation is urgent. We must act to help keep these \nfamilies' heads above water. Each of the thousands of families who \ndepend upon extended unemployment benefits needs our help. In Maryland, \nit is 16,000 families. They need our help in order to be able to feed \ntheir families, pay the rent and utilities on their homes, and to keep \ntheir houses literally out of foreclosure.\n  I hear from heads of households every day who are trying to find \nwork, but the jobs just aren't there. In fact, the Labor Department \nstatistics tell us that for every job opening, there are five \nindividuals actively seeking employment. Those odds are not very good \nfor somebody who is trying to find employment today. That is why we \nhave the long-term unemployment and why we need to extend the benefits \nto those who are in need today. We are emerging from the most severe \nand prolonged economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n  For those of my colleagues who are insisting that the unemployment \ncompensation extension be paid for, I point out that for every dollar \nwe spend in unemployment compensation, we are generating more than \n$1.50 back into our economy. In other words, this is a stimulus. This \nhelps job growth. When people have unemployment insurance, they spend \nit immediately. It helps our retail establishments, our food stores, \nand our economy. It is the definition of stimulus spending, and it is \nimmediate.\n  I also add that it is not a handout. Employment insurance is just \nthat--an insurance program. It is an insurance program to which \nemployers and employees contribute so that in difficult times such as \nthese, they can receive benefits. We are in these times now. That is \nwhy we paid the unemployment insurance benefits taxes. These funds \nshould now be available to help the people who need it.\n  Equally essential are COBRA benefits, which allow people who lose \ntheir jobs to continue health insurance coverage for themselves and \ntheir families. I cannot tell you the number of people who are shocked \nwhen they lose their jobs and go to pay for their COBRA and find out it \nis prohibitive and they cannot afford it. They cannot afford to \ncontinue their health insurance protection in the most critical time of \ntheir lives. That is why Congress passed help for people during this \neconomic time with their COBRA protection. But that has expired. We \nneed to extend that so families can continue to maintain their health \ninsurance. The extension of COBRA benefits will allow us to get \naffordable health care to those who are in the most desperate need.\n  I want to mention the expiration of the National Flood Insurance \nProgram. In my State, over 60,000 homes are covered by the National \nFlood Insurance Program, and half of those are on Maryland's Eastern \nShore. This program was authorized, but it expired on March 28, 2010. \nSince then, no new policies have been issued, no policies have been \nrenewed, and there has been no increased coverage on existing policies \nthat could be issued. So Marylanders who wish to purchase a home in a \nflood plain cannot do so during this period.\n  We need to act now. We literally have frozen the market, which is not \ngood for our economy, for our families, and it is certainly something \nwe need to correct. The bill before us will retroactively make up for \nthe past 2 weeks, but we need to act quickly in order that this \nimportant program continues.\n  Finally, I wish to stress the urgency of fixing the Medicare \nphysician reimbursement, an area on which I have worked for many years \nto try to repeal the flawed sustainable growth rate payment system that \nmakes no sense. As of April 1, there is a 21.2-percent across-the-board \ncut in Medicare reimbursement for physicians and other providers who \nare paid according to the fee schedule--physical, occupational, and \nspeech language therapists, nurse practitioners, and others. The \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services is holding claims until \nWednesday, April 14. At that time, claims will be paid at the lower \nreimbursement rate. We must stop that from happening.\n  Today, my office received nearly a dozen calls from constituents who \nwere told by their doctors that they are not accepting new Medicare \npatients at this time. This is no longer a hypothetical; there is a \ndenial of access to care. Seniors are being made to suffer because of \nobstructionism in this body of not allowing this bill to move forward \nin a prompt way.\n  I come to the floor today to urge immediate passage of this \nlegislation and\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\nurge my colleagues to work together to pass a long-term extension of \nthese essential benefits. Ensuring that American families are able to \nweather this economic storm should not be a partisan issue. We need to \nwork together to debate the merits of this bill and provide the \nAmerican people with the help they need and the economy with the boost \nit needs while we are working on long-term recovery of our Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

Res. 13 (111th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2010.\n       (c) Emergency Designation for Statutory PAYGO.--This Act, \n     with the exception of section 4, is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 4(g) of the \n     Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139; 2 \n     U.S.C. 933(g)).\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on March 10, the Senate passed a bill to \nextend unemployment insurance and a number of other provisions through \nthe end of this year. We are currently working with the House of \nRepresentatives to agree on a package of offsets for a portion of that \nbill.\n  In the meantime, Congress needs to act on the pending bill to ensure \nthat Americans can receive their much needed unemployment benefits. \nThis bill would extend benefits to the end of this month.\n  My amendment, which I just offered, will extend the programs in the \nbill before us today for one more month, until the end of May. Why? \nWhat is the purpose of this? The answer is that this further short-term \nextension would ensure that Congress has enough time to resolve its \ndifferences over the long-term extension.\n  It is now April 13. The end of the month is not too long away. It is \nnot sufficient time to work out an agreement with the relevant Senators \non both sides of the aisle as to how to pay for this and what portions \nof the unemployment/COBRA bill. It is going to take a little more time \nthan 2 weeks. This amendment will extend the unemployment benefits and \nall the provisions in the current bill for one more month to give us \ntime to work out a solid understanding so that in the end we can pass \nthe bigger, longer term extenders bill, which would extend the tax \nprovisions, as well as the SGR, COBRA, UI, FMAP, and other provisions \nuntil the end of the calendar year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we invoked cloture last evening on a \nmotion to proceed to legislation that will extend unemployment benefits \nduring what has been the deepest recession since the Great Depression. \nWe have had objections from the other side to extending unemployment \nbenefits as an emergency, saying these cannot be extended because they \nwill cost too much and add to the deficit and this and that.\n  It is interesting to me that in this country, when our country has \nexperienced an economic downturn, we have always dealt on an emergency \nbasis with the most vulnerable Americans by extending unemployment \ninsurance benefits. Why? For two reasons. No. 1, when you work for a \nliving in this country, you actually pay premiums for an unemployment \ninsurance plan that then kicks in when you lose your job. This is not \nas if somebody is getting something for nothing. People who are working \nin this country are actually paying into a plan that provides for \nunemployment insurance. And, No. 2, extending unemployment insurance \nduring a severe economic downturn is just the right thing to do for the \nmost vulnerable Americans.\n  I find it interesting that the very people who have been standing in \nthe way of doing this, saying it is the Federal budget deficits, that \nthey are too big--I agree they are too big. But I have not seen any of \nthese folks out here when it really matters. This is taking on the most \nvulnerable Americans. They are out here taking on that issue.\n  How about the big issues? How about fighting a war and not paying for \none penny of it over a 10-year period? In the 8 years of the previous \nadministration, we went to war, and we were told by President George W. \nBush: You are not going to pay for a penny of this; and if you try to \npay for it, I will veto the bill. It is all going to be emergency \nspending. The fact is, we should have seen the same folks out here \ncomplaining about that issue.\n  Or how about going back 10 or 11 years when legislation was passed \nthat built these huge corporate financial pyramids that got engaged in \nall kinds of unbelievable risky speculation and ran the country into \nthe economic ditch and caused $15 trillion of American wealth to vanish \nand cause these unbelievable increases in deficits? I did not see them \nout here on that issue either. In fact, many of them voted for the \nlegislation that repealed the protections that were put in place after \nthe Great Depression and actually allowed to happen what has happened \nin the last 10 years that caused this collapse.\n  I don't know. It seems to me this last stand on the budget deficit, \nto say let's have the last stand when it comes to the most vulnerable \nAmericans, that is our last stand--how about a last stand, for example, \non some of the affluent Americans? How about a last stand on carried \ninterest? I encourage my colleagues who have been out here worried \nabout the budget deficit to come out here while I am here and talk \nabout changing the carried interest rules.\n  What does that mean? It sounds like a foreign language to some. It \nmeans some in this country are earning more income than anybody in \nAmerica and paying the lowest income tax rates. Why is that the case? \nThat is what the law allows them to do. We have been trying to change \nthe law, but some of my colleagues do not want to change the law. That \nwould be increasing taxes.\n  Let me give an example of increasing taxes. How about increasing \ntaxes on a person who made $3.6 billion in a year--which, by the way, \nis about $10 million a day--and pays 15 percent income taxes? How about \nif we say to that person and others like him or her: How about you pay \nthe same kind of taxes everybody else in this country pays? That will \nreduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  I ask my colleagues, do you want to join me to do that? I am all for \nreducing the Federal budget deficit. Tighten our belts, reduce \nspending--I am all for that. But, also, how about asking people to pay \ntheir fair share of taxes?\n  I said yesterday, as I said before, that we have some of the biggest \nfinancial institutions in this country that in the last decade decided \nto buy sewer systems from foreign cities in order to avoid paying U.S. \ntaxes. How about let's make sure we close all loopholes, such as that \nloophole, that say: You want all the benefits America has to offer? How \nabout paying the taxes and being responsible as an American citizen for \nthings that you are required to do?\n  If we want to reduce the Federal budget deficit let's take some real \nbig hunks at doing that by, yes, reducing some spending, and there is \nplenty of waste. I chaired 20 hearings on the biggest waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the history of this country; that is, the contracting in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. I will not go through it in detail today. I am telling \nyou, it is the biggest waste in American history in these contracts.\n  Let's cut some of that spending. Let's raise some taxes on those who \nare not paying their fair share, those who are doing everything they \ncan to avoid paying taxes in this country. Let's cut the deficit, but \nlet's not come out here and pretend that the last stand is to take on \nthe most vulnerable Americans at a time when we should extend \nunemployment insurance. That makes no sense.\n  Mr. President, if you know much about economics, you understand \nduring a steep economic downturn there is substantially less revenue \ncoming into the Federal Government. We have lost something like $400 \nbillion a year in revenue. At exactly the same time when we have a \nsteep economic downturn, the economic stabilizers kick in--unemployment \ninsurance, food stamps, and other programs for people who have been \nlaid off, out of work, in trouble. That is exactly what we do during\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\nan economic downturn. We have less revenue and more spending. That is \ntemporary because the minute we come out of this and restore economic \nhealth, then we do the things necessary to get rid of those budget \ndeficits and put the country back on track to a better course.\n  I don't know, this has been a Byzantine circumstance to see who comes \nto the floor of the Senate and say: You know what. Now we are going to \nmake our last stand, and it is going to be when you want to give some \nunemployment insurance to the most vulnerable Americans, those who have \nlost their jobs.\n  Someplace in this country, all around the country today, about 17 \nmillion people or so woke up jobless. They have lost their jobs. They \ndo not have work. They got dressed and went out with some hope in their \nhearts that maybe they could find a job. But tonight will come and they \nwill not have found a job. The question they ask is, Am I going to get \nthe funding I was told would exist, for which I paid insurance premiums \nfor unemployment insurance? Am I going to get that help during this \nperiod of time? This was not my fault. I was laid off because of a very \nsteep economic recession.\n  The answer should be from this Congress: Yes, you are going to get \nthat help. We understand the obligation and the need to do that during \nthis economic recession.\n  My hope is we will get a little cooperation and see if we can do \nthat. Again, I am very interested in tackling this Federal budget \ndeficit. Let's tackle it in big ways in the areas where substantial \nadditional revenue that should come in is now not coming in because \npeople are avoiding paying their taxes, some of those who are the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  Let's also tighten our belt and cut spending in areas I just \ndescribed. Let's not decide the last stand is to take on the most \nvulnerable Americans who woke up this morning jobless and, in some \ncases, hopeless and helpless if they do not have money to buy food, pay \nrent, and buy medicine.\n  We can do better than that. There is a moral imperative for this \nCongress to at long last do the right thing.\n  I did not come to the floor to say that, but because that is the \nbusiness of the day, I wanted to, on behalf of Senator Baucus and \nSenator Reid and others, say that we have an obligation, and we are \ntrying to work through this issue.\n  Last night by one vote we were able to invoke cloture with almost no \nhelp--we got a little help to get cloture invoked. Now we will get on \nwith the business of seeing if we can, during a very deep economic \ndownturn, extend unemployment insurance as we are required to do and as \nwe have an obligation to do.\n  I hope the answer is yes. That is our responsibility. That is our \nobligation. If there are those who come to the floor later wanting to \njoin me in dealing with the issues I just described--spending cuts, \nrevenue increases from those who are not paying their fair share, some \nof the biggest financial companies in the country--let's join and do \nthat. I am here and very happy to do it.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, there are many things on the agenda for this country \nthat need doing. We are trying to work through this list. We worked on \na health care reform bill that I understand was very controversial. The \nfact is, health care is such a significant part of our economy and the \ncosts are growing so rapidly that we have to try to address it, and we \ndid.\n  There is another issue, however, that I want to talk about today, and \nthat is the issue of energy. We do not think much about energy because \nit becomes kind of second nature to the way we live. We get up in the \nmorning and the first thing we do is turn off an electric alarm clock, \nperhaps, and then flick a switch and lights go on. We do almost \neverything without thinking, and that reflects on our use of energy. \nSomeone makes coffee. They turn on a stove to make coffee or plug in a \ntoaster to make toast. They get in their car to drive to work, perhaps \ntake a shower beforehand with hot water from a hot water heater. All of \nthose, even before they get started, reflect the prodigious use of \nenergy in our country.\n  Almost two-thirds of the oil that we use in this country comes from \nother countries outside our shores. I have spoken often about this \nfact. But we stick straws in this planet and suck oil out of it. We \nsuck out about 85 million barrels of oil a day and one-fourth is \ndestined to come to the United States because that is how much we need \nand how much we use. The problem is that about two-thirds of it comes \nfrom other countries. Some of it comes from countries that do not like \nus very much.\n  The question is, How do we provide greater energy security for our \ncountry, more energy security so we are less vulnerable? Second, and \njust as important, how do we change our mix of energy and our use of \nenergy to protect our planet with respect to the issue of climate \nchange?\n  Let me talk about this for a moment and say the following: First, \nclimate change is important. There is something happening to our \nclimate, and we ought to address it. Even the skeptics should at least \nbe in support of a series of no-regret steps that if 50 years from now \nyou decide that climate change was not happening, at least you have \ndone something you don't have regrets doing because they were the right \nthings to do. Even the skeptics should agree about that. But, yes, \nsomething is happening to our climate and we ought to take some steps \nto address them. I am in favor of capping carbon. The use of carbon and \nemitting it into the airshed is a serious problem. We need to have a \nlower-carbon future. I am in favor of capping carbon emissions. But it \nhas to be done in a smart way and an appropriate way, and I am in favor \nof that. I am also in favor of putting a price on carbon.\n\n  There are some people who I think that I and others who want to bring \nthe Energy bill to the floor of the Senate--which came from the Energy \nCommittee and the work we did last year--don't support addressing \nclimate change. I support the effort to address climate change. I \nsupport a cap on carbon, and I support the opportunity to decide that \nwe are going to not only lower carbon emissions, but put a price on \ncarbon, which is a way to accomplish all that. What I don't support is \nwhat is called ``cap and trade'' as the mechanism to do that because I \ndon't have any interest or willingness to consign a $1 trillion carbon \nsecurities market to Wall Street to speculate on. There are other ways \nto do this.\n  Let me just say that the issue of restraining carbon and putting a \nprice on carbon can be done in many different ways. Some of my \ncolleagues say: Well, the only way to do it is what we call cap and \ntrade. I don't believe that, and I don't support that for the reasons I \nhave described. There could be a carbon fee, a straightforward carbon \nfee, which is much less complicated. There is the cap-and-dividend \napproach, which has some advantages as well. There is a sector-by-\nsector approach. There are a number of hybrid approaches being \ndiscussed. There is the command-and-control approach, where you simply \nsay: Here is the restriction. So, there are many different approaches \nto this issue of restricting carbon and trying to price carbon.\n  But here is what is happening. We passed an energy bill out of the \nenergy committee last June. It was bipartisan. Republicans and \nDemocrats joined together and we passed an energy bill and here is what \nit does: It will reduce the amount of carbon emitted into the airshed, \nit will maximize the production of energy from wind and solar sources, \nwhich are carbon free, and it will build the transmission capability \naround the country, a superhighway of transmission so you can gather \nenergy from where the sun shines and the wind blows and put it on the \nwire to move the energy where it is needed to a load center. We also \nhave a renewable electricity standard, called an RES, requiring 15 \npercent of all electricity be done from renewables. I would offer an \namendment to take that to 20 percent, if we can get the bill to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  That is just an example of what is in the bill. In fact, this is a \nchart reflecting that it will reduce our dependence on foreign energy \nand it will increase domestic production. It was my amendment that \nopens the eastern Gulf of Mexico for production. It is the only area \nthat is not now open and has substantial reserves of both oil and \nnatural gas. We establish a renewability\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\nelectricity standard, create a transmission superhighway. We electrify \nand diversify the vehicle fleet in our country. Seventy percent of the \noil used in this country is used in the vehicle fleet. So that is very \nimportant. The bill contains substantial provisions dealing with energy \nefficiency and new green energy technology.\n  All those things are exactly what we would do if we had already \npassed a climate change bill to say: All right. Now how do you \nimplement it? What are the provisions you develop in order to implement \nthis, to have less carbon emitted? This is what you would do.\n  So many of us have been impatient about trying to get this bill to \nthe floor of the Senate, but here is what I understand. I understand \nthat those who say they want climate change legislation first have said \nthey don't want an energy bill to come to the floor of the Senate \nbecause they want there to be some agreement on climate change, and \nuntil they get that, they don't want the Energy bill to come to the \nfloor of the Senate. My view is, we should bring the Energy bill to the \nfloor of the Senate. Let's all of us decide this is a priority. When \nthe bill comes to the floor of the Senate, let's reach an agreement on \nsome kind of climate change amendment to this bill and move ahead.\n  I wouldn't support cap and trade, but there are other things I will \nsupport that will put a price on carbon. But why would we end this \nCongress not having achieved some very substantial achievements in a \nbipartisan energy bill that will actually reduce the emission of carbon \nin the atmosphere? That makes no sense to me.\n  As we go forward, I know this is an issue that requires it fit into a \nbroader set of issues--immigration reform is discussed these days, Wall \nStreet reform or financial reform is going to come to the floor at some \npoint, which will take some time, appropriations bills, and there are \nmany other things--but I still believe it is very important that we \ndiversify America's energy supply, that we maximize the production of \nrenewable energy, and that we produce more here at home and, yes, that \nincludes oil and natural gas. The use of coal is also very important, \nthe use of coal using new technology to decarbonize. We can do all \nthese things. Our legislation includes the provisions that will \naccomplish that.\n  So, what we need to have happen is to have our legislation come to \nthe floor of the Senate from the Energy Committee. I would say to all \nthose who wish to work on the broader piece of climate change to add to \nit as an amendment. I support a carbon cap, and I will support pricing \ncarbon. That does not include support for cap and trade. If we haven't \nlearned anything from the last decade or so about what Wall Street \nwould do with a $1 trillion securities market, then we are pretty ill-\nprepared to legislate on these issues.\n  There are not a lot of weeks left in this legislative session, and my \nfervent hope, I would say to those who have been working on climate \nchange and blocking our ability to bring an energy bill to the floor of \nthe Senate, is that we can perhaps find a way to work together to bring \nthe Energy bill to the floor. That is the way the Senate works. The \nSenate works by running things through a committee and working hard to \nachieve compromise. We did that on a bipartisan basis and passed a \npiece of legislation that is a Democratic-Republican energy bill that \nreduces carbon, maximizes renewable energy, opens additional areas of \ndrilling in the eastern gulf, builds an interstate highway of \ntransmission capability, has the first ever RES, renewable electricity \nstandard, and all those things are important to this country. We should \nnot leave them at the starting gate. Let's at least decide that this, \ntoo, is a priority for our country. Yes, health care is a priority, but \nso is energy.\n  Let me make one final point. If tomorrow morning, instead of flicking \nthat switch, shutting off the alarm clock, taking a shower with the use \nof an electric water heater, putting a piece of bread in the toaster, \ntaking something out of your refrigerator and using all that energy \neven before you get in your car to go to work, if, God forbid, somehow \nterrorists interrupted the pipeline of foreign oil coming to this \ncountry--and there are a lot of points where that possibility exists--\nthis country's economy would be flat on its back. We are, in my \njudgment, far too vulnerable with the percentage of our economy that \nruns on foreign oil and there is a way to respond to that and a way to \naddress it and much of that is included in this legislation that has \nalready passed the Energy Committee on a bipartisan vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              NASA Budget\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to discuss \nPresident Obama's proposed fiscal year 2011 budget and the proposed \npath forward for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nwhich we all know as NASA. Even though Colorado doesn't have a NASA \nfacility, this proposed budget and the major changes to NASA's \ndirection included in it have major implications for thousands of \nColoradans. I was the chairman on the House side of the Space \nSubcommittee and I know what space means to Colorado and I know what it \nmeans to our Nation.\n  Yesterday, Senator Bennet and I had the opportunity to meet with \nformer General and now NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden to urge him to \nreevaluate the decision included in the President's budget request for \nNASA to terminate the Constellation Program. This program is developing \nthe successor to the retiring space shuttle known as the Orion capsule \nand Ares rocket. Those two technologies will be teamed up in the \nplanning that was brought together.\n  We had a frank and productive discussion with Administrator Bolden. \nSenator Bennet and I impressed upon him the importance of this \nprogram--especially the development of the Orion capsule--to thousands \nof jobs in Colorado and, frankly, to America's leadership more broadly \nin space. General Bolden assured us that he wants to be flexible and \nwork with Congress on this NASA budget and that he is committed to \nhuman space flight. In other words, the President's budget request is \nthe beginning of a long process, and I was pleased to hear General \nBolden is set on working with Congress to chart a future course for \nNASA and America's leadership in space. I look forward to working with \nGeneral Bolden as this unfolds.\n  If I might, I will take a few moments to describe the aerospace \ncommunity in Colorado. Although we don't host a NASA facility, Colorado \nhas the second largest aerospace economy in the Nation, behind only \nCalifornia. We have a talented and educated workforce and our colleges \nand universities have deep ties to NASA, private aerospace companies, \nand Federal research laboratories. We have many businesses that partner \nwith NASA and the military to provide launch services and satellite \ndevelopment as well as a number of startup companies that are pushing \nthe boundaries of what is possible in privately financed access to \nspace. We can also in Colorado boast of the two key military space \ncommands--NORAD and the Air Force Space Command--and three Air Force \nbases with strong space missions: Buckley, Peterson, and Schriever.\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\n  In short, Colorado's aerospace enterprise brings together the \ngovernment and commercial sectors as well as the military and civil \nsectors. For all of these reasons, I pay close attention to NASA and to \nthe administration's vision for the agency, and the significant changes \nin the President's fiscal 2011 budget request demand an especially hard \nlook. I know many of my Senate colleagues feel the same way.\n  I have been reviewing the President's NASA budget since it was \nreleased in February and, as I noted earlier, Senator Bennet and I \nshared our concerns with General Bolden yesterday.\n  Let me start by saying there is much to like in the President's \nbudget. First, it supports an extension of the International Space \nStation until 2020 and possibly beyond. Completing this station has \nbeen a long time coming and I am pleased to see that this \nadministration's commitment to fully utilizing it past the previous end \ndate of 2015.\n  Second, the budget includes important new investments in science and \naeronautics research. My goal is to balance each of NASA's four mission \npriorities: earth science, space science, space exploration, and \naeronautics. The President's request for nonexploration priorities \nrepresented a farsighted investment that should pay large dividends.\n  Also, the budget includes an additional $6 billion over 5 years, \nwhich is especially notable at a time when many agencies are seeing \nflat or declining budgets. Much of this investment will go toward \ndeveloping transformative technologies and propulsion systems that will \nhelp NASA cross into new frontiers.\n  However, the elephant in the room is understandably the proposed \ncancellation of the Constellation Program, which is to be supplanted by \ncommercial development of human space flight. A purely commercial \napproach to human space flight may be the future, but I am concerned \nthat it also runs the risk of diminishing American leadership in space. \nIf that happens, that would be a great shame. It would be penny wise, \nbut I fear it would be pound foolish. Let me be frank. This move would \nhit Colorado especially hard. Well over 1,000 Coloradans work directly \non one aspect or another of Constellation. In addition, the Jefferson \nCounty Economic Council estimates that work on Constellation supports \nnearly 4,000 additional Colorado jobs and $300 million worth of \neconomic activity in the Metro Denver area. As the Presiding Officer \ncan imagine, those kinds of numbers give me real pause. They are \nespecially worrisome in today's economic conditions.\n  The budget proposal leaves broader questions unanswered as well. \nAfter the planned retirement of the space shuttle next year, the United \nStates will be without the capacity to launch humans into space, \nincluding to the International Space Station. At that point, we will be \nforced to purchase access to space on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. \nConstellation was supposed to minimize the gap in our ability to access \nLow Earth Orbit, otherwise known as LEO, and now the President is \nproposing to rely on the commercial sector to minimize the gap instead.\n  I strongly support development of commercial launch capabilities and \nspace services, and I look forward to the day when the commercial \nsector can provide these services for NASA to focus on development of \nnew exploration technologies and human missions beyond Low Earth Orbit.\n  I am confident that day will come. However, I have not seen \nsufficient proof from the administration that day is close at hand. The \ncommercial sector has yet to prove it can safely put a human into \norbit.\n  Should the commercial sector fail to deliver human access to space, \nAmerica will be reliant on Russian-procured launch services to the \nspace station and LEO for the foreseeable future. In my opinion, that \nis an unacceptable position for our Nation.\n  The United States and Russia have enjoyed a very productive \npartnership in space. It has been good for our country and good for \nspace exploration. We should cooperate and share resources wherever \npossible. But I am concerned about what an indefinite reliance on \nRussian launch services will mean for our leadership in space.\n  Cancelling Constellation has other important implications for our \nnational security. NASA is a prime customer for the U.S. space launch \nindustrial base, which we rely on to sustain our strategic deterrence \nmission and to ensure access to space. These issues are especially \nimportant to me, as I sit on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Department of Defense officials have stated that Constellation's \ncancellation could increase the current price of propulsion systems for \nour launch vehicles. The Department of Defense is looking at the cost \nimpacts, but we will not have clear answers until this summer. Congress \nneeds this information before deciding whether to approve the \nPresident's budget request.\n  I do not want to appear naive about the problems this administration \nfaced in crafting a NASA budget and direction for the future. The \nConstellation Program, as currently resourced, is clearly \n``unsustainable,'' in the words of the Review of Human Spaceflight \nPlans Committee--more commonly known as the Augustine Committee. The \ncommittee went on to say that we are ``perpetrating the perilous \npractice of pursuing goals that do not match allocated resources.'' \nThat is simply not a recipe for U.S. leadership in space either.\n  In the midst of crafting this budget for NASA, the administration \nalso faced the worst economic conditions in a generation. I can \nappreciate the difficulty of designing a sustainable plan for NASA with \ntoday's fiscal constraints.\n  We cannot and should not ask NASA to do more with less. Transferring \nroutine space operations to the commercial sector appears to be an \nattractive, potentially money-saving alternative.\n  I know I am not alone in believing that Congress should not support \nthis budget based on what we know now. Terminating Constellation does \nnot make sense. But we should be open to restructuring the program in a \nway that preserves American leadership in space and protects jobs.\n  Madam President, where do we go from here? The President will be \nspeaking later this week in Florida. It will be his first set of \ncomments on the proposed NASA budget. I appreciate the fact that the \nPresident is tackling the problems with Constellation head on. However, \nhe needs to explain his plan better.\n  I hope the President will begin to answer the questions that I and \nmany of my colleagues in Congress have asked. I hope he will begin to \narticulate a plan for NASA that is, in the words of the Augustine \nCommittee, ``worthy of a great nation.'' I do not believe we are there \nyet, but we will get there.\n  One of the lessons I learned as a mountaineer came on the 10th day of \nwhat was supposed to be a 7-day climb of Mount McKinley. At that \ncritical moment in our climb, I learned that when you are all the way \nin, you will find a way. I believe the American people are all the way \nin with NASA. I know this Congress is.\n  NASA's mission of exploration resonates with each of us. That mission \ntranscends programs, budgets, and politics. It has endured the end of \nMercury, Gemini, and Apollo, and it will soon endure the end of the \nspace shuttle.\n  Unfortunately, the history of NASA is littered with canceled programs \nwith little to show for them. I don't want to see the same happen with \nConstellation, nor do I want to continue on an unsustainable course.\n  The challenge before us is to ensure that NASA's programs and budgets \nare worthy of its mission.\n  Over the coming weeks and months, I will be working with my \ncolleagues in Congress and the administration to find the right way to \nfurther NASA's mission.\n  I believe there is a sweet spot to be found that includes many of the \npositive aspects of the President's proposal. But the American people \ndeserve answers on the President's vision for our Nation's leadership \nin human space travel.\n  While some changes need to be made, I believe the Constellation \nProgram has advanced an important mission. It would be highly \ndisappointing to leave behind the significant investments we have made \nin Constellation without anything to show for them.\n  We will find a budget that works for NASA, for Congress, and for \nColorado. We have to because we are in all the way.\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Recess Appointment\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about one of the recess \nappointments President Obama made when the Senate was not in session. \nBefore I get into my concern about this, I wish to emphasize the fact \nthat I have been the ranking member or the chairman of the Oversight of \nGovernment Management and the District of Columbia and then several \nyears ago the Federal Workforce. Working with Senator Akaka, we have \nconscientiously tried to make the most significant improvements in the \nFederal service, in terms of human capital and looking at title V of \nthe code that deals with our Federal workers.\n  If we look at the past and determine why we have had some real bad \nsituations in the Federal Government, it is we have not had the right \npeople with the right knowledge and skills at the right time in the \nright place. The whole effort has been to try to improve the management \nof our government, to work with Senator Akaka to try to get Federal \nagencies off the high-risk list. The high-risk list is agencies subject \nto waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\n  I first share that with you because I think it may cast a little bit \nof a light on what I am going to talk about this evening.\n  The President nominated Rafael Borras to serve as the Department of \nHomeland Security Under Secretary for Management on June 24, 2009. That \nis June of last year. I met with Mr. Borras to discuss his experience, \nqualifications, and goals for the Department of Homeland Security and \nalso served as the ranking member when the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee held his nomination hearing on July 29, \n2009.\n  I carefully reviewed Mr. Borras's background and resume and stated \nqualifications and heard what people he worked for and what people who \nworked for him said about him. Based on all that, I placed a hold on \nMr. Borras's nomination because I believe he is unqualified to be the \nDHS Under Secretary for Management.\n  On March 27 of this year, the President ignored my concerns and my \nhold and made Mr. Borras 1 of his 15 recess appointments, and I want to \nknow why. I want to know why. I do not generally oppose nominees, and I \ndo not put holds on lightly. When I do, I explain why I put on holds. I \ndo not hide out. I let people know why I put on a hold.\n  I am extremely concerned about the management challenges the \nDepartment of Homeland Security faces, which are wide ranging and far \nreaching.\n  When Congress established the Department of Homeland Security in \n2002, we initiated the Federal Government's largest restructuring since \nthe Department of Defense was created in 1947. What is more, we told \nthe Department to protect us from terrorism and natural disasters, \nwhile addressing the organizational, operational, and cultural \nchallenges associated with merging 22 agencies and 170,000 employees \ninto one entity. It is probably the biggest management challenge in the \nhistory of the world. The Government Accountability Office cautioned \nabout the challenges the merger would cause and placed the Department \nof Homeland Security on its high-risk list in January of 2003.\n  Today, DHS is the third largest Cabinet department with about 230,000 \nemployees and an annual budget of $50 billion. Management challenges \npersist and the Department remains on GAO's high-risk list. \nAdditionally, the DHS inspector general, the DHS Chief Financial \nOfficer, and the Homeland Security Advisory Council's Cultural Task \nForce have also identified management challenges at the DHS. They \nrecognize they have some big problems.\n  DHS is too big an entity, spending too much money, with too important \na job to be deemed susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement year after year, and it is imperative that the right \nperson be put in place to address those challenges. I do not believe \nMr. Borras is the person, and I do not think he will move the \nDepartment forward toward getting off the Government Accountability \nOffice's high-risk list.\n  My concerns about Mr. Borras's qualifications and the hold on the \nnomination, as I mentioned, were not secret. I wrote to the majority \nleader, I wrote to Secretary Napalitano, and I also wrote to the \nPresident to outline my concerns.\n  I announced at a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing \non DHS management challenges that I was holding the nomination because \nof those concerns, but no one approached me to discuss those concerns. \nThe Senate did not debate Mr. Borras's qualifications. No cloture \nmotion was filed. Rather, my concerns were ignored, and this recess \nappointment was made.\n  I would like for someone in the administration to explain why things \nwere done this way. I assume because it is everyone knows Mr. Borras is \nnot the best person to manage our third largest department, and any \ndebate we had would have made his lack of qualifications plainly \napparent. So we did not debate it.\n  If the Senate had taken the time to debate this nomination, I would \nhave explained in 2007, Congress set statutory requirements for the DHS \nUnder Secretary for Management. By the way, we helped create that \nspecial Under Secretary for Management because we believed the \nDepartment needed someone who would get up early in the morning and go \nto bed late at night and move on the transformation that is needed in \nthe Department to get it off the high-risk list.\n  We required the Under Secretary to have extensive executive-level \nleadership and management experience, a demonstrated ability to manage \nlarge and complex organizations, and a proven record in achieving \npositive operational results. Mr. Borras did not meet those statutory \nrequirements because he does not have the appropriate executive-level \nleadership experience or demonstrated ability to manage an organization \nas large and complex as DHS.\n  The administration and Mr. Borras point to his experience as one of \nseveral vice presidents in one region of a Fortune 500 company, as a \nregional administrator for one region of the General Services \nAdministration, and as a Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Department \nof Commerce. I do not believe, and most people do not believe, these \nexperiences are in any way comparable to the challenges Mr. Borras will \nface at DHS.\n  Mr. Borras has never overseen a budget anywhere near as large as the \nDHS budget. His own assertions indicate that the largest budget he ever \nwas involved with was $4.5 billion at the Department of Commerce. That \nis roughly one-tenth the size of the DHS\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\n$50 billion budget, and Mr. Borras was never directly responsible for \nthe Commerce Department budget. He was just one of those who worked at \nthe Department.\n\n  Additionally, Mr. Borras has never managed hundreds of thousands of \nemployees, such as the 230,000 he will be responsible for at DHS. At \nmost, he asserts he was directly responsible for managing 1,500 \nemployees while a GSA regional administrator.\n  He has also never overseen a procurement budget similar to that at \nDHS, where in 2005, $10 billion was spent on 63,000 contracts. Mr. \nBorras asserts that the largest procurement budget he has been involved \nwith was one-quarter of that, $2.5 billion, while he was at the General \nServices Administration.\n  Given the vast difference between Mr. Borras's experience and the \nrequirements of the job, I agree with two of his former supervisors who \ntold me this job is a big leap from what he has done in the public and \nprivate sector. In other words, they said this is a big leap from what \nhe has done.\n  Further, when you compare Mr. Borras's qualifications with the \nqualifications of past nominees for this position, it is even more \nconcerning.\n  For example, Paul Schneider had over 38 years of Federal service when \nhe was nominated to be the DHS Under Secretary for Management, and much \nof that experience was with the Navy, a large, complicated organization \nsuch as DHS.\n  Similarly, Elaine Duke had more than 25 years of progressively \ndifficult Federal Government experience, primarily within the \nDepartment of Defense, when she was nominated to be DHS Under Secretary \nfor Management.\n  I do not mean to imply only career civil servants are appropriate for \nthis role, but Mr. Borras's resume does not include high-level \nmanagerial positions in organizations that are similarly complex to \nDHS. I think the Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary for \nManagement needs a proven record in that regard.\n  I emphasize again, we set this up specifically to be responsible for \ntransformation and to deal with the management problems of the \nDepartment. We laid it out: This is the kind of person we ought to be \nputting into this position.\n  Additionally and unfortunately, Mr. Borras demonstrated a lack of \nattention to detail on two separate occasions in his personal life, \nwhich makes me wonder whether he is prepared to successfully undertake \nall the responsibilities required of the DHS Under Secretary for \nManagement, such as addressing DHS's low rank on the ``Best Places to \nWork in the Federal Government'' study and overseeing the billions of \ndollars the DHS spends on hard-to-manage projects such as SBInet.\n  I feel so strongly about Mr. Borras's lack of qualifications that I \nam no longer seeking to work to enact a 5-year term for the person who \nholds this position. The thought was, when we put this position \ntogether, we would give it a 5-year term because we knew that if we \nwere going to do transformation, it was going to take more than 1 year. \nWe would give that individual 5 years to go forward and work on nothing \nbut transformation, transformation, transformation, so this Department \nwould come together and get it off the high-risk list.\n  The Government Accountability Office suggested that such a term would \nhelp improve the management function at DHS, and I have been advocating \nfor such legislation for the last couple years. My bill has bipartisan \nsupport and has passed the Senate before, but now I don't want it \nenacted because I am afraid of having Mr. Borras in this position for 5 \nyears. I don't think he has the skills necessary to get the job done. \nSo that is gone.\n\n  I know I am not alone in my concerns. Mr. Borras was passed out of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee largely on a \nparty-line vote, but it should be noted that two Democratic members of \nthe committee expressed concern about his qualifications when we were \ndebating his nomination.\n  In fact, one of the Democrats who voted for the nomination said she \nwas doing so to send the nomination to the floor, but that she wanted \nthe committee to take a closer look at Mr. Borras's qualifications to \nmake sure he had the management skills necessary to manage the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I wonder, did such a review ever occur? If it did, it did not include \nme even though I am the ranking member on the committee's Oversight of \nGovernment Management Subcommittee. I should have asked Senator Akaka \nif he had ever been consulted, but a dime will get you a dollar that \nthey didn't talk to him at all.\n  I wasn't a strong supporter in creating the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Standing it up created real challenges, and those challenges \nremain. But the Department exists, and we owe it to the United States \nand our children and grandchildren to ensure that the Department is as \ngood as it can be. I think we need to ask our President why he made \nthis recess appointment when doubt existed on both sides of the aisle \nabout Mr. Borras's qualifications. What was the stated reason for the \nappointment? Will somebody explain why the appointment was made?\n  I sat with the Secretary, and we talked about it. Never in all of my \nconversations did anyone come forward and say he should get the job; \nthat he is qualified for the job. The fact that no one in the \nadministration defended Mr. Borras or explained why they thought he was \nqualified to be a DHS Under Secretary for Management still remains a \npuzzlement to me. I think somebody owes it to me, to Senator Akaka, and \nto the Members of this Senate to explain why they put this man in this \nposition under a recess appointment, particularly when we have an \nagency that, if we don't have the kind of attention given to it, will \nnever be in a position where it can get off the high-risk list.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I noticed the senior Senator from \nOhio, my colleague, was in the Chamber, and I wanted to thank him \npublicly for his vote yesterday, joining with three other Republicans \nSenators--Senators Collins, Snowe, and Brown, the new Senator from \nMassachusetts--in their vote to extend unemployment benefits.\n  There is simply no reason this shouldn't be bipartisan--this \nextension of unemployment benefits. It is not solving all our Nation's \nproblems, but it certainly stimulates the economy. It is the best use \nof public dollars to help the economy because when we extend \nunemployment benefits, we pay unemployment benefits to a family in \nAshtabula or a family in Yellow Springs who ends up putting money into \ntheir community. They spend it at the local grocery store, the hardware \nstore, or the department store. They are able to pay their property \ntax, which is money that goes to schools, and all of those things. So \nit clearly has a stimulative effect on the local economy.\n  Even more than that, it is what we owe to people who are working \nhard, playing by the rules, and who can't find a job. We don't call it \nunemployment welfare. We call it unemployment insurance. I think all of \nus on both sides of the aisle, even though 30 of my colleagues worked \nagainst passing this legislation to extend unemployment benefits to \npeople who are now unemployed but who were employed, understand, though \nmaybe we need to have a little more instruction around here, that when \npeople are employed, they pay into the system as insurance. When they \nare unemployed, they get assistance from the government to keep bread \non the table, to keep their families fed. It is a pretty simple \nconcept, and it has worked well for us for decades.\n  I hear from my Republican colleagues who voted against the extension \nof unemployment benefits that the reason they did so is because it is \nnot paid for and that it will blow a hole in the budget. I know the \nPresiding Officer, when he represented Boulder in his\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\ncongressional district in Colorado before he came to the Senate--he was \ndown the hall from me, and he remembers, as I do the time when we \nopposed the war in Iraq, and the Republicans who supported it, all but, \nI believe, three in the House and one in the Senate didn't think then \nabout paying for that war. They didn't think about what that meant in \nterms of cost to their children and grandchildren when they passed \nthat.\n  We were both in the House, Senator Udall of Colorado and myself, and \nthey didn't think about the cost when we passed the Medicare giveaway \nto the drug and insurance companies, which Senator Udall and I--then \ncongressmen--opposed. They didn't say anything about paying for it in \nthose days. They just added it to the credit card for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  When they gave tax cuts to the richest Americans--hundreds of \nbillions of dollars over 10 years to the wealthiest Americans--that was \njust added to the credit card of the future.\n  It is only now they object to the cost, when it is unemployed \nworkers--people whose lifestyle, people whose quality of life isn't \nclose to the quality of life and the lifestyle and the standard of \nliving that we enjoy, dressed like this, working in a place like this, \nthis august body, with the privileges that surround us. It is only when \nwe talk about people who have lost their jobs, who don't have \nprivileges that we do now--and generally through no doing of their own, \nbut simply because they lost their jobs because their company closed or \nthey got laid off--that they object to the cost.\n  Most of these workers were efficient workers who did what their \nemployer asked. Yet we are going to be so stingy as to deny them \nunemployment compensation.\n  It is not like they are sitting around with nothing to do and should \nbe out working. I talked to dozens of people, as I am sure Senator \nUdall, the Presiding Officer, has, talked to dozens of people who tell \nme they send out 10 or 15, sometimes 25, sometimes 50 resumes every \nweek or so to try to get a job. Usually these resumes go unanswered and \npossibly barely even looked at because these companies are not even \nhiring.\n  It is a question of fairness. It is a question of good economics. It \nis a question, in some sense, of the privilege we enjoy here that they \nare denying even a shred of that same advantage, by refusing to extend \ntheir unemployment benefits and refusing to extend the assistance they \ncould get for health care with the so-called COBRA program which allows \nthem to keep the health insurance they had. It is at high cost--but not \nso prohibitively high a cost since we have been helping with that since \nthe stimulus package and legislation I had written before the stimulus \nbill that included it in it that gave assistance to people who lost \ntheir insurance when they signed up for COBRA to keep what they had.\n  I do not know what to think about their opposition. I hear them say \nit is about the budget deficit but I really wonder if it is because \nthey didn't say it before when it was the tax cuts for the rich, the \ndrug and insurance company giveaway, billions of taxpayer dollars, and \nthe Iraq war. They never thought about paying for those things but they \nwant to do it on the backs of unemployed workers. I do not get that.\n  Let me make it more personal. I have two letters today. I talked to a \nlady from Painesville, OH, east of Cleveland, in Lake County right \nalong Lake Erie. She wrote and then I actually called her today and \ntalked to her. Her name is Barbara. She said:\n\n       My son-in-law just got his last unemployment check. He has \n     2 kids, a $1,000 house payment, car insurance, gas is $3 a \n     gallon, food bills, school clothes, school supplies, car \n     maintenance.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       Oh yes, the kids like to eat. . . . They turn off the \n     utilities when you do not pay them. . . . [P]lease vote to \n     extend unemployment until jobs are available that pay more \n     than minimum wage.\n\n  She goes on to write:\n\n       [We] need good paying jobs or unemployment right now. [My] \n     daughter has bills she wants to pay.\n\n  She said:\n\n       [My] husband wants to work for money.\n\n  She said:\n\n       My kids don't want welfare.\n\n  Again, I think perhaps the Republicans who voted en masse--with the \nexception again of four courageous Republicans, including my seatmate, \nSenator Voinovich, the senior Senator from my State, including the two \nMaine Senators and the Massachusetts Senator--perhaps they do not \nunderstand the difference between welfare and unemployment insurance. I \nwish they would pay more attention so that they did. This is again \nunemployment insurance. These people are not taking welfare. These are \npeople who earned it.\n  The second and last letter I will read--Janet from Toledo in \nnorthwest Ohio writes:\n\n       I have been working since I was 14. I am going on 65.\n\n  So Janet has worked 50 years or so.\n\n       I had to take early retirements and I am [at] risk of \n     losing my home. . . . Thank the Lord I kept my car, but I \n     can't afford much else like health insurance.\n       People like me are struggling. Giving unemployment . . . is \n     giving money to people who have already earned it and paid \n     into the system.\n\n  She is not asking for herself but she is asking for the many people \nshe sees in Oregon, OH, and Wauseon and Bryan and Toledo and Sylvania \nand all over northwest Ohio, people who again, as most Americans, play \nby the rules, work hard and simply ask for a fair shake. They want this \nunemployment insurance available, payments available to them. It is not \na lot of money. It is not anything most of us would want to live on, on \nany kind of decent standard of living. It is enough to get them to pay \ntheir bills through the week, through the month, so their house will \nnot be foreclosed on, so they can feed their children or whatever the \nbasic needs of life are that are so important to them.\n  I again thank the four Republicans who joined the Democrats in \nextending this legislation. I hope we can move forward this week, pass \nthis legislation and get it to the President so we can get on with the \njob of figuring out how to put more people to work in this country.\n  I spoke today, I did a conference call with several Ohio highway \ncontractors to talk about what this meant to them, what we can do to \nget money so they can build more highways and bridges and water and \nsewer systems so they can help companies that want to expand do what \nthey need to do to modernize and expand their plants so they can begin \nhiring people. That is our mission, extend unemployment benefits and \nfigure out, working with the private sector, how we help them create \njobs and get this economy back on track.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, the recently enacted health reform law will \nextend quality, affordable health coverage to 32 million Americans and \ncover 95 percent of legal residents within the next decade.\n  Many Americans, including Christian Scientists, rely on provisions in \ncurrent law that recognize spiritual care\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\nas a medical expense eligible for a medical care tax deduction. Nothing \nin the recently enacted health reform law prevents insurance companies \nfrom covering care that is currently recognized by the Internal Revenue \nService as eligible for a medical care tax deduction through health \ninsurance plans in the exchanges. Further, the new health reform law \ndoes not reduce existing provisions in the law that recognize spiritual \ncare.\n  As we work to implement comprehensive health reform, I believe it is \nimportant to ensure that the needs of Americans relying on religious \nand spiritual care are addressed. I know these views are shared by my \ncolleagues, Chairman Harkin and Senator Sherrod Brown, and I look \nforward to continue working with them on this issue.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I would like to associate myself with the remarks \nof Senator Kerry. We share an interest in providing appropriate \naccommodation for spiritual and religious care in a reformed health \ninsurance market.\n  No American should be left worse off as a result of health reform. \nSome spiritual care--including that which is provided by Christian \nScience practitioners and Christian Science nurses--has been covered by \ncertain health insurance policies for decades.\n  For example, four plans under the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram cover religious nonmedical nursing care and/or Christian \nScience practitioner services. They are the Government Employees' \nHealth Association, the Mail Handlers Benefit Plan, the Special Agents \nMutual Benefit Association, and the Association Benefit Plan.\n  Religious nonmedical nursing services are also covered under the \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs--42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395x(ss) and \nSec. 1395i-5. TRICARE covers care in Christian Science nursing \nfacilities, private duty Christian Science nursing services, and \nChristian Science practitioner services (10 U.S.C. Sec. 1079(a)(4)). \nAnd under section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, funds contained in \na health savings account may be used to pay for spiritual care (26 \nU.S.C. Sec.  223(d)(2)(A)).\n  I have an interest in identifying a statutory way to affirm that \nhealth insurance companies may still cover this mode of care as part of \ntheir policies.\n  Chairman Harkin has shown great leadership throughout health reform.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Ohio. Nothing in health reform \nlegislation would cut existing benefits or restrict the ability of \nprivate insurance carriers from covering spiritual care. Further, \nspiritual care will continue to be recognized as a medical expense \neligible for a medical care tax deduction.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the Senator for his assistance and look \nforward to working with him and Senator Kerry to ensure that \nappropriate protections for spiritual care are provided as health \nreform is implemented.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2236-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING CAPTAIN JOHN LONERGAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I bring to the \nattention of the Senate the bravery and sacrifice of a great American, \nCPT John Lonergan, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry at \nthe Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War. His memory will be \ncommemorated on May 8, 2010, with the dedication of a monument in his \nhometown of Carrick on Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland.\n  Amid severe famine and the 1848 rebellion against British rule, the \nLonergan family was forced to flee Ireland and made their way to \nVermont. In 1862, as the American Civil War erupted, John Lonergan \nmobilized Company A of the 13th Vermont Volunteer Infantry Regiment, \nthe so-called ``Irish Company.'' His unit served 9 months of active \nduty in Virginia as part of the 2nd Vermont Brigade guarding the outer \ndefenses of Washington, DC. As General Lee and General Grant maneuvered \nthe armies of the South and North during the summer of 1863, Lonergan's \nCompany A was sent on a forced march to Pennsylvania for what would be \nthe Battle of Gettysburg.\n  On July 2, 1863, at Gettysburg, Lonergan, now a captain, and his \ncompany successfully recaptured a Union cannon lost to the rebels and \ntook prisoner more than 80 Confederate soldiers. Captain Lonergan was \nlater awarded the Medal of Honor for his leadership and gallantry \nduring this battle. The next day, he led his company of Vermont \nsoldiers in an attack against the right flank of a massive Confederate \nassault on Cemetery Ridge. Company A made an invaluable contribution to \ndrive back the Confederate charge at a crucial moment in the Battle of \nGettysburg.\n  After the War, Captain Lonergan worked to overcome existing prejudice \nagainst Americans of Irish descent by organizing the first public \ncelebrations of St. Patrick's Day in Vermont. He never lost his love \nfor Ireland, and he was apparently a passionate advocate for liberation \nfrom British rule. Captain Lonergan continued serving his new country \nas a U.S. Customs officer, assigned to duty in Montreal, Canada. He \ndied in 1902 and was buried in Burlington, VT.\n  We Vermonters are proud to recognize the bravery of Captain Lonergan, \nthose of Irish descent who fought alongside him, and the thousands of \nother Vermonters who fought in the Civil War. Vermont, per capita, had \nmore of its sons die fighting in the Civil War than any other State.\n  For their service, bravery and sacrifice, we thank all of them, and \nall those who continue this proud tradition as they serve the Nation \ntoday in Afghanistan, Iraq and other outposts across the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2236-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 REMEMBERING JOAN MARJORIE KOCH STIVERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is with great admiration and \nrespect that I take this time to memorialize one of Kentucky's most \noutstanding citizens, Mrs. Joan Marjorie Koch Stivers.\n  Mrs. Stivers was born on June 19, 1921, in Greenfield, MA. After \ngraduating from high school she attended Simmons College where she \nreceived a bachelor of science in dietetics. She then attended Harvard \nUniversity where she received a master's degree in public health. After \ngraduating from Harvard, Mrs. Stivers relocated to Manchester, KY, as a \nsingle young woman, upon taking a position with the Kentucky Public \nHealth Department.\n  In 1948 she married Bertram Robert Stivers of Manchester, KY. Mr. \nStivers would go on to serve Kentucky as a judge of the circuit court. \nTheir marriage lasted 57 years and produced four children and numerous \ngrandchildren. All of their four children are accomplished and include \ndaughters Louise and Mary Beth, who have had outstanding careers in \nhigher education, and one son Robert, who is a State senator and \nanother, Franklin, who is an appellate judge.\n  However, Mrs. Stivers is perhaps best known for her service to Sue \nBennett College, which she joined in 1957 as a faculty member. Her \ncareer at Sue Bennett spanned 34 years in which time Mrs. Stivers held \nnumerous positions both inside and outside of the classroom. In \naddition to her teaching duties, Mrs. Stivers served the college as \ndean of women, dean of students, academic dean, and finally president \nof the college.\n  After her retirement, Mrs. Stivers remained active in the community. \nShe volunteered at the Federal Correctional Institute in Manchester, \nwas active in the Presbyterian Church, and served on the Cumberland \nValley Area Development District Commission on Aging and on the \nGovernor's Commission on Aging.\n  The life of Mrs. Stivers made a tremendous impact on both her local \ncommunity and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky. I am honored to \nbring her accomplishments to the attention of the Senate, and I wish to \nextend my heartfelt condolences to her friends and family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2236-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2236-S2237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANKIE MANNING\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to recognize Mrs. Frankie Manning of the VA Puget Sound Health \nCare System in Seattle, WA. After over 40 years of service in the U.S. \nArmy and the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mrs. Manning is retiring \nfrom government service. A pioneer in championing the needs of women \nveterans, she helped\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\ncreate the Women Veterans' Program for the Western Region in the 1980s. \nThis program developed standards of care for women in the VA system and \nis still in place today. She was also instrumental in ensuring that the \nrural areas of our State received equal access and care from the VA \nsystem. My office worked closely with Mrs. Manning to establish the \nVeteran-Virtual Clinic in Port Angeles, a project that allows 3,000 \nveterans living on the Olympic Peninsula to access specialty care at \nthe VA in Seattle.\n  Mrs. Manning has filled many roles within the VA system and served \nmost recently as the nurse executive, overseeing the nursing operations \nat the Seattle and Tacoma facilities. Mrs. Manning also had a \ndistinguished career in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps, spanning 23 years \nthat included a deployment to Saudi Arabia during the gulf war. Mrs. \nManning retired from the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n  These decades of service to our country demonstrate a dedication to \npublic service matched by few. Mrs. Manning worked tirelessly to ensure \nthe men and women serving in our armed services received the best \nhealth care possible and that this care continued for the rest of their \nlives. I would like to thank Mrs. Manning for her years of service to \nour country and to the people of Washington State. Her career is a \ntremendous example of public service, and her commitment to our \nveterans is truly appreciated. I wish her all the best in her future \nendeavors and know that her many talents will be missed at the VA Puget \nSound Health Care System.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2237-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NOTIFICATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BLOCKING THE \nPROPERTY OF CERTAIN PERSONS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CONFLICT IN SOMALIA--PM \n                                   50\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (IEEPA), and section 301 of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1631 (NEA), I hereby report that I \nhave issued an Executive Order (the ``order'') blocking the property of \ncertain persons contributing to the conflict in Somalia. In that order, \nI declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States posed by that conflict, as described below.\n  The United Nations Security Council, in Resolution 1844 of November \n20, 2008, reaffirmed its condemnation of all acts of violence in \nSomalia and incitement to violence inside Somalia, and expressed its \nconcern at all acts intended to prevent or block a peaceful political \nprocess. United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1844 also \nexpressed grave concern over the recent increase in acts of piracy and \narmed robbery at sea against vessels off the coast of Somalia, and \nnoted the role piracy may play in financing violations of the arms \nembargo on Somalia imposed by UNSCR 733 of January 23, 1992. In UNSCR \n1844, the United Nations Security Council determined that the situation \nin Somalia poses a threat to international peace and security in the \nregion and called on member States to apply certain measures against \npersons responsible for the continuing conflict. The United Nations \nSecurity Council has continued to express grave concern about the \ncrisis in Somalia in UNSCR 1846 of December 2, 2008, UNSCR 1851 of \nDecember 16, 2008, and UNSCR 1872 of May 26, 2009.\n  Pursuant to the IEEPA and the NEA, I have determined that the \ndeterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence \nin Somalia, and acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast \nof Somalia, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the \nnational security and foreign policy of the United States. The order \ndeclares a national emergency to deal with this threat.\n  The order is not targeted at the entire country of Somalia, but \nrather is intended to target those who threaten peace and stability in \nSomalia, who inhibit the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia \nor the distribution of such assistance in Somalia, or who supply arms \nor related materiel in violation of the arms embargo. The order blocks \nthe property and interests in property in the United States, or in the \npossession or control of United States persons, of the persons listed \nin the Annex to the order, as well as of any person determined by the \nSecretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:\n\n  to have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the \npeace, security, or stability of Somalia, including but not limited to \n(1) acts that threaten the Djibouti Agreement of August 18, 2008, or \nthe political process, or (2) acts that threaten the Transitional \nFederal Institutions, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), or \nother international peacekeeping operations related to Somalia;\n  to have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance to \nSomalia, or access to, or distribution of, humanitarian assistance in \nSomalia; or\n  to have directly or indirectly supplied, sold, or transferred to \nSomalia, or to have been the recipient in the territory of Somalia of, \narms or any related materiel, or any technical advice, training, or \nassistance, including financing and financial assistance, related to \nmilitary activities.\n\n  The designation criteria will be applied in accordance with \napplicable Federal law including, where appropriate, the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. The designation criteria \nwill also be applied taking into consideration the arms embargo on \nSomalia imposed by UNSCR 733 of January 23, 1992, as elaborated upon \nand amended by subsequent resolutions.\n  The order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to designate for blocking any \nperson determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided \nfinancial, material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or \nservices in support of, the activities described above or any person \nwhose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the \norder. I determined that, among other threats to the peace, security, \nor stability of Somalia, acts of piracy or armed robbery at sea off the \ncoast of Somalia threaten the peace, security, or stability of Somalia. \nI further authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, to designate for blocking any person \n(defined as an individual or entity) determined to be owned or \ncontrolled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf \nof, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in \nproperty are blocked pursuant to the order.\n  I delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including \nthe promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers \ngranted to the President by IEEPA and the United Nations Participation \nAct, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the order.

A bill to amend the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to \nprovide that certain transition services shall be available to eligible \ncandidates before the general election; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bill I am introducing \ntoday, the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010, bipartisan \nlegislation that concerns both our national security and America's \ndemocratic institutions.\n  I am proud to be joined by my colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich \nin introducing this bill. I also want to thank our cosponsors, Chairman \nAkaka of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee as well as \nChairman Lieberman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee.\n  I am appreciative of their support and for their input while drafting \nthis bill.\n  I also would like to thank the Partnership for Public Service, a \nleading nonpartisan, nonprofit organization in the area of government \naccountability and reform. Their recent ``Ready to Govern'' report on \nthe 2008-2009 transition made a number of important recommendations \nthat are included in our bill.\n  As the strong, bipartisan support for this bill demonstrates, this is \nnot a political issue.\n  After the attacks of September 11, we face new security challenges \nthat require close cooperation between outgoing and incoming \nadministrations, and the recent economic crisis underscores the \nimportance of a smooth handoff on domestic policy as well.\n  This was highlighted in a recent article by Martha Kumar, a respected \npolitical scientist at Towson University and Director of the \nnonpartisan White House Transition Project. As Professor Kumar recounts \nin her December 2009 article in Presidential Studies Quarterly, a \nthreat to President Obama's inauguration brought together the incoming \nand outgoing senior national security personnel in the White House \nSituation Room the morning of his swearing-in.\n  In the hours before then-President-elect Obama was to take office, \nintelligence sources had indicated a possible plot to attack the \nNational Mall during the ceremony. Thankfully, this threat proved a \nfalse alarm.\n  But, as Kumar explains, that Situation Room meeting between advisers \nto President Bush and President-elect Obama was a powerful example of \nwhy transition planning is so important.\n  In their meeting that morning, those on both sides worked well \ntogether as a team. This was so because they had met frequently in the \nweeks beforehand and had undergone joint emergency preparedness \nexercises together.\n  This occurred in no small part because the administration of former \nPresident George W. Bush made it a high priority. The former President \nand his White House staff deserve great credit for their work during \ntheir final months in office. By appointing his chief of staff, Joshua \nBolton, as his transition point-person and convening a formal \nTransition Coordinating Council, President Bush created a successful \nmodel for a 21st century transfer of power.\n  Presidential inaugurations have always been moments of celebration \nfor Americans, as we reaffirm the elective nature of our government. \nBut they also represent moments of potential vulnerability.\n  In the earliest years of our history, that vulnerability inhabited \nthe untested nature of our institutions. In an era when elected \ngovernment was rare, the transition from one executive administration \nto another, particularly those between parties, brought fears of \npolitical or social unrest.\n  The primary example of such a transition remains that from the \nadministration of John Adams to that of Thomas Jefferson, the first \nbetween opponents of different parties to contest the Presidency.\n  The peaceful nature of the 1801 transition came as a welcome surprise \nto some. The early American writer and novelist, Margaret Bayard Smith, \nwhose brother, James Bayard, held the Senate seat from Delaware I now \noccupy, attended that inauguration. In a letter to her daughter, she \ndescribed it thus:\n\n       I have this morning witnessed one of the most interesting \n     scenes a free people can ever witness. The changes of \n     administration, which in every government and in every age \n     have most generally been epochs of confusion, villainy, and \n     bloodshed, in this our happy country take place without any \n     species of distraction or disorder.\n\n  It is also notable that the greatest political crisis in our history \noccurred during the period between election day in November 1860 and \nAbraham Lincoln's inauguration the following March. The States that \nseceded did so amid a palpable uncertainty of national leadership.\n  Today, however, our concern is less with political stability than \nwith national security.\n  During the Cold War, when fears of a power vacuum caused a renewed \nfocus on continuity of government, Congress passed the Presidential \nTransition Act of 1963. It formalized several important elements of a \nsuccessful transition, including public funds for transition staff, use \nof office space and equipment from the General Services Administration, \nreimbursement for travel by the President-elect and Vice President-\nelect, and their use of franked mail. It was amended in 1998 to permit \nthe President-elect and Vice President-elect to supplement public \ntransition funding with private donations and laid out requirements for \ndisclosing their sources.\n  In 2004, Congress took an important step by including provisions in \nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act that allow \ntransition personnel to request FBI background checks for potential \nappointees. This helps ensure that, on January 20 when the new \nPresident is sworn in, the most critical national security positions \nare immediately filled.\n  While some aspects of a successful Presidential transition process \nhave been formalized by these acts, much of what has become necessary \nfor a safe and smooth transition is still left to chance.\n  Fortune favors the prepared.\n  We were very lucky that the first transition of the post-September 11 \nera was carried out smoothly and with great preparation by both the \noutgoing and incoming administrations.\n  As I said a few moments ago, we owe great thanks to former President \nBush for making this a priority and committing staff and resources to \nthe process.\n  I also commend those who worked on both the Obama transition team as \nwell as those from Senator McCain's campaign who engaged in some \ntransition planning before election day.\n  Most importantly, our bill will go a long way in removing the stigma \nthat has historically caused candidates to hide or even delay important \ntransition planning until after election day.\n  We all recognize that the first priority of any Presidential campaign \nis to win the election. I certainly understand why, in the past, \ncandidates have been wary of revealing that they have engaged in pre-\nelection transition planning.\n  But we cannot afford to lose critical planning time because of fears \nthat a candidate might be accused by a rival of ``measuring the \ndrapes'' prematurely. We must also ensure that incumbents make the \nnecessary preparations in case they lose bids for reelection.\n  Candidate transition planning is an act of responsibility, not \npresumptuousness.\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\n  With the security and domestic policy challenges we face today, it \nmust become the norm for any major party nominee to begin making \narrangements for a transition long before election day.\n  The bill my colleagues and I are introducing will both formalize many \nof the recent transition's successes and provide additional resources \nto help nominees begin their transition efforts earlier.\n  The Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010 encourages \neligible Presidential candidates to accept transition office space and \na broad array of services from the General Services Administration \nimmediately after their nominating conventions.\n  Presently, candidates must wait until after election day before these \nresources become available. We know that this is too late, since both \ncampaigns in 2008, and others in recent years, began informal \ntransition planning months in advance.\n  Under our bill, salaries for candidates' transition staff, travel \nexpenses, and allowances are funded exclusively by separate funds \nraised by their campaigns prior to the election.\n  Eligible candidates would be authorized to set up a separate account \nto support these activities. They would be able to transfer money from \ntheir campaign accounts into this transition account as well as raise \nfunds separately.\n  Those candidates eligible to receive GSA-provided services and access \nto facilities include major party candidates. Third-party candidates \nwould be eligible if they met the same criteria used by the Commission \non Presidential Debates to participate in general election debates.\n  The GSA would distribute to candidates a report on modern \ntransitions, including a bibliography of resources. This report would \nalso be released to the public and posted on the Internet to educate \nthe press and public on the importance of early transition planning.\n  Of course, under the bill services and information to candidates \nwould be provided on an equal basis and without regard to political \naffiliation, and they would have to be used only for transition \npurposes.\n  Because a transition depends on the careful attention of those both \npreparing to assume power and those leaving it, our bill also \nauthorizes appropriations for the outgoing administration to use in \nplanning and coordinating transition activities across departments and \nagencies. It recommends adopting the Bush model of a transition \ncoordinating council, staffed by both outgoing appointees and career \nmanagers from each agency. This council would meet regularly with \nrepresentatives from the major nominees and update them on transition \nmatters.\n  The bill also encourages the outgoing administration to prepare \ncomprehensive briefing materials for incoming officials on a range of \nissues and potential areas of concern.\n  My colleagues and I approach this as pragmatists, and our goal is not \nto tie the hands of an administration. It is to inspire responsible \npreparation. This bill is not about telling an outgoing President what \nto do; rather, it lays out a strongly suggested model for how to do the \nright thing.\n  The only new requirement it sets for the outgoing President is the \nsubmission of two reports to Congress in the months before election day \ndescribing the activities being undertaken to prepare for the transfer \nof power.\n  But the model it suggests has worked and can serve as a blueprint for \ntransitions to come.\n  My first job in politics after Joe Biden was elected to the Senate in \n1972 was to help him set up his Senate office in Delaware. My last job, \nbefore I was appointed to his Senate seat was as co-chair of his Vice \nPresidential Transition Team.\n  I can tell you from experience, setting up a Senate office is tough, \nbut it is nothing like setting up a White House.\n  I was there in the room when then-President-elect Obama and Vice \nPresident-elect Biden convened their first transition meetings right \nafter election day. I cannot stress more forcefully how important it \nwas in those meetings that the Obama-Biden transition had begun much \nearlier.\n  There simply is not enough time between November and January to get \neverything done that needs to be done.\n  These are the reasons why I hope my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this legislation to make our presidential transitions \nsmoother and safer.\n  We cannot afford to leave something this important to chance.\n  Again, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich, for his help in pulling this bill together as well as \nSenators Akaka and Lieberman for their support and leadership.\n  I look forward to working with them on the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to move this measure through the \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, every 4 to 8 years our country achieves \na feat that is very much the exception to the rule when placed in the \ncontext of the long roll of history: through universal suffrage the \npeople select a new president, and the president-elect assumes power in \na peaceful manner.\n  It is a testament to the dedication and professionalism of past \npresidents, presidents-elect, civil servants and private citizens that \nthis latter task, the presidential transition, is now seen by many \nAmericans as routine; a new president is selected in November, and in \nJanuary, he or she swaps places with the incumbent president. Life goes \non as normal.\n  Of course, the task of transferring command of an organization with \nmore than 5 million employees and a $3.7 trillion annual budget is a \nbit more complex than our recent successful track record may suggest. \nDomestic and international threats further complicate this process.\n  Perhaps more than any of its counterparts, the Bush-Obama transition \nwas dealt the longest odds for attaining the uneventful standard our \ncountry has come to expect from transfers of power. As my colleagues \nwell know, the Bush-Obama transition was the first of the modern era to \noccur during wartime, and the first to follow a general election in \nwhich the incumbent president or vice-president did not vie for the \npresidency. The Bush-Obama transition was also the first to occur in \nthe post-September 11th world, and the first since the largest \nreorganization of government in over 6 decades. As the candidates \nentered the last week of the campaign season, the second worst month in \nthe history for the Standard & Poor's 500 was drawing to a close after \nthat index had plunged 27 percent in 4 weeks' time.\n  These challenges would be more than enough for any well-disciplined \ntransition effort to confront. Yet in January\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\n2010, shortly before the anniversary of President Obama's inauguration, \nthe American public learned through press accounts of still another \nthreat confronted by the outgoing and incoming administrations. In the \ndays preceding the Presidential Inauguration, intelligence reports \nsurfaced that al-Shabaab, a Somali terrorist organization with ties to \nal-Qaeda, was planning an attack on the crowds that would gather to \nwitness the administration of the oath of office to the 44th President \nof the U.S. The threat was taken so seriously that the Secretary of \nDefense did not attend the inaugural ceremonies in order to ensure \ncontinuity of the Nation's national security apparatus.\n  Fortunately this plot did not materialize. But threats like these \nemphasize the importance of a new president being ready to govern from \nday one.\n  Despite the challenges faced by the Bush-Obama transition, this most \nrecent transfer of power most closely approached our transition ideal. \nBoth the President and President-elect understood the gravity of the \ntasks before them, and undertook early and robust planning efforts. \nPresident Bush began preparing his administration for the transition \nearlier than any other presidency when he directed then White House \nChief of Staff Joshua Bolten in late 2007 to ensure ``that the \ntransition is as effective as possible, especially in the national \nsecurity area.'' For his part, President-elect Obama established the \nlargest transition organization to date. At its peak, the Obama-Biden \nTransition Project's staff numbered 450, with a total budget of more \nthan $12 million, $7 million of which came from private contributions.\n  In many ways, this most recent transition effort was the best case \nscenario. The transition succeeded because of the character and values \nof those tasked with leading the effort, individuals like Gail \nLovelace, Joshua Bolten, Clay Johnson, John Podesta, and Christopher \nLu.\n  But for critical events like a presidential transition, we cannot \nalways be assured that such productive organizations and working \nrelationships will develop. One need look no further than the \nacrimonious relationship between the outgoing Clinton administration \nand the incoming Bush administration, or the internal dissension in \nPresident-elect Carter's transition team, to find examples of \ndysfunctional transitions.\n  Of course, presidential personalities and uncontrollable \ncircumstances will always be a driving factor in the success of future \npresidential transitions. But we in Congress can contribute to future \nsuccesses by providing sufficient assistance and formal avenues to more \nrobust transition planning, and by working to address the stigma that \nhas unfortunately been associated with so-called ``presumptuous'' \ntransition planning before the general election.\n  As my colleagues know, the formal mechanisms used by the federal \ngovernment to transfer power were established in March 1964 with \nenactment of the Presidential Transition Act, PTA. The Presidential \nTransition Act of 1963 extends certain government services to the \npresident-elect, including staff salaries, travel expenses, office \nspace, postal reimbursement, and communications equipment. With the \nexception of substantive amendments in 2000 to provide for a transition \ndirectory and activities designed to ``acquaint key prospective \nPresidential appointees with the types of problems and challenges that \nmost typically confront new political appointees,'' and a provision of \nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to provide \nfor expedited security clearances for transition team members and \nprospective presidential appointees, the architecture our country uses \nto achieve a successful transition remains largely the same almost a \nhalf-century on.\n  So I am pleased to today join the distinguished junior Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Edward Kaufman, in introducing legislation to \ncontribute to the future success of presidential transitions. Prior to \nreturning to the U.S. Senate as a Member, Senator Kaufman served as one \nof the Obama-Biden Transition Project's twelve board members, where he \ngained first-hand experience in the challenges associated with \ntransitioning the Federal Government.\n  I am happy to also be joined by two of the U.S. Senate's most ardent \nchampions of good governance: the Chairman and of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Senator Joseph Lieberman, \nand my longtime friend and colleague on the Subcommittee on Oversight \nof Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of \nColumbia, Senator Daniel Akaka.\n  The Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010 would extend to \nthe major party candidates and certain third-party candidates a select \nlist of the services currently provided to the president-elect under \nthe PTA. These benefits include office space, communications services, \nprinting and binding expenses, and briefings and workshops designed to \nacquaint key potential administration staff with the problems and \nchallenges they are likely to face. The bill would also provide \ncandidates with assistance from the General Services Administration in \ndesigning systems architecture compatible with federal systems.\n  To encourage more deliberate transition preparation in the executive \nbranch, the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act also authorizes \nfunding for the establishment of a transition coordinating council and \nan agency transition directors council modeled on the coordinating \nbodies that functioned so successfully during the Bush-Obama \ntransition. The assistance extended to the candidates by these \nauthorized functions would be provided on the same terms as those \nemployed during the last transition, on an equal basis and without \nregard to a candidate's political affiliation. The bill would also \nrequire the President, or the President's designee, to report to \nCongress in presidential election years on the preparations being made \nto ensure a smooth transition.\n  We in Congress cannot, and should not, dictate the roles and \ndecision-making processes employed by the outgoing and incoming \nadministrations; as a former mayor and governor, I know how fluid and \ndynamic transfers of power can be. So I am especially pleased that \nSenator Kaufman's bill is not prescriptive. Rather, the Pre-Election \nPresidential Transition Act provides assistance that candidates can \nreject or accept at their discretion, and the authorized activities \nincluded in the bill for coordinating bodies in the executive branch \nrespect separation of powers issues by allowing, but not requiring, the \nuse of these best practices.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Pre-Election Presidential Transition \nAct provides valuable transition assistance to candidates at an earlier \ntime than ever before. Regardless of the various unique obstacles a \npresident-elect faces, each transition since the Nixon administration \nhas been provided formal assistance for a very short period of time--76 \ndays during the most recent transition. Of course, candidates can begin \npreparing for the transition before the general election. But in the \nhome stretch of a presidential election, every spare dollar and body \nare employed to help the candidate win, and preparing to govern often \nfalls by the wayside.\n  Senator Kaufman's bill will contribute to earlier, more robust \ntransition planning by providing candidates with the means, the \narchitecture, and the sanction associated with an equitable and \nimpartial assistance mechanism to combat unfortunate dispersions of the \ntransition planning process, like the comments directed at then Senator \nObama's transition activities during the campaign.\n  Candidates taking deliberate steps to ensure a smooth transition \nshould not be criticized as presumptuously ``measuring the White House \ndrapes'' before the election; they should be encouraged and supported. \nThe Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act seeks to achieve that \ngoal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the Pre-Election \nPresidential Transition Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2245-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2245-S2246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 478--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF MARCH AS \n                     ``NATIONAL WHOLE CHILD MONTH''\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\n                              S.

But I miss him and the contribution he made to \nPoland and to our country in the work we did together on cultural \nissues, and certainly support this moment of silence and ask that we \nall remember the terrible thing that happened to so many of the leaders \nin Poland and what that means for how we have to come together and \nassist that country as it moves forward in another crisis that the \ngreat 38 million people of Poland face day after day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/13/senate-section/article/S2249-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
