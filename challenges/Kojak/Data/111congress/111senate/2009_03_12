Madam President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nproceed to a period of morning business until 12 o'clock noon, with \nSenators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each during that period \nof time. Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to debate the nomination of David Ogden to be Deputy \nAttorney General. There will be 2 hours for debate equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees. At 2 p.m., the \nSenate will vote on the confirmation of Mr. Ogden.\n  Following the vote, the Senate will consider the nomination of Thomas \nPerrelli to be Associate Attorney General. Under an agreement that was \nreached yesterday, the debate will be limited to 90 minutes, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled. Upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate will vote on confirmation of the Perrelli nomination.\n  We will continue to work on agreements to consider additional \nnominations this week. I expect to file cloture on a matter to move the \nlands bill forward again, for the information of all Senators. A widely \npopular bill we sent to the House was put on the consent calendar \nyesterday and failed by two votes. So we will have to start that \nprocess over here again. One of the things they are talking about doing \nis adding another Idaho wilderness provision to that bill and to send \nit back over here. But I would hope perhaps we can work something out \nwith people who want us to have to go through all the procedural \nprocesses. I hope we do not have to do that. If we do, that is what we \nwill do. We will have a vote Monday morning on cloture unless we can \nget something worked out with those who are opposing this.\n  Then, next week, that being the case, we will spend some time on the \nlands bill. I have indicated to the Republican leader we are going to \ndo national service this work period. The House is going to pass that \nprobably next Tuesday, allowing us to get to it toward the end of the \nweek or the following week. And then, of course, the final week we are \nhere we have to do the budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3035-7", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3035-S3036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PRODUCTIVE TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

We passed the economic recovery package which is now \nbeginning to filter money into the States. It should start happening \nquite rapidly in the next few weeks.

Madam President, after passing the trillion-dollar ``spend-\nulus'' bill, House Democrats are already talking about a second \nstimulus. It sounds to me as if they have already concluded that the \nfirst trillion dollar stimulus bill is a failure and was nothing more \nthan a downpayment on their social agenda.\n  I know Missourians and many Americans agree that a trillion dollars \nis a terrible thing to waste. This is one economic crisis we cannot \nsimply pay our way out of. The bottom line is that our economy will not \nrecover and conditions for families, workers, and small businesses will \nnot improve until we get to the root of the problem and rid our \nfinancial system of toxic assets. That is what the President said when \nhe addressed the joint session. He said: We must solve the credit \nproblem or nothing else will work.\n  Well, to date, the Obama administration seems as though they have \nbeen trying to treat every cut and bruise on a patient who is \nexperiencing cardiac arrest. Their strategy has been to address each \nperceived crisis as a new one in an ad hoc manner. That has gone back \nto last fall under the previous administration. The Treasury strategy \nhas been to address the symptoms, not the underlying illness, and it is \none that, unfortunately, we have followed here.\n  Let's take a look at what ``ad-hocracy'' has done for us:\n  February's unemployment numbers came out last Friday. Our Nation is \nnow struggling under the highest unemployment rate in more than 20 \nyears--8.1 percent. This is more than a number of millions of Americans \nwho have been laid off and are struggling to find new jobs. That is \nright--millions.\n  Almost 2 million workers have lost their jobs in the last 3 months. \nThe latest job numbers are another sad reminder that right now our \nfinancial system is not working. It has been clogged with toxic debt.\n  The Treasury's ad hoc approach is not working. The President's \napproach seems to be to appease his different constituencies with one \nboutique initiative after another, and we have racked up over a \ntrillion dollars in debt doing so. That effort--that ``spend-ulus'' \nbill--is going to stimulate the debt. It is going to stimulate the \ngrowth of Government. But it will not stimulate the economy or jobs.\n  We have to focus on the urgent priority. I hope it does not take \nanother 2 million workers to face layoffs before the administration \ngets serious about addressing this crisis.\n  Yesterday, the President said we need some ``adult supervision'' in \nWashington. I could not agree more. We definitely need some adult \nsupervision in the Treasury Department when it comes to addressing our \ncredit crisis. We need someone who is willing to make tough choices, \nnot just slapping new names on old ineffective programs and throwing \nbillions of taxpayer dollars into failed financial institutions in the \nhopes that Americans will see it as the change they have been promised.\n\n  In the words of the current President and CEO of the Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City, Thomas Hoenig:\n\n       We have been slow to face up to the fundamental problems in \n     our financial system and reluctant to take decisive action \n     with respect to failing institutions.\n\n  We saw what happened in Japan when policymakers lacked the political \nwill and were slow to clean up its sick banking system--a decade-long \nrecession. That is why I believe we need a bold, coherent, and tested \nplan that will address the root causes of our economic crisis, and the \nexperts agree. They have been unanimous, and I have talked to many of \nthem: people such as the former FDIC Chairman Bill Seidman, who ran the \nsuccessful RTC program to clean up the savings and loan crisis; the \nformer Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan. The Presidents and CEOs of the \nFederal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston believe we \nmust address the toxic assets clogging our financial system.\n  Under my American credit cleanup plan, which I have talked about \nbefore on this floor, the Government can put to work statutory \nauthorities long used by the FDIC for failed banks. We know this plan \ncan work. It worked during the savings and loan crisis, and it can work \nagain to solve the credit crunch. It works every day when the FDIC goes \nin to shut down failed institutions, and it can work right now in this \nmajor crisis. When we boil it down, it is not easy, but the solution is \nsimple--three steps: First, identify the sick banks; second, remove the \ntoxic assets, protect depositors, and fire the failed executives and \nboard of directors who caused this mess; third, relaunch cleansed \nhealthy banks back into the private market; get the Government out so \nthe banks can get about doing their job of providing credit; no more of \nus fighting on the floor of how much a failed executive of a failed \nbank should be paid. Get them out.\n  This is the right approach that provides a clear exit strategy. It \nputs an end to throwing more and more billions of good taxpayer dollars \ninto failing banks. It is the right approach to put our economy back on \nthe road.\n  I call on the President and his economic team to get past their \ndenial about the serious illness facing our economy. Their trillion-\ndollar box of Band-Aids isn't going to work. Stop pouring good taxpayer \ndollars into failed banks with no plan and no strategy. We have a \nskilled surgeon in the FDIC who has operated on failed banks and has \nthe experience and knowledge to deal with toxic assets.\n  Last night, a reporter was questioning me and said, ``Everybody is \ntalking about removing toxic assets.'' Well, that is the problem.\n  In the words of one of my favorite country music songs, we need a \nlittle less talk and a lot more action. If the FDIC's current \nauthorities are insufficient, Congress must stand ready to\n\n[[Page S3037]]\n\nprovide any tools or resources the FDIC needs to complete the surgery. \nI have cosponsored S. 541 with Senator Dodd to expand the FDIC \nborrowing authority. I call on our leadership to bring it up, to add \nauthority for the FDIC to regulate bank holding companies. Give them \nthe tool and let them use it.\n  The Obama administration must face the reality that major surgery on \nour financial institutions is imperative to extract toxic assets \nclogging our financial system so the economy can recover. No more \nthrowing billions at failed banks. Send in the FDIC. This is one crisis \nwhere hope won't be enough. We must act, and we must act now.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Thomas \nHoenig, the President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Too Big Has Failed\n\n       Two years ago, we started seeing a problem in a specialized \n     area of financial markets that many people had never heard \n     of, known as the subprime mortgage market. At that time, most \n     policymakers thought the problems would be self-contained and \n     have limited impact on the broader economy. Today, we know \n     differently. We are in the midst of a very serious financial \n     crisis, and our economy is under significant stress.\n       Over the past year, the Federal government and financial \n     policy makers have enacted numerous programs and committed \n     trillions of dollars of public funds to address the crisis. \n     And still the problems remain. We have yet to restore \n     confidence and transparency to the financial markets, leaving \n     lenders and investors wary of making new commitments.\n       The outcome so far, while disappointing, is perhaps not \n     surprising.\n       We have been slow to face up to the fundamental problems in \n     our financial system and reluctant to take decisive action \n     with respect to failing institutions. We are slowly beginning \n     to deal with the overhang of problem assets and management \n     weaknesses in some of our largest firms that this crisis is \n     revealing. We have been quick to provide liquidity and public \n     capital, but we have not defined a consistent plan and not \n     addressed basic shortcomings and, in some cases, the \n     insolvent position of these institutions.\n       We understandably would prefer not to ``nationalize'' these \n     businesses, but in reacting as we are, we nevertheless are \n     drifting into a situation where institutions are being \n     nationalized piecemeal with no resolution of the crisis.\n       With conditions deteriorating around us, I will offer my \n     views on how we might yet deal with the current state of \n     affairs. I'll start with a brief overview of the policy \n     actions we have been pursuing, but I will also provide \n     perspective on the actions we have taken and the outcomes we \n     have experienced in previous financial crises. Finally, I \n     will suggest what lessons we might take from these previous \n     crises and apply to working our way out of the current \n     crisis.\n       In suggesting alternative solutions, I acknowledge it is no \n     simple matter to solve. People say ``it can't be done'' when \n     speaking of allowing large institutions to fail. But I don't \n     think that those who managed the Reconstruction Finance \n     Corporation, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Swedish \n     financial crisis or any other financial crisis were handed a \n     blueprint that carried a guarantee of success. I don't accept \n     that we have lost our ability to solve a new problem, \n     especially when it looks like a familiar problem.\n\n\n                  Current Policy Actions and Problems\n\n       Much has been written about how we got into our current \n     situation, most notably the breakdowns in our mortgage \n     finance system, weak or neglected risk management practices, \n     and highly leveraged and interconnected firms and financial \n     markets. Because this has been well-documented, today I will \n     focus on the policy responses we have tried so far and where \n     they appear to be falling short.\n       A wide range of policy steps has been taken to support \n     financial institutions and improve the flow of credit to \n     businesses and households. In the interest of time, I will go \n     over the list quickly.\n       As a means of providing liquidity to the financial system \n     and the economy, the Federal Reserve has reduced the targeted \n     federal funds rate in a series of steps from 5.25 percent at \n     mid-year 2007 to the present 0 to 25 basis-point range. In \n     addition, the Federal Reserve has instituted a wide range of \n     new lending programs and, through its emergency lending \n     powers, has extended this lending beyond depository \n     institutions.\n       The Treasury Department. the Federal Reserve and other \n     regulators have also arranged bailouts and mergers for large \n     struggling or insolvent institutions, including Fannie Mae \n     and Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, WaMu, Wachovia, AIG, \n     Countrywide, and Merrill Lynch. But other firms, such as \n     Lehman Brothers, have been allowed to fail.\n       The Treasury has invested public fluids, buying preferred \n     stock in more than 400 financial institutions through the \n     TARP program. TARP money has also been used to fund \n     government guarantees of more than $400 billion of securities \n     held by major financial institutions, such as CitiGroup and \n     Bank of America. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the \n     Treasury Department have committed more than $170 billion to \n     bail out the troubled insurance company AIG.\n       Other actions have included increased deposit insurance \n     limits and guarantees for bank debt instruments and money \n     market mutual funds.\n       The most recent step is the Treasury financial stability \n     plan, which provides for a new round of TARP spending and \n     controls, assistance for struggling homeowners, and a plan \n     for a government/private sector partnership to buy up bad \n     assets held by financial institutions and others.\n       The sequence of these actions, unfortunately, has added to \n     market uncertainty. Investors are understandably watching to \n     see which institutions will receive public money and survive \n     as wards of the state.\n       Any financial crisis leaves a stream of losses embedded \n     among the various participants, and these losses must \n     ultimately be borne by someone. To start the resolution \n     process, management responsible for the problems must be \n     replaced and the losses identified and taken. Until these \n     kinds of actions are taken, there is little chance to restore \n     market confidence and get credit markets flowing. It is not a \n     question of avoiding these losses, but one of how soon we \n     will take them and get on to the process of recovery. \n     Economist Allan Meltzer may have expressed this point best \n     when he said that ``capitalism without failure is like \n     religion without sin.''\n\n\n          What Might We Learn from Previous Financial Crises?\n\n       Many of the policy actions I just described provide support \n     to the largest financial institutions, those that are \n     frequently referred to as ``too big to fail.'' A rationale \n     for such actions is that the failure of a large institution \n     would have a systemic impact on the economy. It is emphasized \n     that markets have become more complex, and institutions--both \n     bank and nonbank entities--are now larger and connected more \n     closely through a complicated set of relationships. Often, \n     they point to the negative impact on the economy caused by \n     last year's failure of Lehman Brothers.\n       History, however, may show us another experience. When \n     examining previous financial crises, in other countries as \n     well as in the United States, large institutions have been \n     allowed to fail. Banking authorities have been successful in \n     placing new and more responsible managers and directors in \n     charge and then reprivatizing them. There is also evidence \n     suggesting that countries that have tried to avoid taking \n     such steps have been much slower to recover, and the ultimate \n     cost to taxpayers has been larger.\n       There are several examples that illustrate these points and \n     show what has worked in previous crises and what hasn't. A \n     comparison that many are starting to draw now is with what \n     happened in Japan and Sweden.\n       Japan took a very gradual and delayed approach in \n     addressing the problems in its banks. A series of limited \n     steps spread out over a number of years were taken to slowly \n     remove bad assets from the banks, and Japan put off efforts \n     to address an even more fundamental problem--a critical \n     shortage of capital in these banks. As a result, the banks \n     were left in the position of having to focus on past problems \n     with little resources available to help finance any economic \n     recovery.\n       In contrast, Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses \n     in its major financial institutions and insisted that solvent \n     institutions restore capital and clean up their balance \n     sheets. The Swedish government did provide loans to solvent \n     institutions, but only if they also raised private capital.\n       Sweden dealt firmly with insolvent institutions, including \n     operating two of the largest banks under governmental \n     oversight with the goal of bringing in private capital within \n     a reasonable amount of time. To deal with the bad assets in \n     these banks, Sweden created well-capitalized asset management \n     corporations or what we might call ``bad banks.'' This step \n     allowed the problem assets to be dealt with separately and \n     systematically, while other banking operations continued \n     under a transparent and focused framework.\n       The end result of this approach was to restore confidence \n     in the Swedish banking system in a timely manner and limit \n     the amount of taxpayer losses. Sweden, which experienced a \n     real estate decline more severe than that in the United \n     States, was able to resolve its banking problems at a long \n     term net cost of less than 2 percent of GDP.\n       We can also learn a great deal from how the United States \n     has dealt with previous crises. There has been a lot written \n     attempting to draw parallels with the Great Depression. The \n     main way that we dealt with struggling banks at that time was \n     through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.\n       Without going into great detail about the RFC, I will note \n     the four principles that Jesse Jones, the head of the RFC, \n     employed in restructuring banks. The first step was to write \n     down a bank's bad assets to realistic economic values. Next, \n     the RFC would judge the character and capacity of bank \n     management and make any needed and appropriate changes. The \n     third step was to inject equity in the form of preferred \n     stock, but this step did not occur until realistic asset \n     values and capable management were in place. The final step \n     was receiving the dividends and eventually recovering the par \n     value of the stock as\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\n     a bank returned to profitability and full private ownership.\n       At one point in 1933, the RFC held capital in more than 40 \n     percent of all banks, representing one-third of total bank \n     capital according to some estimates, but because of the four \n     principles of Jesse Jones, this was all carried out without \n     any net cost to the government or to taxpayers.\n       If we compare the TARP program to the RFC, TARP began \n     without a clear set of principles and has proceeded with what \n     seems to be an ad hoc and less-than-transparent approach in \n     the case of banks judged ``too big to fail.'' In both the RFC \n     and Swedish experiences, triage was first used to set \n     priorities and determine what institutions should be \n     addressed immediately. TARP treated the largest institutions \n     as one. As we move forward from here, therefore, we would be \n     wise to have a systematic set of principles and a detailed \n     plan to guide us.\n       Another example we need to be aware of relates to the \n     thrift problems of the 1980s. Because the thrift insurance \n     fund was inadequate to avoid the losses embedded in \n     thrift balance sheets, an attempt was made to cover over \n     the losses with net worth certificates and expanded powers \n     that were supposed to allow thrifts to grow out of their \n     problems. A notable fraction of the thrift industry was \n     insolvent, but continued to operate as so-called \n     ``zombie'' or ``living dead'' thrifts. As you may recall, \n     this attempt to postpone closing insolvent thrifts did not \n     end well, but instead added greatly to the eventual losses \n     and led to greater real estate problems.\n       A final example--our approach to large bank problems in the \n     1980s and early 1990s--shows that we have taken some steps to \n     deal with banking organizations that are considered ``too big \n     to fail'' or very important on a regional level.\n       The most prominent example is Continental Illinois' failure \n     in 1984. Continental was the seventh-largest bank in the \n     country, the largest domestic commercial and industrial \n     lender, and the bank that popularized the phrase ``too big to \n     fail.'' Questions about Continental's soundness led to a run \n     by large foreign depositors in May of 1984.\n       But looking back, Continental actually was allowed to fail. \n     Although the FDIC put together an open bank assistance plan \n     and injected capital in the form of preferred stock, it also \n     brought in new management at the top level, and shareholders, \n     who were the bank's owners, lost their entire investment. The \n     FDIC also separated the problem assets from the bank, which \n     left a clean bank to be restructured and eventually sold. To \n     liquidate the bad assets, the FDIC hired specialists to \n     oversee the different categories of loans and entered into a \n     service agreement with Continental that provided incentive \n     compensation for its staff to help with the liquidation \n     process.\n       A lesson to be drawn from Continental is that even large \n     banks can be dealt with in a manner that imposes market \n     discipline on management and stockholders, while controlling \n     taxpayer losses. The FDIC's asset disposition model in \n     Continental, which used incentive fees and contracts with \n     outside specialists, also proved to be an effective and \n     workable model. This model was employed again in the failure \n     of Bank of New England in 1991, the failures of nearly all of \n     the large banking organizations in Texas in the 1980s, and \n     also for the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was set up \n     to liquidate failed thrifts.\n\n\n                      Resolving the Current Crisis\n\n       Turning to the current crisis, there are several lessons we \n     can draw from these past experiences.\n       First, the losses in the financial system won't go away--\n     they will only fester and increase while impeding our chances \n     for a recovery.\n       Second, we must take a consistent, timely, and specific \n     approach to major institutions and their problems if we are \n     to reduce market uncertainty and bring in private investors \n     and market funding.\n       Third, if institutions--no matter what their size--have \n     lost market confidence and can't survive on their own, we \n     must be willing to write down their losses, bring in capable \n     management, sell off and reorganize misaligned activities and \n     businesses, and begin the process of restoring them to \n     private ownership.\n       How can we do this today in an era where we have to deal \n     with systemic issues rising not only from very large banks, \n     but also from many other segments of the marketplace? I would \n     be the first to acknowledge that some things have changed in \n     our financial markets, but financial crises continue to occur \n     for the same reasons as always--over-optimism. excessive debt \n     and leverage ratios, and misguided incentives and \n     perspectives--and our solutions must continue to address \n     these basic problems.\n       The process we use for failing banks--albeit far from \n     perfect in dealing with ``too big to fail'' banks--provides \n     some first insight into the principles we should establish in \n     dealing with financial institutions of any type.\n       Our bank resolution framework focuses on timely action to \n     protect depositors and other claimants, while limiting \n     spillover effects to the economy. Insured depositors at \n     failed banks typically gain full and immediate access to \n     their funds, while uninsured depositors often receive quick, \n     partial payouts based on expected recoveries.\n       To provide for a continuation of essential banking \n     services, the FDIC may choose from a variety of options, \n     including purchase and assumption transactions, deposit \n     transfers or payouts, bridge banks, conservatorships, and \n     open bank assistance. These options focus on transferring \n     important banking functions over to sound banking \n     organizations with capable management, while putting \n     shareholders at failed banks first in line to absorb losses.\n       Other important features in resolving failing banks include \n     an established priority for handling claimants, prompt \n     corrective action, and least-cost resolution provisions to \n     protect the deposit insurance fund and, ultimately, taxpayers \n     and to also bring as much market discipline to the process as \n     possible.\n       I would argue for constructing a defined resolution program \n     for ``too big to fail'' banks and bank holding companies, and \n     nonbank financial institutions. It is especially necessary in \n     cases where the normal bankruptcy process may be too slow or \n     disruptive to financial market activities and relationships. \n     The program and resolution process should be implemented on a \n     consistent, transparent and equitable basis whether we are \n     resolving small banks, large banks or other complex financial \n     entities.\n       How should we structure this resolution process? While a \n     number of details would need to be worked out, let me provide \n     a broad outline of how it might be done.\n       First, public authorities would be directed to declare any \n     financial institution insolvent whenever its capital level \n     falls too low to support its ongoing operations and the \n     claims against it, or whenever the market loses confidence in \n     the firm and refuses to provide finding and capital. This \n     directive should be clearly stated and consistently adhered \n     to for all financial institutions that are part of the \n     intermediation process or payments system. We must also \n     recognize up front that the FDIC's resources and other \n     financial industry support funds may not always be sufficient \n     for this task and that Treasury money may also be needed.\n       Next, public authorities should use receivership, \n     conservatorship or ``bridge bank'' powers to take over the \n     failing institution and continue its operations under new \n     management. Following what we have done with banks, a \n     receiver would then take out all or a portion of the bad \n     assets and either sell the remaining operations to one or \n     more sound financial institutions or arrange for the \n     operations to continue on a bridge basis under new management \n     and professional oversight. In the case of larger \n     institutions with complex operations, such bridge operations \n     would need to continue until a plan can be carried out for \n     cleaning up and restructuring the firm and then reprivatizing \n     it.\n       Shareholders would be forced to bear the full risk of the \n     positions they have taken and suffer the resulting losses. \n     The newly restructured institution would continue the \n     essential services and operations of the failing firm.\n       All existing obligations would be addressed and dealt with \n     according to whatever priority is set up for handling claims. \n     This could go so far as providing 100 percent guarantees to \n     all liabilities, or, alternatively, it could include \n     resolving short-term claims expeditiously and, in the case of \n     uninsured claims, giving access to maturing funds with the \n     potential for haircuts depending on expected recoveries, any \n     collateral protection and likely market impact.\n       There is legitimate concern for addressing these issues \n     when institutions have significant foreign operations. \n     However, if all liabilities are guaranteed, for example, and \n     the institution is in receivership, such international \n     complexities could be addressed satisfactorily.\n       One other point in resolving ``too big to fail'' \n     institutions is that public authorities should take care not \n     to worsen our exposure to such institutions going forward. In \n     fact, for failed institutions that have proven to be too big \n     or too complex to manage well, steps must be taken to break \n     up their operations and sell them off in more manageable \n     pieces. We must also look for other ways to limit the \n     creation and growth of firms that might be considered ``too \n     big to fail.''\n       In this regard, our recent experience with ad hoc solutions \n     to large failing firms has led to even more concentrated \n     financial markets as only the largest institutions are likely \n     to have the available resources for the type of hasty \n     takeovers that have occurred. Another drawback is that these \n     organizations do not have the time for necessary ``due \n     diligence'' assessments and, as we have seen, may encounter \n     serious acquisition problems. Under a more orderly resolution \n     process, public authorities would have the time to be more \n     selective and bring in a wider group of bidders, and they \n     would be able to offer all or portions of institutions that \n     have been restored to sound conditions.\n\n\n                          Concluding Thoughts\n\n       While hardly painless and with much complexity itself, this \n     approach to addressing ``too big to fail'' strikes me as \n     constructive and as having a proven track record. Moreover, \n     the current path is beset by ad hoc decision making and the \n     potential for much political interference, including efforts \n     to force problem institutions to lend if they accept public \n     funds; operate under other imposed controls; and limit \n     management pay, bonuses and severance.\n       If an institution's management has failed the test of the \n     marketplace, these managers should be replaced. They should \n     not be given public funds and then micro-managed, as we\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\n     are now doing under TARP, with a set of political strings \n     attached.\n       Many are now beginning to criticize the idea of public \n     authorities taking over large institutions on the grounds \n     that we would be ``nationalizing'' our financial system. I \n     believe that this is a misnomer, as we are taking a temporary \n     step that is aimed at cleaning up a limited number of failed \n     institutions and returning them to private ownership as soon \n     as possible. This is something that the banking agencies have \n     done many times before with smaller institutions and, in \n     selected cases, with very large institutions. In many ways, \n     it is also similar to what is typically done in a bankruptcy \n     court, but with an emphasis on ensuring a continuity of \n     services. In contrast, what we have been doing so far is \n     every bit a process that results in a protracted \n     nationalization of ``too big to fail'' institutions.\n       The issue that we should be most concerned about is what \n     approach will produce consistent and equitable outcomes and \n     will get us back on the path to recovery in the quickest \n     manner and at reasonable cost. While it may take us some time \n     to clean up and reprivatize a large institution in today's \n     environment--and I do not intend to underestimate the \n     difficulties that would be encountered--the alternative of \n     leaving an institution to continue its operations with a \n     failed management team in place is certain to be more costly \n     and far less likely to produce a desirable outcome.\n       In a similar fashion, some are now claiming that public \n     authorities do not have the expertise and capacity to take \n     over and run a ``too big to fail'' institution. They contend \n     that such takeovers would destroy a firm's inherent value, \n     give talented employees a reason to leave, cause further \n     financial panic and require many years for the restructuring \n     process. We should ask, though, why would anyone assume we \n     are better off leaving an institution under the control of \n     failing managers, dealing with the large volume of ``toxic'' \n     assets they created and coping with a raft of politically \n     imposed controls that would be placed on their operations?\n       In contrast, a firm resolution process could be placed \n     under the oversight of independent regulatory agencies \n     whenever possible and ideally would be funded through a \n     combination of Treasury and financial industry funds.\n       Furthermore, the experience of the banking agencies in \n     dealing with significant failures indicates that financial \n     regulators are capable of bringing in qualified management \n     and specialized expertise to restore failing institutions to \n     sound health. This rebuilding process thus provides a means \n     of restoring value to an institution, while creating the type \n     of stable environment necessary to maintain and attract \n     talented employees. Regulatory agencies also have a proven \n     track record in handling large volumes of problem assets--a \n     record that helps to ensure that resolutions are handled in a \n     way that best protects public funds.\n       Finally, I would argue that creating a framework that can \n     handle the failure of institutions of any size will restore \n     an important element of market discipline to our financial \n     system, limit moral hazard concerns, and assure the fairness \n     of treatment from the smallest to the largest organizations \n     that that is the hallmark of our economic system.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, yesterday I noted that in the middle \nof the current economic crisis, the administration's budget spends too \nmuch, taxes too much, and borrows too much. Yesterday I focused \nprimarily on the fact that it spends too much. This morning I wish to \nexpand a little bit more on that issue.\n  As I noted yesterday, the current Congress is on a remarkable \nspending binge. In the first 50 days of the new administration, \nCongress has approved more than $1.2 trillion in spending which \ntranslates into $24 billion a day, or $1 billion every hour since \nInauguration Day. The budget, which we just learned about a while back, \ncontinues that trend.\n  Earlier this week, Congress approved a Government spending bill that \nincreased spending by 8 percent over last year, about double the rate \nof inflation. The budget proposes another spending increase over last \nyear's budget of an additional 8 percent. A lot of people are wondering \nwhy, in the midst of a recession, when millions of Americans are losing \njobs and homes, the administration is proposing to spend tax dollars as \nif we are in the middle of the dot.com boom.\n  According to the administration's budget plan, the State Department \nsees a 41-percent increase in spending next year--a 41-percent increase \nin spending at the State Department. HUD sees an 18-percent increase.\n  The budget also proposes a ``slush fund'' for climate policy that \nwill be larger than the entire annual budgets at the Department of \nLabor, Treasury, and Interior. Let me say that again: A slush fund for \nclimate policy that will be bigger than the budgets of the Department \nof Labor, Treasury, and Interior.\n  Americans want reform in education, health care, energy, and other \nareas, but they want the administration to fix the economy first. That \nis the first priority. At this point we seem to be getting proposals on \neverything but the financial crisis. That is what is crippling our \neconomy.\n  This budget spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much. If \nwe want to earn the confidence of the American people for our programs \nand plans, the first thing we need to do is to get this excessive \nspending under control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3039-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3039-S3041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Sergeant William Patrick Rudd\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, one of America's bravest soldiers has \nfallen, so I rise to speak about SGT William Patrick Rudd of \nMadisonville, KY. On October 5, 2008, Sergeant Rudd tragically died of \nthe wounds sustained during a ground assault raid on senior leaders of \nal-Qaida in Mosul, Iraq. He was 27 years old.\n  Sergeant Rudd was an Army Ranger on his eighth deployment in support \nof the war on terror. He had previously served five tours in Iraq and \ntwo in Afghanistan.\n  For his many acts of bravery over years of service, he received \nseveral medals, awards, and decorations, including the Kentucky Medal \nfor Freedom, three Army Achievement Medals, the Army Commendation \nMedal, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star Medal.\n  Army Rangers are among the most elite members of our fighting forces. \nThey undergo grueling training to wear the honored Ranger Tab on their \nsleeves. For Sergeant Rudd it was the life he always wanted.\n  ``I really enjoy what I'm doing and I think I'm really good at it,'' \nSergeant Rudd told his friend and fellow Ranger, SSG Brett Krueger. \nThis was just a few days before his death. ``I told him he was,'' Staff \nSergeant Krueger remembers.\n  Sergeant Rudd said, ``And I don't picture myself doing anything else \nas successful and as comfortable as what I do now.''\n  Sergeant Rudd's parents also remember their son--who went by his \nmiddle name, Patrick--as a young man firmly dedicated to his fellow \nRangers and the cause they fight for.\n  ``He died for the country,'' says William Rudd, Patrick's dad. ``He \nloved the Army Rangers. He loved his men. . . . He didn't join for \nhimself. You might say he joined for everyone else over here.''\n  Patrick's mother, Pamela Coakley, also remembers her son's sure sense \nthat he was on the right path. ``One thing he told me, if this ever \nhappened . . . was just to know that he died happy and proud,'' she \nsays. ``And that's what stuck with me, because those big brown eyes \nlooked into me. I know he was serious.''\n  Pamela also remembers Patrick's fascination since he was young with \nthe men and women who fight on the side of the good guys. ``CIA, FBI, \never since he was a little boy growing up. . . . U.S. Marshals . . . \nhis cousin was a State trooper, and he always wanted to be in that \nfield,'' she says.\n  Young Patrick also loved the outdoors, camping, and riding horses. In \nfact, the family owned horses and Pamela remembers a time when one of \nhers was injured. She feared the horse would not survive. But 12-year-\nold Patrick gave the horse shots, cleaned its wounds, and it lived. \n``He was always my little man,'' Pamela says. ``He was always my son, \nbut really the man of the house, too.''\n  Patrick also looked after his sister, Elizabeth Lam, and that \nincluded sending a message to her would-be boyfriends. ``On my first \ndate, he sat on the front porch with a shotgun,'' Elizabeth said, ``on \nmy very first date.''\n  Patrick graduated from Madisonville-North Hopkins High School in 1999 \nand then worked at White Hydraulics in Hopkinsville, after which he\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\njoined the Army in October of 2003. ``He had spent two years thinking \nabout it, knowing that he needed a different direction in his life and \nwanting to defend our country,'' Patrick's dad, William, recalls. ``I'm \npretty sure he had his mind made up he wanted to be a Ranger when he \nwent through Basic,'' adds Patrick's stepbrother, Josh Renfro.\n  Assigned to B Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, based out \nof Fort Benning, GA, Patrick became a vital part of his Ranger team. \nBecause he was a NASCAR fan and his favorite driver was Ricky Rudd, his \nfellow Rangers gave him the nickname ``Ricky.''\n  ``He was a good-hearted person who loved life,'' said SSG Brett \nKrueger. ``You could never catch him on a bad day. . . . everyone loved \nhim dearly. . . . A lot of younger guys looked up to him.''\n  SGT Dusty Harrell explains why. ``He spent countless hours passing \ndown knowledge to younger soldiers, to help them be successful.''\n  Jack Roush, owner of some of NASCAR's most successful teams, heard of \nthe loss of Sergeant Rudd. To honor the Ranger and NASCAR fan, he had a \ndecal of Patrick's name placed on David Ragan's No. 6 car during a race \nin Atlanta.\n  At the same time, the Atlanta Motor Speedway donated 200 tickets to \nmembers of Patrick's unit to attend the race. Patrick and the other \nRangers became close friends who spent time together in and out of \nuniform. Sergeant Harrell remembers a time when he and Patrick went \nfishing together in Georgia, and he learned that Patrick, a brave Army \nRanger, was afraid of snakes. Sergeant Harrell got a bite on his line \nand reeled it in to find a water moccasin on the hook. By the time he \nturned around to share a reaction with his friend, ``Ricky was already \nup the hill.''\n  Staff Sergeant Krueger, Sergeant Harrell, and more of Patrick's \nfellow soldiers came to Madisonville to share their memories of Patrick \nwith his family. After speaking with them, Pamela said, ``It made me \nfeel like I still had sons.''\n  After the loss of a brave young soldier such as Patrick Rudd, we must \nkeep his loved ones foremost in our minds. We are thinking today of his \nmother Pamela Coakley; his father William Rudd; his stepmother Barbara \nRudd; his sister Elizabeth Lam; his stepbrother Josh Renfro; his \ngrandparents Judy and Bennie Hancock; and many other beloved family \nmembers and friends.\n  Pamela says she has faith she will see her son again someday. For \nnow, she has 27 years' worth of cherished memories, and in many of them \nPatrick is still her little man, defender of his sister's honor, and \ndoctor to horses.\n  ``I don't envision the war stuff,'' Pamela says. ``I see Patrick \nsitting on the kitchen counter. I see him sitting down by the creek or \nlaying on the bed with his dog Harley. That's what I see.''\n  I know the entire Senate rises with me to say we honor SGT William \nPatrick Rudd for his service, and we will forever remain reverent of \nhis enormous sacrifice on behalf of our Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to express my \nsupport for the bipartisan bill introduced earlier this week by my \ncolleague Senator Bingaman, called the Federal Land Assistance \nManagement Enhancement Act, or the FLAME Act, S. 561. Senator Bingaman \nwas joined by my colleagues: Senators Murkowski, Boxer, Cantwell, \nJohnson, Murray, Tester, Tom Udall, and Wyden as cosponsors. I wish to \nadd my support as a cosponsor as well.\n  Like many States from coast to coast, my home State of Colorado \nfeatures expansive areas of wildland that are increasingly at risk of \nwildfire. Periods of drought continue to raise the possibility of \nwildfires in America, while in Colorado and throughout the mountain \nWest, the epidemic of bark beetle infestation has compounded our risk \nof wildfire. In 2008, more than 5.1 million acres of land nationwide \nburned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In 2006 and \n2007, more than 9 million acres burned, and more than 8 million acres \nburned in 2004 and 2005. The costs associated with these fires are \nlarge and increasing. To a large degree, these costs occur because \nfires are encroaching ever closer to our communities. These fires \nrequire more aggressive suppression efforts because of the risks to \nlives and property.\n  But unfortunately, the Federal lands agencies--especially the Forest \nService--do not have the resources they need to fight these fires. They \nmust resort to raiding funds from other important programs within these \nagencies, such as trails and road maintenance, recreation management \nand, especially important, preventive fuels treatment that could help \nreduce fires, or at least lessen their severity and costs when the \nwildfires occur.\n  For example: last year, the Forest Service had $1.2 billion budgeted \nfor fire suppression, but the agency had to transfer at least $400 \nmillion from other programs when that funding fell short. In August of \nlast year, Forest Service Chief Gail Kimbell sent out an interagency \nmemo asking the staff to find ways to come up with extra money. The \nextra money being sent off to these accounts forced the closure of some \nrecreation areas, caused some contract obligations to go unmet, and \ncanceled construction, research, and natural resource work.\n  Later, Congress approved $610 million for the Forest Service in \nemergency Federal firefighting funding, restoring some of those \ntransfers. Nonetheless, that work had gone undone when it was necessary \nfor it to be done.\n  Making matters worse is the fact that the Forest Service budget has \nhistorically declined overall. The Department of Interior and Forest \nService each maintain multibillion dollar deferred maintenance backlogs \nand are having to scale back some of their services. As is often \npointed out, the Forest Service now dedicates upwards of half of its \nentire budget for emergency fire suppression activities.\n  We can't keep funding firefighting efforts in this manner. We have to \nfind a better approach, so we do not continue to borrow money intended \nfor other important missions. Also, we must move forward with efforts \nthat allow us to reduce wildfire threats at the front end.\n  The FLAME Act would do just that. It would set up a separate fund \nthat agencies can draw upon to augment firefighting costs. In so doing, \nwe can help the agencies avoid drawing down funds in other programs and \nprovide additional funds when we face an especially intense and \nexpensive fire season. I strongly support the creation of a Federal \nfund designated solely for catastrophic emergency wildland fire \nsuppression activities, which is what this bill does.\n  Equally important, in my view, is a provision in the FLAME Act \ncalling for comprehensive wildland fire management strategies to best \nallocate fire management resources, assess risk levels for communities, \nand prioritize fuel reduction projects.\n  For many of my constituents--as in the State of the Presiding \nofficer, New York, as well--Federal and State wildlands are Colorado's \ngreatest attribute, providing all manner of outdoor recreation and awe-\ninspiring scenes of nature. Yet those same forested lands hold the \npotential for tragedy, as the threat of lost life and property due to \nwildfire grows. We currently employ a largely reactive wait-and-see \napproach to catastrophic wildland fires. The FLAME Act will help us \nshift to a more effective and proactive approach. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this bipartisan approach.\n  Again, I thank Senator Bingaman for introducing this legislation. I \nlook forward to working with him and our colleagues to bring this bill \nbefore the full Senate and press for its final passage.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Madam President, I wish to talk about the state of our \ncountry and the President's budget that has recently been offered.\n  There are many Americans who are hurting right now. Many have lost \ntheir homes or are afraid of losing their homes. Many are concerned \nthat the value of their home, their greatest asset, has gone down \ntremendously and they can longer count on their home as an asset when \nthey retire. They have seen their 401(k)s devastated. Certainly, many \nof us in this chamber who have Thrift Savings Plans have seen our plans \ngo down because of the problems in the stock market. Over half of \nAmericans are invested in some way in the stock market. So there are a \nlot of people who are hurting out there right now. The unemployment \nrate all across the country is rising. I think California is over 10 \npercent now. My home State of Nevada is over 9 percent. Nationwide, \nunemployment is a little over 8 percent. So we should be focusing on \nthe economy.\n  During Bill Clinton's campaign back in 1992, he coined a phrase: \n``It's the economy, stupid.'' That is when we were in a very minor \nrecession. Today, we are in a severe recession with no end in sight. \nSome people say we are going to recover next year. Other people say \nthis is going to be a long, deep recession. No one really knows for \nsure. We do know that is the past, when we do the wrong things, \nrecessions can become very severe, and can lead to depressions. When we \ndo the right things, recessions become more mild.\n  We recently passed a so-called stimulus bill. I don't think it is \ngoing to do a lot. It is going to help short term in a few areas, but I \nthink the long-term damage is going to vastly outweigh the short-term \nprospects. Last week, we passed another massive spending bill that \nincreased funding 8 percent over the same programs we had last year. An \n8-percent increase at a time when families are cutting their own \nbudgets, businesses are cutting their budgets, is irresponsible.\n  I just had the mayor of Las Vegas in my office. Local governments \nacross America are having to cut their budgets. State governments are \ncutting spending because Governors are required by constitution in \nalmost every State to balance their budget. They are looking for any \nkind of waste. The only place that is not looking for any waste is \nright here in Washington, DC. Why? Because we can print money. We can \nborrow from our children.\n  Every generation of American has said: I may not have everything I \nwant, but I want my children to have a better America than I did. \nGrowing up, part of the American dream has been: I want to go past what \nmy parents did. Today's generation has become selfish. We want to keep \nour standard of living and borrow from our children's future, no matter \nthe cost to our children. That idea is what the President's budget \naccomplishes.\n  The President's budget double the public debt in the first 5 years. \nLet me repeat that. In the first 5 years of the President's budget, the \ndebt doubles. In the first five years of the Obama Administration, \nassuming he is re-elected, this budget will increase the debt more than \nthe debt has ever increased since the founding of the Republic, all the \nway from George Washington to George W. Bush. After 10 years the public \ndebt triples. This is not sustainable. If we go down this path, it \ncould lead to the downfall of America as we know it.\n  There are many items in the budget that are problematic. We had a \ndiscussion this morning about the differences between Europe and \nAmerica. In Europe, they believe the state is the answer, government is \nthe answer.\n  One of the things de Tocqueville observed when he visited America in \nthe 1800s was the charitable nature of Americans, how we helped in \ncommunities through voluntary acts, through our churches, through our \ncommunity organizations, secular, religious--we helped each other \nvoluntarily. It was not forced on us by the government.\n  Europe today believes the state is the answer. As a matter of fact, \nnot too long ago, the King of Sweden made a charitable contribution to \nprivate charities, and people in Sweden criticized him because instead \nof giving the money to charities, they said he should have given the \nmoney to the state. That is the European attitude.\n  Most Americans believe that the private sector can deal with problems \nin our communities person to person through charitable giving. We are \nthe most generous Nation in the history of the world when calculating \nthe percentage of our income we give to charities. That has been part \nof the miracle of America. Whether it is for disease research, whether \nit is for organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs or Big \nBrothers Big Sisters, community food banks, Catholic Charities.\n  We have some amazing charities that give compassionate care to those \nwho truly need it. As a matter of fact, the word ``compassion,'' if you \ntake it at its root, means ``to suffer with.'' Charities and \nindividuals can relate to people on a one-on-one basis and suffer with \nthem. They can walk through life with them. That is why when the \nPresident put in his budget that we were going to eliminate charitable \ndeductions for people making over $250,000 a year, there was a hue and \ncry across America, especially from charities saying: Mr. President, \nthis is going to hurt. You are going to hurt us at a time when, because \nof the economy, charitable contributions are down.\n  We have seen that. Food pantries across America are hurting. Every \norganization that has come to me in Nevada has told me: We are hurting \nright now. Please don't allow this part of the budget to be adopted. \nDon't let the charitable deduction go away.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Why would someone want to eliminate the \ncharitable deduction just to increase the size of Government? Is it \nbecause they believe the state is a better answer than the private \nsector? Maybe. If that is the case, this is a very dangerous precedent \nwe are setting going forward.\n  The budget has many other problems. There is a tax in this budget on \nwhich, I believe, the President violated his pledge. He said taxes were \nonly going to go up on those people making $250,000 a year or more. I \nguess that is true as long as you don't use energy because there is an \nenergy sales tax in the President's budget. So if you use electricity, \nif you use gasoline, or if you buy any products made with energy in the \nUnited States, you are going to pay higher taxes on products, higher \ntaxes on your electric bills, higher taxes on your gasoline.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I won't object, but I would ask that 3 \nminutes be added to the time for the Ogden debate.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Madam President, this energy tax I was talking about is a very \nregressive tax. I understand why people want to do it, I support the \ntransition to a greener economy, but instead of putting incentives for \nus to go to a greener economy, they want to put a tax on Americans that \nwill hurt the poor more than anybody else. It will severely affect \nthose making under $250,000 a year.\n  They say they are going to distribute that money to those through the \nMaking Work Pay tax credit. But that is for lower income people. What \nabout\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\nthe people who are truly middle-income people--the people making around \n$100,000 a year, or $80,000 to $100,000 a year. This includes teachers, \nfirefighters, and police officers. They are going to pay that tax.\n  According to MIT, the refundable aspect of this tax provision is \ngoing to raise about $300 billion a year. They are not refunding that. \nSo this is another giant problem the President has with his budget.\n  A couple other concluding points. We have a situation here where we \nshould sit down together and think about our children, our \ngrandchildren. Instead of giving us what we want today, let us think \nabout the debt we are passing on to them. What is that debt like? It is \nas though we have taken their credit card and we are running up their \ncredit card and they have to pay the finance charges. That means they \nhave to work harder and they have to pay higher taxes in the future to \npay those finance charges. This debt adds trillions of dollars in \ninterest payments on their credit card--trillions of dollars.\n  This is not the direction our country should be going in today. We \nshould be thinking about being fiscally responsible and thinking about \nfuture generations, just as generations before us have done.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3042-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

OGDEN TO BE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of David W. Ogden, of Virginia, to \nbe Deputy Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided and controlled between the two leaders \nor their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished presiding officer, a good friend \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, before I begin on the David Ogden matter, I have been \nlistening to a couple of days of debate not on Ogden but on the budget, \nand I see these crocodile tears. Oh, my gosh, we might eliminate some \nof these special tax breaks given to people making over $250,000 or \n$500,000 or $1 million or $2 million. My heart breaks for them, it \nreally does, that they do not get all kinds of special tax breaks, that \nthey might be unwilling to actually give money to charity. But then I \nlook at the people who make $25,000 or $30,000 a year--people I see \nwhen I go to mass on Sunday, digging deep and putting money in, a far \ngreater percentage of their pocket--and they are not getting any tax \nbreak for that. They are not getting a tax break. They take a standard \ndeduction and they give to charity because it helps the people in this \ncountry who are in need. These are people who barely have enough money \nto pay for food for their own families, yet they give to charity.\n  Let us stop setting up a straw man that somehow the very wealthy \namong us won't give anything to charity if we remove some of their tax \nbreaks. You either feel a moral responsibility to give to charity or \nnot. It is not because you are doing it to placate the IRS. You do it \nbecause it is the right thing to do. It is like the story in the Gospel \nof the widow's mite. She gave all she had. And to those wealthy who \nwanted to denigrate what she gave, the Lord said: She gave more than \nyou did because she gave all she had.\n  So let us not cry, or pull out the world's smallest violin for this. \nPeople will give to charity if they feel they can and should help the \nleast among us, not because they are getting some kind of a tax break.\n  Now, this idea that we must have tax breaks for the wealthiest here, \nbecause, after all, that is how we will pay for the war in Iraq--\nremember the last administration saying: We will give huge tax breaks \nand that will pay for the war in Iraq. It gave us the biggest deficit \nin the Nation's history and it precipitated the problems we are having \ntoday.\n  Let us be honest about this. If we give tax breaks, give them to the \nhard-working men and women in this country who are paying Social \nSecurity taxes, who are getting a weekly, or even hourly salary. They \nare the ones who need the tax breaks. Warren Buffett, one of the \nwealthiest people in the world, has argued against these huge tax \nbreaks for people like himself. As he pointed out, he pays a lesser \npercentage of his income to taxes than people cleaning up his office--\nto janitors in his office; to secretaries in his office.\n  So let us be honest about this. People give to charity if they feel \nit is their moral duty, as my wife and I feel it is to give to charity, \nnot because of any tax exemption. Let us be honest about that.\n  Now, on the other issue, David Ogden. The Senate is finally ready to \nstop the delaying tactics we have had to put up with and will conclude \nits consideration of President Obama's nomination of David Ogden to be \nDeputy Attorney General. We will finally give the nomination an up-or-\ndown vote that in the past, when George Bush was President, Senate \nRepublicans used to claim was a constitutional right of every nominee.\n  After all, all four of President Bush's Deputy Attorney General \nnominees were confirmed without a single dissenting vote by Democrats. \nNotwithstanding that, Senate Republicans have decided to ignore the \nnational security challenges this country is facing since the attacks \nof 9/11, and they have returned to their partisan, narrow, ideological, \nand divisive tactics of the 1990s.\n  In fact, it was the nomination of Eric Holder to be the Deputy \nAttorney General in 1997 that was the last time a President's choice \nfor Deputy Attorney General was held up in the Senate. He, of course, \nwas also nominated by a Democrat. Senate Republicans have unfortunately \nreturned to their old, tired playbook. They ought to listen to what is \nbest for the country, not what they are told to do by radio \npersonalities.\n  David Ogden will fill the No. 2 position at the Department of \nJustice. As Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Ogden is going to be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the Justice Department, \nincluding the Department's critical role in keeping our Nation safe \nfrom the threat of terrorism. He is highly qualified to do so. He is \nleaving a very lucrative and successful career in private practice, \ntaking an enormous cut in pay to return to the Justice Department, \nwhere he previously served with great distinction, and having \npreviously served with such distinction at the Department of Defense.\n  Senators Kaufman, Klobuchar, and Durbin made statements yesterday in \nsupport of the nominee, and I was very pleased to hear these three \ndistinguished Senators speak so highly and favorably of him. Senator \nSpecter, the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, also spoke yesterday \nin support of Mr. Ogden's nomination, and I was very pleased to hear \nSenator Specter's statement. I thank them all.\n  But after that, I was disappointed at the handful of opposition \nstatements that parroted outrageous attacks against Mr. Ogden that had \nbeen launched by some on the extreme right. These attacks from \nextremists distort the record of this excellent lawyer and this good \nman. They begin by ignoring the truth, the whole truth, and then \nmischaracterizing a narrow sliver of his diverse practice as a \nlitigator. Those who contend that Mr. Ogden has consistently taken \npositions against laws to protect children are unwilling to tell the \ntruth. They chose to ignore Mr. Ogden's record and his confirmation \ntestimony.\n  What these critics leave out of their caricature is the fact that Mr. \nOgden aggressively defended the constitutionality of the Child Online \nProtection Act and the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 when he \npreviously served at the Justice Department. In private practice, he \nwrote a brief for the American Psychological Association in Maryland v. \nCraig in which he argued for the protection of child victims of sexual \nabuse.\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\n  For those who talk about how one might help out and do charitable \nworks, let me tell you about his personal life. He has volunteered his \ntime at the Chesapeake Institute, a clinic for sexually abused \nchildren. I wonder how many of the people who are out here attacking \nhim have given their own time to help children, especially sexually \nabused children. As a former prosecutor, I know how much help those \nchildren need. I ask those who want to willy-nilly attack him: Have you \never given your money or your time to help these children the way Mr. \nOgden has?\n  In his testimony, he demonstrated his commitment to the rule of law \nand his abhorrence at child pornography and child abuse. Now, these may \nbe inconvenient facts for those who want to perpetuate a fraud, but \nthey are the truth. That truth has led the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and the \ntop law enforcement organizations across the country to support this \nnomination and reject the misconceived effort of character \nassassination of this public servant and family man.\n  We have the former Deputy Attorney General under President Bush \nsupporting him, judge advocates general, the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Major Cities \nChiefs Association, the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nNational District Attorneys Association--an association where I was \nhonored to serve as its vice president before I was in the Senate--the \nNational Narcotic Officers' Associations' Coalition, the National \nSheriffs' Association, the Police Executive Research Forum, the \nNational Center for Victims of Crime, and many others.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a list of the 53 letters in support the committee received \non this nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Letters of Support for the Nomination of David Ogden To Be Deputy \n      Attorney General of the United States, as of March 11, 2009\n\n\n                   Current & Former Public Officials\n\n       Beth S.

Mr. President, I might say also that some of the \nRepublicans--and they have all been Republicans who have attacked Mr. \nOgden--are also applying a double standard. Nominees from both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations and Senators from both sides \nof the aisle have cautioned against opposing nominees based on their \nlegal representations on behalf of clients. Like many others in this \nChamber, I felt privileged to serve as a prosecutor, but I would hate \nto think I could not have served in that position because, before I was \na prosecutor, I defended people who were accused of crimes. I was a \nlawyer. I wanted to make sure clients were given equal protection of \nthe law. If we start singling out somebody because of their clients, \nwhat do you do? Do you say to this person: You defended somebody \ncharged with murder and therefore you are in favor of murder? Come on, \nlet's be honest with where we are.\n\n  In fact, when asked about this point in connection with his own \nnomination, Chief Justice Roberts testified:\n\n       . . . it has not been my general view that I sit in \n     judgment on clients when they come. . . .\n       . . . it was my view that lawyers don't stand in the shoes \n     of their clients, and that good lawyers can give advice and \n     argue any side of a case.\n\n  Basically, he took the same position David Ogden did. The difference \nis every single Republican voted for Chief Justice Roberts. Apparently, \nthey do not use the same standard for those nominated by Democrats.\n  For nominees of Republican Presidents, Republicans demand that their \nclients and their legal representations not be held against nominees. I \nhave heard this speech in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate \nfloor by Republicans: You cannot hold their clients against them.\n  Whoops; screech; stop--the American people elected Barack Obama as \nPresident so, suddenly, the Republicans do not want that rule anymore. \nWhen the American people elect a Democratic President, they do not want \nthe same rules; they want a double standard.\n  I will give one example. It is probably the example that stands out \nthe most. Just over a year ago, every Republican in the Senate voted to \nconfirm Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States. \nThey showed no concern that, according to his own statement, one of his \nmost significant cases in private practice was his representation of \nCarlin Communications, a company that specialized in what was called \n``Dial-a-Porn'' services.\n  When a Republican nominee represents someone for Dial-a-Porn, that is \njust his client. But when a Democratic nominee represents Playboy \nmagazine, oh, that is awful. We are so offended. My gosh, we must have \nthe most delicate sensibilities in America. Talk about a double \nstandard. Where was the outrage then? Where was the debate? Where were \nthe concerns? Where were the questions? Oh, wait just a moment, \nsomething just occurred to me. He was nominated by George W. Bush. Mr. \nOgden has been nominated by Barack Obama. So when Karl Rove and Rush \nLimbaugh gave the orders that they were supposed to oppose and hold up \nEric Holder, the first African-American Attorney General in this \ncountry, they held him up.\n  Every one of them voted unanimously for Alberto Gonzales, who was \nfinally forced out of office for incompetence. But, oh my goodness, Mr. \nOgden has been nominated by a Democrat. What a tough double standard.\n  If you were going to write something like this for a novel or story, \nyour editor would reject it because it seems to be so far-fetched.\n  Let's stop the game playing. We had an election last November. If you \nare going to apply one standard under a Republican President and a \ndifferent one under a Democratic President, stand up and say: This had \nnothing to do with what he did, it is just that we want a double \nstandard. We want a different standard.\n  I have served in the Senate for 35 years. I was honored by my \ncolleagues on both sides of this aisle earlier this week when I cast my \n13,000th vote. I worked with both Democrats and Republicans and voted \nfor nominees of\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\nboth parties. I like to think I have never applied a double standard.\n  In Mr. Ogden's case, it is not as though he is only supported by \nDemocrats. His nomination received dozens of letters of support, \ndrawing strong endorsements from both Democratic and Republican former \nofficials and high-ranking veterans of the Justice Department. Larry \nThompson, a former Deputy Attorney General himself, who is highly \nrespected in this body, certainly highly respected by me--a Republican \nnominee--wrote that ``David will be a superb Deputy Attorney General.''\n  Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, wrote that Mr. Ogden ``possesses the leadership and experience \nthe Justice Department will need to meet the challenges which lay \nbefore us.''\n  A dozen retired military offices who served as Judge Advocates \nGeneral endorsed Mr. Ogden's nomination. These are military persons who \nhave been Judge Advocates General. I have no idea whether they are \nRepublicans or Democrats. I just know they served with distinction in \nour Armed Forces to protect the rights of Americans. Here is what they \nwrote, that he is ``a person of wisdom, fairness and integrity, a \npublic servant vigilant to protect the national security of the United \nStates and a civilian official who values the perspective of uniformed \nlawyers in matters within their particular expertise.''\n  Mr. Ogden's nomination was reported by a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago, having been delayed for several \nweeks. The vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee was 14 to 5. The \nsenior Senator from Minnesota who is now on the Senate floor was also \nthere. The Assistant Republican leader voted for Mr. Ogden. The ranking \nRepublican on the committee voted for Mr. Ogden. The senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina, who served in the Judge Advocate General Corps, \nvoted for him.\n  I don't know what more you can say. You have these former high-\nranking officials, both in the Defense Department and the Justice \nDepartment, of both parties, saying he is the kind of serious lawyer \nand experienced government servant who understands the special role the \nDepartment of Justice must fill in our democracy.\n  We are the Senate. We are supposed to be the conscience of the United \nStates. One hundred of us men and women in this body are privileged to \nrepresent 300 million Americans. We not only represent them, we ought \nto set an example. We ought to say it is time for the slurs and the \nvicious rightwing attacks to stop. The problems and threats confronting \nthe country are too serious. The problems and threats confronting this \ncountry are not problems and threats to just Democrats or just \nRepublicans, they are threats to all Americans.\n  In the Department of Justice, the Attorney General needs a deputy to \nhelp run and manage that Department, not for the personal needs of the \nAttorney General but for the needs of 300 million Americans, to help \nprotect every one of us.\n  Senators should join in voting to confirm this highly qualified \nnominee, this good man, to be Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates. Our country will benefit and we in the Senate will show that we \nactually do know how to do the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the great \nleadership of Chairman Leahy in his work in getting this very important \nnomination to the floor of the Senate. I rise once again in support of \nDavid Ogden to be the next Deputy Attorney General of the United States \nof America.\n  When I drove in to work today, I heard on the news about new \ndevelopments in the Madoff case, about how some people had thought $50 \nbillion had been lost in this country, lost to investors, lost to \npeople who had nothing left, lost to some of the charities and \ncharitable organizations in this country who, during this difficult \ntime, are trying to help people in need. They thought it was $50 \nbillion, but now it was likely $65 billion was lost because of one man, \none man who committed such fraud--one man. That is what is going on in \nthis country today--$65 billion went through the fingers of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and now it is being prosecuted \nunder the jurisdiction of the Justice Department of the United States.\n  Look at the other things going on in this country. We have billions \nof dollars coming out of very important investments in infrastructure \nand broadband and jobs in new energy in this country. But it is an \nunprecedented investment in this country. It is something like $700 \nbillion or $800 billion going out there, and you have the funds being \nused to help some of the credit markets get going again. We all know \nwhen you put money like that out on the market, there are going to be \npeople who try to do bad things. There are going to be people who will \ntry to steal that money, and we need a Justice Department that will \nhold accountable these people who are getting the money; a Justice \nDepartment that will watch over the taxpayers' money, make sure people \nlike Madoff get prosecuted. That is what we need in this country.\n  When you see the difficult economic time we are in--people without \njobs, people who are desperate--it is no surprise oftentimes you see an \nincrease in economic crimes. We see that happening today.\n  We look at all those factors--Government taxpayer money going out on \nthe street, the discovery of cases of people who have been ripping \npeople off so long that it is only when economic times get bad that you \nactually see there is embezzlement going on, and then the natural, sad, \nand unfortunate increase in crime because of difficult economic times. \nAll that is going on, and that is why I say we need a fully functioning \nJustice Department. That means we need a Deputy Attorney General for \nthat Justice Department.\n  Yesterday, at our Judiciary Committee, the chairman himself said Eric \nHolder, the Attorney General, is all alone up there. He needs help. It \nis time to move these nominees.\n  That is why I question why people at this point would be wanting to \ndelay his process, would want to not put someone who is clearly \nqualified to do this job into the Justice Department. We need to fill \nthis post right now, and I have full confidence David Ogden is the \nright man at the right time. Why do I know this?\n  As I said yesterday, we had a great attorney general's office in \nMinnesota for years and years under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, and then something happened. A Republican-appointed \nU.S. attorney, Tom Heffelfinger, was a friend of mine, U.S. attorney \nunder George Bush I and II, who left of his own accord. When he left he \nfound out his name was on a list to be fired. He was replaced with \nsomeone who didn't have management experience, and that office nearly \nblew up over a 2-year period with one person in charge.\n  Now under Attorney General Mukasey we at least have some peace in \nthat office; things have improved. But I saw firsthand, when you put \nsomeone who is not necessarily qualified in a job, when you put someone \nin who is not putting the interests of the State first, I can see what \nhappened. So Eric Holder and his deputies and those who work for him \nhave a big job on their hands.\n  They not only have these white-collar crimes and these enormous \nissues to deal with, they also have a morale issue in the Justice \nDepartment. And no one, no one says that is not true.\n  The way you fix morale in an institution as big as the Justice \nDepartment is you put people in place who have the respect of those who \nare working for them. Look at the numbers. The Department of Justice \nhas more than 100,000 employees and a budget exceeding $25 billion.\n  Every single Federal law enforcement reports to the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, the nomination we are considering today, including the FBI, \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, including the Bureau of Prisons, \nand all 93 U.S. Attorneys Offices in this country.\n  So what do we have here in David Ogden? Well, we have someone who has \nbroad experience in law and in government: went to Harvard Law School, \nclerked for Justice Harry Blackmun--a Minnesotan, may I add--he has \nbeen in the public sector as a key person in the Justice Department \nunder Attorney General Reno. He is someone who also\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\nhas had private sector experience. I personally like that, when someone \nhas been in Government and they have also had some private sector \nexperience representing private clients as well. He is an openminded \nand moderate lawyer with broad support from lawyers of all political \nand judicial philosophies. So here you have someone with 6 years of \nleadership in the Department when the Department's morale was, by all \naccounts, good. We need to put him back in that Department.\n  I know that people on the other side of the aisle--there are a few of \nthem--have raised issues about clients he had in the past. I can tell \nyou as a lawyer, I think any lawyer--and there are plenty of lawyers in \nthis Chamber--has, in fact, represented clients they might not quite \nagree with, and they need to make sure the ethical rules are followed.\n  I know as a prosecutor I chose to represent the State. But there was \nno one I admired more than those defense lawyers who were representing \npeople who were charged with crimes. I did not choose to do that side, \nbut many people did. In our system in the United States of America, \nwhen someone gets in trouble or someone needs a lawyer, that is your \njob as a lawyer. I think that if we use some kind of standard that we \nare going to throw people out of this Chamber because of clients they \nhad represented whom we did not agree with or things they personally \nhad done, it would be a very different Chamber.\n  I think people should be very careful about charges they make and \ndecisions they make about reasons. They can oppose a nomination of \nsomeone if they want, but it better be for the right reasons. I believe \nwe have the right reasons here.\n  I know Chairman Leahy just quoted this, but it is very important to \nremember. At his own confirmation hearing, Chief Justice Roberts said:\n\n       The principle that you don't identify the lawyer with the \n     particular views of the client, or the views that the lawyer \n     advances on behalf of a client, is critical to the fair \n     administration of justice.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       It was my view that lawyers don't stand in the shoes of \n     their clients, and that good lawyers can give advice and \n     argue any side of a case. It has not been my general view \n     that I sit in judgment on clients when they come to me. I \n     viewed that as the job of the Court when I was a lawyer. And \n     just as someone once said, you know, it's the guilty people \n     who really need a good lawyer, I also view that I don't \n     evaluate whether I as a judge would agree with a particular \n     position when somebody comes to me for what I did, which was \n     provide legal advice and assistance.\n\n  So that is what we are talking about here. We have someone in this \ncandidate who has broad support from people who have served in his role \nunder both Democratic and Republican Attorneys General. We have someone \nwho has the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, a major law \nenforcement organization, and someone who has the endorsement of the \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  While at the Department of Justice, David Ogden also led the \nGovernment's defense of various antipornography statutes against \nconstitutional attack, even arguing forcefully against the positions \ntaken by some of those people he had formerly represented.\n  For example, while at the Civil Division, David Ogden defended the \nChild Online Protection Act of 1998, which aimed to protect children \nfrom harmful material on the Internet by requiring pushers of obscene \nmaterial to restrict their sites from access by minors. Under David \nOgden, the Civil Division of the Justice Department aggressively \ndefended that statute.\n  While he was head of the Civil Division, David Ogden also defended \nthe Child Pornography Prevention Act, which expanded the ban on child \npornography to cover virtual child pornography. I know this as a \nprosecutor. I know how damaging this is. We had cases where people who \nwere preying on children would actually see their images on the \nInternet, would figure out who they are. We had one case where we went \nafter someone who met a kid at the mall whom he met on the Internet. \nThen the police looked at all of those images that were on that guy's \nInternet site, and they actually traced them to another kid who did not \neven know her picture was on that Internet site. That is what we are \ntalking about--explicit images that appear to depict minors but were \nproduced without using any real children, or perhaps using a real child \nand putting them in the imagery, computer-generated imagery. That is \nwhat David Ogden did, he protected these statutes. He defended these \nstatutes, and he will continue to do that at the Department of Justice.\n  This strong support for families and children is why David Ogden \nreceived the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's \nendorsement, the Boys and Girls Club of America's endorsement, and, of \ncourse, because of his work with law enforcement, the Fraternal Order \nof Police and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. You think these \norganizations just come and willy-nilly put their names on an \nendorsement, those organizations, venerable organizations that have \nbeen here for so long? No. They would not put their name on the \nendorsement of anyone who did not consider the protection of children \nas one of their paramount goals. They know David Ogden will do that. \nThey know what I know: David Ogden is a man of integrity and commitment \nto the rule of law. He is someone who will work with our Attorney \nGeneral, Eric Holder, to restore credibility to the Justice Department, \nto restore morale, to make it the kind of place where lawyers, the kids \ncoming out of law school, say: That is where I want to work. I want to \ngo work for Eric Holder and David Ogden.\n  That is what we need restored in our Justice Department. That is why \nwe need to move this along the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. She is one of the \nnewest additions to the Senate Judiciary Committee. She has already \nimproved the quality of our committee by just being there.\n  Obviously, having former prosecutors on the committee is something I \nhave searched for and am happy to have. I appreciate what she has \nbrought to us. She was in an era when as a prosecutor she faced things \nI did not have to, such as the online threats to young people, and she \nunderstands what she is saying.\n  I see my good friend from Tennessee on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of David Ogden to be Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  There is simply no excuse for the delay in confirming Mr. Ogden.\n  In 2004, when the 9/11 Commission issued its report on national \nsecurity issues, it specifically recommended that the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral and other national security nominees be confirmed without \ndelay.\n  Let me quote from the Commission's report:\n\n       Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little or no \n     notice, we should minimize as much as possible the disruption \n     of national security policymaking . . . by accelerating the \n     process for national security appointments.\n\n  The report said the President-elect should make his nomination by \nJanuary 20--which President Obama did, he nominated Ogden on January \n5--and the Senate should finish considering the nominee within 30 days.\n  But 66 days later, this nomination is still pending.\n  It is time to get Mr. Ogden in his post so the Department of Justice \ncan get to the important work ahead.\n  David Ogden is an extremely strong nominee, and the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral is a critical official in the Justice Department.\n  The Deputy Attorney General is the second-ranking position in the \nDepartment and plays a large role in national security issues.\n  His responsibilities include overseeing the closing of the detention \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay and the transfer of the remaining 245 \ndetainees to new locations, signing FISA intelligence applications, and \ncoordinating responses to terrorist attacks.\n  He is also responsible for the day-to-day management of the Justice \nDepartment's more than 100,000 employees and its budget of over $25 \nbillion. And he manages the criminal division, the FBI, and the over 90 \nU.S. attorney's offices nationwide.\n  This is a critical position both for the enforcement of our criminal \nlaws\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\nand for keeping Americans safe from harm.\n  President Obama has chosen David Ogden to be the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, and his record shows why:\n  Ogden is a Harvard Law School graduate, and a former clerk to a U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice.\n  He is a nationally recognized litigator with over 25 years of \nexperience and the cochair of the Government and Regulatory Group at \none of DC's top law firms.\n  Mr. Ogden is also a former Deputy General Counsel and legal counsel \nat the U.S. Department of Defense, where he received the highest \ncivilian honor you can receive--the Department of Defense Medal for \nDistinguished Public Service.\n  And he is a former Associate Deputy Attorney General, chief of staff \nand counselor to the Attorney General, and Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Civil Division at the Department of Justice.\n  David Ogden knows the Department of Justice inside and out, and he \nhas already proven that he can be an effective leader.\n  In fact, over 50 individuals and groups have written in to support \nthis nomination.\n  Ogden has the endorsements of:\n\n     the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the \n     Fraternal Order of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs \n     Association, the National Association of Police \n     Organizations, the National District Attorneys' Association, \n     the National Narcotic Officers' Association Coalition, the \n     National Sheriffs' Association, the Community Anti-Drug \n     Coalitions for America, the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children, the National Center for Victims of Crime, \n     the Judge Advocates General, the Boys and Girls Club of \n     America, and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.\n\n  The letters state again and again that Ogden was a standout public \nservant before and that he is highly qualified for the position of \nDeputy Attorney General.\n  Let me read just a few remarks from officials who served in \nRepublican administrations: Paul Cappuccio, the Associate Deputy \nAttorney General under George H.W. Bush, has written:\n\n       I consider myself a judicial and legal conservative, and \n     believe it is important to appoint high-quality individuals \n     who will uphold the rule of law. In my view, David Ogden is . \n     . . a person of the highest talent, diligence, and integrity. \n     He is, in my view, an excellent pick.\n\n  Larry Thompson, who was Deputy Attorney General under George W. Bush, \nhas said that Ogden is ``a person of honor who will, at all times, do \nthe right thing for the Department of Justice and our great country.''\n  And from Richard Taranto, a high-ranking DOJ lawyer under President \nReagan: ``The country could not do better.''\n  This is very strong support for Ogden. I also hope that my colleagues \nwill look closely at his track record as a public servant.\n  During the Clinton administration, Ogden proved himself at every \nturn. In addition to being promoted three times to high level \npositions--from Associate Deputy Attorney General to Chief of Staff to \nAssistant Attorney General--he also received the Attorney General's \nMedal in 1999 and the Edmund J. Randolph Award for Outstanding Service \nin 2001. He took the lead on a landmark lawsuit against the cigarette \ncompanies for lying to the American people about the health risks of \nsmoking. Under his guidance, the Civil Division recovered more than \n$1.5 billion in taxpayer money from Government contractors in the \nhealth care industry and elsewhere that had overbilled the government \nand defrauded the American people. And he vigorously defended the Child \nPornography Prevention Act of 1996 and the Child Online Protection Act \nof 1998.\n  This is a nominee who has proven himself in Government.\n  In his confirmation hearing, Ogden also laid out his priorities for \nthe future. He said his top priorities will be protecting the national \nsecurity, restoring the rule of law, and restoring nonpartisan law \nenforcement at DOJ.\n  He told us that he is committed to making sure that DOJ fights \nfinancial, mortgage and securities fraud effectively.\n  And he pledged in no uncertain terms that if confirmed he would \n``recommend that protecting children and families should be a top \npriority, including through the prosecution of those who violate \nfederal obscenity laws.''\n  In a 2001 speech at Northwestern Law School, Ogden explained to a \ngroup of students that a government lawyer's client is not ``the \nPresident, the Congress, or any agency, although the views of each may \nbe extremely relevant,'' his client is the people of the ``United \nStates.''\n  The American people will be well served by having David Ogden on our \nside. He is an outstanding lawyer and a dedicated public servant.\n  It has been 66 days since President Obama nominated David Ogden to be \nthe Deputy Attorney General.\n  He is a good nominee that should not be held up. Let's let him get to \nwork without any further delay.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to briefly \ndiscuss my opposition to the nomination of David Ogden to be Deputy \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  First, however, I would like to take a minute to respond to \nallegations made yesterday by Senator Leahy, who criticized the ``undue \ndelay'' of David Ogden's nomination and further stated that ``It was \ndisturbing to see that the president's nominee of Mr. Ogden to this \ncritical national security post was held up this long by Senate \nRepublicans apparently on some kind of a partisan whim.'' There was no \nsuch delay. I would like to set the record straight on the Senate's \nprompt consideration of this nominee.\n  President Obama announced Mr. Ogden's nomination on January 5, but \nthe Judiciary Committee did not receive his nomination materials until \nJanuary 23, and he was not officially nominated until January 26. The \ncommittee promptly held a hearing on his nomination on February 5, just \n13 days after receiving his nomination materials. His hearing record \nwas open for written questions for 1 week, until February 12, and Mr. \nOgden returned his responses on February 18 and 19.\n  Following Mr. Ogden's hearing, the Judiciary Committee received an \nunprecedented number of opposition phone calls and letters for a \nDepartment of Justice nominee. In total, the committee has received \nover 11,000 contacts in opposition to his nomination. Despite this \noverwhelming opposition, the committee promptly voted on Mr. Ogden's \nnomination on February 26.\n  I would note that the week prior to the committee's vote on Mr. \nOgden's nomination was a recess week and was the same week the \ncommittee received Mr. Ogden's answers to his written questions. Per \nstandard practice, the committee could not have voted on him prior to \nFebruary 26 because the record was not complete.\n  Rather than hold this controversial nomination over for a week in \ncommittee, which is any Senator's right, Republicans voted on Mr. \nOgden's nomination the first time he was listed, on February 26. Five \nof the eight committee Republicans voted against his nomination, a \nstrong showing of the concern over Mr. Ogden's nomination.\n  And now, just 45 days after Mr. Ogden was nominated and despite \nsignificant opposition, the Senate is poised to vote on his \nconfirmation.\n  Even giving Democrats the benefit of the doubt and allowing that Mr. \nOgden's nomination was announced on January 5, 66 days ago, the Senate \nis still acting as quickly as it has on past Deputy Attorney General, \nDAG, nominees. On average since 1980, Senators have been afforded 65 \ndays to evaluate DAG nominees. Further, Senators were afforded 85 days \nto evaluate the nomination of Larry Thompson, President Bush's first \nDAG nominee and 110 days to evaluate the nomination of Mark Filip. \nYesterday, Senator Leahy said he had ``urged'' the ``fast and complete \nconfirmation'' of Mark Filip and that ``he was.'' If 110 days was a \n``fast'' confirmation, then how is 66 days an ``undue delay?'' In \nshort, I take issue with the chairman's characterization of any ``undue \ndelay'' on this nomination.\n  As a member who shares the concerns of the thousands of individuals \nwho have called the committee, I would now like to explain my \nopposition to David Ogden's nomination to be Deputy Attorney General.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Ogden would be the second-highest ranking official \nin the Department of Justice. The Deputy Attorney General possesses \n``all the power and authority of the Attorney\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\nGeneral, unless any such power or authority is required by law to be \nexercised by the Attorney General personally.'' He supervises and \ndirects all organizational units of the Department, and aides the \nAttorney General in developing and implementing Departmental policies \nand programs. To say the least, this is an important position.\n  America is entitled to the most qualified and judicious person to \nfill such a crucial role. My concern is that David Ogden falls short of \nthose expectations.\n  Mr. Ogden is undoubtedly a bright and accomplished attorney. Although \nhe lacks criminal trial experience that would be helpful in overseeing \nDOJ components such as the Criminal Division, National Security \nDivision, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, FBI, and DEA, it appears he is fit \nto serve as Deputy Attorney General.\n  My concern is with his views on some of the most important issues \nwithin the Department's purview. During Mr. Ogden's time as an attorney \nin private practice, he vigorously defended very sensitive and \ncontroversial issues such as abortion, pornography, the incorporation \nof international law in Constitutional interpretation, and the \nunconstitutionality of the death penalty for minors.\n  While I recognize that lawyers should not necessarily be impugned for \nthe views of their clients, I am particularly concerned about a pattern \nin Mr. Ogden's representations, namely his work on obscenity and \npornography litigation. In these cases, Mr. Ogden has consistently \nargued the side of the pornography producers, opposing legislation \ndesigned to ban child pornography, including the Children's Internet \nProtection Act of 2000 and the Child Protection and Obscenity \nEnforcement Act of 1998.\n  At his hearing and in response to written questions, Mr. Ogden \nmaintained that the views he advocated in these cases were those of his \nclient, and not necessarily his own. While I accept this as plausible, \nI am unsatisfied with Mr. Ogden's unwillingness to answer my specific \nquestions about his own personal beliefs. Discerning such personal \nviews is crucial to adequately evaluating a nominee who may be charged \nwith enforcing the very laws he has opposed in the past.\n  It would not have been hard for Mr. Ogden to distance himself from \nsome of the extreme views he advanced on behalf of his clients. For \nexample, in his brief for the American Psychological Association in \nCasey v. Planned Parenthood, he wrote:\n\n     it is grossly misleading to tell a woman that abortion \n     imposes possible detrimental psychological effects when the \n     risks are negligible in most cases, when the evidence shows \n     that she is more likely to experience feelings of relief and \n     happiness, and when child-birth and child-rearing or adoption \n     may pose concomitant (if not greater) risks of adverse \n     psychological effects for some women depending on their \n     individual circumstances.\n\n  I was disappointed--and somewhat shocked--that, given an opportunity \nto respond to such a statement, the best Mr. Ogden could offer was \nfurther clarification that he was representing the views of client. \nWhen pressed for his personal views on the matter, he refused to \nanswer. As a result, I am left to guess at what this nominee's views \nare on a matter of critical importance.\n  Similarly, I asked Mr. Ogden whether he believes that adult obscenity \ncontributes to the sexual exploitation of children in any way. Further, \nI asked him whether he personally believes that adult obscenity \ncontributes to the demand for prostitutes, and/or women and children \nwho are trafficked into prostitution. His curt response was the same \nfor both questions: ``I have not studied this issue and therefore do \nnot have a personal belief.'' It is hard to believe that a lawyer who \ndevoted significant time and energy throughout his career to \nrepresenting the pornography industry would not have an opinion on \nthese issues.\n  In response to my question about whether he personally believes there \nis a Federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage, he replied: ``I \nhave not studied this issue and therefore have not developed a personal \nview as to whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex \nmarriage.'' I simply find it hard to believe that a lawyer of the \ncaliber and experience possessed by David Ogden has not thought about \nmatters of such widespread public debate.\n  In short, although I am impressed by Mr. Ogden's credentials, his \nlack of candor in response to my questions leaves me guessing about the \napproach he will take to these and other sensitive issues at the \nDepartment of Justice. While former clients or advocacy should not \nnecessarily disqualify a lawyer from such positions, David Ogden did \nnot do enough to distance himself from controversial views he advocated \nin the past, often against the interests of the government. Therefore, \nMr. Ogden's performance throughout this nomination process is not \nenough to overcome the unfortunate presumptions created by his record \nof representation. I am unable to support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business, with the time charged to the \nRepublican side on this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Secretary Geithner\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, this morning Secretary Geithner appeared before the \nBudget Committee. He had good humor. He was resilient. He did a good \njob in his testimony. He said, a variety of times, approximately this: \nThere would be no economic recovery until we fix the banks and get \ncredit flowing again.\n  I would like to make a constructive suggestion to our new President, \nwho I think is an impressive individual, and to Secretary Geithner, \nbecause while that may be the goal of the Government, the country is \nnot yet persuaded the Government will do that or can do that.\n  I asked Secretary Geithner whether he is familiar with a book by \nErnest May, a longtime professor at the Kennedy School of Government at \nHarvard University. The book is called ``Thinking in Time: The Uses of \nHistory for Decision Makers.'' The reason I asked Secretary Geithner \nabout that was because Ernest May's book ought to be required reading \nfor any governmental decision maker. The thesis of the book is that any \ncrisis one may be presented--if you are Secretary of Treasury, \nSecretary of Defense--usually has something in history to teach you a \nlesson. For example, if you are the Kennedy administration dealing with \nthe Cuban missile crisis in the early 1960s, you may want to look back \nto Hitler's invasion of Rhineland in 1936 to see whether we should have \nstopped him then and avoided, perhaps, World War II.\n  Professor May often says one has to be very careful in thinking about \nthe different analogies because you might pick up the wrong analogy and \nthe wrong lesson from history. I would like to suggest to the President \nand to the Secretary of Treasury, in the spirit of Professor May's \nbook, a couple of analogies from history that I believe would help this \ncountry deal with the banking crisis, deal with getting credit flowing \nagain, and begin to get us back toward the economic recovery that we \nall want for our country and that we very badly need.\n  The first example comes from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who \nwas elected after a deep recession, and maybe even a depression was \nalready underway, much worse than today. Mr. President, 5,000 banks had \nfailed, and deposits were not insured. What did President Roosevelt do? \nHe did one thing: Within 2 days after taking the oath of office, he \ndeclared a bank holiday, from March 6 to March 10, 1933. Banking \ntransactions were suspended across the Nation except for making change. \nHe presented Congress with the Emergency Banking Act. The law empowered \nthe President, through the Treasury Department, to reopen banks that \nwere solvent and assist those that were not. The House passed it after \n40 minutes of debate, and the Senate soon followed. Banks were divided \ninto categories. On the Sunday evening before the banks reopened, the \nPresident addressed the Nation through one of his signature fireside \nchats. The President assured 60 million radio listeners in 1933 that \nthe crisis was over and the Nation's banks were secure. By the \nbeginning of April, Americans confidently returned $1 billion to the\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\nbanking system; the bank crisis was over. Now, there was a lot more to \ncome. That was not the end of the Great Depression, but it was the end \nof the bank crisis, and it came because of swift and bold Presidential \nleadership.\n  The lesson I would suggest from that analogy to our nation's history, \nis that President Roosevelt did not try to create the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority and the Civilian Conservation Corps and the PWA and the WPA \nand pack the Supreme Court all in the first month of his term of \noffice.\n  He declared a banking holiday within 2 days after taking office. He \nassured the country that he would fix the problem. He went on the radio \nnot for the purpose of talking about the whole range of problems but to \nsay, on March 12, 1933: I want to talk for a few minutes to the people \nof the United States about banking. And he explained what was going on. \nHe said: We do not want and we will not have another epidemic of bank \nfailures. He said: We have provided the machinery to restore our \nfinancial system.\n  The people believed him. They put money back in the banks because the \nAmerican people were looking for Presidential leadership at that \nmoment. They knew that the Congress or the Governors or other \nindividuals in the country could not fix the bank problem. They knew \nthe President had to fix it. When the President took decisive action \nand said he would fix the problem, the country responded and that part \nof the problem was fixed. The bank crisis was over. That is analogy No. \n1.\n  Analogy No. 2--and I believe the analogy is closer to today's \nchallenge facing President Obama and Secretary Geithner and all of us, \nreally--is President Eisenhower's speech in October 1952 in which he \ndeclared he would end the Korean war. I'd like to read a paragraph from \nthat speech because it seems to me so relevant to the kind of \nPresidential leadership that might make a difference today.\n  President Eisenhower said:\n\n       The first task of a new administration will be to review \n     and re-examine every course of action open to us with one \n     goal in view: to bring the Korean war to an early and \n     honorable end.\n\n  In these circumstances today, one might say to bring the bank crisis \nand the credit freeze to an early, honorable end.\n  President Eisenhower, then a general, not President, said:\n\n       This is my pledge to the American people. For this task a \n     wholly new administration is needed. The reason for this is \n     simple. The old administration cannot be expected to repair \n     what it failed to prevent.\n\n  In other words, the issue in the Presidential election of 1952 was \nchange. That is also familiar. It just happened to be the Republicans \narguing for change at the time.\n  Then the President said:\n\n       That job requires a personal trip to Korea. I shall make \n     that trip. Only in that way could I learn how best to serve \n     the American people in the cause of peace. I shall go to \n     Korea.\n\n  On November 29, in the same month he was elected to the Presidency, \nDwight D. Eisenhower left for Korea.\n  The lesson from that instance in history, as Ernest May would have us \nlook at, is not that President Eisenhower ended the Korean war by \nChristmas or even by Easter of the next year. The lesson is that he \ntold the American people he had one objective in mind. Of all the \nthings going on in 1952--inflation and other problems--he focused on \nthe one that only a President could deal with. He did it in memorable \nterms. We remember the phrase today: I shall go to Korea. The people \nbelieved him. They elected him. They relaxed a little bit. The war was \nended, and the 1950s were a very prosperous time.\n  I wish to make this a constructive and, I hope, timely suggestion \nbecause the President and the Secretary are about to tell us what they \nare going to do about banks. What I would like to suggest is this: they \ndon't need to scare us anymore. Back in Tennessee, we are all pretty \nscared. There are a lot of people who are not sure what is going to \nhappen with the banks. They don't need to explain the whole problem to \nus anymore. That is not what leaders do. Leaders solve problems. Maybe \nit needs to be explained enough so we grasp it, but basically Americans \nare looking for Presidential leadership to solve the problem.\n  I don't think we have to be persuaded that our impressive new \nPresident is capable of doing more than one thing at a time. He may \nhave shown that better than anybody else in history. We have already \nhad two summits--one on health and one on fiscal responsibility. I was \nprivileged to attend one of the summits. I thought it went very well. \nThe President has repealed some of President Bush's orders that he \ndidn't agree with on the environment and stem cell research. The \nPresident has been out to a wind turbine factory in Ohio talking about \nenergy. He has persuaded Congress to spend a trillion dollars, over my \nobjection, but still he was able to do that in the so-called stimulus \nbill. The new Secretary of Education has worked with the President, and \nhe made a fine speech on education the other day. He is doing a lot of \nthings. A lot of things need to be done.\n  The point is, there is one overriding thing that needs to be done \ntoday, and that is to fix the banks and get American credit flowing \nagain. President Roosevelt didn't create the Tennessee Valley Authority \nand the CCC and the WPA during the bank holiday. He fixed the banks. So \nmy respectful suggestion is that our impressive, new President say to \nthe American people as soon as he can, in Eisenhower fashion: I will \nfix the banks. I will get credit flowing again. I will take all these \nother important issues facing the country--health care, education, \nenergy, on which I am eager to work--and I will make them subordinate \nto that goal. In the spirit of President Eisenhower: I will concentrate \nmy full attention on this goal until the job is honorably done; that \njob being, fixing the banks and getting credit flowing again.\n  I genuinely believe that if this President did that, if he, in \neffect, made that speech, cleared the decks, gathered around him the \nbright people he has around him and said to the American people: Don't \nworry, a President can do this and I am going to. That statement would \nbe the beginning of the economic recovery. Because lack of confidence \nis a big part of our problem. This crisis began with $140 oil prices. \nThat was, in the words of FedEx chairman Fred Smith, ``The match that \nlit the fire.'' Then there was the housing subprime mortgage crisis and \nthen banking failures.\n  Now, even in strong community banks in Tennessee, we have people who \nare out of work and who can't pay their small business loans or student \nloans. Some of those banks are beginning to have some problems.\n  We need to interrupt this train. We only have one person who can do \nit. A Senator cannot do it. The Vice President cannot do it. The \nSecretary of the Treasury cannot do it. No Governor can do it. The \nPresident can; only he can do it. Even though he may be able to do many \nthings well at one time, he needs to do one thing until the job is \nhonorably done.\n  My respectful suggestion is that Ernest May's book, which reminds \nleaders to think in terms of history, ``Thinking in Time,'' is a \npowerfully apt book for these times. As the Secretary and the President \nand his advisers think about how to present to the American people what \ntheir plan is, they should remember that a part of it is not only \ndeveloping a strategy. The most important part is persuading at least \nhalf the people they are right. I believe that means clearing the deck: \nno more summits, no more trips in other directions. Focus attention on \nthe problem facing the country until the job is honorably done.\n  In Eisenhower fashion, I hope the President will say: I will fix the \nbanks. I will get credit flowing again. I will concentrate my attention \non that job until it is done.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time during the quorum be split evenly between the \nparties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time \nbe charged equally to both sides.\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of David Ogden to be our Deputy \nAttorney General. In doing so, I will make a few brief points.\n  First, Mr. Ogden is extraordinarily qualified as a lawyer. He has \nserved as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil \nDivision, as the Chief of Staff to Attorney General Janet Reno, as the \nAssociate Deputy Attorney General, and as Deputy General Counsel over \nat the Department of Defense. He has a distinguished government record.\n  He has also been a distinguished lawyer in the private sector, as \nevidenced by his position as cochair of the Government and Regulatory \nLitigation Group at the law firm of WilmerHale. His qualifications for \nthis important position as Deputy Attorney General are exemplified by \nthe support of former Deputy Attorneys General of both parties.\n  Republican Larry Thompson said:\n\n       David is a person of honor who will, at all times, do the \n     right thing for the Department of Justice and our great \n     country. As a citizen, I am extremely grateful that a lawyer \n     of David's caliber again offers himself for public service.\n\n  Democrat Jamie Gorelick wrote that David Ogden ``is a man of unusual \nbreadth and depth who is as well prepared to help lead the Department \nas anyone who has come in at the outset of a new administration can \npossibly be.''\n  Second, now more than ever, the Department needs a competent Deputy \nAttorney General. I will not go back and review the long sad litany of \nproblems--to put it mildly--we saw in the Bush Justice Department. But \nthe incompetence and politicization that ran rampant through that \nbuilding must never be repeated.\n  The Deputy Attorney General is the second ranking member at the \nDepartment, and some have compared the position to a chief operating \nofficer. We need in that office a person who understands what makes the \nDepartment of Justice such an important and unique institution, who is \ncommitted to restoring the Department's honor and integrity, who will \nact independent of political pressure, and who understands the levers \nwithin the building that need to be pulled to get things done. Based on \nmy review of his background and based on his confirmation hearings and \nbased on my personal conversations with David, I believe him to be such \na man.\n\n  I commend Chairman Leahy for his determination to confirm as many \nDepartment nominees as quickly as possible. The Department has more \nthan 100,000 employees and a budget exceeding $25 billion. It is also \ntasked with confronting the most complex and difficult legal challenges \nof our day. The Attorney General must have his leadership team in place \nas quickly as possible. It is March 12 and the Attorney General does \nnot have his Deputy confirmed by this body. Despite some very \nunfortunate delay tactics that have taken place, Chairman Leahy is \ndoing all he can to move these nominees in a careful, deliberate, and \nexpeditious manner. I commend him for that effort and I look forward to \nsupporting him in that effort.\n  I would also add that as a Senator I have found some of the comments \nthat have been made about Mr. Ogden to be very troubling, and certainly \nnot the sort of debate I had in mind when I ran to be a Senator. \nEverybody here who is a lawyer knows that a lawyer in private practice \nhas a duty--a duty--to zealously advocate--to zealously advocate--the \nposition of his client. What makes our system great is that you don't \nhave to win a popularity contest as a client before you can get a \nzealous advocate for your position. Every lawyer is under a duty to \nzealously advocate their client's position.\n  So to take a lawyer who has served in private practice with great \ndistinction and attribute to him personally the views of clients is \nplain dead wrong and strikes at the heart of the attorney-client \nrelationship that is the basis of our system of justice. It is a \nterrible mistake to do that, and particularly to exaggerate those \npositions to the point where he has been accused of supporting things \nsuch as child pornography. It is an appalling misstatement. The major \norganizations that concern themselves with the welfare of children in \nthis country support David Ogden. That should put these false claims to \nrest. However, I do very much regret that the level of debate over \nsomeone such as David Ogden in this historic body has come to a point \nwhere those sorts of charges are being thrown out, completely without \nfactual basis and, in many respects, in violation of what we should as \nSenators understand to be a core principle, which is that a lawyer is \nbound to advocate for his client and to do so does not confer upon the \nlawyer the necessity of agreeing to those views.\n  As somebody who spent a good deal of time in public service as a \nlawyer and who has spent some time in private practice as a lawyer as \nwell, I can tell my colleagues that one of the reasons people come to \npublic service is so they can vindicate the public interest. David, as \nDeputy Attorney General, I have no doubt whatsoever will serve in a way \nthat vindicates the public interest, that protects children, that \nprotects our country, and that serves the law.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to say this, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nbriefly the pending nomination of David Ogden to be Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. I had spoken on the subject in some detail 2 days ago, and my \ncomments appear in the Congressional Record. But I wish to summarize my \nviews today and also to respond to an issue which has been raised about \nundue delay on Mr. Ogden's nomination. There has been no such delay, \nand I think that is conclusively demonstrated on the record.\n  President Obama announced Mr. Ogden's nomination on January 5, but \nthe Judiciary Committee did not receive the nomination materials until \nJanuary 23, and he was not officially nominated until January 26.\n  Then the committee promptly held a hearing on his nomination on \nFebruary 5, 13 days after receiving his nomination materials. His \nhearing record was open for written questions for 1 week, until \nFebruary 12, and Mr. Ogden returned his responses on February 18 and \n19.\n  Following Mr. Ogden's hearing, the Judiciary Committee received an \nunprecedented number of opposition calls and letters--over 11,000 \ncontacts in opposition to the nominee, unprecedented for someone in \nthis position. Despite this opposition, the committee promptly voted on \nMr. Ogden's nomination on February 26.\n  I note that the week prior to the committee's vote on Mr. Ogden's \nnomination was a recess week, and it was the same week the committee \nreceived Mr. Ogden's answers to his written questions. As is the \nstandard practice, the committee would not have voted on him prior to \nFebruary 26 because the record was not complete.\n  Rather than hold this nominee over for a week in committee, which is \nany Senator's right, Republicans voted on Mr. Ogden's nomination for \nthe first time he was listed, on February 26. And now, 45 days after \nMr. Ogden was nominated, the Senate is poised to vote on his \nnomination.\n  Even allowing that Mr. Ogden's nomination was announced on January \n5--66 days ago--the Senate is still acting as quickly as it has on past \nDeputy Attorneys General.\n  On average, since 1980, Senators have been afforded 65 days to \nevaluate Deputy Attorney General nominees. Senators were afforded 85 \ndays to evaluate the nomination of Larry Thompson and 110 days to \nevaluate the nomination of Mark Filip, both nominated by President \nGeorge W. Bush. In fact, we are voting on Mr. Ogden's nomination faster \nthan any of President Bush's nominees: Larry Thompson, 85 days; James \nComey, 68 days; Paul McNulty, 147 days; and Mark Filip, 110 days. I \nbelieve these facts put to rest any allegation there was any delay.\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\n  I spoke on Wednesday urging my colleagues to move promptly, noting I \nhad a call from Attorney General Holder who said he was needed. Not \nhaving had any top-level people confirmed, I think the Attorney \nGeneral's request is a very valid one. In my position as ranking \nmember, I am pushing ahead and trying to get the Ogden nomination voted \non.\n  On Wednesday, I noted the fine academic record and professional \nrecord and put his resume into the Record, so I need not do that again.\n  I noted on Wednesday in some detail the opposition which had been \nraised by a number of organizations--Family Research Council, headed by \nTony Perkins; Fidelis, a Catholic-based organization; the Eagle Forum; \nand the Alliance Defense Fund--on the positions which Mr. Ogden had \ntaken in a number of cases. I also noted the judgments that when Mr. \nOgden took those positions, he was in an advocacy role and is not to be \nheld to those policy positions as if they were his own.\n  I noted that the Judiciary Committee is taking a close look at other \nnominees--Elena Kagan, for example--on the issue of whether she \nadequately answered questions. I am meeting with her later today. Her \nnomination is pending. Also, the nomination of Ms. Dawn Johnsen \ninvolving the issue of her contention that denying a woman's right to \nchoose constitutes slavery and a violation of the 13th amendment.\n  I believe on balance Mr. Ogden ought to be confirmed, as I said on \nWednesday, noting the objections, noting the concerns, and contrasting \nthem with his academic and professional record. He took advocacy \npositions well recognized within the profession, but that is a lawyer's \nresponsibility. He cannot be held to have assumed those positions as \nhis own policy.\n  We will later today take up the nomination of the Associate Attorney \nGeneral. While I have the floor, I think it appropriate to make some \ncomments regarding this nomination.\n  Thomas Perrelli is the nominee. He has an outstanding academic \nrecord: a graduate of Brown University, Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum \nlaude, very substantial indicators of academic excellence. Then Harvard \nLaw School, again magna cum laude, 1991; managing editor of the Harvard \nLaw Review. He clerked for Judge Lamberth in the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia. He has been an associate at Jenner & \nBlock; counsel to the Attorney General; Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral; and later a partner in Jenner & Block. He was named to the \n``40 under 40'' list by the National Law Journal; a recipient of the \nJenner Pro Bono Award; and recognized as one of Lawdragon's 500 ``New \nStars, New Worlds.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nhis resume.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Thomas J. Perrelli\n\n\n                       Associate Attorney General\n\n       Birth: 1966, Falls Church, Virginia.\n       Residence: Arlington, Virginia.\n       Education: A.B., Brown University, magna cum laude, 1988; \n     Phi Beta Kappa, 1987; J.D., Harvard Law School, magna cum \n     laude, 1991; Managing Editor, Harvard Law Review.\n       Employment: Law Clerk, Honorable Royce C. Lamberth, U.S. \n     District Court for the District of Columbia, 1991-1992; \n     Associate, Jenner & Block LLP, Washington , DC, 1992-1997; \n     Counsel to the Attorney General (Janet Reno), U.S. Department \n     of Justice, 1997-1999; Deputy Assistant Attorney General, \n     U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, 1999-January \n     2001; Unemployed, January 2001-June 2001; Partner, Jenner & \n     Block LLP, Washington, DC, 2001-Present; Managing Partner, \n     Washington, DC office, 2005-Present; Co-Chair, Entertainment \n     and New Media Practice.\n       Selected Activities: Named to ``40 under 40,'' National Law \n     Journal, 2005; Recipient, Albert E. Jenner, Jr. Pro Bono \n     Award, Jenner & Block, 2005; Recognized as one of Lawdragon's \n     500 ``New Stars, New Worlds,'' 2006; Named Best Intellectual \n     Property Lawyer in Washington, DC by Washington Business \n     Journal, 2008; Recognized as leading media and entertainment \n     lawyer, Chambers & Partners USA, 2007-2008; Member, American \n     Bar Association.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there had been some question raised as to \nMr. Perrelli's representation of clients in a couple of cases--\nincluding the American Library Association v. Attorney General Reno, \nwhere he appeared on behalf of a coalition of free speech groups and \nmedia entities (including Penthouse) arguing that the Child Protection \nRestoration and Penalties Enhancement Act of 1990 criminalized material \nin violation of the first amendment.\n  There were a number of letters filed by pro-life organizations, \nincluding the Pennsylvania Family Institute, International Right to \nLife Federation, Family Research Council, and the National Right to \nLife Committee. We have evaluated those issues closely.\n  I questioned Mr. Perrelli in some detail on the position he took in \nthe Terri Schiavo case where he claimed the Federal court did not have \njurisdiction. It seems to me as a legal matter, the State court did not \nhave exclusive jurisdiction, that the Federal court could take \njurisdiction under Federal doctrines. He defended his position saying \nthat he was taking an advocate's role, and he thought it was a fair \nargument to make. My own view was that it was a little extreme.\n  I think all factors considered, the objections which have been raised \nof Mr. Perrelli as Associate Attorney General turn almost exclusively \non positions he took as an advocate. I believe his outstanding academic \nand professional record support confirmation.\n  Again, we are taking a very close look at all of the nominees but, on \nbalance, it seems to me that is the appropriate judgment. Here, again, \nwe are almost 2 months into a new administration and the Attorney \nGeneral does not have any upper echelon assistants. These confirmations \nwill provide that assistance.\n  I think it is fair to note that Mr. Perrelli's nomination was \nsupported overwhelmingly in the committee, the same conclusion I came \nto. It was a 17-to-1 vote in his favor. Only one Senator voted no and \none Senator voted to pass. That is showing pretty substantial support.\n  I thank the Chair. I note the presence of the distinguished chairman \nof the committee, so I yield the floor to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand my time has been used. We are \nsupposed to vote at 2 p.m. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nuse the time until 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if Senator Leahy would like my time, he \nis welcome to all of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania for his support of both David Ogden and Thomas Perrelli, \nboth superbly qualified candidates, both of whom will be confirmed this \nafternoon. I will speak further about Mr. Perrelli after this vote.\n  Again, I go back to David Ogden. David Ogden has been strongly \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats, those who served in the Bush \nadministration and other administrations. I thought it was a scurrilous \nattack on him because he and his firm supported libraries, supported \nperfectly legal publications, and some Republicans saying they could \nnot vote for him because of that.\n  I note that these same Republicans all voted for Michael Mukasey, a \nfine gentleman, to be Attorney General, who listed as one of his \nprimary cases his representation of the TV channel that carries ``Dial-\na-Porn.''\n  Now, certainly when a Republican, nominated by a Republican, \nrepresented Dial-a-Porn, that seems to be wrong; when a Democrat, \nnominated by a Democrat, represents libraries and basically a \nmainstream men's magazine, that is wrong.\n  I hope we will avoid in the future such double standards. I see a man \nwho has helped children, who has volunteered his time, who has given \ngreat charity to children, and who has been supported by the Boys and \nGirls Clubs, by the Missing and Exploited Children's groups, by the \nNational District Attorneys Association, and by every major law \nenforcement organization.\n  So, Mr. President, I know time has expired, and I would ask for the \nyeas and nays on confirmation of the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof David W. Ogden, of Virginia, to be Deputy Attorney General?\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the agreement on the Perrelli \nnomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is to be 90 minutes of debate, evenly \ndivided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am only going to speak for 2 or 3 \nminutes. I have had a number of Senators, both Republican Senators and \nDemocratic Senators, ask if there is a possibility of this to be a \nvoice vote. A number of them have airplanes to catch. I mention that \nfor Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  I am perfectly willing at some appropriate time to yield back all our \ntime and have a voice vote on President Obama's nomination of Thomas J. \nPerrelli to be the Associate Attorney General, the number three \nposition at the Justice Department. He is a superbly qualified veteran \nof the Department of Justice who has chosen to leave a lucrative \nprivate practice to return to public service. This nomination was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee one week ago by a strong, \nbipartisan vote of 17-1. I thank Senator Specter, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Kyl, Senator Sessions, Senator Graham and Senator Cornyn for \ntheir support of this important nomination.\n  Given Tom Perrelli's background and qualifications, this strong \nsupport is no surprise. He is the managing partner of the Washington, \nD.C. office of Jenner & Block. Before that he held important posts at \nthe Justice Department, earning a reputation for independence and \nintegrity, as well as the respect of career lawyers at the Department. \nMr. Perrelli joined the Justice Department in 1997 as Counsel to the \nAttorney General. In that role, Mr. Perrelli assisted the Attorney \nGeneral in overseeing the civil litigation components of the Department \nof Justice, and also worked on a wide variety of special projects, \nincluding professional responsibility issues for Department attorneys, \nand law enforcement in Indian Country.\n  From 1999 to 2001, Mr. Perrelli served as Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Civil Division, supervising the Federal Programs Branch. \nThat branch defends Federal agencies in important constitutional, \nregulatory, national security, personnel and other litigation. In \naddition, he played a leading role on significant policy issues ranging \nfrom medical records privacy, the use of adjusted figures in the census \nto Indian gaming, and social security litigation.\n  A Phi Beta Kappa graduate from Brown University and graduate of \nHarvard Law School where he served as the Managing Editor of the \nHarvard Law Review, Mr. Perrelli has demonstrated throughout his years \nin Government that he understands that the role of the Department of \nJustice is to be the people's lawyer, with first loyalty to the \nConstitution and the laws of the United States. He clerked for Judge \nRoyce Lamberth, a no nonsense judge. In private practice, first as an \nassociate at Jenner & Block from 1992 to 1997 and then, again, from \n2001 to the present where he became a partner and then the managing \npartner of its well-respected Washington office, he is recognized as an \noutstanding litigator and manager. He will need all those skills to \ncall on all his experience in the challenging work ahead.\n  Numerous major law enforcement organizations have endorsed Mr. \nPerrelli's nomination, including the National President of the \nFraternal Order of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and the \nNational Association of Police Organizations. Paul Clement, who worked \nfor Senator Ashcroft and then Attorney General Ashcroft and was \nappointed by President Bush to be Solicitor General, wrote that career \nprofessionals at the Department who had worked with Mr. Perrelli ``held \nhim in uniformly high regard'' and that Mr. Perrelli's ``prior service \nin the Department should prepare [him] to be a particularly effective \nAssociate Attorney General.'' He also described Mr. Perrelli as ``an \nincredibly skilled lawyer'' whose ``skills would serve both Tom and the \nDepartment very well if he is confirmed as the Associate Attorney \nGeneral.''\n  I urge the Senate to confirm Tom Perrelli to the critical post for \nwhich President Obama has nominated him. I look forward to \ncongratulating him, his wife Kristine and their two sons, James and \nAlexander on his confirmation.\n  I will withhold the remainder of my time. Before I do that, I know \nthe floor staff on both parties are seeing whether it is possible to \nshorten the time. If it is--I am stuck here this afternoon, but for \nthose Senators who are trying to grab a flight out of here, it would be \ngood to let them know. I retain the remainder of my time. I see a \ndistinguished former member of our committee, the Senator from Kansas, \non the floor. I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the case of Mr. \nPerrelli, nominated to be Associate Attorney General. I rise to speak \nin opposition to the nomination. I will not be long, but I think there \nis an important policy issue that needs to be discussed.\n  I would be prepared to yield back time after that point in time. I do \nnot know if we have other people who desire to speak, so Members could \nmove on about their busy day.\n  I do think we have an important discussion here. I have no doubt of \nthe qualifications of Mr. Perrelli to be Associate Attorney General. I \nthink from what the chairman has stated--and I have no reason to \ndispute what the chairman has stated about the qualifications of Mr. \nPerrelli. I think they are good. I do not ascribe bad motives \nwhatsoever to him or anybody. But I think there is a very important \npolicy discussion that needs to take place here, with an opportunity to \nvote, before we put this individual third in command of the Justice \nDepartment, to oversee management of the Department's day-to-day \noperations, including formulating departmental policies.\n  Concerns have been raised with regard to Mr. Perrelli's nomination to \nbe Associate Attorney General primarily due to his pro bono \nrepresentation of Terri Schiavo's husband, Michael\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\nSchiavo, in his effort to allow the starvation to take place, and the \ndehydration, of his wife. The death that took place several years ago \ncaptured the discussion and the thoughts in the country about issues \nabout the quality of life and whether we protect life that is in a \ndiminished qualitative state. It was a tough discussion. It was a tough \ndebate. I was here and involved with it, as were a number of other \nindividuals. It was one that went back and forth for some period of \ntime. Terri Schiavo, as I might remind a number of individuals, was in \na very difficult mental condition. Her husband was desiring to withhold \nfood and water from Terri Schiavo.\n  The family members of Terri Schiavo: No, we should not do this. We \nshould allow her to continue to live. Food, water--provide those items \nto her.\n  It pulled back and forth on people. And the fundamental root question \ninvolved in it is, Do we put a subjective value on human life or is all \nhuman life sacred, per se, in an objective sense? Because it is human \nlife, is it sacred, per se, or is there some sort of threshold issue we \nshould be considering on whether we protect human life to the degree \nfully that we can and certainly on the issues of providing food and \nwater? That was kind of the policy discussion and that was the \nconundrum we were in as a country because people could see both sides \nof this issue and say: Gosh, she is in a difficult spot as an \nindividual. Her husband says: Let's withhold food and water. The family \nsays: No. And the country was brought into the discussion, the debate, \nas was this body.\n  Mr. Perrelli was pro bono, representing for free, Michael Schiavo, in \nthis case, who was the primary proponent to withhold food and water for \nTerri Schiavo. I think before we put a person who took that position--\nhe did this for free--into the No. 3 position at the Justice Department \nof the United States, we should discuss that because people are policy \nand what they view and what they stand for does find its way into \npolicy apparatus for the United States of America. And this is a key \nissue for us.\n  I want to put it very clearly. While there is a lot of emotion \nsurrounding this, there is a fundamental policy question, as I \nmentioned a bit earlier, about this, and that is the basic issue of, do \nwe view human life sacred, per se, or does the dignity that we treat \nindividuals with depend on their physical or mental status as human \nbeings? And we shouldn't get around the starkness of that debate. It is \na stark debate, but it is an important one, and I think clearly we \nshould err on the side of saying: If this is a human person, then they \nare regarded as fully human with all human rights regardless of any \nsort of diminished physical or mental capacity they might have. To hold \ndifferently than that would be for us to say that some people are more \nequal than others, that some have more rights--or some have fewer \nrights than other individuals do. And we have been in that sort of \npolicy discussion before, and we have always regretted it. We are at \nour best when we are standing for the weakest people amongst us, with \nthe most diminished, with the most difficulty. These are the ones we \nwant to stand for the most.\n  One of the proud moments for me here in our body was to work a bill \nwith Senator Kennedy on helping to get more Down's Syndrome children \nhere born alive because right now about 90 percent of them are killed \nin utero. We worked on a way to have an adoption registry and an effort \nto recognize that these are valuable people and we should not say that \nbecause of their difficulty here, they should be regarded as less \nhuman. That is not a position that upholds the nature and traditions \nand ideals of the United States of America.\n  If a subjective judgment of qualify of life is what determines the \nvalue of an individual or the protections accorded to that individual, \nthis has enormous implications for all of us, both for the way we \nconduct our own lives and the way we order our society. If we have a \nfundamental mandate to protect the most vulnerable amongst us, not just \nthose who have social or political influence or those who are regarded \nas productive, a reordering of our priorities and our laws becomes \nnecessary.\n  Ultimately, the debate over Terri Schiavo was not one about States \nrights or medical ethics or end-of-life decisions; it was about whether \nwe measure life by a subjective or an objective test. That is the \nfundamental debate point here. Is it a subjective determination? If you \nhit enough of these criteria, you are given full human rights? If you \nhave a few of these, too few of these, you are not given full human \nrights? Or is it an objective test? You are a human, of the species, \nyou have full human rights in all situations, and you are certainly \nentitled to food and water even if are you in a difficult mental \ncondition.\n  I believe this is a very important debate, and now we are seeing more \nof the country enter into it, end-of-life issues on the sacredness of \nhuman life: Does it exist at the end of life or not? Do we have these \nobjective or subjective tests?\n  Mr. Perrelli--by all accounts a good lawyer--comes out on one point \nof view. He comes out on the point of view that we can look at these in \nsubjective ways, representing the client in this who looked at a \nsubjective quality-of-life case. Of all of the qualified lawyers in the \nUnited States--and there are many brilliant lawyers in the United \nStates--why would we insist upon putting in as the No. 3 lawyer at the \nJustice Department one who has a point of view that is so stark on this \nand so against the view of most Americans, who would view all human \nlife objectively as being beautiful, as being sacred, as being \nsomething worthy of protection? Now, as people are policy, you put \nsomeone into the No. 3 position at the Justice Department who holds a \nvery radical point of view on this, of all of the qualified lawyers \nthat are across the United States. The signal that sends across the \nsociety is, OK, there is a shift taking place here: we are not going to \nfocus on human life as objectively sacred, we are going to view it as \nsubjectively needing to meet criteria to protect.\n  That may be seen as too stark, but that was the stark question that \nwas put forward in the Terri Schiavo case, and that was the stark \nquestion this nominee decidedly went to one side on. He could have \nstayed out of it, could have not been involved whatsoever. But he \ndidn't. He freely and ``freely'' got involved in this case on one side \nin a radical direction that I believe is wrong for the country to take.\n  It will be clearly possible that cases involving euthanasia or other \nend-of-life issues may come before the Federal courts during his tenure \nin office. With cases in Oregon, the State of Washington, probably \nbeing considered in other States, it is highly likely, actually, that \nthese cases will come forward. I am deeply concerned that Mr. \nPerrelli's view of this, while so decidedly on one side of it, will not \nbe an objective observer or enforcer of current U.S. law. I think that \nis a step back for us protecting and defending the sanctity of basic \nhuman life.\n  This is something I think all of us in our own heart of hearts \nabsolutely agree, that human life is sacred, it is sacred at all \nstages, and it is sacred in all places. But now we are presented with a \npolicy choice in a person. I would hope that people, as they would look \nat this, would say that is not a direction we should be going, that is \nnot a direction we should be tilting in this country as we deal with \nthese end-of-life issues coming at a very rapid pace in front of \nlegislative bodies at the State level, and I believe they will come \nhere, and I believe they will enter their way into the courts.\n  For all of these reasons, I really don't believe we should go this \nroute. I will be voting against Mr. Perrelli even though I believe him \nto be a qualified individual because of the stark position, the \nnegative position he has taken, the subjective view he has expressed \nwith his advocacy of the view of human life in this very important \nposition.\n  I will retain the balance of the time in case other issues are \nraised, if there are other issues that are raised. If there are not \nother issues that are raised, I do not know if we have other people to \nspeak on our side. I would be willing to yield back. But if other \ndebate points are raised, then I would like to have a few minutes to \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would yield on that point. I disagree with \nhim\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\non this. I do not believe Mr. Perrelli is a right-to-die advocate or \nthat the positions he represented on behalf of clients was extreme. In \nfact, all seven justices of the Florida Supreme Court, most appointed \nby Republican governors, agreed with Mr. Perrelli's argument. They \nstruck down unanimously the law that gave Governor Jeb Bush authority \nover Ms. Schiavo's medical care.\n  It is wrong to caricature Mr. Perrelli as a ``right to die'' \nadvocate. Mr. Perrelli did not become involved in the Schiavo \nlitigation to further any personal or political agenda and did not \nbecome involved in the litigation when the issue was Ms. Schiavo's \nwishes. In fact, he did not become involved in the case until after the \nFlorida State courts had fully and finally litigated the question of \nMs. Schiavo's wishes and her medical condition. Mr. Perrelli's concern \nwas for an unprecedented challenge to the judicial process. He argued \nthat the Florida Legislature passed a law that imposed one set of rules \non Ms. Schiavo and a different set of rules on everyone else in \nFlorida. And he was proven right, when the Florida Supreme Court \nunanimously struck down the law taking the decisions out of the hands \nof the family and giving them to the Governor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the long list of those who have written \nto the committee in support of Mr. Perrelli's nomination be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Letters of Support for the Nomination of Thomas J.

This list includes numerous major law enforcement \norganizations that have endorsed Mr. Perrelli's nomination, including \nthe National President of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Major \nCities Chiefs Association, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations. It also includes Paul Clement, who worked for Senator \nAshcroft and then Attorney General Ashcroft and was appointed by \nPresident Bush to be Solicitor General.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to make a very brief \nstatement explaining my opposition to the nomination of Thomas \nPerrelli, to be Associate Attorney General at the Department of \nJustice. Like other DOJ nominees, Mr. Perrelli's past advocacy includes \nwork affecting obscenity. In particular, he signed a brief attacking \nthe Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act of 1990 \nfor ``criminaliz[ing] the production and distribution of `sexually \nexplicit' speech unless the producer and distributor comply with \nburdensome recordkeeping and labeling requirements.'' The brief was \nfiled on behalf of Penthouse, the American Library Association, and \nothers, whom the brief collectively describes as ``mainstream national \nmedia entities.''\n  To be clear, I recognize and respect that lawyers are entitled to \nrepresent any client they choose. I do not believe that arguments \nadvanced on behalf of a client necessarily reflect the lawyer's views. \nMoreover, I do not believe that examining past advocacy is sufficient \nor appropriate to ascertain the beliefs of a particular nominee, much \nless disqualify him. It does, however, invite legitimate questions \nabout what a nominee's personal views are on those same matters.\n  Therefore, at his hearing, I asked Mr. Perrelli whether he believed \nthat adult obscenity contributed in any way to the exploitation of \nchildren. He told me that he had not reviewed the science, so I sent \nhim four studies to review after the hearing, asking him to respond \nwith comments. His response was wholly inadequate. He said:\n\n       I have reviewed the two summaries you forwarded, compiled \n     by a social scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, \n     which indicate her view that exposure to extreme forms of \n     pornography can teach behaviors, including the sexual \n     exploitation of children. It appears there is a great deal of \n     literature on the subject, and without a comprehensive \n     examination of the research, I am hesitant to come to any \n     firm conclusions on the science.\n\n  Even after reviewing certain studies concluding that there is a \nconnection between pornography and child exploitation, which Mr. \nPerrelli recognized, the most he could say in response was that he was \nhe needed to review even more science before reaching any conclusions. \nBecause Mr. Perrelli refused to recognize even the possibility of such \na connection, or otherwise shed light on his own personal views, I am \nunsure how he will approach issues of obscenity and exploitation at the \nDepartment. Therefore, I am unable to support Mr. Perrelli's \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all debate \ntime on the Perrelli nomination be yielded back and that the provisions \nof the previous order governing this nomination remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I object in that I want to raise one additional point. \nAnd I do believe we should have a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The additional point I would raise on this is that my \ncolleague points to the Florida Supreme Court. I note that half of the \nDemocrats in this body who returned to vote on the Terri Schiavo case \nvoted in favor of Terri Schiavo's family. I think there was a clear \nview on this, and that is my point, when you get a radical position put \nforward that looks at this in a subjective sense.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would be willing to yield back time. I do \nwant a recorded vote to take place.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all debate \ntime on the Perrelli nomination be yielded back and that the provisions \nof the previous order governing this nomination remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Thomas John Perrelli, of Virginia, to be Associate Attorney General \nof the United States?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my apprehension \nregarding the closure of the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center in Cuba. I \nhave several concerns regarding the transfer and disposition of the \nenemy combatants detained there in response to the attacks of September \n11, 2001.\n  Here we are, almost 8 years removed from that fateful Tuesday morning \nwhen terrorists murdered 3,000 of our citizens at the Pentagon, the \nWorld Trade Center complex, and on hijacked flights. On that day, we \nwere caught flatfooted and hit with a right cross. Many of us who were \nhere in Congress in the days that followed 9/11 swore we would provide \nthe President and the Nation with whatever tools were necessary to \nensure that we would never be caught by surprise again.\n  So on September 18, 2001, Congress sent to President Bush the \nAuthorization to Use Military Force. This was signed into law. Twenty-\nsix days after the attacks on New York and Washington, we commenced \nmilitary operations in Afghanistan. We had identified our enemy and \ndetermined the location of his base of operation and where this \ntreacherous plot had been devised. We took the fight to the Taliban and \nal-Qaida and engaged them in Afghanistan. In the course of those \nengagements, U.S. and coalition forces captured enemy combatants.\n  Early in 2002, enemy combatants who were seized on the battlefield \nbegan arriving at Guantanamo for detention. In 2004, the Supreme Court \nissued an opinion in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that, as a necessary incident to \nthe AUMF, the President is authorized to detain persons captured while \nfighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan until the cessation of hostilities. \nAt one time, nearly 800 detainees were housed at Guantanamo. \nApproximately 525 detainees have been transferred to other countries \nfor detention or released outright and returned to their country of \nresidence. Approximately 60 detainees who were released were later \nrecaptured on the field of battle in Afghanistan or have again taken up \narms against the United States on other fronts.\n  Recently, as reported this year in the January 23 edition of the New \nYork Times, a former Guantanamo detainee from Saudi Arabia has \nresurfaced as No. 2 in charge of al-Qaida in Yemen.\n  There he is, as shown in this picture: Said Ali al-Shihiri, deputy \nleader for al-Qaida in Yemen; also known as Abu Sayyaf al-Shihiri and \nalso as Abu-Sufyan al-Azidi; and also known as Guantanamo detainee No. \n372. He was released from Guantanamo in November 2007. He planned the \nU.S. Embassy attack in Yemen in September 2008.\n  Furthermore, it is believed this man was involved in the planning of \nan attack on the American Embassy in Yemen last September. This \nterrorist assisted in the murder of 10 Yemeni citizens and 1 American--\nformer Guantanamo detainee No. 372.\n  The Washington Post recently ran a 2-day installment profiling a \nGuantanamo detainee from Kuwait: Abdullah Saleh al-Ajmi, also known as \nGuantanamo detainee No. 220, released from Guantanamo in November 2006, \nand detonated a truck bomb in Mosul, Iraq, in March 2008.\n  He was released and subsequently traveled to Syria and snuck into \nIraq. Ultimately, this terrorist drove a truck packed with explosives \ninto a joint American and Iraqi military training camp and blew himself \nup, taking 13 Iraqi soldiers with him--former Guantanamo detainee No. \n220.\n  In March of 2004, a released detainee returned to Pakistan to again \ntake up the fight against coalition forces as an insurgent. His name is \nAbdullah Mehsud. This former detainee, in July 2007, killed himself in \nengagement. He was responsible for the kidnapping of Chinese nationals \nin Pakistan. After Pakistani forces began to close in on him, he blew \nhimself up with a grenade.\n  These are just a few of the examples that illustrate how precarious \nit can be to release these detainees to other nations. We are \noutsourcing the security of our Nation to other countries. Shouldn't we \nbe cautious and examine who we are letting free? Who is taking custody \nof these detainees? What security precautions and monitoring measures \nare in place to ensure they stay incarcerated or remain accountable?\n  If we shelve the only DOD strategic interrogation facility we have \nand cannot place these detainees with confidence in other countries, \nwill we be forced to transfer these enemy combatants to the United \nStates? Removing these detainees from a secure military facility with \nan airport, a highly trained security force, a secure infrastructure, \nand located on an island outside the continental United States is, in \nmy opinion, reckless. Bringing these detainees to the continental \nUnited States is tantamount to injecting a virus into a healthy body.\n  On January 22, 2009, President Obama signed three Executive orders \npertaining to Guantanamo and the enemy combatants detained there. He \nhas ordered the closure of the detention facility within 12 months. He \nhas also required that any detainees presently in custody be treated \nhumanely and in accordance with the Army Field Manual. In fact, this \norder references the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, an act passed by \nCongress that required that the treatment of the detainees comply with \nthe Army Field Manual. The objective of this order was already \nfulfilled by the passing of that law.\n  The third order commissioned a task force to conduct a comprehensive \nreview of options available that will provide a solution and final \ndisposition for the detainees at Guantanamo. The Executive order \nclosing Guantanamo states:\n\n       Prompt and appropriate disposition of individuals currently \n     detained at Guantanamo and closure of the facilities in which \n     they are detained would further the national security and \n     foreign policy interests of the United States.\n\n  Now, presently, approximately 245 detainees designated as ``enemy \ncombatants'' are housed at Guantanamo. The possibility of returning a \nmajority of these detainees to their home country or a third country so \nthat we can rid ourselves of this issue troubles me, nor does it strike \nme as particularly sophisticated in the analysis of how other countries \nsee us. There is no doubt that among some European elites, their \nopinions on the previous administration became more negative as the \nyears went by. There is no doubt that this was also reflected amongst\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\nthe broader populations who have tended toward liberalism for decades. \nOpinions from other parts of the world are harder to measure, of \ncourse, as it is difficult to measure the views of populations living \nunder various types of autocratic government.\n  Negative international opinion should not be exaggerated for a number \nof reasons. First and most obvious, leadership, particularly in \ndifficult times, should not be directed by polls. This is true \ndomestically, and it certainly is true of foreign polls. It is neither \nour job nor the administration's job to represent foreign populations. \nDecisions in Government should not be made by leaders sticking their \nfingers in the air to see which way the wind is blowing.\n  Second, appealing to foreign popularity completely disregards the \nunique role this Nation has played in advancing global security. It \nalso disregards the historic debates in which leftwing parties have \nadvanced their ideology. But we should not ignore that there has been \nunprecedented--unprecedented--cooperation from the same Democratic \ngovernments whose liberal disdain so succors some in the opposition \nhere on all matters of national security. Cooperation from these \ngovernments on diplomatic, military, intelligence, law enforcement, and \nhumanitarian assistance has been the norm, not the exception, \nregardless of disputes on Iraq policy and on those governments' views \non Guantanamo.\n  In terms of foreign policy, I would much rather have the cooperation \nof a government than its approval, although I recognize that in some \ncases the approval facilitates the cooperation. But realistically \nspeaking--and this is a subject that ought to be steeped in realism--\npopularity is not a prerequisite for hard-headed cooperation against a \ncommon threat.\n  I wish to quote what columnist Tom Friedman--who is certainly not a \ncheerleader for the Republican Party--said about foreign policy thinker \nMichael Mandelbaum, who is usually associated with Democratic policies:\n\n       When it comes to the way other countries view America's \n     preeminent role in the world--\n\n  Writes Friedman, who then quotes Mandelbaum--\n\n     whatever its lifespan, three things can be safely predicted: \n     The other countries will not pay for it; they will continue \n     to criticize it; and they will miss it when it is gone.\n\n  I would urge the policymakers in this administration, as well as my \ncolleagues in the majority party, to consider this wisdom expressed by \nDemocratic thinkers the next time they engage in the canard that we \nneed to change our policy to improve our standing with other nations. \nLet's hope this is not the main reason to shutter Guantanamo because, \nif it is, it is a slim and irresponsible reason.\n  Prior to the issuance of the Executive order, I received a briefing \non the President's intention to close Guantanamo. I would endorse an \napproach that would have commissioned a 1-year review process rather \nthan coming out and declaring closure within a year. It strikes me that \nthe study should come before the decision, not accompany it.\n  On his second full day in office, the President, without his Attorney \nGeneral in place, issued this order, and I fear he painted himself into \na corner. Two weeks ago, Attorney General Holder visited Guantanamo \nBay. His public comment on his visit was the following:\n\n       I think it is going to take us a good portion of that time \n     to really get our hands around what Guantanamo is and what \n     Guantanamo was.\n\n  I am sure Attorney General Holder saw what I saw at Guantanamo when I \nvisited there. I am sure he saw the impressive infrastructure, with \nmedical, recreational, and legal facilities. Attorney General Holder is \na good man, and I am glad the President has made him the point man on \nthis issue, but his comments are indicative of the fact that the \ncomplexities surrounding Guantanamo cannot be solved by the stroke of a \npen on an Executive order.\n  On February 23, 2009, the Department of Defense submitted a report to \nthe White House titled ``Compliance With the President's Executive \nOrder on Detainee Conditions of Confinement at Guantanamo Bay.'' The \nSecretary of Defense tasked a special team to review the treatment of \ndetainees and the conditions at Guantanamo in response to the \nPresident's order of January 22, 2009. The review team focused on \nmyriad issues, especially housing, medical treatment, food services, \nreligious freedom, access to attorneys, mail, security, use of force, \ninterrogation, discipline, and intellectual stimulation.\n  During its 13-day investigation, the review team reviewed hours upon \nhours of videotapes, reports, and important records. Team members also \nconducted more than 100 interviews of base leadership, support staff, \ninterrogators, and guards. Moreover, they conducted unannounced spot \nchecks both day and night.\n  In the end, the review team concluded that the detention facility and \nthe treatment of detainees at Guantanamo are in compliance with common \narticle III of the Geneva Convention. What I found especially pleasing \nis that the review team concluded that Guantanamo interrogation \nprotocols exceed the Army Field Manual and that cells at Guantanamo \nfrom maximum and high security cell blocks--I am quoting from the \nreport--``exceed those typical of medium and maximum security detention \nfacilities throughout the United States.''\n  I wish to quote other excerpts:\n\n       Interrogations of Guantanamo detainees are all voluntary. \n     Approximately one-third of all interrogations take place at \n     the request of the detainee. Detainees are permitted to \n     decline participation in interrogations at any time with no \n     negative disciplinary consequences.\n\n  Unfortunately, our own Washington Post chose only to run a small \narticle on this report. It was buried on page 3. This is in sharp \ncontrast to the multiday, multipage, above-the-fold story about the \nreleased detainee who blew himself up in Mosul in March of 2008. I \nsuppose the media was hoping this review of operations at Guantanamo \nwould reveal that the present conditions of the detainees would be in \nviolation of the Geneva Convention. Therein lays the problem. Somewhere \nalong the way politicians, nominees, and the media all started to label \nthe present conditions at Guantanamo as intolerable and substandard.\n\n  This report shows that conditions mirror or exceed any current prison \nin the Federal system. I encourage every Member to read the report and \nlearn for themselves the facts about Guantanamo.\n  Some of the administration's proposals--ones endorsed by my Senate \ncolleagues in the majority--involve bringing the detainees to the \nUnited States. I have given this issue serious consideration and am \nunable to find one good reason why our Government would want to do \nthis. We have legally detained enemy combatants on the field of battle. \nWe have categorized them into three classifications: First, detainees \nwho no longer pose a threat and need to be returned to their country or \na third country; secondly, enemy detainees who are too dangerous to \nrelease and must be incarcerated until the cessation of hostilities; \nand, third, detainees against whom we will present admissible evidence \nand adjudicate within the parameters of a fair and constitutionally \nguaranteed process.\n  There is no reason this court proceeding cannot be carried out at \nGuantanamo or satellite facilities outside the United States. The \ntransfer of the detainees to the United States will undoubtedly present \na wide array of complex legal issues that, in my estimation, will take \nlonger than 1 year to solve. Mechanisms at Guantanamo that ensure a \nfair adversarial judicial proceeding, with all the applicable rights, \nis feasible and can be carried out and has been carried out previously \nat Guantanamo.\n  If we close this facility and are unable to place some of these \ndetainees into the custody of third countries, what then? The Bureau of \nPrisons has previously stated that they consider these prisoners a \n``high security risk.'' As such, these prisoners would need to be \nhoused in a maximum security prison. According to the Bureau of \nPrisons, it does not have enough space in maximum security facilities \nto house these detainees. However, one idea offered by my colleagues in \nthe majority party for holding the detainees would be to transfer them \nto the Federal Supermax Prison in Florence, CO.\n  Now, this facility holds the worst criminal elements our country has. \nThe maximum security institution, Supermax, ADX, Florence, CO. The\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nrated capacity is 490 prisoners. The current level is 471. The Bureau \ntries to ensure that this facility is never at full capacity in case of \nemergency transfers. In reality, the Federal Bureau of Prisons doesn't \nhave the room required to hold these very dangerous prisoners in high \nsecurity facilities.\n  As an alternative to the Supermax at Florence, CO, another idea \noffered by the majority would be to sprinkle the detainees throughout \nthe Federal Prison System. Just look at this chart of the Federal \nBureau of Prisons: We have 15 high-security prisons. The maximum beds \nin those 15 high-security prisons happen to be 13,448. The current \npopulation of those prisons is 20,291. It doesn't take too many brains \nto realize we can't solve it that way.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It happens that I have been down there inspecting, maybe \nmore than any other Member. The first time was right after 9/11; the \nlast time was a couple of weeks ago.\n  One of the interesting things is, if you talk to anyone who has been \nthere and served there, you find this is above the standards of any of \nour Federal prisons. At the current time, the population down there is \n245, of which 170 cannot be repatriated; their countries would not take \nthem back.\n  Out of the 170, 110 are the real hardened ones. When the Senator from \nUtah talks about they would put them in 15 prisons, they identified my \nState of Oklahoma, Forest Hill. I went there to see the facility only \nto find it would not work. But the sergeant major in charge of that \nfacility served a year at Guantanamo Bay and said that of all the \nprisons she has been in, or worked in, that is the one that has the \nmost humane treatment and is best suited for this kind of detainee. I \nagree with the Senator and ask if he has given thought as to where \nthese 15 prisons are as alternatives and would they not become magnets \nfor terrorist activity in the United States?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is a good question. I think I am making an \noverwhelming case that it is ridiculous to not use that facility, which \nis perfectly capable, offshore, on an island, where we have all the \nsecurity we need and we don't have the capacity to take care of them in \nthis country and we should not want to anyway. I have also made the \npoint that sending them to other countries is not the answer either. \nThey don't want them either.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Senator from Utah, if you stop and think, can \nyou think of a better deal that America has had? We have had that \nfacility since 1903, and the rent is still the same, $4,000 a year. Can \nyou find a better deal than that anywhere in Government?\n  Mr. HATCH. You can't. To have to bring these prisoners here, we don't \nhave room, and the cost would be astronomical. Thirdly, we are going to \nhave real big problems that we will have a difficult time handling, \nassuming we can find places to put them. I have been down there, too, \nand I have been involved in this for a long time. The Federal Bureau of \nPrisons cannot receive these detainees. We are already overcrowded in \nhigh-security facilities by almost 7,000 prisoners.\n  What is our next option? Military custody? These detainees are \nalready held in military custody. Why are we bringing them from one \nmilitary installation to another? Some ideas regarding military custody \nand presented by the majority include the transfer of the detainees to \nFort Leavenworth, KS. My esteemed colleague from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback, already pointed out this idea would have dire consequences \nfor the Army's Command and General Staff College. This is a course run \nby the Army and open to foreign students from our military partners. \nSome of these foreign officers are from Islamic nations that have \nsupported us in our ongoing efforts against terrorism. The governments \nof these nations have publicly declared that they will withdraw their \npersonnel from the course if enemy combatants are transferred to the \nMilitary Discipline Barracks at Fort Leavenworth. What a loss that \nwould be.\n  I know mistakes were made in the early days of Guantanamo. There may \nhave been some isolated cases where the treatment of some of these \ndetainees there could be construed as not being in accordance with the \nGeneva Convention. In response to these deficiencies, the Supreme \nCourt, Congress, the Department of Defense, and Justice have \nimplemented protections and mechanisms to ensure that this will not \nhappen again. The U.S. Supreme Court has issued decisions ensuring that \nconstitutionally guaranteed rights apply to these men. Military \nprosecutors and FBI agents are conducting reviews of evidence held \nagainst detainees to ensure their admissibility. Military leaders in \ncharge of Guantanamo have taken measures to ensure that humane \nstandards and treatment of detainees and their religion exceeds not \nonly the Geneva Convention but most prison standards found in the \nUnited States. Whatever problems there were at Guantanamo have been \naddressed and corrected.\n  I also remind my distinguished colleagues that our war against \nterrorism will not end with the signing of a treaty. The cessation of \nhostilities in Afghanistan is far from over. We are now shifting our \nfocus and additional troops back to that theater of operation. This \nwill increase the likelihood of contact with the enemy, which may \nrequire additional detentions. In the days ahead, I hope Congress will \nplay a part in the disposition of detainees and the future of \nGuantanamo Bay. A well-thought-out and properly executed plan offered \nby the President would easily garner bipartisan support. I ask the \nPresident to rethink his deadline of closing Guantanamo less than 12 \nmonths from now. This is a useable facility that has merit and \noperational worthiness.\n  In closing, I will quote the 34th President of the United States, \nDwight D. Eisenhower, who said the following: ``Peace and justice are \ntwo sides of the same coin.''\n  I commend the President for wanting to conduct a thorough review of \nthe operations at Guantanamo. My assessment is, this was completed 2 \nweeks ago with the Defense Department's report and the Attorney \nGeneral's visit. What else is there to do? Let's get back to the task \nat hand of resuming military commissions and the humane detention of \nenemy combatants.\n  I am very concerned about this. So far, I have not seen a \nconscientious, let alone remarkably worthwhile or worthy, plan that \nwould exceed what we are already doing in Guantanamo or that would be \nas good as what we are already doing there.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nDepartment of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, dated September 10, \n2007, be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                    Federal Bureau of Prisons,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Trent Franks,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Franks: This is in response to the letter \n     signed by you and several other Members of Congress \n     requesting a description of the impact of transporting and \n     incarcerating in the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) the \n     approximately 500 enemy combatants currently being held in \n     the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       We have provided estimates of the costs you identify, and \n     we also mention some of the challenges we would encounter if \n     we were responsible for taking these enemy combatants into \n     BOP custody. We must emphasize, however, that we would hope \n     to learn more about this unique population and what would be \n     required of our agency if we were required to assume custody \n     of them. This would allow us to undertake a more complete and \n     comprehensive impact assessment.\n       We would consider the individuals confined in Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, to be high security; therefore, they would require \n     the highest level of escort staff, type of restraints, and \n     other security measures if they were to be transferred into \n     BOP custody. The transportation of Federal inmates and \n     detainees is coordinated through the Justice Prisoner and \n     Alien Transportation System (JPATS) within the United States \n     Marshals Service. JPATS is a nationwide network of aircraft \n     and ground transportation vehicles. The BOP assists JPATS by \n     transporting Federal inmates from the airfields used by the \n     U.S. Marshals Service aircraft to our institutions.\n       We estimate that it would cost approximately $455,000 for \n     the JPATS air travel of 500 detainees from Cuba to any of our \n     United States penitentiaries. This air travel includes \n     flights from Cuba to the Federal Detention Center (FDC) in \n     Miami, Florida, from FDC Miami to the Federal Transportation \n     Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and a third flight to a \n     high-security United States penitentiary. Costs of \n     transportation\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\n     would also include BOP buses to move the detainees from \n     the airfields to our facilities (a cost of approximately \n     $1,300 per bus trip). Thus, the total cost could reach \n     approximately $500,000.\n       Currently, there is not sufficient bedspace at any high-\n     security Federal prison to confine these individuals. Our \n     high-security institutions are operating at 55 percent above \n     capacity. There are approximately 199,700 Federal inmates at \n     present, and we are expecting the inmate population to \n     increase to over 221,000 by the end of fiscal year 2011. The \n     average yearly cost of confining a high-security inmate in \n     the BOP is approximately $25,400.\n       We would most likely confine these detainees in one or two \n     penitentiaries. This would require us to transfer a \n     sufficient number of inmates to other penitentiaries in order \n     to create the necessary bedspace. Such transfers would add to \n     the cost of confining the enemy combatants and would impose \n     significant additional challenges on our agency (based the \n     level of crowding in all high-security BOP institutions).\n       Due to the unique status of enemy combatants and the \n     probable lack of information about these individuals' \n     histories of violent behavior or disruptive activities, it is \n     unlikely that we would house these detainees with inmates in \n     the general population of high-security institutions (with \n     inmates serving sentences for Federal crimes and District of \n     Columbia code offenses). Therefore, if transferred to BOP \n     custody, these enemy combatants would most likely be confined \n     in special units, segregated from the general inmate \n     population. It is also likely that many of these individuals \n     require separation from other enemy combatants. This kind of \n     confinement is comparable to special housing units in BOP \n     institutions (which are used for administrative detention and \n     disciplinary segregation). These units are more costly to \n     operate than general population units due to the increased \n     staffing and enhanced security procedures needed for inmates \n     who have separation requirements and/or who are potentially \n     violent or dangerous.\n       The management of inmates in special housing units presents \n     additional challenges due to the increased security required \n     for these individuals. It would be even more challenging to \n     confine enemy combatants who would likely have additional \n     restrictions or requirements dictated by the Department of \n     Defense. We are unsure how our inmate management principles, \n     which focus on constructive staff-inmate interaction, maximum \n     program involvement, and due process discipline would fit \n     into the Department of Defense's requirements for the enemy \n     combatants.\n       While it is not entirely clear where the BOP's obligations \n     would begin and end with regard to the provision of basic \n     inmate programs and services, we foresee the need for some \n     special or enhanced services in order to provide the basic \n     necessities to these enemy combatants. We would need to \n     acquire translation services or transfer appropriate \n     bilingual staff for us to communicate our expectations to \n     these individuals and to allow these detainees to communicate \n     their needs and concerns to us. We would need these \n     translation services in order to provide appropriate \n     visiting, telephone, and correspondence privileges to the \n     detainees and, if required, to monitor these communications. \n     We also would likely need to make accommodations with regard \n     to our food service and religious programs to meet the \n     cultural and religious requirements of these detainees.\n       I hope this helps you understand our concerns regarding the \n     confinement of enemy combatants. Please contact me if I can \n     be of any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Harley G. Lappin,\n                                                         Director.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I point out also that in a recent report, \nU.S. officials said the Taliban's new top operations officer in \nsouthern Afghanistan is a former prisoner at the Guantanamo detention \ncenter.\n  Pentagon and CIA officials said Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul was among 13 \nprisoners released to the Afghan Government in December 2007. He is now \nknown as Mullah Abdullah Zakir, a name officials say is used by the \nTaliban leader in charge of operations against United States and Afghan \nforces in southern Afghanistan.\n  One intelligence official told the Associated Press that Rasoul's \nstated mission is to counter the growing U.S. troop surge. I wished to \nput that in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair, I was scheduled to \nspeak after the Senator from Ohio. I understand he is not ready to \nspeak yet and that it is permissible if I take some time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, before I get into what I want to talk \nabout, I have been listening to the Senator from Utah. I find it to be \nvery interesting because his subject matter is also a mission of mine. \nI think a lot of people have not realized the problem we have with the \nbum raps given to Guantanamo Bay, and almost all of them are by people \nwho have not been there. To my knowledge, almost without exception, \nthose people who have gone down there--newspapers and publications \nmaking accusations of torture and human rights violations--once they go \nthere and see it, you never hear from them again, and that includes Al-\nJazeera and some of the Middle Eastern publications. I believe we have \na problem with people who have somehow brought forth this idea that \nthere have been abuses that haven't taken place. I think probably the \nmost important part of the argument is that there is not another \nGuantanamo Bay; there is no place you can put these detainees.\n  As I said in my question to the Senator from Utah, what are we going \nto do with these some 245 detainees if they are not there? Also, with \nthe escalation of activity in Afghanistan, what will we do with those \ndetainees whom we will capture? The problem is, some people say they \nwill be put in prisons in Afghanistan. There are two prisons there; \nhowever, they have said they will only take Afghans. If the terrorist \nwho is caught is from Djibouti or Yemen or Saudi Arabia, there is no \nplace else to put them other than Guantanamo Bay. It is a resource we \nneed to have. We don't have a choice.\n  I believe our President was responding to a lot of activists who were \nupset because during his inaugural address he didn't say anything about \nthis, so they are making demands that he stop any kind of legal \nactivity that is going on in the way of trials or tribunals and then \nclose it in 12 months. You cannot do that until you determine how you \nare going to take care of the detainees who are currently there and \nthose who will be there.\n  I feel strongly we are going to have to look out after the interests \nof the United States. Nothing could be worse than to take 15 to 17 \ninstallations within the continental United States and put terrorists \nthere, only to serve as magnets for terrorist activity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3057-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3057-S3061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, some things have happened recently \nregarding one of my favorite subjects, and that is global warming. Way \nback in the beginning of this issue--to give you a background, since \nthe occupant of the chair wasn't here at that time--the Republicans \nwere the majority, and I was chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. We were within inches of ratifying the Kyoto Treaty.\n  Similar to everybody else, I assumed that manmade gases were causing \nglobal warming. Everybody said they did. The Wharton School of \nEconomics came out with the Wharton Econometric Survey. They said it \nwould cost--if we were to sign the Kyoto Treaty and live by the \nemissions requirements--between $300 billion and $330 billion a year. \nThat was the range. That would be the result. It is something I looked \nat.\n  We started looking at the science, only to find out there is a lot of \nintimidation in the scientific community and most of this was \noriginally brought by the United Nations. I have been one of the \ncritics of the U.N. and a lot of things they do and don't do. If you \nwill recall, when this first started, it was the U.N. IPCC, \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that came up with the idea \nthat manmade gases--CO2, methane--were the cause of the \nglobal warming.\n  Now, since that has been proven not to be true, and we are now in a \ncooling spell, they are trying to change the term to ``climate \nchange.'' We are not going to let them do that. It has always been \n``global warming.'' We looked at the science. We had bills coming up on \nthe floor that would have addressed this. One was in 2005. At that \ntime, I was kind of alone on the floor for 5 days, 10 hours a day, to \ntry to explain why we could not impose the largest tax increase in \nhistory on the American people. So in looking at the cost of this \nthing, we started hearing\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\nfrom a lot of scientists who had been intimidated but were now wanting \nto come out of the closet and tell the truth about their real feelings.\n  The reason I wished to come here today is because there is a Gallup \nPoll that came out yesterday. I wish to share that with you and with \nthis body. A record high of 41 percent of Americans now say global \nwarming is exaggerated. This is the highest level of public skepticism \nabout mainstream reporting in more than a decade, according to the \nMarch 11, 2009 Gallup Poll survey. I use that poll because Gallup and \nthe Pew organization have never been sympathetic to my view. Yet their \npoll was announced.\n  We should never underestimate the intelligence of the American \npeople. Sadly, that is exactly what the promoters of manmade climate \nfears have consistently been doing. Keep in mind, the issue we are \ntalking about is not whether there is global warming. We went through a \nperiod of global warming that ended 7 years ago. Now we clearly are in \na cooling period. Prior to that, we have had several times--people \nforget, God is still up there. Throughout these written histories, we \nhave had these cycles.\n  The interesting thing about this poll that came out yesterday is \nlooking at the percentage of people who worry a great deal about the \nenvironment, this is a total change from what we have seen before. It \nis now--what is it, No. 9? The last thing is global warming. These are \nenvironmental concerns: pollution of drinking water, water pollution, \ntoxic contamination of soil and water, and very last is global warming. \nThere was another poll just about a month ago by Pew Research, I \nbelieve it was, and that one shows the same thing. I say this because \nof some of my colleagues who think the American people are believing \nthis stuff--manmade gases making global warming.\n  This is January last month, and this is by the Pew Polling Group. \nThis isn't just environmental issues; it says, ``Name your major \nconcern.'' No. 1, economy; No. 2, jobs. Where is global warming? No. \n20, at the bottom, the very last one. That is something that has \nchanged.\n  Getting back to the poll, the previous Gallup Poll released on Earth \nDay 2008 showed the American public's concern about manmade global \nwarming is unchanged from 1989. This is after all the media hype, all \nthe media talking about how bad man is.\n  By the way, I am going to pause here for a minute because in 2005 we \ndebated a bill on this floor that would have--since we did not ratify \nthe Kyoto treaty--said unilaterally what should we do in the United \nStates because some people would like to believe this is a great \nproblem. They said: Let's pass our own global warming bill in the \nUnited States. Think about that. If you are one who believes \nCO2 and anthropogenetic gases are causing global warming, if \nyou really believe that in your heart, what good would it do to do it \nonly in the United States? If you do that, all these jobs are going to \ngo to countries such as China, Mexico, India--places where they don't \nhave emission controls--and you would have a net increase in \nCO2 after we paid the tax and the punishment for it.\n  After one of the most expensive climate change fear campaigns in our \nNation's history, there is no change in global warming concerns by \nAmericans in the past two decades. This skepticism persists despite the \nNobel Peace Prize jointly shared by former Vice President Al Gore and \nthe United Nations.\n  By the way, I have to say I cannot think of one assertion that was \nmade in the science fiction movie Al Gore put together that has not \nbeen refuted scientifically. I am talking about sea-level rises and all \nthe rest of the things. Sure, it scared a lot of kids. A lot of kids \nhad nightmares. Nobody now believes there is any science behind that \nparticular movie.\n  The skepticism persists despite a $300 million campaign to spread \nclimate fears. Skepticism persists despite a daily drumbeat of scary \nscenarios promoted by the United Nations and the media of what could, \nmight, or may happen 20, 30, 50, 100 years from now. In fact, global \nwarming skepticism appears to have grown stronger as the shrillness of \nthe climate fear campaign intensified.\n  The latest Gallup Poll released on March 11 further reveals the \nAmerican public has a growing skepticism. A record-high 41 percent now \nsay it is exaggerated. This represents the highest public opinion since \nthe whole issue began. These dramatic polling results are not \nunexpected as prominent scientists around the world continue to speak \nout publicly for the first time to dissent from the Al Gore-United \nNations and media-driven manmade intimidation on climate fears.\n  In addition, a steady stream of peer-reviewed studies, analyses, \nreal-world data, and developments have further refuted the claims of \nmanmade global warming fear activists.\n  Americans are finally catching on in large numbers that the U.N. IPCC \nis a political, not a scientific, organization. Interesting that when \nthe U.N. IPCC comes out with their periodic reports, they never talk \nabout the scientists. It is the politicians who are making the \naccusations or coming to the conclusions. So they have these briefs on \nthe political analyses of these reports.\n  If new peer-reviewed studies are to be believed, today's high school \nkids watching Gore's movie will be nearing the senior citizen group \nAARP's membership age by the time warming allegedly resumes in 30 \nyears. That is interesting because now they are talking about maybe it \ndid not happen, maybe we were not in the middle of it in the middle \nnineties when they tried to get us to ratify the Kyoto treaty, but it \nis coming, maybe 30 years from now.\n  Dr. John Brignell, a skeptical UK emeritus engineering professor at \nthe University of South Hampton, wrote in 2008:\n\n       The warmers--\n\n  He calls them--\n\n     are getting more and more like those traditional predictors \n     of the end of the world who, when the event fails to happen \n     on a due date, announce an error in their calculations and \n     [they come up with] a new date.\n\n  That is what they are doing now.\n  Furthermore, I always believed the more global warming information \npeople have, the less concerned they will become. That is obvious. That \npoll 5 years ago would have had this way up there somewhere around No. \n3. Now it is No. 20. It just barely made the list.\n  Confirming this unintended consequence is a study by the scientific \njournal Risk Analysis released in February of 2008 which found that \nGore and the media's attempts to scare the public ``ironically may be \nhaving just the opposite effect.'' The study found that the more \ninformed respondents ``show less concern for global warming.'' The \nstudy found that ``perhaps ironically, and certainly contrary to . . . \nthe marketing of movies like the Ice Age and An Inconvient Truth, the \neffects of information on both concern for global warming and \nresponsibility for it are exactly the opposite of what were expected. \nDirectly, the more information a person has about global warming, the \nless responsible he or she feels for it; and indirectly, the more \ninformation a person has about global warming, the less concerned he or \nshe is for it.''\n  Again, this is not me, Jim Inhofe, U.S. Senator, talking. This is \nProfessor John Brignell. Certainly you cannot question his credentials.\n  Climate realism continues to be on the march.\n  I now report to you on the skeptical Heartland Institute's \nInternational Conference on Climate Change in New York, which just \nfinished 3 days ago. It is brand new. As the most outspoken critic of \nmanmade global warming alarmism in the United States, I am pleased to \nsee the world's largest ever gathering of global warming skeptics \nassembled in New York City just this week to confront the issue, \n``Global warming: Was it ever really a crisis?'' That was the title of \nthe convention. All of these scientists from all over the world were \ntaking part in it.\n  A lot has changed over the last 6 years since I started speaking out \nagainst the likes of Al Gore, the United Nations, and the Hollywood \nelitists. Perhaps the most notable change is the number of scientists \nno longer willing to be silenced. How do you silence a scientist? You \ntake away their grants, whether they be Government grants or they come \nfrom the Heinz Foundation or the Pew Foundation or others. If you don't \nagree with us, certainly you should be punished.\n  I remember not too long ago on the Weather Channel--Heidi Cullen has\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\nthis weekly show. It is to promote the idea that man is responsible for \nglobal warming. She says: Any meteorologist who does not agree with me \nshould be decertified. All of a sudden, everyone started yelling and \nscreaming. The vast majority of meteorologists will agree with the \ncomments I am making today.\n  Certainly since Al Gore made his movie, hundreds of scientists have \ncome out of the woodwork to refute the claims made by the alarmists.\n  The gathering of roughly 800 scientists, economists, legislators, \npolicy activists, and media representatives at the Second International \nConference on Climate Change sponsored by the Heartland Institute \nprovides clear evidence to the growing movements against alarmism--the \nworld is coming to an end.\n\n  I am happy that important voices are being heard in New York, \nincluding Vaclav Klaus, the President of the Czech Republic. I was in \nthe Czech Republic not too long ago. He couldn't have been nicer and \nmore complimentary of me. He said: What they are trying to do is to \npunish us economically in our country and your country on science that \nis strictly not there.\n  In his remarks to the conference 3 days ago, Vaclav Klaus, President \nof the Czech Republic, said:\n\n       Today's debate about global warming is essentially a debate \n     about freedom. The environmentalists would like to mastermind \n     each and every possible aspect of our lives.\n\n  Climate scientist Dr. Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology, MIT, one of the world's leading experts in dynamic \nmeteorology, especially planetary waves, told the gathering in New York \nthat momentum is with the skeptics, saying:\n\n       We will win this debate, for we are right and they are \n     wrong.\n\n  I have a chart. This was Richard Lindzen, who is the Alfred P. Sloan \nprofessor of atmospheric science at MIT. This was an op-ed piece in the \nWall Street Journal. He says:\n\n       A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to \n     assiduously ignore the fact that the Earth and its climate \n     are dynamics; they are always changing even without any \n     external forcing. To treat all change as something to fear is \n     bad enough; to do so in order to exploit that fear is much \n     worse.\n\n  I think he was talking about the amount of money former Vice \nPresident Al Gore made on this issue, but I am not going to get into \nthat now.\n  The point is, I am talking about credentials of scientists and them \ncoming out with statements such as these, and they were not doing this \njust a few years ago.\n  So this event that took place in New York City in the last few days \nis very significant. Others in attendance were William Gray, Colorado \nState University. He is one of the experts there who testified before \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee one time before making this \nsame type of statement.\n  Stephen McIntyre, primary author of Climate Audit, a blog devoted to \nthe analysis and discussion of data, he is a devastating critic of the \ntemperature record of the past 1,000 years, particularly the work of \nMichael Mann, the creator of the infamous ``hockey stick'' graph. That \ngraph is thoroughly discredited. There is no scientist who will stand \nbehind that graph. What he attempted to show after this, there was a \nmarked increase in temperatures. That was the blade on the hockey \nstick. What he forgot to put down--and nobody will disagree with this \nfact--is that in the timeframe from about 1200 to 1400, we had what \nthey call the medieval warm period. Then we went into the little ice \nage.\n  This medieval warm period is interesting. If anyone wants to take a \ntrip up to Greenland and talk to them, go through their history books \nand look at what the prosperity was during this timeframe, that is when \nall the Vikings were up there. They were growing all this stuff. Then, \nof course, when the cycle reversed, it went into the little ice age. \nThey all died or left. Actually, the economic activity was much better. \nThat was also when they were growing grapes in the Scandinavian \ncountries because it was warm enough to do that.\n  This chart is significant because what they have done is looked at \nthis and said the world is coming to an end. And in a minute I am going \nto talk about what all the pundits were saying in the middle seventies \nwhen they said another ice age is coming. But this has been going on \nthroughout recorded history.\n  Chemist Dr. Arthur Robinson, curator of a global warming petition \nsigned by more than 32,000 American scientists, including more than \n10,000 with doctorate degrees--and they all are rejecting the alarmist \nassertion that global warming has put the Earth in a crisis and caused \nprimarily by mankind.\n  Dr. Willie Soon, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, has \nalso testified along the same line.\n  Retired award-winning atmospheric scientist Dr. Roy Spencer, now with \nthe University of Alabama in Huntsville.\n  Here is a very small sampling of recent developments in the news.\n  The New York Times: ``Prominent geologist Dr. Don Easterbrook warns \nwe are in `decades-long cooling spell.' '' And I think everyone would \nagree with that.\n  ``NASA warming scientist `suffering from a bad case of megalomania'--\nformer supervisors says.'' This was only yesterday in the Business and \nMedia Institute. This is an excerpt of the report:\n\n       John Theon, a retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist, \n     said . . . at The Heartland Institute's 2009--\n\n  What I have been talking about here--\n\n       . . . that the head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space \n     Studies, James Hansen, should be fired. Hansen is widely \n     known for his outspokenness on the issue of manmade global \n     warming. I have publicly said I thought Jim Hansen should be \n     fired, ``Theon said.'' But my opinion doesn't count much, \n     particularly when he is empowered by people such as the \n     current President of the United States. I am not sure what \n     we can do to have him get off of the public payroll and \n     continue with the campaign or crusade. I think the man is \n     sincere, but he is suffering from a bad case of \n     megalomania.\n\n  Another article. ``NASA Warming Scientist Under Fire--From Former \nSupervisor--Jim Hansen should be fired.'' This is another one, although \nthis time they make the observation that James Hansen, who is the most \noutspoken proponent that it is manmade gases, anthropogenic gases, and \nCO2 that is causing global warming, is the recipient of \n$250,000 from the Heinz Foundation. Obviously, that does have an impact \non his position.\n  This one is: ``U.S. Government Meteorologist Claims `Gross Blatant \nCensorship' for Speaking Out Against Climate Alarmism.'' This was March \n9, a few days ago, by Stanley Goldenberg, a meteorologist with the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's--that is NOAA--\nAtlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory Hurricane Research \nDivision. This is an excerpt of what this scientist said:\n\n       The debate, as you also know, is masked by media \n     censorship, bias and distortion. I am interviewed quite a bit \n     on many, many levels and thankfully most of our interviews \n     are benign. They're trying to get out to the public.\n\n  In his criticism, Goldenberg said:\n\n       I've seen gross, gross blatant censorship. If you're here \n     from the media I'd be glad to argue with you from firsthand \n     experience. I challenge anybody from a mainstream media \n     source to take or print a positive report on this conference. \n     They won't get it past the editor.\n\n  He is talking about, of course, the media bias, which we all know \ntook place during this conference.\n  This is an excerpt from the Boston Globe's paper yesterday:\n\n       New figures being released today show the recession helped \n     drive down global warming emissions from the northeast power \n     plants last year to their lowest levels in at least 9 years. \n     The drop in emissions may be good for the environment, but \n     was not seen as reason for celebration. ``What does this say \n     about the state of the economy?'' said Robert Rio, senior \n     vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts. We \n     could get 100 percent below the cap if we shut every business \n     and moved them out of state.\n\n  The NASA moonwalker and geologist Harrison Schmitt said climate \nchange alarmists intentionally mislead. This again is yesterday's \nBusiness & Media Institute quoting him:\n\n       Last month, Apollo 17 astronaut and moonwalker Harrison \n     Schmitt added his voice to the growing chorus of scientists \n     speaking out against the anthropogenic--man-made--global \n     warming theory. In strongly worded comments he said the \n     theory was a ``political tool.'' Now, in a speech at the \n     International Conference on Climate Change he outlined his \n     argument in great detail saying,\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\n     ``the science of climate change and its causes is not \n     settled.'' . . . Several indisputable facts appear evident in \n     geological and climate science that makes me a true, quote, \n     denier, unquote, of human caused global warming. The \n     conclusion seems inescapable that nature produces the primary \n     influences on climate.\n\n  I think this chart shows that it has been going on throughout \nrecorded history.\n  Another article: ``A Freezing Legacy For Our Children.'' This one is \nby James Marusek, nuclear physicist and engineer retired from the U.S. \nDepartment of the Navy. He said:\n\n       There is a lot of talk these days about the legacy we will \n     leave our children and our grandchildren. When I stare into \n     the immediate future, I see a frightening legacy caked in \n     darkness and famine. Instead of intelligently preparing, we \n     find ourselves whittling away this precious time chasing \n     fraudulent theories. Climate change is primarily driven by \n     nature. It has been true in the days of my father and his \n     father and all those that came before us.\n\n  Again, this guy is a nuclear physicist and engineer.\n  This is from a new study titled ``The Evidence Is That The Ocean Is \nCooling, Not Warming.'' This was 2 days ago. And it contains an excerpt \ntitled ``Cooling of the Global Ocean Since 2003,'' by Craig Loehle, \nPh.D., National Council for Air and Stream Improvement. He said:\n\n       Ocean heat content data from 2003 to 2008--4\\1/2\\ years--\n     were evaluated for trend. The result is consistent with other \n     data showing a lack of warming over the past few years.\n\n  I think I am making a point here that no one is going to argue, and \nthat is that now we are in a cooling period. It drives people nuts, \nthose who try to make people think the world is coming to an end; that \nit is going to get too hot, and now they realize that is not the case.\n  This is another statement made by another scientist, and this was 3 \ndays ago.\n\n       Alaska River Ice now 60 percent thicker than it was 5 years \n     ago. Flashback: The Nenana Ice Classic is a pretty good proxy \n     for climate change in the 20th Century.\n\n  In other words, it is increasing, not decreasing. Here is another \nscientist. This was reported 4 days ago in Investors Business Daily by \natmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, Professor Emeritus of \nEnvironmental Sciences at the University of Virginia, who served as the \nfounding director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service.\n\n       We conclude therefore that the drive to reduce \n     CO2 emissions is not concern about climate. \n     Ultimately, ideology may be what's fueling the CO2 \n     wars.\n\n  So it goes on and on. Here is another: ``Left-wing Columnist \nAlexander Cockburn A Climate Skeptic--John Fund--March 11.'' And \nAlexander Cockburn, by the way, is normally on the other side. Here is \nthat quote:\n\n       My most memorable exchange was with Alexander Cockburn, the \n     left-wing columnist for the Los Angeles Times and the Nation \n     magazine. Mr. Cockburn has undergone blistering attacks since \n     he first dissented from the global warming ``consensus'' in \n     2007. ``I've felt like the object of a witch hunt,'' he says. \n     ``One former Sierra Club board member suggested I should be \n     criminally prosecuted.'' Mr. Cockburn was at the conference \n     collecting material for his forthcoming book ``A Short \n     History of Fear,'' in which he will explore the link between \n     fear mongering and climate catastrophe proponents. ``No one \n     on the left is comfortable talking about science,'' he told \n     me. ``They don't feel they can easily get their arms around \n     it, so they don't think about it much. As a result, they are \n     prone to any peddler of ideas that reinforce their \n     preexisting prejudices. One would be that there is a \n     population explosion that must be dealt with by slowing down \n     economies.'' I asked him how he felt hanging around with so \n     many people who have a more conservative viewpoint than he \n     does. ``It's been good fun and I've learned a lot,'' he told \n     me. ``I think what they are saying on this topic is looking \n     better and better.''\n\n  And here is one of the guys who was a chief proponent of the fear \nmongers. We have to keep in mind there is a lot of money involved in \nmaking people afraid. I am old enough to remember back in the middle \n1970s, when we were going through at that time what was thought to be \nthis devastating ice age; that we were all going to freeze to death. \nHere is Time magazine, and here they talk about another ice age is \ncoming and they document their case. This is 1974, from Time magazine.\n  Now, let's look at Time magazine a few years later. Here is Time \nmagazine a couple of years ago and they have totally reversed \nthemselves. No longer is it an ice age that is coming and we are all \ngoing to die; the headline now is ``Be Worried, Be Very Worried,'' and \nthey have this polar bear standing on the last scoop of ice in the \nArctic.\n  By the way, there are 13 different populations of polar bears in \nCanada, and with the exception of the one on the western Hudson Bay \narea, they are all flourishing. They are doing very well. The \npopulation has quadrupled since the 1960s. So don't feel badly about \nthe polar bear. They are doing fine.\n  My point here is that these publications, I can assure you--and I \nhave not checked this out, but that last one, in 1974, from Time \nmagazine, I am sure that sold a lot of editions because everyone wanted \nto read the story as to how another ice age was coming and we were all \ngoing to die. We have checked on this. This was their biggest seller in \nthat particular year. I don't see the date, but a couple of years ago, \nbecause they capitalize on this type of disaster.\n\n  I suppose I will go ahead and conclude now. We had some new \ninformation, and apparently I didn't bring it down with me, but I would \nonly say this. I am one of the chief critics of what has been happening \neconomically in this country since last October. Last October, we voted \non a $700 billion bailout for the banking industry. I was against that. \nI recognize that was both Republican and Democrat. It came out of a \nRepublican White House and it was in concert with the Democrats. They \nall said: Let's scare everybody so we can have this $700 billion \nbailout. I voted against it, and some of my conservative friends voted \nfor it.\n  This was the largest authorization of money in the history of the \nworld, and it was all taking place at that time in October--October 10 \nis when we voted in the Senate, with 75 Senators voting for that. My \nproblem with it was that it was put together by our then-Secretary of \nthe Treasury, and we were giving him total authority over how to spend \n$700 billion--the largest amount of money ever talked about in one \nblock in this country, or in the history of the world. So I opposed it.\n  Now we find out that as soon as he got the money, he didn't spend it. \nHe said he was going to buy distressed assets. He didn't spend it on \nthat. He put money into the banks, and we haven't noticed a change in \nthe credit since then. Now, of course, we have a new President and we \nhave the budget and the omnibus bill that was voted on a few days ago--\n$410 billion--and all these people are talking about earmarks and all \nthat. But let's keep in mind that only 1 percent of that $410 billion \nwas in anything like earmarks. I wish people were as concerned about \nthe 99 percent as they are the 1 percent, but that is a huge amount of \nmoney.\n  Now we have the President, with his budget coming forward, and this \nis going to produce huge deficits--in the trillions--and I have been \ncritical of those. But as bad as all of that is, and talking about the \nhuge amounts of money, what is worse is if we should be forced or \npushed by the promoters of these global warming scares into passing a \ntax, what they call a cap-and-trade tax. In other words, this is a tax \nthat would tax the American people. For all practical purposes, it \nwould be a CO2 tax. They don't call it that. They disguise \nit by calling it a cap and trade. But nonetheless, the analysis of that \nis that it would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $300 billion to \n$330 billion a year.\n  The reason I bring that up is that if we are pushed into passing some \nkind of a global warming or a cap-and-trade tax of $300 billion to $330 \nbillion, they will masquerade it and act as if it isn't that much, but \nwe know it is. We have sources--MIT and several other sources--and \neconomic analysis that has taken place that says if that should happen, \nit will be something that occurs every year. At least these large \namounts of money in the stimulus bills and in the bailout bills are \none-shot deals, theoretically. But the other would be a tax increase on \nthe American people.\n  I do have a dog in this fight. I do have a selfish concern. My wife \nand I have 20 kids and grandkids. My life is not going to change by \nanything that is passed in terms of a tax increase, but it does affect \nthe next generations, and I think we are going to have to get to the \npoint we are looking at not what is it today but down the road how are \nwe going to pay for it.\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\n  To go back to the original $700 billion bailout, if you do the math, \nthere are 140 million taxpaying families in the country. Divide that by \n$700 billion and that is $5,000 a family. We are talking huge amounts. \nAnd should we pass this global warming tax increase that would be \ncomparable to over $300 billion, it would mean $3,000 a family. And \nthat is every year.\n  I think we need to overcome the problem that we have in following the \nmedia off this plank and look at the science and let the science tell \nus what to do. If we do that, we will find with everything I have \ntalked about over the last 35 minutes is in fact true.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, this Chamber will confirm in the coming \ndays a new U.S. Trade Representative. Mayor Kirk's confirmation \nrepresents an opportunity for American trade policy to break from the \nfalse choice between free trade and fair trade.\n  As our economy struggles with massive job losses, a shrinking middle \nclass that we have seen during the entire Bush years, and a housing \ncrisis brought on by wrong-headed policy, the housing crisis that \nundermines the pursuit of the American dream, our trade policy must be \npart of our response to the new realities of the global economy.\n  Mayor Kirk inherits a position traditionally focused on status quo \ntrade policy, and expanding that policy with more of the same status \nquo trade policy that gives protection to large business, protection to \nbig oil, protection to big drug companies--and even with new rights and \nnew privileges--a status quo trade policy that suppresses the standard \nof living for American workers, and at the same time hurts workers in \nChina and India and Mexico; a status quo trade policy that does nothing \nto curb the cost of climate change or the degradation of the \nenvironment; and a status quo trade policy that has yielded an $800 \nbillion--more than $2 billion a day--trade deficit.\n  For 8 years the Bush trade policies were wrong. They are wrong now. \nThey should not continue this way in the future. Our trade deficit has \nreached annually, thanks to Bush trade policies and thanks to lax trade \nenforcement, a wrong-headed, unregulated, free-trade policy, which has \nallowed toys with lead paint, contaminated toothpaste and other \nproducts, and weakened the health and safety rules for our trading \npartners and our own communities.\n  We want more trade but not like this. Bush trade policies have \ndevastated communities in my State, in towns such as Tiffin, \nChillicothe, and Lorain, and done damage to your State in places such \nas Flint and Detroit and Hamtramck. Job loss does not just affect the \nworker or the worker's family, as tragic as that is for them, job loss, \nespecially job loss in the thousands, devastates communities. It \ndepletes the tax base. It means the layoff of police and fire personnel \nand schoolteachers. It hurts local business owners--the drug store, the \ngrocery store, the neighborhood restaurant.\n  Massive job losses prevent middle-class growth. The Senator from New \nYork, who is in the Chamber, talked about how the middle class in the \nlast 10 years has shrunk. The middle class has shrunk in pure numbers. \nIt has shrunk in income, in buying power. The middle-class people in \nthis country have seen their incomes go down in part because of the \nBush trade policy and partly because of tax policy and in part because \nof the economic policy generally.\n  Massive job losses prevent middle-class growth, as manufacturing jobs \nthat once anchored a community are gone, but they demoralize a \ncommunity. Ohio has seen the loss, during the Bush years, of more than \n200,000 manufacturing jobs; nationwide, 4.4 million manufacturing jobs, \n26 percent, more than one out of four manufacturing jobs in our country \nthat simply disappeared.\n  We know in Michigan and Ohio and across the industrial heartland of \nthis country and in every State, American manufacturing can compete and \ncompete with anyone in the world if it is a fair fight. But the deck is \nstacked against us when our Government does not enforce our own trade \nlaws that level that playing field.\n  Foreign competitors take an unfair advantage, and it is stopping \nAmerican manufacturers from reaching their potential. We can no longer \nafford to sit on the sidelines. We must establish a manufacturing \npolicy in this Nation that helps businesses stay here, that helps \ncommunities thrive, that rebuilds middle-class families in communities \nin my State.\n  It starts with reforming our trade policy. I am pleased to hear Mayor \nKirk's emphasis on trade enforcement. Too many of our major trading \npartners are breaking the rules through massive currency imbalances, \ntax and capital subsidies, and through unfair labor and environmental \npractices.\n  In recent years, the Trade Representative has shown, to put it \nbluntly, a terrible record in response to public demand for strong \ntrade enforcement. The Trade Representative that has occupied that \noffice for close to a decade simply does not enforce our trade laws. \nAll five of the public petitions for trade enforcement actions filed \nduring the Bush administration, each concerning currency manipulation \nor labor exploitations by China, every one of those five public \npetitions was denied by the U.S. Trade Representative.\n  In some cases those petitions were denied on the day they were \nsubmitted, as if the administration even bothered to read them. Wrong-\nheaded economic policy, job-killing trade agreements have also fueled \nincreasing income disparity at home and abroad. I traveled some years \nago, after NAFTA passed--a trade agreement that has hurt our Nation--I \ntraveled at my own expense to McAllen, TX, across the border, with a \ncouple of friends to Reynosa, Mexico. I met a husband and wife who \nworked for General Electric. They lived in a shack about 15 by 20 feet, \ndirt floor, no running water, no electricity. If it rained hard, the \ndirt floor turned to mud.\n  If you walked through the neighborhood, you could see where people \nworked in that neighborhood because these shacks were made out of \nbuilding materials from the companies they worked for or the companies \nthat supply the companies for which they worked.\n  These two workers worked for General Electric Mexico, 3 miles from \nthe United States of America. If you go to one of those plants where \nthose workers worked, those plants looked a lot like an American plant. \nThese workers made about 90 cents an hour and lived, as I said, in \nsqualid conditions, as hard as they were working, 6 days a week, 10 \nhours a day.\n  I visited an auto plant nearby, and this auto plant looked exactly \nlike an auto plant in Michigan or Ohio, except perhaps it was more \nmodern. If you walked into the auto plant, things were clean, the \ntechnology was up to date, the workers were productive, working hard.\n  There was one difference between the auto plant in Reynosa, Mexico, \nand the auto plant in the United States; that is, the auto plant in \nReynosa, Mexico, had no parking lot because the workers could not \nafford to buy the cars they made. That is what our trade policy has \nwrought.\n  You can go to Malaysia and go to a Motorola plant. The workers cannot \nafford to buy the cell phones they make. You can come back to this \nhemisphere and go to Costa Rica to a Disney plant and the workers \ncannot afford to buy the toys for their children, the toys they make, \nor you can go back across the sea to China and the workers in plant \nafter plant after plant cannot afford to buy the material, buy the \nproducts they make.\n  Simply put, in this country, because of a strong union movement over \nthe\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\nyears, that is another debate and another question, how the Employee \nFree Choice Act will help in building the middle class in this country, \nworkers who worked hard and were productive, shared in the wealth they \ncreated.\n  As productivity went up, then workers' wages went up. As workers made \nmore profits for their boss, as workers made money for their company, \nthose workers shared in the wealth they created. It is the American \nfree enterprise system. It is what Americans have stood for. It is why \nthe middle class in this country, until recently, has been as strong as \nit has been.\n  I am glad to see the Obama administration will approach trade \ndifferently, will consider what goes on in Reynosa and what goes on in \nMalaysia and Costa Rica and China. The Obama administration will take a \ndifferent direction on trade.\n  I am glad to see Mayor Kirk's emphasis on enforcement. That means \ncorrecting our imbalanced trade relationship with China. Enforcement \nalso means using the tools of a trade agreement to correct labor \nabuses. I remember when the Jordan agreement overwhelmingly passed \nCongress. This agreement was held up--at the end of the Clinton \nadministration--as a standard in labor provisions. But in 2001, the \nBush administration backtracked, essentially turned the other way, as \nthose labor standards and labor provisions were being ignored by the \nJordanian Government. In fact, it even turned the other way when \nreports came out that there was human trafficking plaguing the citizens \nof Jordan.\n\n  As human rights groups revealed overwhelming evidence of labor \nviolations and human trafficking, the Bush administration simply did \nnot enforce trade agreements. At the time, the USTR sent a letter to \nJordan's trade minister saying the United States would not enforce the \nlabor provisions. So why should the Jordanian Government do it when \nthey knew they did not have to?\n  Those days of turning away from our responsibilities are over. In \nNovember 2008 voters in my State, as they did in Michigan, as they did \naround the country, demanded real change, not symbolic differences in \npolicy. The Panama Free Trade Agreement, negotiated under fast-track \nrules by President Bush, is more of the same failed model, trade model, \nand we are hearing stories now that it is time for this Senate and the \nHouse to vote on the Panama Free Trade Agreement. It is a little \nagreement. It is not too bad. It does not really do any damage.\n  Well, it does do damage. It is the same failed trade model that we \nsaw with NAFTA, the same failed trade policy, the same model as the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement, the same kind of trade policy \nand trade mechanism and trade model as we saw with PNTR with China.\n  I hope the administration does not simply push up a Bush trade \nagreement, change its shape a little bit, put some new handprints on \nit, and make some changes at the margin. I hope the administration will \nreshape these trade agreements, reshape our trade policy. We need to \nstop the pattern where the only protectionism in trade agreements is \nprotectionism for the drug companies, protectionism for the oil \ncompanies, and protectionism for the financial services companies, many \nthat have created the economic turmoil we now face.\n  I illustrated one time during a trade debate not too long ago that if \nwe really were concerned about trade agreements, if we were really \nconcerned about doing trade in the right way, of just simply \neliminating the tariff reforms, trade agreements would be one page. It \nwould simply say: Here is the schedule that eliminates trade tariffs.\n  But what we have seen in our trade agreements in the last 10 years is \ntrade agreements that look something like this: This is not exactly the \nreal trade agreement, but they are usually hundreds and hundreds of \npages. And NAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, do you \nknow why they are not just one page or two or three pages of repealing \ntariff schedules? The reason is because it is all about protections. \nYou have protections for drug companies, you have protections for oil \ncompanies, you have protections for banks, you have protections for \ninsurance companies.\n  That is what these trade agreements have all been about. They accuse \nus of protectionism. These trade agreements are bailouts for their \nwealthy friends, for their corporate buddies, for their big campaign \ncontributors. These protections to my friends at the USTR's office \nduring the Bush administration were all about protecting oil, \nprotecting financial services, and we know what that has brought us.\n  Panama, the proposed trade agreement with Panama, includes terms that \nshift extraordinary power to corporations. Panama has a reputation as a \nbanking secrecy jurisdiction and a tax haven. Panama was among 35 \njurisdictions identified by the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development 9 years ago as a tax haven.\n  The GAO reported a number of corporations, U.S. corporations, created \nsubsidiaries in Panama for tax purposes. Now, why would we want to pass \na trade agreement with a nation that has encouraged U.S. companies to \nmove their earnings to their country to avoid U.S. taxes?\n  Why would we reward a country that makes a lot of money by enticing \nthese corporations to come to their country: We will help you avoid \nyour taxes? Why do we reward a country like that? Why do we want more \nof that, especially when we know and when we look at what has happened \nwith corporate salaries. If we look at what has happened with the \nbanks, and they know we do those kind of things, it simply does not \nmake sense.\n  In addition, investments derived from illegal activities--namely, \ndrug dealing--have also been known to exist in Panama. Several sources \nindicate that Panama serves as a tax haven for as many as 400,000--\nmostly, not all, United States--companies, and Panama has refused to \nsign a tax disclosure agreement with the United States. This is not \njust Panama saying, come visit us, come move some of your executives \nand, on paper, move some of your work to Panama. But then, to avoid \ntaxes, we don't even make them disclose what those companies are and \nthe taxes they have evaded. Such an agreement would deter tax cheats \nfrom evading taxes through Panama and would enable the IRS to verify \nthat income subject to tax in the United States has been properly \nreported.\n  Offshore tax evasion is an enormous problem. We have heard Senator \nDorgan talk about what has happened in the Cayman Islands. It is an \nenormous problem that would be potentially aggravated by the free trade \nagreement itself and also by Panama's continuing refusal to enter into \na disclosure agreement with the United States. Why would we complete a \ntrade deal which includes these extraordinary protections for \ncorporations with a country that has secrecy issues? The old model for \ntrade agreements no longer works.\n  As Mayor Kirk begins his work at USTR, as we confirm him in the next \nfew days--and I hope we will--we can create an alternative framework \nthat rewrites trade rules for globalization, trade rules that protect \nour national interests and strengthen our workers and communities.\n  We are all accountable in this body for trade votes, how our votes \naffect American workers, how our trade policies affect Lima and \nZanesville and Dayton and Middleton and Portsmouth and Hamilton. We are \nall accountable for trade votes. Most of us want trade. We want more \ntrade, but we want it under a different set of rules. Fidelity to a \nbroken trade system will not put our economy back on track and workers \nback to work. The small business owner or manufacturer in a machine \nshop or tool and dye company in Akron or a local machine shop in Dayton \nor workers and business owners around the country don't want more of \nthe same. It is time to rethink trade policy. We want trade, more of \nit. But we want it under a different set of rules that works for \nworkers, for communities, and for the country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3063-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport of expanded embryonic stem cell research and to thank President \nObama for reversing the Federal limitations imposed on stem cell \nresearch by the previous administration. I also thank my colleagues \nSenators Harkin, Specter, Feinstein, Hatch, and Reid, for their ongoing \nleadership on this issue.\n  Research on human embryonic stem cells began in 1998 and is still \nonly in its infancy. In this short time, researchers have made great \nstrides in stem cell research, discovering the scientific potential of \nembryonic stem cells and their ability to treat and cure diseases that \naffect patients and families across our country. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the true potential of embryonic stem cell research has not yet \nbeen realized. For the past 8 years, Federal funding has been limited \nto the study of embryonic stem cell lines derived before August 9, \n2001, significantly hampering the ability of researchers to effectively \nstudy the full potential of these cells. Political issues, funding \nconsiderations, and the limited pipeline of talented researchers \nspecializing in this new field have slowed the development of a robust \nresearch community focused on stem cell investigation.\n  Stem cells could be a boon to medical research and treatment in a \nvariety of ways: as replacement cells for those cells that have been \nlost or destroyed because of disease; as tools for studying early \nevents in human development; as test systems for new drug therapies; \nand as vehicles to deliver genes that could correct defects. The more \nthat is learned about embryonic stem cells, the better scientists can \nassess their full therapeutic potential and that of other stem cell \ntypes.\n  This research is so critical to the scientific understanding of \ndiseases, therapies, and cures that impact millions of Americans. \nEmbryonic stem cells could lead to treatments for diseases that afflict \nup to 100 million Americans, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's \ndisease, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, spinal cord injuries, and so \nmany other debilitating conditions.\n  Now, I have always been a supporter of stem cell research and have \nlong recognized the importance of this critical research to the \nscientific community. However, stem cell research became personal for \nme in 2007 when my oldest granddaughter Elle was diagnosed with \ndiabetes. But my family is not alone in either struggling with the \ndisease of juvenile diabetes or recognizing the importance of stem cell \nresearch to a potential cure for the disease. Mimi Silverman of \nBedford, NH, speaks eloquently about what it is like to be the parent \nof a diabetic. Her daughter Abby, who is now 30, was diagnosed with \ndiabetes at the age of 7. Mimi knows about the toll that diabetes takes \non the entire family and she talks about the psychological effects on \nher family, not knowing what each day will bring. She describes the \ndisease as a ticking timebomb in which there is always uncertainty and \nunderlying apprehension.\n  A few years ago, Abby, Mimi's daughter, was 2 weeks away from getting \nmarried. She was living alone in Minneapolis, 1,500 miles away from her \nfiance and her family. She was alone in her apartment and because of \ndiabetes, she fell unconscious. Luckily, her fiance called. He realized \nthat Abby was incoherent and he was able to contact the apartment \nmanager to unlock the door and get her help. But had her fiance not \ncalled when he did, in all likelihood, Abby would not be alive today. \nMimi is now a leading advocate in New Hampshire in support of stem cell \nresearch.\n  Laura Clark, from Antrim, NH, is 25 years old. Five years ago she was \nin the final year of her nursing studies at the University of New \nHampshire. Unfortunately, she was in a tragic car accident on the way \nto the movies. As a result of the collision, Laura's neck was crushed \nand after two weeks in intensive care and 11 weeks in rehabilitation, \nLaura recovered but is now quadriplegic. While her spirit is strong, \nher life has changed dramatically. The accident not only affected \nLaura, but of course her family was affected as well. Her mother Kathy \nquit her job to stay home to take care of Laura, and her younger \nsister, who was in high school at the time, was not able to go on to \ncollege. Laura doesn't give up the hope that some day, as a result of \nstem cell research, a scientist will discover a way to help her regain \nher independence.\n  Stem cell research holds the potential to help Elle, to help Abby, \nand to help Laura, and so many others in New Hampshire and across this \ncountry. I thank President Obama for recognizing the importance of this \nissue and for providing an opportunity for us to reverse the stem cell \npolicy that has slowed the pace of medical research and hindered the \ndevelopment of therapeutic treatments for medical conditions ranging \nfrom diabetes and spinal cord injuries to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. \nI now look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the \nnew administration to ensure continued support of stem cell research. \nThrough increased funding and ensuring that moral and ethical \nguidelines for research are established in this growing field, I am \nhopeful that the scientific community will continue with crucial stem \ncell innovations that will positively affect the lives of those three \nyoung women whom I talked about and so many people across this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, the Fiscal Year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations \nAct, which President Obama signed yesterday, contains $36.6 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority for the Department of State and Foreign \nOperations, which is the same amount approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee in July 2008.\n  This represents a $1.6 billion decrease from former President Bush's \nbudget request of $38.2 billion. I repeat--this legislation is $1.6 \nbillion below what former President Bush recommended in his budget.\n  It is a $3.8 billion increase from the fiscal year 2008 enacted \nlevel, not counting supplemental funds, and $968 million above the \nfiscal year 2008 level including fiscal year 2008 supplemental and \nfiscal year 2009 bridge funds.\n  The State and Foreign Operations portion of the omnibus does not \ncontain any congressional earmarks. It does, as is customary and \nappropriate, specify funding levels for authorized programs, certain \ncountries, and international organizations like the United Nations and \nthe World Bank.\n  I want to thank Chairman Inouye, President Pro Tempore Byrd, and \nRanking Member Cochran for their support throughout this protracted \nprocess. And I want to thank Senator Gregg, who as ranking member of \nthe State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee worked with me to produce \nthis bipartisan legislation that was reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee with only one dissenting vote.\n  It was imperative that we enacted this legislation. The alternative \nof a year-long continuing resolution would have been devastating for \nthe operations of the State Department and our embassies, consulates \nand missions around the world, and for programs that support a myriad \nof United States foreign policy interests and that protect the security \nof the American people. Many Senators on both sides of the aisle were \nencouraged that Senator Clinton was nominated for and confirmed to be \nSecretary of State. If we\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nwant her to succeed we must provide the tools to do so. This \nlegislation supports her highest priority of rebuilding the civilian \ncapabilities of our government.\n  The omnibus provides $7.8 billion for Department of State operations, \na decrease of $274 million below former President's Bush's request and \n$1.2 billion above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level, not including \nsupplemental funds. Counting emergency funds provided in fiscal year \n2008 for personnel, operations and security costs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the omnibus provides a 5.6-percent increase.\n  These increases are attributed to a major investment in personnel, \nprimarily to replace worldwide positions that were redirected to Iraq \nand invest particularly in countries of growing importance in South \nAsia. The omnibus supports the request of 500 additional positions, \nmuch of which will help posts left depleted, some by 25 percent, due to \npositions shifting to Iraq during the last 5 years. In addition, the \nomnibus recommends $75 million for a new initiative to train and deploy \npersonnel in postconflict stabilization. These critical investments \nwould have been lost under a year-long continuing resolution.\n  The omnibus provides $1.7 billion for construction of new secure \nembassies and to provide security upgrades to existing facilities, \nwhich is $178 million below former President Bush's request. He had \nproposed a 41-percent increase which we did not have the funds to \nsupport. But an increase of $99.5 million, or 13 percent, above the \nfiscal year 2008 enacted level is provided considering the significant \nthreats our embassies faced last year alone, from Yemen to Belgrade. \nEven this lesser increase for embassy construction and security \nupgrades would be lost under a year-long continuing resolution.\n  Specifically, the omnibus provides $4.24 billion for diplomatic and \nconsular programs, which funds State Department personnel. This is an \nincrease of $464 million, or 12 percent, above the fiscal year 2008 \nenacted level and $42 million above the President's request. This funds \na major investment in personnel to increase language training and \nexpand the number of personnel in regions of growing importance. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have strongly endorsed this \ninvestment, but it would not be funded under a continuing resolution.\n  In fact, under a year-long continuing resolution the State Department \nwould not have the resources to fund the staff currently serving at 267 \nposts overseas, due to exchange rate losses and the increased cost of \nsecurity overseas. That means the United States would have even less \nrepresentation than we do now, which none of us here would find \nacceptable.\n  The omnibus provides $1.1 billion for worldwide security protection \nfor noncapital security upgrades, an increase of $355 million above the \nfiscal year 2008 enacted level and $46 million below the request. This \naccount funds all the Diplomatic Security agents at every post \nworldwide, armored vehicles, and training--all investments which, \nagain, have bipartisan support. The increases would fund additional \npersonnel for protection at high-threat embassies and oversight of \nsecurity contractors in Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel-West Bank. This \nwould not be possible under a continuing resolution.\n  Senators of both parties have expressed strong support for expanding \ninternational exchange programs, particularly in predominantly Muslim \ncountries. The omnibus provides $538 million for education and cultural \nexchanges, which is $15.5 million above the President's request and an \nincrease of $36.6 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. \nThose additional funds would be lost under a continuing resolution at \nthe moment when the U.S. has the greatest opportunity to reintroduce \nour country, our people, and our values to the rest of the world.\n  The same is true of public diplomacy. The omnibus provides $394.8 \nmillion for the State Department's public diplomacy activities, \nincluding outreach, media and programs in embassies to develop \nrelationships with people in host countries. This is $33.9 million \nabove the fiscal year 2008 level, which would not be available under a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  The omnibus provides $1.7 billion for construction of new secure \nembassies and maintenance of existing facilities, a $280 million \nincrease above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level and $83 million below \nthe President's request. Of this amount, $801 million is for embassy \nmaintenance, $40 million less than the request and $46 million above \nthe fiscal year 2008 enacted level.\n  The omnibus provides $770 million for planning, design and \nconstruction of new embassies and office buildings worldwide, $178 \nmillion below the request and $99 million above the fiscal year 2008 \nenacted level. Any Senator who has traveled abroad has seen the need to \nreplace insecure and old embassies. There is already a long waiting \nlist, and it would be even longer under a continuing resolution.\n  Former President Bush's budget underfunded the U.S. assessed \ncontribution to U.N. Peacekeeping in fiscal year 2009 by assuming a \nreduction in every mission except Sudan. That was pie in the sky. The \ncost of most of these missions is increasing, not decreasing. The \nomnibus provides $1.5 billion for U.N. Peacekeeping, an increase of \n$295 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level and $20 million \nabove the President's request. However, compared to the total amount \nenacted in fiscal year 2008, the bill is $173 million below the \noperating level in fiscal year 2008 including supplemental funds. These \nare costs we are obligated to pay by treaty. They support the troops of \nother nations in Darfur, the Congo, Lebanon, Haiti, and a dozen other \ncountries.\n  The omnibus provides $1.5 billion for contributions to international \norganizations, the same as the President's request and $186 million \nabove the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. The account funds the U.S. \nassessed dues to 47 international organizations, including NATO, IAEA, \nOECD, the U.N. and others for which, as a member of the organization, \nthe U.S. is obligated by treaty to contribute. We either pay now or we \npay later.\n  The omnibus provides $709.5 million for the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors, an increase of $39.5 million above the fiscal year 2008 \nenacted level and $10 million above the former President Bush's budget \nrequest. This includes funding for languages which the former \nadministration proposed to eliminate in fiscal year 2009, such as \nRussian, Georgian, Kazak, Uzbek, Tibetan and the Balkans, where freedom \nof speech remains restricted and broadcasting programs are still \nnecessary to provide unbiased news.\n  For USAID, the omnibus provides $808.6 million for operating \nexpenses, $41.4 million above former President Bush's request and $179 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. This continues \nefforts begun last year to address the serious staff shortage at USAID, \nbut under a continuing resolution USAID's staff problems would continue \nto worsen. It would not be able to hire additional staff for \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, or for other posts where there is not \nsufficient oversight of contracting and procurement. It is a crisis \nsituation that I and Senator Gregg are determined to fix.\n  For bilateral economic assistance, the omnibus provides a total of \n$17.1 billion, $1.3 billion below former President Bush's request and \n$623.3 million above the fiscal year 2008 level. We received requests \nfrom most Senators--Democrats and Republicans--for funding from within \nthis account, totaling far more than we could afford. A continuing \nresolution would have made it impossible to fund many, if not most, of \nthose requests.\n  A good example is global health. The omnibus provides $7.1 billion \nfor global health and child survival, an increase of $757 million above \nthe request and $737 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. \nA continuing resolution would be devastating for these life-saving \nprograms.\n  A total of $495 million is provided for child survival and maternal \nhealth, an increase of $125 million above former President Bush's \nrequest and $49 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. These \nfunds are for programs that directly decrease child and maternal \nmortality from preventable diseases, like malaria, polio and pneumonia. \nUnder a continuing resolution USAID would not be able to expand its \nmalaria control programs to other countries in Africa with a high \nincidence of malaria, which kills a million people, mostly African \nchildren, every year.\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\n  The omnibus provides $300 million for safe water programs, including \nincreasing access to safe drinking water and sanitation, which is a key \nfactor in improving public health.\n  Former President Bush proposed a steep cut in funding for family \nplanning and reproductive health programs, even though they are the \nmost effective means of reducing unwanted pregnancies and abortions. \nThe omnibus, instead, provides a total of $545 million from all \naccounts for family planning and reproductive health including $50 \nmillion for the U.N. Population Fund, which is $82 million above the \nfiscal year 2008 level. A continuing resolution would eliminate those \nadditional funds, and the number of unintended pregnancies and \nabortions would increase.\n  The omnibus provides a total of $5.5 billion for programs to combat \nHIV/AIDS, $388 million above former President Bush's request and $459 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2008 level. Of this amount, $600 million \nis provided for the global fund to fight HIV/AIDS, which is $400 \nmillion above the request. Additionally within the total, $350 million \nis provided for USAID programs to combat HIV/AIDS, which is $8 million \nabove the request.\n  These additional funds, which pay for life-sustaining antiretroviral \ndrugs, prevention and care programs, would be lost under a continuing \nresolution, to the detriment of 1 million people who would receive \nlife-saving treatment this year. With this funding 2 million additional \nHIV infections would be prevented this year. Instead of 10 million \nlives we are saving today, we have the opportunity to save 12 million \npeople. We have the opportunity with this bill to save 1 million more \norphans or vulnerable children who are either infected with HIV or have \nbeen orphaned because a parent died from HIV/AIDS. Why would we not \nmake this investment this year?\n  The development assistance account funds energy and environment \nprograms, microcredit programs, private enterprise, rule of law, trade \ncapacity, and many other activities that Senators on both sides of the \naisle support. The omnibus provides $1.8 billion for development \nassistance which is $161 million above former President Bush's request \nand $176 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level.\n  The omnibus provides $350 million for international disaster \nassistance, $52 million above the request and $30 million above the \nfiscal year 2008 enacted level, excluding supplemental funds. These \nfunds enable the United States to put its best face forward when \ndisaster strikes, as it did with the tsunami, the earthquake in \nPakistan, floods in Central America, and famine in Africa.\n  The omnibus provides $875 million for the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation. This is $1.3 billion below the request and $669 million \nbelow the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. This reflects the view of the \nHouse and Senate that the Congress supports the MCC but wants to see a \nslowdown in new compacts, while $7 billion in previously appropriated \nfunds are disbursed, and while the new administration decides how it \nwants to fund the MCC in the future. The agreement provides sufficient \nfunds to continue current operations and to commence two new compacts \nof $350 million each.\n  For the Peace Corps, the omnibus provides $340 million, which is $9 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2008 level. Those additional funds would \nhave been lost under a continuing resolution.\n  The omnibus provides $875 million for international narcotics control \nand law enforcement, which is $327 million below the request and $321 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. Those additional \nfunds for programs in Latin America, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and many \nother countries would be lost under a continuing resolution.\n  There is a total of $405 million for continued support of the Merida \nInitiative, including $300 million for Mexico and $105 million for the \ncountries of Central America. The fiscal year 2008 supplemental \nincluded $400 million and $65 million, respectively. We are all \nincreasingly alarmed by the spread of drug-related violence and \ncriminal gangs in Mexico, but under a continuing resolution there would \nbe nothing for the Merida Initiative.\n  Migration and refugee assistance is funded at $931 million, which is \n$167 million above former President Bush's request and $108 million \nabove the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. That $108 million would be \nlost under a continuing resolution. This amount is already $557 million \nbelow what was provided in fiscal year 2008 including supplemental and \nfiscal year 2009 bridge funds. These funds are used for basic care and \nprotection of refugees and internally displaced persons, whose numbers \nare not expected to decrease this year.\n  The omnibus provides $4.9 billion for military assistance and \npeacekeeping operations, $173 million below former President Bush's \nrequest but $212.6 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. \nThe omnibus assumes $170 million provided in the fiscal year 2008 \nsupplemental as fiscal year 2009 bridge funds for military assistance \nto Israel, making the total amount for Israel equal to the President's \nrequest, $2.55 billion. The additional $212.6 million for other \nimportant bilateral relationships would be lost under a continuing \nresolution.\n  For contributions to the multilateral development institutions, which \nwe owe by treaty, the bill provides $1.8 billion. That is $503 million \nbelow the former President's request and $251 million above the fiscal \nyear 2008 enacted level. A continuing resolution would have put us \nanother $251 million in arrears, in addition to the arrears we already \nowe.\n  The omnibus provides the amounts requested by the former President \nfor the Export-Import Bank, an increase of $26.5 million above fiscal \nyear 2008. By not passing this legislation, these additional resources \nwould not have been available to make U.S. businesses competitive in \nthe global marketplace. At this time of economic downturn at home we \nshould be doing everything we can to support U.S. trade.\n  These are the highlights of the fiscal year 2009 State and Foreign \nOperations portion of the omnibus that passed by a vote of 62-38. It \ncontains funding to meet critical operational costs and programmatic \nneeds which support U.S. interests and protect U.S. security around the \nworld.\n  A handful of our friends in the minority spent days criticizing the \nomnibus because it contains earmarks. Apparently they would have \npreferred that unnamed, unelected bureaucrats make all the decisions \nabout the use of taxpayer dollars. In fact, the total amount of the \n$410 billion omnibus that Members of Congress--Democrats and \nRepublicans--have earmarked for schools, fire and police departments, \nroads, bridges, hospitals, scientific research, universities and other \norganizations and programs in their states and districts which would \nnot otherwise receive funding, is less than 1 percent. That is what the \naggrieved speeches were about. A whopping 1 percent.\n  Some Senators complained that the omnibus--all but a small fraction \nof which would fund the budget requests of former President Bush--is \nmore than we can afford. Those are the same Senators who, year after \nyear, rubberstamped billions and billions of borrowed dollars to fund \nan unnecessary war and reconstruction programs in Iraq that were \nfraught with waste and abuse.\n  Some say that the intervention of the Economic Recovery and \nReinvestment Act is why they opposed the omnibus. Regarding the \nDepartment of State and Foreign Operations, 99.6 percent of the omnibus \nhas no correlation whatsoever to what was funded by the Recovery Act. \nThis portion of the omnibus funds all of the United States' activities \noverseas. All of the key new investments I have described would not \nhave been possible under a year-long continuing resolution.\n  The funding for State and Foreign Operations in the omnibus amounts \nto about 1 percent of the total budget of this country. However one \nviews the Economic Recovery Act, the damage that a year-long continuing \nresolution would have caused to the functions of our embassies, \nconsulates and missions, and to the foreign service officers who serve \nthe American people around the world, would have been devastating. The \ndamage to programs would be measured in lives.\n  We have seen the image of our country battered beyond recognition. \nThe values our country was founded on were ignored, ridiculed, and \ndiminished. Democrats and Republicans\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\nalike recognize that the United States needs to reinvigorate its \nengagement in the world, particularly through rebuilding alliances and \nusing diplomacy more effectively. The omnibus puts our money where our \nmouths are. The alternative would have been to retract, and to invite \nothers to fill the vacuum. That might save money in the short term, but \nit would have cost us dearly in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3066-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUSINESS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad Republican Senators abandoned \ntheir efforts to filibuster the nomination of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. It was only after the majority leader filed for cloture that \nthe Republican caucus came to the conclusion that such a maneuver was \nfutile. I thank the majority leader for scheduling the debate and votes \nfor the President's nominees to serve as Deputy Attorney General and \nAssociate Attorney General. They have now been confirmed by the Senate.\n  The Republican minority, nonetheless, insisted on 7 hours of debate \non the Deputy Attorney General nomination this week before allowing the \nvote. That was longer than the debate they demanded on the nomination \nof the Attorney General of the United States. I spoke yesterday to open \nthe debate, as did the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, who also supported the nomination. We both \nspoke, again, today to close the debate.\n  I followed the debate, and have responded by way of additional \nstatements to correct the record on the Deputy Attorney General \nnominee.\n  Now I would like us to take a step back and see what has occurred. \nYesterday, the Republican minority insisted on 5 hours of debate on the \nOgden nomination. In fact, the Republican opposition devoted less than \n1 hour to comment about the Ogden nomination. The rest of their time \nthey consumed with criticism of the President's budget and policy \ninitiatives to help the country recover from the economic crisis. I am \nnot saying that the budget discussion is unimportant. I may not agree \nwith their criticism, but the budget is certainly a topic about which \nSenators may wish to make statements. My point is that after delaying \ndebate on the President's nomination for the No. 2 official at the \nJustice Department for 2 weeks, and demanding extended debate, they \nfailed to use the time to discuss the nomination. Instead, they talked \nabout unrelated issues.\n  In fact, they were so uninterested in debating the nomination that by \nthe time Senator Inhofe came to the floor, all Republican time had been \nused on other discussions. As a courtesy, we made available time from \nthe Democratic side that should have been used by supporters of the \nnomination. We accommodated the Senator from Oklahoma so that he could \nspeak against the nomination.\n  Today, an additional 2 hours was demanded by the Republican majority \nto debate the Ogden nomination further before they would allow a vote. \nOf course, those Republicans who opposed the nomination used not 1 \nminute of time to debate it today--not 1 minute.\n  Indeed, of the time that the Republican minority insisted was \nnecessary before the Senate could vote on the Ogden nomination, more \nthan an hour was wasted in quorum calls with no speakers at all \nyesterday and approximately 1 hour was spent by opposition speakers--\nnot 7 hours, not 3 hours, barely 1 hour. The Ogden debate could easily \nhave been handled with the opposition taking an hour or an hour and \none-half to speak.\n  I wish instead of this campaign to delay and obstruct the President, \nthe minority would work with us on the consideration of matters of \ncritical importance to the American people. I will note just one \ncurrent example. This morning, the New York Times had a front-page \nstory about financial frauds. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nreported an antifraud matter to the Senate. The Leahy-Grassley Fraud \nEnforcement and Recovery Act, S.386, needs to be considered without \ndelay. It is an important initiative to confront the fraud that has \ncontributed to the economic and financial crisis we face, and to \nprotect against the diversion of the Federal efforts to recover from \nthis downturn.\n  As the New York Times story demonstrates, improving our efforts to \nhold those accountable for the mortgage and financial frauds that have \ncontributed to the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression is \nmost timely. We need to do better, and our bipartisan bill, which has \nthe support of the U.S. Department of Justice, can make a difference. \nIn addition to Senator Grassley, I thank Senator Kaufman, Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Schumer, and Senator Shelby for working with us and \nfor their interest in this important measure.\n  Our legislation is designed to reinvigorate our capacity to \ninvestigate and prosecute the kinds of frauds that have undermined our \neconomy and hurt so many hard-working Americans. It provides the \nresources and tools needed for law enforcement to aggressively enforce \nand prosecute fraud in connection with bailout and recovery efforts. It \nauthorizes $245 million a year over the next couple of years for fraud \nprosecutors and investigators. With this funding, the FBI can double \nthe number of mortgage fraud taskforces nationwide, and target the \nhardest hit areas. It includes resources for our U.S. Attorneys' \nOffices, as well as the Secret Service, the HUD Inspector General's \nOffice and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. It includes important \nimprovements to our fraud and money laundering statutes to strengthen \nprosecutors' ability to confront fraud in mortgage lending practices, \nto protect TARP funds, and to uncover fraudulent schemes involving \ncommodities futures, options and derivatives as well as making sure the \nGovernment can recover the ill-gotten proceeds from crime.\n  Our bipartisan measure was favorably reported on a voice vote by the \nJudiciary Committee on March 5. I have been trying to get a time \nagreement to consider the measure ever since. The Senate should \nconsider and pass it without delay. We can help make a difference for \nall Americans. Instead of wasting our time in quorum calls when no one \nis speaking, or demanding multiple hours of debates on nominations that \ncan be discussed in much less time before being confirmed, let us work \non matters that will help get us out of the economic ditch that we have \ninherited from the policies of the last administration, and let us \nbegin to work together on behalf of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3066-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3066-S3067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EL SALVADOR ELECTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Sunday the people of El Salvador will \ngo to the polls to elect a new President. As one Senator who has \nfollowed developments in that country and observed with concern the \nsteady rise in violent crime, including organized crime and drug \ntrafficking, I hope that whoever wins the election makes reforming the \npolice and justice system a priority.\n  United States assistance to El Salvador is a small fraction of what \nit was during the 1980s, but in 2006 El Salvador signed a 5-year \ncompact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The compact totals \n$461 million, and focuses on road construction, economic and social \ndevelopment in the area of the country bordering Honduras that bore the \nbrunt of the worst consequences of the civil war.\n  I had hoped that a portion of the MCC compact would be used to \nstrengthen El Salvador's dysfunctional judicial system, both to help \nreduce violent crime and attract foreign investment, but unfortunately \nthat was not the decision of the Salvadoran Government or the Bush \nadministration at the time. Nevertheless, the MCC compact does seek to \nimprove the lives of some of El Salvador's poorest communities and I \nsupport it.\n  Recently, I have been concerned with reports that some Salvadorans \ninvolved in the election campaign may have asserted that if the \nopposition party candidate wins the election the United States will \nstop funding the MCC compact. Such an assertion, presumably to \nintimidate voters, would be completely false.\n  We take no position on the Salvadoran election. It is entirely for \nthe people of El Salvador to decide who their next President will be. \nThe MCC compact will continue regardless of who wins on Sunday, as long \nas the policies of the new Government, of whichever party, are \nconsistent with\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nthe MCC's eligibility criteria, including controlling corruption and \ninvesting in health and education.\n  I look forward to the results of Sunday's election and the \nopportunity for our two countries to work together for a brighter \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3067-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE EXPANSION OF NATO\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 10-year \nanniversary of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \nNATO.\n  During the debate on whether to expand NATO, I said that this debate \nholds special resonance for me. Growing up as a Polish American in east \nBaltimore, I learned about the burning of Warsaw at the end of the \nSecond World War. The Germans burned Warsaw to the ground--killing a \nquarter of a million people--as Soviet troops watched from the other \nside of the Vistula River. I learned about the Katyn massacre--where \nRussia murdered more than four thousand Polish military officers and \nintellectuals in the Katyn Forest at the start of the Second World War.\n  The tragedies that Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary \nexperienced in the aftermath of the Second World War are etched on my \nheart. That was the one reason I fought so long and so hard for Poland \nand the others to be part of the western family of nations.\n  Despite the importance of history, my support for NATO enlargement \nwas based on the future. My support was based on what is best for \nAmerica. Thankfully when we voted to bring Poland, the Czech Republic, \nand Hungary into NATO, the yeas carried the day. Since that day, those \nthree nations have exceeded every expectation as strong allies of the \nUnited States, and the naysayers' fears during the debate on the NATO \nexpansion have also been shown as unwarranted.\n  The NATO expansion nations of 1999, Poland, the Czech Republic, and \nHungary have more than lived up to their obligations under the NATO \nalliance. Poland has made enormous investments into all areas of its \nmilitary. As a result, over the last 10 years the number of Polish \ntroops serving on NATO missions has steadily grown from 1500 to over \n3500. Another 300 Polish military personnel serve in prestigious \nacademic and administrative positions in NATO institutions around the \nworld. Polish naval vessels also operate as part of NATO standing \nreaction forces all over the world, providing cutting edge mine \ndetection and countermeasures expertise.\n  Poland has also emerged as one of the United States' strongest allies \nin the war against terrorism and extremism around the globe. Polish \ntroops accompanied American soldiers into Iraq when they invaded in \n2003, and maintained a mission that grew as large as 2500 troops up \nuntil the end of 2008. Nearly 30 Polish soldiers gave their lives in \nIraq. Poland also has one of the largest contingents in Afghanistan. \nOver 1600 Polish soldiers fight every day to stabilize the Afghan \nprovince of Ghazni. Nine Polish soldiers have been killed and dozens \nwounded in Iraq.\n  In closing, I wish to speak a bit about history. My colleagues have \nheard me speak about Poland's history many times in the past. For 40 \nyears, I watched the people of Poland live under brutal, communist \nrule. They did not choose Communism--it was forced upon them. Each \nethnic group in America brings our own history to our wonderful \nAmerican mosaic. Bringing these three nations into NATO family of \nnations 10 years ago was one of the best decisions we made in the post-\ncold war era. Of all the things I have done in my years in the Senate, \nthis is one of those for which I am most proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3067-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3067-S3068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to express my grave concern at \nthe continuing massacres, kidnappings, and terror orchestrated by the \nLord's Resistance Army, the LRA, in northeastern Congo and southern \nSudan. As many of my colleagues know, I have long been engaged in \nefforts to bring an end to this--one of Africa's longest running and \nmost gruesome rebel wars. In 2004, I authored and Congress passed the \nNorthern Uganda Crisis Response Act, which committed the United States \nto work vigorously for a lasting resolution to this conflict. In 2007, \nI visited displacement camps in northern Uganda and saw first-hand the \nimpact the violence orchestrated by the LRA has had throughout the \nregion. I have been frustrated as the LRA has been able to move in \nrecent years across porous regional borders to gain new footholds in \nnortheastern Congo, southern Sudan, and even the Central African \nRepublic, with little consequence.\n  Just over 2 months ago, the Ugandan, Congolese, and South Sudanese \nmilitaries launched a joint offensive against the LRA's primary bases \nin northeastern Congo. Serious concerns have been raised about the \nplanning and implementation of this operation. Since the military \nstrike began, the LRA has been able to carry out a series of new \nmassacres in Congo and Sudan, leaving over 900 people dead. That is a \nkilling rate that, according to the Genocide Intervention Network, \nexceeds that in Darfur or even in Somalia. Hundreds of new children \nhave been abducted and new communities have been devastated and \ndisplaced. It is tragically clear that insufficient attention and \nresources were devoted to ensuring the protection of civilians during \nthe operation. Meanwhile, the LRA's leader, Joseph Kony, and his \ncommanders escaped the initial aerial assault and have continued to \nevade the militaries. Thus far, this operation has resulted in the \nworst-case scenario: it has failed to stop the LRA, while spurring the \nrebels to intensify their attacks against civilians.\n  I am not ruling out that this offensive--still ongoing--may yet \nsucceed. Indeed, I strongly hope it does. On several occasions last \nyear, Kony refused to sign a comprehensive peace agreement with the \nGovernment of Uganda, an agreement that even included provisions to \nshield him from an International Criminal Court indictment. At the same \ntime, as negotiations were still underway, his forces launched new \nattacks in Congo, Sudan, and, for the first time, Central African \nRepublic. They abducted hundreds of youths to rebuild their ranks. It \nwas apparent that Kony was not interested in a negotiated settlement, \ndespite the good efforts of mediators and northern Ugandan civil \nsociety leaders. I supported those peace negotiations, but it became \nincreasingly clear that the LRA's leaders would only be stopped when \nforced to do so.\n  For many years I have pressed for a political solution to the crisis \nin northern Uganda. I pressed for the international community to work \ncollectively to support efforts to bring peace and stability to this \nwar-torn area. And against all odds, the most recent peace talks in \nJuba, South Sudan, did see a collective effort but to no avail. These \nnegotiations were not perfect but for some time offered a path forward \nand provided a framework to address the underlying grievances of \ncommunities in northern Uganda. But then, it became increasing clear \nthat Joseph Kony had no intention of ever signing the final agreement \nand had instead been conducting new abductions to replenish his rebel \ngroup. It became increasingly clear that Kony and his top commanders \nwould stand in the way of any comprehensive political solution.\n  These failed talks justify military action against the LRA's top \ncommand, but that action must be carefully considered. As we have seen \ntoo many times, offensive operations that are poorly designed and \npoorly carried out risk doing more harm than good, inflaming a \nsituation rather than resolving it. Before launching any operation \nagainst the rebels, the regional militaries should have ensured that \ntheir plan had a high probability of success, anticipated \ncontingencies, and made precautions to minimize dangers to civilians. \nIt is widely known that when facing military offensive in the past, the \nLRA have quickly dispersed and committed retaliatory attacks against \ncivilians. Furthermore, to be sustainable, military action needs to be \nplaced within a larger counterinsurgency strategy that integrates \noutreach to local populations, active programs for basic service \nprovision and reconstruction in affected areas, and mechanisms for ex-\ncombatant disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. Those \nmechanisms are especially important in the case of the LRA because of \nthe large number of child abductees who make up the rebel ranks.\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\n  As this operation continues, I hope the regional militaries are \nidentifying their earlier mistakes and adjusting their strategy in \nresponse. Meanwhile, the international community cannot continue to \nstay on the sidelines as these massacres continue. The United Nations \nSecurity Council should take up this matter immediately and, in \ncoordination with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative \nfor LRA-affected areas, develop a plan and new resources to enhance \ncivilian protection. I urge the Obama administration to use its voice \nand vote at the Security Council to see that this happens. At the same \ntime, I urge the administration to develop an interagency strategy for \nhow the United States can contribute to longer term efforts to disarm \nand demobilize the LRA, restore the rule of law in affected areas of \nCongo and Sudan, and address political and economic marginalization in \nnorthern Uganda that initially gave rise to this rebel group.\n  This is not to suggest the United States has not already been \ninvolved with the ongoing operation. AFRICOM officials have \nacknowledged that they provided assistance and support for this \noperation at the request of the regional governments.\n  As a 17-year member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs and \nsomeone who has been involved with AFRICOM since its conception, I \nwould like to offer some thoughts on this matter. While I supported \nAFRICOM's creation, I have been concerned about its potential to \neclipse our civilian agencies and thereby perpetuate perceptions on the \ncontinent of a militarized U.S. policy. It is essential that we get \nthis balance right and protect chief of mission authority. By doing so, \nwe can help ensure AFRICOM contributes to broader efforts to bring \nlasting peace and stability across Africa. When I visited AFRICOM's \nheadquarters last December and talked with senior officials, we \ndiscussed the important roles that it can play. They include helping to \ndevelop effective, well-disciplined militaries that adhere to civilian \nrule, strengthening regional peacekeeping missions, and supporting \npostconflict demobilization and disarmament processes. In my view, \nassisting a multilateral operation to disarm an armed group that preys \non civilians and wreaks regional havoc fits this job description, \ntheoretically, at least.\n  To put it bluntly, I believe supporting viable and legitimate efforts \nto disarm and demobilize the LRA is exactly the kind of thing in which \nAFRICOM should be engaged. Of course, the key words there are viable \nand legitimate. We should not be supporting operations that we believe \nare substantially flawed and do not have a high probability of success. \nFurthermore, we should ensure that operations we assist do not \nexacerbate inter-state tensions or violate international humanitarian \nlaw. If we get involved, even in an advisory capacity, we have to be \nwilling to take responsibility for outcomes, whether anticipated or \nnot. To that end, it is critical that the State Department is not only \ninvolved but plays a leading role in ensuring that any military \nactivities are coordinated with long-term political strategies and our \noverarching foreign policy objectives.\n  In the case of this current operation against the LRA, as I have \nalready outlined, I do not believe these conditions were met or the \nnecessary due diligence undertaken before its launch. But we cannot \njust give up on the goal of ending the massacres and threat to regional \nstability posed by this small rebel group. That is precisely why I am \nurging the development of an interagency strategy to drive U.S. policy \ngoing forward. By putting in place such a proactive strategy, we can \nbetter help the region's leaders to get this mission right and protect \ntheir people from the LRA's continuing atrocities. This could finally \npave the way for a new future for this region and its people and help \nshape an AFRICOM that works effectively for both Africa and America's \nsecurity interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3068-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3068-S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CLEAN TEA\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the Senate \nmany times to discuss the importance of curbing greenhouse gas \nemissions. Over the past several Congresses, I have introduced \nlegislation to create a mandatory cap-and-trade program to help \nutilities reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide, while also \nregulating unhealthy emissions of mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur \ndioxide. Hopefully, later this year, Congress will consider an economy-\nwide, cap-and-trade bill to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\n  But one area that has not received enough attention or comprehensive \ntreatment in climate change proposals is the transportation sector.\n  In all fairness, it is tricky to address. Mobile sources--like cars \nand trucks--are numerous and do not stay in any one jurisdiction. The \namount of pollution they produce is impacted by the efficiency of the \nvehicle, the type of fuel it uses, as well as how far, fast and often \nthe vehicle is driven. Managing all of those different inputs is not an \neasy thing to do. But we must find a way if we are serious about \naddressing climate change.\n  The transportation sector produces 30 percent of greenhouse gas \nemissions and is the fastest growing source of pollution. If we do not \ncurb emissions from transportation, we will either fail to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions to the level scientists tell us is necessary \nto stave off climate change. Or we will have to ask other sectors to \nmake up the difference.\n  When the transportation sector has been considered before, the focus \nhas always been on vehicle fuel economy standards or tailpipe emissions \nstandards. Last Congress, I was extremely proud to play a role in \nincreasing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, standard for cars \nand trucks for the first time in 32 years. The new standard requires \nthe entire U.S. fleet of cars and trucks to average 35 mph by 2020.\n  The new standard has a better chance of success because it applies \nacross the entire U.S. fleet, removing the loophole that encouraged \nauto manufacturers to build larger cars. At the same time, we \nstructured the standard in a way that allows manufacturers to \nspecialize in the vehicles for which they are known. Instead of having \nevery manufacturer meet the 35 mph standard, those that build smaller \ncars will meet a higher standard and those that build larger cars will \nmeet a lower one. But in the end, the fleet as a whole will reach 35 \nmph. We increased CAFE in a way that garnered the support of both \nenvironmentalists and the automobile industry--a model I hope we can \nfollow in developing climate change legislation.\n  In the same bill that raised CAFE, Congress also established a \nRenewable Fuel Standard, RFS, requiring that 36 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuel is sold in 2020--up from 9 billion gallons today.\n  Taken together, the CAFE and RFS is expected to save two million \nbarrels of oil per day and save consumers more than $80 billion at the \npump. It will also reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 18 percent.\n  While this is a major improvement, we must remember that our goal is \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent. We need to look \nfor other ways to make the transportation system cleaner.\n  That is where the bill we are introducing today comes in. The Clean \nLow-Emission Affordable New Transportation Act, or CLEAN TEA, would \nreserve a portion of any auction proceeds from a climate change bill, \nand dedicate it to funding transportation projects that reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  This is a critical piece of the puzzle which, if left out, hampers \nthe effectiveness of the other measures taken by car companies and fuel \nproducers. For example, in 1975, we created CAFE standards to reduce \noil use. But at the same time, we closed down transit systems and built \nhomes far from workplaces, schools, groceries and doctors. As a result, \ndriving increased by 150 percent. Therefore, even though cars got \nsignificantly more efficient, American use of oil increased 50 percent. \nWe cannot afford to make that mistake again.\n  CLEAN TEA requires States and metropolitan planning organizations to \nreview their long-range transportation plans to determine what they \ncould do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by making their \ntransportation system more efficient and providing alternative forms of \ntransportation. Once they establish a goal that is appropriate for \ntheir area and a list of\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nprojects to help them meet that goal, they would receive funding to \nbuild those projects. Eligible projects are anything that is proven to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, including transit, freight or \npassenger rail, sidewalks and bike lanes, carpools and vanpools, \nintelligent transportation systems, congestion pricing measures and \ncoordination of development and transportation plans.\n  Ten percent of auction proceeds might sound like a lot. But as I \nmentioned before, the transportation sector is 30 percent of the \nproblem and growing faster than any other sector. In addition, these \nprojects that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions will save Americans \nmoney and create jobs.\n  The American Public Transit Association recently found that people \nwho use transit regularly save $1,800 a year in transportation costs. \nThe Surface Transportation Policy Project has found that those who live \nin areas with access to public transportation incur significantly lower \ncosts than those who do not. This is incredibly important in a weak \neconomy or when gas prices are high. Most people do not realize that \ntransportation is the second highest expense in most American \nhouseholds--more than health care. For some, transportation costs are \neven higher than their mortgage or rent.\n  Last spring and summer, when gas prices went to $4 a gallon across \nthe country, Americans sought ways to save money by driving less. Many \nof them found that their transportation options were quite limited. \nTheir neighborhoods had no sidewalks and there was little or no transit \nservice. Those who had options, exercised them. But those who didn't \neither had to pay the price of gas and skimp elsewhere or reduce their \nquality of life. This is unacceptable.\n  We fund our transportation system through a gas tax, which is to say \nthat we pay for roads and transit by burning gasoline. When people \ndrive less, our transportation budgets dry up. So states and localities \nthat seek to reduce oil use, lower greenhouse emissions and save their \nconstituents money, get their budgets cut. CLEAN TEA reverses that by \nsending money to states and localities based on how much they reduce \nemissions.\n  As we develop a climate change bill, we must consider how every \nsector of the economy can play a part in lowering greenhouse gas \nemissions. When it comes to the transportation system, we--right here \nin Congress--have a lot to say about how that system is developed, how \nefficient it is and how polluting it is. We should make sure that, as \nwe tell American businesses to get their houses in order, we clean up \nour act as well.\n  Through CLEAN TEA, we have the chance to make progress addressing \nmany problems at once--finding additional funding for transportation \ninfrastructure, building money-saving transportation alternatives and \nlowering greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nmy cosponsorship of the Clean, Low-Emission, Affordable, New \nTransportation Efficiency Act, CLEAN TEA.\n  This bill, which I introduced along with Senator Carper, would \nestablish a fund for transportation initiatives designed to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The fund would be supported by 10 percent of \nthe proceeds of any future cap-and-trade system established by Congress \nto address the issue of climate change. The funding could be used by \nStates and local planning organizations for the development of projects \nsuch as rail, transit, transit-oriented land use and other initiatives \ndesigned to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. It is \nimportant to note, however, that the bill is not focused solely on \nproviding alternatives to auto use. Highway operational improvements \nsuch as demand management programs and intelligent transportation \nsystems would also be eligible if they reduce emissions by utilizing \nhighway capacity in a more efficient manner.\n  These are important steps in lowering our Nation's greenhouse gas \nemissions, reducing our dependence on foreign oil and promoting \ntransportation mobility. Since transportation accounts for one-third of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, it stands to reason that revenue generated \nfrom a cap-and-trade system should be devoted to creating a more \nsustainable transportation future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3069-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to help celebrate Women's \nHistory Month today. This is a time to celebrate the contributions of \nwomen throughout our history and to recognize the work of so many to \nsecure women's rights and fulfill our Nation's promise of equal justice \nunder the law.\n  My own State can be proud that so many Wisconsin women have made \ncritical contributions to the movement for women's suffrage, to \neducation, and to countless other areas of American life. Wisconsin \nachieved extraordinary things to pave the way for suffrage and social \nprogress for generations to come. According to the Wisconsin Historical \nSociety, in 1919 Wisconsin was the first State to ratify the 19th \namendment to grant women the right to vote. Sixty years before that \nhistoric moment, one of the great leaders of the suffrage movement, \nCarrie Chapman Catt, was born in Ripon, WI. Catt's lifelong effort to \npass the 19th amendment, especially her leadership of the National \nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association, was vital to the Amendment's \nultimate success. And Catt didn't stop there. Once the amendment was \nratified, she founded the League of Women Voters to continue and build \non the momentum for change that the women's suffrage movement created. \nCatt's lifetime of persistence and dedication--as a leader for change \nand, earlier in her life, as the only woman in her graduating class at \nIowa Agricultural College and Model Farm--reminds us how hard women \nthroughout our history have worked to secure our rights and freedoms.\n  We also remember the amazing Wisconsin women who have enriched their \nlocal communities, including Margaret Schurz. Schurz started the first \nkindergarten in the Nation in Watertown, WI, in 1856. Her efforts led \nto the implementation of kindergarten and early-education programs \nthroughout the United States. Her legacy is a great example of the \nimpact Wisconsin women have had in bringing about progressive change in \neducation and many other areas.\n  This month we also know that we must continue to advocate for \nfundamental fairness and equality for women. The enactment of the Lily \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 to help ensure protection from pay \ndiscrimination represents another step forward, but there remains a \nlong road ahead of us. In addition to passing the Fair Pay Act, \nCongress needs to do more to ensure all of America's citizens receive \nequal pay for equal work. Wage discrimination costs families thousands \nof dollars each year. This is hard-earned money that working women \nsimply cannot afford to lose. I am a proud cosponsor of the Paycheck \nFairness Act introduced earlier this year. This legislation strengthens \npenalties for employers who violate the Equal Pay Act and requires the \nDepartment of Labor to provide training to employers to help eliminate \npay disparities.\n  I applaud President Obama's announcement that he will convene a White \nHouse Council on Women and Girls to ensure that the Federal Government \nis coordinated in its response to the challenges facing women and girls \nin our country. As we commemorate Women's History Month, we must \ncontinue to honor the tremendous contributions women have made, and \nrenew our commitment to advancing the rights of women everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3069-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3069-S3070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           REAL STIMULUS ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have cosponsored Senator Vitter's \nlegislation, The REAL, Resources from Energy for America's Liberty, \nStimulus Act of 2009. It is crucial that this Nation realize the need \nto develop our oil and natural gas resources from the Outer Continental \nShelf and ANWR, enact the kind of responsible streamlining of \ngovernment to not hinder that development, and provide important \nregulatory relief.\n  I have consistently highlighted the amounts of U.S. reserves, and I \nthink it is important to continue to point out the amount of reserves \nin the United States. The OCS holds 14 billion barrels\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\nof oil and 55 trillion cubic feet of gas, which is equivalent to 25 \nyears worth of imports from Saudi Arabia. ANWR holds 10 billion barrels \nor 15 years worth of imports from Saudi Arabia. Today we would have 1 \nmillion additional barrels of oil a day coming from ANWR had President \nClinton not vetoed legislation in 1995 to authorize that production. \nProduction from ANWR is entirely responsible. Compared to the size of \nAlaska, ANWR's 19 million acres is about the same size of South \nCarolina, and of that area, we propose opening about 1.5 million acres \nto exploration which is roughly 6 percent of ANWR. Of those 1.5 million \nacres, only 2,000--an area the size of Washington's Dulles \nInternational Airport--would be devoted to drilling. This is only one \nexample of new production which can occur in an environmentally \nexacting manner.\n  The legislation also includes important regulatory reforms which \noutside the energy production components of this bill would be referred \nto the Environment and Public Works Committee for consideration. Some \nof the EPW related provisions include streamlining environmental \nconsiderations in the leasing of the OCS and ANWR and streamlining \nreviews for new nuclear power plant licensing. The bill includes \nlanguage meant to ensure that Federal projects and actions are not \nneedlessly delayed, and therefore made more costly, by required \nenvironmental reviews. Too often the NEPA mandated environmental review \nprocess is used as the means to slow or stop projects, not based on \nsubstantive environmental grounds but, rather, simply because selected \nindividuals oppose the projects. We need to reduce the ability of these \nnot-in-my-backyard interests to continue to manipulate Federal law this \nway. Too many jobs and economic resources are at stake.\n  The bill importantly excludes greenhouse gases from the definition of \npollutant and prohibits the EPA Administrator from granting waivers to \nenforce their own tail pipe emission standards. Granting these States a \nwaiver will only result in a patchwork of State regulations and \ncompliance will vary greatly depending on product demand in each State. \nThe U.S. auto industry, already on life support, faces a $47 billion \nburden this year due to increased national fuel economy standards, \naccording to the National Automobile Dealers Association.\n  Finally, the bill keeps activists from using the Endangered Species \nAct from hindering crucial energy exploration and production. \nActivists' efforts to list species and restrict human activities based \non climate change are backdoor attempts to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions under the Endangered Species Act. Directly linking species \nthreats to climate change under ESA means that any increase in carbon \ndioxide or greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the country could be \nsubject to legal challenges due to arguments that those activities are \nharming any species that is in decline. It allows endless litigation on \nmajor activities that are funded, carried out, or authorized by the \nFederal Government. The economic impacts of regulating greenhouse gases \nunder ESA are enormous. For example, any permit for a powerplant, \nrefinery, or road project in the United States could be subject to \nlitigation if it contributes to total carbon emissions. ESA prompted \nlawsuits and bureaucratic delays could even extend to past fossil fuel-\nlinked Federal projects if they could increase greenhouse gas emissions \nor reduce natural carbon dioxide uptake. The ESA is over 30 years old. \nIts only real success has been to provide full time employment for the \nradical activists and the trial bar. Most importantly, despite billions \nof Federal dollars spent, millions of acres of property rights \nrestricted, and the years of red tape delays, barely 1 percent of \nlisted species have actually recovered. If that is not justification to \nrestructure an outdated, ineffective law, I don't know what is--there \nhas to be a better way.\n  I have long said America is not running out of oil and gas or running \nout of places to look for oil and gas. America is running out of places \nwhere we are allowed to look for oil and gas. The American public has \ngot to demand that the Democrats in Congress allow us to produce from \nour own resources without unnecessary and burdensome Government \nregulation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3070-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3070-S3072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

I believe \n     that what we have proven over the past 40 years is that this \n     is incorrect. The current cost of energy supports my \n     position: $4 gasoline (with $5 in sight), rising food prices \n     (fueled by a nonsensical corn to ethanol policy), plus the \n     cost of the war in Iraq (Alan Greenspan is correct: it is all \n     about oil). Certainly the cost of electricity and other \n     energy sources will follow suit. While the private sector has \n     proven extremely adept at maximizing profits over a 3 month \n     quarterly-reporting time frame, that appears to be the limit \n     of their time horizon. It is sadly ironic that decisions made \n     in 1974 by France regarding nuclear power and by Brazil (a \n     dictatorship at the time!) in 1975 regarding ethanol, were \n     vastly more far-sighted that what our country has chosen by \n     abrogating energy leadership to the private sector.\n       Alternatively I believe that strong interaction lead by the \n     Federal government and involving the private sector can solve \n     the problem. While I understand that sounds socialistic, that \n     is exactly how we were able to harness our power to address \n     the challenge of the second world war and the cold war.\n       I would recommend that you set a goal to have the country \n     be free of imported oil in 15 years. To accomplish this, we \n     will need to find another way to power the transportation \n     sector, and electricity is the only viable alternative. The \n     government should subsidize mass transit and utilization of \n     electric cars and development of next-generation electric \n     cars should be subsidized. Financing for subsidies should \n     come from taxes on the egregious profits realized by oil \n     companies, which we are subsidizing in the form of military \n     defense of the middle east. Clearly the supply of electricity \n     will need to be greatly augmented, and nuclear fission is the \n     best answer for this. While I do not believe that wind or \n     solar have the efficiency to supply the amount of electricity \n     needed, research into improving these technologies should be \n     fostered.\n       In the process of implementing these policies, a highly \n     desirable collateral effect would be to greatly spur American \n     science. Federal support for basic and applied research would \n     stabilize the funding base, and improve the desirability of \n     the scientific disciplines, which are not in favor with young \n     Americans, because the return on mastery of the fields of \n     math, biology, chemistry and physics are not currently \n     commensurate with the investment required to learn them. To \n     fund this, you will have to figure out how to reign in health \n     care, another item which will require forceful government \n     intervention.\n       While I am encouraged by your interest in my opinion, I am \n     dismayed by the timing. At this point, the horse is long out \n     of the barn, and if you have done anything to address the \n     situation, it has been invisible to me. Yet, you still have a \n     good fraction of your term remaining, enough time to start \n     acting in the best interest of the United States and her \n     institutions, and to start de-prioritizing those of \n     [individuals] who are only interested in their bottom lines.\n       Best regards and good luck.\n     Gary.\n                                  ____\n\n       To quickly preface my story, I am a professional that nets \n     a salary of roughly $38,000/year with a small family. We have \n     made the\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\n     decision that raising good kids and having a mother in the \n     home is more important than making more money. With my salary \n     and my wife's very part-time job, in the past we have been \n     able to absorb minor blows such as unexpected medical \n     situations, needed vehicle repairs, and other unforeseen \n     bills. With the way things are now, such as gas and food \n     prices, we have had to strategize and make every dollar \n     count. There is no complaint on my end, although if and when \n     the next unexpected medical bill happens, it will be \n     difficult. Fortunately we have faith that all will be okay \n     and that we will always be able to pay our bills and enjoy \n     life.\n       By no means am I asking for a handout. On the contrary, I \n     wish the elected officials that act as our government would \n     step out of the way and allow the hard-working Americans do \n     what they do best; use their intellect to solve problems. \n     Please allow the free market do what it was designed to do. \n     We firmly believe that God created this beautiful Earth for \n     our ``responsible'' use. What I mean is that we should use \n     the resources that are available to us (which are in \n     wonderful abundance here) while at the same time replenish \n     what we can for our posterity. We never bought into this \n     ``Green'' movement and have since discovered that it was all \n     a hoax with horrible intentions.\n       We will survive whatever comes our way. My family has the \n     ``American Spirit''. I wish that Congress would adopt that \n     same spirit.\n     Dillon, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking those you represent what we think and \n     feel about this crisis. The cost of oil going up has affected \n     so many more things than just filling up our tank. We are \n     faced with the choice of going to the doctors, (we have \n     insurance), or get gas or groceries!! We have been unable to \n     have children on our own, and we decided for me to go back to \n     work to save up money for fertility treatments. But now that \n     the gas, food & utility prices have shot up, we are beginning \n     to wonder if we will be able to get to work let alone ever \n     achieve our dream.\n       I see my siblings trying to raise their children and make \n     ends meet with gas prices the way they are. I hear it in the \n     voices of my co-workers, family, and friends. This is not \n     right! We elected our politicians to be our representatives, \n     not to go to Washington and do what they want. Listen to the \n     majority not the minority. ``For the people by the people.'' \n     We the people are talking. Are you all listening????\n       First: Drill off shore and in Alaska. Second: Keep working \n     on alternatives like hydrogen, coal to oil, nuclear \n     facilities etc. This country is full of the best and \n     brightest. We ought to show that.\n     Annette, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Subject: Final Destination of Alaska Oil is--?\n       American taxpayers paid to have the Alaskan pipeline built \n     to relieve dependence on foreign oil in the 70s. When oil \n     prices started to drop, the oil companies, BP, Exxon, and \n     etc. cried poor-mouth. They were not getting an adequate \n     return on their investment in the North Slope oil fields. \n     [Congress gave approval for the companies] to take American \n     oil to Asia for a better price than they could get on the \n     West Coast of California or other American markets. Then \n     prices in America started rising, but the oil (our oil!) was \n     still being shipped to Asian countries. To my knowledge, this \n     is still where a lot of the Alaska oil is going.\n       Question: Is Congress still letting these greedy ruthless \n     oil companies ship desperately needed American oil to Asia \n     for higher prices? If not, when did it stop and where is it \n     being shipped? If they are still shipping American oil to \n     Asia, why the heck hasn't Congress stopped the process?\n       A response to this situation, and/or a clarification of \n     what is the present status of Alaska oil shipments would be \n     appreciated.\n     Joe, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am against increasing domestic production of oil in \n     sensitive areas such as the Arctic. It has not been made \n     clear to me that it would have any other than a minor affect \n     on prices and supply.\n       I am adjusting to the high gas prices by driving a fuel \n     efficient vehicle and parking the others and using them only \n     when absolutely necessary. I also am careful in my driving \n     habits such as keeping my speed at or below 60 and avoiding \n     undo acceleration. I turn my engine off at stop lights when I \n     expect the wait will be long. I coast down hills when it is \n     safe to do so with the engine off although this can be a \n     dangerous practice.\n       Here's what I feel our government including congress could \n     to help the situation:\n       1. Set a national speed of 55 or 60 as was done in the 70s. \n     I think that many people do not understand that higher speeds \n     require more gas than lower speeds to go the same distance \n     because of air friction. This is not publicized. It should \n     be.\n       2. Stop all speculation in oil trading by whatever means \n     necessary. For me, the frequent (mostly) up and down \n     variations in price at the gas station are more unsettling \n     than the high price.\n       3. Declare new fuel efficiency standards under emergency \n     conditions. Not some silly minor improvement by 2020! As has \n     been done [in the past]. The auto manufacturers demonstrated \n     how rapidly through research and development just how fast \n     they could come up with catalytic converters in the 70s to \n     meet emission standards. Give them credit! They can perform \n     miracles if they are forced to. Force them!\n       4. Keep oil prices high but stable. Painful as it is, it \n     seems to me the only way to effect the needed changes. I have \n     no longer any confidence in energy leadership by either \n     government or industry. Government just does what industry \n     wants and what industry wants is to keep things as they are. \n     Our government needs to take a leadership role. For a long, \n     long time, congress and the administration have failed \n     miserably in that role. It is time for a change.\n       5. Require new cars to have a fuel consumption meter \n     clearly visible to the driver. This would encourage efficient \n     driving. When the driver sees how his miles-per-gallon drops \n     to near zero when accelerating up a hill--well, he might \n     learn to drive more conservatively.\n       It seems to me that this is our second warning regarding \n     the consequences of our dependence on oil, the first being in \n     the early 70s. Perhaps this is our last warning.\n     David, Viola.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am but a young college student. I currently live in \n     Middleton with my family for the summer. I will be headed \n     back to University of Idaho this fall for my sophomore year. \n     The $4 per gallon gas prices are ridiculous. While living \n     here in the summer, I begin to realize how lucky I am to be \n     headed back to Moscow where I can get anywhere in town just \n     by riding a bike or walking. Living in Middleton, I need to \n     drive 15 miles to go to work seeing as there are not very \n     many job opportunities located in my town. Some people have \n     to drive even drive further to get to their jobs. I have seen \n     my parents struggle with the prices. They always consider how \n     much it is going to cost us to drive somewhere if we plan on \n     going on a family trip. It definitely complicates things.\n       I am currently studying Wildlife Resources at my school and \n     have learned much about how environments are affected by \n     polluting toxins that come from coal plants. This should not \n     be an alternative. Also, corn ethanol is not effective, \n     because in order to create enough fuel for everyone in our \n     country, we would need to drastically increase the corn \n     production. Nuclear power, on the other hand, I am unsure \n     about, but what I am sure about is that we are in a decade of \n     change--one that is challenging us. People need to realize \n     that ``global warming'' is not a farce and people should not \n     use excuses such as ``Well, Idaho had a higher average of \n     snowfall this year than in the past 5 years.'' There is a \n     reason it is called ``global warming'' and not ``Idaho \n     warming''. It has to do with average global temperatures and \n     the changing of these temperatures cause climate changes, \n     which could be why we saw so much snow this past winter.\n       Anyways, to get back on track, we need to shift to cleaner \n     ways of generating energy. We have all heard of harnessing \n     wind, water, solar, and geothermal energy. These are all very \n     costly, but run clean. The solutions are not to use more coal \n     or drill for more oil. Those solutions are just prolonging \n     the problem, which is our dependency. If we open up more \n     drilling sites in America then the gas may be lowered a \n     little bit, but American oil is still finite and will \n     eventually deplete which will put us in the same situation we \n     are in now. The $4 per gallon is a wakeup call that we need \n     to change the way we are doing things and progress; not \n     regress. Hopefully you will help to make this progression \n     that we so desperately need.\n     Dylan, Middleton.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for letting me express my frustrations.\n       This is a very simple problem to solve. Start drilling and \n     alleviate the problems we are currently seeing at the gas \n     pumps, food prices, and other high prices that are occurring \n     with the high prices of fuel. If streamlined and the ability \n     of Congress to cut red tape that is currently enacted, we \n     could start pulling oil out of the ground in 18 months and \n     not 5 to 10 years. Pulling oil out of the ground will make \n     the prices fall plain and simple. [Some] will say that more \n     oil will not cause prices to fall due to the oil companies, \n     but basic economics 101 will tell you that more supply equals \n     less prices plain and simple. It is not rocket science, but \n     [some groups have] been more interested in the redistribution \n     of wealth rather than letting the free market take it is \n     course.\n       I hear lies and intentional misstatements of the truth \n     coming from [some politicians]. When [will truthtellers \n     start] educating] the public on how much oil we currently \n     have in North America (more than Saudi Arabia), and letting \n     extreme environmentalist entities that they bow to run the \n     show on our energy policy.\n       I keep hearing from [some] that we cannot drill our way to \n     energy independence. What is their solution then? I have not \n     heard of anything that they are coming up with to alleviate \n     the problem. They do not want nuclear power plants, they do \n     not want to burn coal, and drilling offshore and in ANWR \n     would be horrible for the environment. I have some news for \n     [those folks]: their French buddies have nuclear power plants \n     that are safe and provide clean energy for the people of \n     France. Burning coal or emitting carbon dioxide does not \n     create global warming; it is a natural effect that has \n     occurred over and over again throughout the history of the \n     Earth. Sport fisherman fish off of oil rigs in the sea, \n     and caribou do not care about an oil rig, or pipeline \n     laying on the ground either.\n       It is time [that we had some leadership and challenged the \n     false information] on energy\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\n     policy. If not, the [conservative voices will] have less \n     leadership in Congress, and we will have an energy crisis in \n     the greatest county in the world.\n       P.S. Can we get some more oil refineries as well?\n     Cory.\n                                  ____\n\n       First off, thank you for soliciting comments from your \n     constituents.\n       Everyone is concerned about, and affected by energy prices. \n     Gas prices are just the tip of the iceberg. Food prices, \n     goods and services prices, utility bills, natural gas up \n     double from last year, airline prices, the housing/credit \n     crisis and a very weak dollar are all affected by our energy \n     emergency. This is not a matter of choice. Either we pursue \n     energy independence or we risk losing the America our \n     forefathers created and our brave soldiers have died fighting \n     for.\n       Why are we the only civilized country not aggressively \n     pursuing energy independence? France is over 70% nuclear, the \n     EU has plans for over 20 coal plants across Europe, Canada is \n     drilling near our northeastern border, Russia recently gave \n     major tax breaks to oil companies to explore inside their \n     borders and find alternative energy, Brazil is aggressively \n     drilling, China is building dozens of coal plants, nuclear \n     plants and hydroelectric dams, they have also secured a lease \n     (from Cuba) 50 miles off the shore of Key West, Florida. The \n     US hasn't built a refinery in over 30 years. There is \n     something wrong with this picture. Is everyone else on the \n     wrong energy path? Or could it be we are falling behind? I \n     think the answer is obvious.\n       To me the solution is twofold. Short term and long term. \n     Short term: Allow private industry to aggressively pursue all \n     sources of energy within our borders. We are sitting on \n     billions of barrels of oil, oil shale and coal. Go get it \n     now! We have nuclear technology, coal to oil technology, \n     wind, solar. Long term: Offer incentives to private \n     industries to create new alternative energy sources. American \n     innovators have proved time and time again they are capable \n     of getting the job done. Get the government out of their way \n     and let them lead the world into the next generation of \n     energy production.\n     Dennis.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing concerning your call for Idahoans to tell \n     about how oil prices are affecting us. Fortunately I live \n     very close to work so I do not drive much to commute. I do \n     however have to transport children to day care, school and \n     other activities. Trips are almost out of the question now.\n       Having looked into the facts I fully support drilling in \n     ANWR and OCS. I find it disturbing that we are not already \n     doing so when I hear that other countries, especially some \n     that are not overly friendly to us, are permitting to drill \n     off of our coasts. I think the U.S. should pursue all avenues \n     of collecting domestic fuel sources including coal shale to \n     oil and nuclear. This country should pursue nuclear power in \n     large scale, hydrogen, and other alternatives as well. The \n     fact remains, as you know, that we will need petroleum-based \n     fuels for the foreseeable future and we should produce some \n     of our own.\n       I think the ethanol projects are a joke as corn is a food \n     product that has so many other uses.\n     Brandon, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       The most difficult part of paying so much at the pump is \n     feeling that the whole situation is--at best--the fault of \n     our Washington politicians who have been influenced by \n     environmentalists who seem determined to return our lifestyle \n     to the horse and buggy era.\n       The most vital step in all you propose is to start claiming \n     our drilling rights in the gulf and to pass legislation which \n     allows us to take advantage of our own oil reserves. The \n     environmentalists have hijacked this whole country by tying \n     the hands of oil companies, who would doubtless do everything \n     possible to lessen our dependence on foreign oil by drilling \n     within our own borders.\n     Deborah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3072-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING JOSEPH SONNEMAN\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the life of a \nvery special resident of my home State of Alaska, longtime political \nactivist Joe Sonneman.\n  Dr. Sonneman passed away March 8, 2009, from Lou Gehrig's disease. He \nwas 64.\n  He made his unique mark on Alaska beginning in 1971, when he first \nvisited to research a doctoral dissertation on the relationship between \noil revenues and state government. He returned after graduate school \nand lived in the 49th State for most of the rest of his life. In true \nAlaskan fashion he proved himself to be a jack of many trades. Dr. \nSonneman--known most often around his adopted hometown of Juneau only \nas ``Joe''--was a photographer, postal worker, public policy analyst \nand taxi driver. He also earned a law degree from Georgetown University \nand was a frequent candidate for Congress.\n  On behalf of his family and his many friends I ask today that we \nhonor his memory. I ask that his obituary, published March 10, 2009, in \nthe Juneau Empire, be printed into the Congressional Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n                [From the Juneau Empire, Mar. 10, 2009]\n\n                          (By Joseph Sonneman)\n\n       Longtime Juneau political activist Dr. Joseph Sonneman died \n     early March 8, 2009, at Providence Regional Medical Center in \n     Everett, Wash., after a three-year struggle with ALS, \n     amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's \n     disease. He was 64.\n       He was born in Chicago in 1944, and attended Chicago public \n     schools.\n       After serving in the U.S. Army from 1963 to 1966, including \n     service as a radar repairman in Korea, he earned a Bachelor \n     of Science in economics from the University of Chicago, and \n     master's and doctorate degrees from Claremont graduate \n     school. While in the master's program in government finance, \n     he was an intern at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. \n     He first came to Juneau in 1971 to conduct research for his \n     doctoral dissertation on the effect of oil income on Alaskan \n     government financial decisions.\n       When he finished graduate school, he returned to Alaska \n     where he worked as a photographer, budget analyst, taxi \n     driver, heavy equipment oiler on the Alaska pipeline, postal \n     worker, and university instructor. He became interested in \n     the law and earned a J.D. degree from Georgetown School of \n     Law in 1989. He was a member of the Alaska, Hawaii and \n     Washington, D.C. Bar Associations and conducted a law and \n     legal research practice in Juneau.\n       He was active in politics all his life, and served on \n     numerous local and state Democratic Party committees and as \n     Alaska Democratic Party treasurer. He ran for Mayor of Juneau \n     in 1973. He also ran in the primaries for the U.S. House in \n     1974, and for the U. S. Senate in 1978, 1992, 1996, and in \n     1998 succeeded in becoming the Democratic Party nominee for \n     U.S. Senate but lost the election to Republican incumbent \n     Frank Murkowski.\n       He was a member of Veterans of Foreign War Post 5559; \n     Pioneers of Alaska Juneau Igloo Number 6; Juneau World \n     Affairs Council; Juneau Chapter of AARP; and Paralyzed \n     Veterans of America, and served on the Juneau Commission on \n     the Aging.\n       As a photographer, he followed the example of Klondike Gold \n     Rush photographer A.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide \npenalties for individuals who engage in schemes to defraud aliens and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nImmigration Fraud Prevention Act of 2009, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Kennedy, to prevent the exploitation of people, citizens, and \nnon-citizens alike, who are preyed on when seeking immigration \nassistance.\n  The Immigration Fraud Prevention Act would prevent and punish fraud \nand misrepresentation in the context of immigration proceedings. The \nact would create a new Federal crime to penalize those who engage in \nschemes to defraud aliens in connection with Federal immigration laws.\n  Specifically, the act would make it a Federal crime to wilfully and \nknowingly defraud or obtain or receive money or anything else of value \nfrom any person by false or fraudulent pretences, representations, or \npromises; and to wilfully, knowingly, and falsely represent that an \nindividual is an attorney or accredited representative in any matter \narising under Federal immigration law.\n  Violations of these crimes would result in a fine, imprisonment of \nnot more than 5 years, or both.\n  The bill would also authorize the Attorney General and the Secretary \nof Homeland Security to use task forces currently in existence to \ndetect and investigate individuals who are in violation of the \nimmigration fraud crimes as created by the bill.\n  The act would also work to prevent immigration fraud by requiring \nthat Immigration Judges issue warnings about unauthorized practice of \nimmigration law to immigrants in removal proceedings, similar to the \ncurrent law that requires notification of pro bono legal services to \nthese immigrants; requiring the Attorney General to provide outreach to \nthe immigrant community to help prevent fraud; providing that any \nmaterials used to carry out notification on immigration law fraud is \ndone in the appropriate language for that community; and requiring the \ndistribution of the disciplinary list of individuals not authorized to \nappear before the immigration courts and the Board of Immigration \nAppeals, BIA, currently maintained by the Executive Office of \nImmigration Review, EOIR.\n  Unfortunately, the need for Federal action to prevent and prosecute \nimmigration fraud has escalated in recent years as citizens and non-\ncitizens attempt to navigate the immigration legal system. Thus far, \nonly States have sought to regulate the unauthorized practice of \nimmigration law.\n  Since immigration law is a federal matter, I believe the solution to \nsuch misrepresentation and fraud should be addressed by Congress.\n  By enacting this bill, Congress would help prevent more victims like \nVincent Smith, a Mexican national who has resided in California since \n1975. His wife is an American citizen, and they live with their 6 U.S. \ncitizen children in Palmdale, CA.\n  Mr. Smith would likely have received a green card at least two \ndifferent times during his stay in California. However, in attempting \nto get legal counsel, Mr. Smith hired someone whom he thought was an \nattorney, but was not. As a result, Mr. Smith was charged more than \n$10,000 for processing his immigration paperwork, which was never \nfiled. Mr. Smith now has no legal status and faces removal proceedings.\n  Another victim of immigration fraud is Raul, a Mexican national, who \ncame to the United States in 2000. He also married a U.S. citizen, \nLoraina, making him eligible to apply for a green card. Raul and his \nwife went to Jose for legal help. Jose's business card said he had a \n``law office'' and that he was an ``immigration specialist.'' But Jose \nwas not a specialist and charged Raul $4,000 to file a frivolous asylum \npetition. While Raul thought he was going to receive a green card, he \nwas instead placed into removal proceedings.\n  From California to New York, there are hundreds of stories like \nthese. Many immigrants are preyed on because of their fears--others on \ntheir hope of realizing the American dream. They are charged exorbitant \nfees for the filing of frivolous paperwork that clog our immigration \ncourts and keep families and businesses waiting in limbo for years.\n  Law enforcement officials say that many fraudulent ``immigration \nspecialists'' close their businesses or move on to another part of the \nstate or country before they can be held accountable. They can make \n$100,000 to $200,000 a year and the few who have been caught rarely \nserve more than a few months in jail. Often victims of such crimes are \ndeported, sending them back to their home countries without \naccountability for the perpetrator of the fraud.\n  Most recently, hundreds of immigrants were exploited by Victor M. \nEspinal, who was arrested for allegedly posing as an immigration \nattorney. Nearly 125 of Mr. Espinal's clients attended the New York \nCity Bar Association's free clinic to address their legal and \nimmigration options. According to prosecutors, Mr. Espinal falsely \nclaimed on his business cards that he was licensed and admitted to the \nCalifornia bar as well as the bar in the Dominican Republic.\n  Organizations such as the Los Angeles Country Bar Association, \nNational Immigration Forum, American Immigration Lawyers Association, \nand American Bar Association have been documenting this exploitation \nfor many years. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me and Senator \nKennedy in putting an end to it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 577\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require the exclusion of \ncombat pay from income for purposes of determining eligibility for \nchild nutrition programs and the special supplemental nutrition program \nfor women, infants, and children; to the Committee on Agriculture. \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nMilitary Family Nutrition Protection Act, which we introduced today to \nprotect the eligibility of military families for nutrition assistance \nprograms. This bill will do a great service to the families of our men \nand women serving in uniform in combat zones overseas.\n  When a soldier is deployed to a combat zone such as Iraq or \nAfghanistan, he or she receives a temporary increase in pay called \n``combat pay.'' Too often, combat pay increases the soldier's salary to \na level that makes his family ineligible for essential nutrition \nassistance programs like the School Lunch and School Breakfast \nprograms; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \nInfants, and Children; and other programs. The family can no longer \nreceive government assistance for food, despite the fact that the \nsoldier's increase in pay is only temporary.\n  Our bill will remove this burden from our military families and stop \npunishing them for the sacrifices their loved ones make overseas. The \nbill stipulates that combat zone pay be excluded from consideration \nwhen determining a family's eligibility for all child nutrition \nprograms. That way, when a soldier deploys to a combat zone, his or her \nfamily can continue to receive the nutrition assistance it needs, and \nour soldiers have one less thing to worry about in the combat zone.\n  As Secretary of Agriculture, I proposed a similar combat pay \nexemption for Food Stamp eligibility, a proposal that was included in \nthe final version of the Farm Bill passed by Congress last year. The \nMilitary Family Nutrition Protection Act is the logical next step to \nensuring our military families get the assistance they need while their \nloved ones are away at war.\n  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am proud to \ncosponsor this important piece of legislation. I look forward to \nworking on the upcoming reauthorization of the child nutrition \nprograms, and I will urge my colleagues on the Committee and in the \nSenate to include the Military Family Nutrition Protection Act as part \nof that reauthorization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 582. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to protect consumers \nfrom usury, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as I think all Americans understand, \nthere is a new sense of outrage today at what Wall Street has done \nthrough their greed, their recklessness and, perhaps, illegal behavior, \nin plunging this Nation and, in fact, the world into a deep recession, \nwhich has caused the loss of millions and millions of jobs, had an \nextraordinarily negative impact on so many people's lives in terms of \ntheir savings and their ability to send their kids to college, and in \nterms of the loss of their homes. That is what Wall Street has done.\n  In my view, as I have said time and time before, we must have a deep \ninvestigation to understand what this crisis was, who are the people \nresponsible for all of this damage, and we must hold them accountable. \nIn fact, it will be a test of the criminal justice system of this \ncountry if, in fact, we have the courage to say to these millionaires \nand billionaires: You know what, the law applies to you too, and you \ncannot act illegally and cause so much damage to our country and the \nworld.\n  One of the many senses of anger and frustration that we hear from the \nAmerican people, one of them that I hear about very often from \nVermonters, as well as people all over this country, is that at a time \nwhen we are providing hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out Wall \nStreet, at a time when large banks are borrowing money from the Fed at \na zero interest rate, the response of Wall Street has been to say: \nThank you very much for all of that, and now we are going to charge you \n15, 20, 25, 30 percent interest rates on your credit cards.\n  It seems to me that when the middle class is shrinking, when people \nare losing their savings, when people are losing their jobs, it is an \nabsolute outrage that Wall Street, which is being bailed out by the \ntaxpayers of this country, is now charging exorbitant and usurious \ninterest rates for the American people.\n  What we are seeing now all over this country is millions of people \nwho are suddenly receiving notices from these banks that say, oh, by \nthe way, we are going to double or triple your interest rate. That is \nwrong and that has to end.\n  I am not going to quote from the Bible, but trust me, it goes back to \nthe Bible, where there are very clear references to the immorality of \nusury. In fact, what we have to understand is that what Wall Street and \nthese credit\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\ncard companies today are doing is not anything different than what \ngangsters and loan shark artists do who break people's kneecaps when \nthey don't pay back, only these gangsters have three-piece suits and \nhave millions of dollars. But at the same time they are destroying \npeople's lives by charging 25, 30 percent interest rates.\n  Today, I will be introducing legislation that will require any lender \nin this country to immediately cap all interest rates on consumer loans \nat 15 percent, including credit cards.\n  How do we select 15 percent as the appropriate number to deal with \nthe usury which is going on in this country? The reason we selected \nthat number is because 15 percent is the same interest rate cap \nCongress imposed on credit union loans almost 30 years ago when it \namended the Federal Credit Union Act.\n  Many people do not know this, but, in fact, right now credit unions, \nwith certain exceptions, have to charge interest rates of 15 percent or \nlower. I do not see the credit unions of this country coming to \nCongress for hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts. In fact, they \nare doing quite well. They are responding to the credit needs of their \nsmall businesses in their communities and to individuals. They are \ndoing well. They have survived and have thrived with this regulation.\n  Right now, the National Credit Union Administration imposes a 15-\npercent cap, except under certain circumstances where the interest rate \ncan go as high as 18 percent. The legislation I will be introducing \ntoday also would allow banks to charge higher interest rates if the \nFederal Reserve determines that is a necessity to maintain the safety \nand the soundness of lenders.\n  Essentially all we are saying today is we have to end the outrage by \nwhich Wall Street and large credit card companies are ripping off the \nAmerican people, and the solution we are proposing is to simply emulate \nwhat the Federal Credit Union Act does for the credit unions all over \nthis country.\n  I am very proud Senator Dick Durbin is an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation. I hope many of my colleagues will join him in sponsoring \nthis bill.\n  Interestingly enough, the proposal we are introducing today is very \nsimilar to one former Senator Al D'Amato advocated for in 1991 when he \noffered an amendment to cap credit card interest rates. The D'Amato \namendment would have capped all credit card interest rates at 14 \npercent. I should mention that amendment was adopted by the Senate with \na vote of 74 to 19. If the Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of that \namendment back in 1991, I hope we will have at least or more support \nfor my bill today because the problem today actually is far more \nsevere.\n  This is legislation the American people want. The American people are \nsick and tired of being ripped off by Wall Street, especially when they \nare bailing out these large financial institutions.\n  Credit card use today is no longer just for luxuries. All over this \ncountry, people are buying their groceries with credit cards, and they \nare buying other basic necessities with credit cards because they have \nno other alternative. Young people are paying some of their college \nexpenses with credit cards. Given that reality, given the fact that the \nmiddle class is hurting, it seems to me that if we are going to respond \nto the needs of the American people, we need to deal with the usury \nthat is going on in this country. We need to cap interest rates.\n  I look forward very much to my colleagues supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Alexander, \n        and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 583. A bill to provide grants and loan guarantees for the \ndevelopment and construction of science parks to promote the clustering \nof innovation through high technology activities; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ncolleague, Senator Pryor, the Building a Stronger America Act. This \nbipartisan legislation is a vital step toward recognizing the value of \n``science parks''--which are concentrated high-tech, science, and \nresearch-related businesses--in strengthening America's global \ncompetitiveness. Through the development of new innovative \ntechnologies, competing and complementary companies working within \nclose quarters are able to build upon each other's ideas when entering \nthe national and global marketplace. Unlike well known industrial \nparks, science parks focus primarily on innovation and product \nadvancement. These parks are a vital part of the Nation's economy, \ncreating 2.57 jobs for each core job in a science park.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship and a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, \nI adamantly encourage increased investment in new and existing science, \nresearch, and technology parks throughout the United States as it is \nvital in the creation of new jobs. Our legislation would allow the \nSecretary of Commerce to guarantee up to 80 percent of loans exceeding \n$10 million for the construction of science parks. Additionally, the \nbill would provide grants for the development of feasibility studies \nand plans for the construction or expansion of science parks. This \nbipartisan measure would drive innovation and regional entrepreneurship \nby enabling science parks to renovate or build, while also encouraging \nrural and urban States to undertake studies on developing their own \nsuccessful clusters.\n  On August 9, 2007, the President signed into law, the America \nCompetes Act legislation authorizing $43 billion of new funding over \nthe next three fiscal years that will boost Federal investment in math \nand science education programs. The bill we are introducing today would \nhelp to ensure that this workforce is provided with avenues in which to \noperate, building on the efforts of the America Competes Act by \nincreasing research funding and education for our innovative workforce.\n  In my home State of Maine, we simply do not have the population \ndensity in any given area to support traditional science parks. \nHowever, Maine is a national leader in providing business \n``incubation'' services. Incubators are critical to the success of new \ncompanies. To help startup entrepreneurs in Maine, incubation centers \naround the State provide business support tailored to companies in \ntheir region. The benefit of business incubators in Maine has been \nnothing short of monumental, with 87 percent of all businesses that \ngraduate from incubators remaining in business, surviving, and creating \nnew jobs. The seven technology centers located throughout Maine play a \npivotal role in promoting technology-led economic development by \nadvancing their own regional competitive advantages. Under the Building \na Stronger America Act, both science parks and business incubators will \nbe eligible for its vital assistance.\n  Residency in science parks provides businesses with numerous \nadvantages, including access to a range of management, marketing, and \nfinancial services. At its heart, a science park provides an organized \nlink to local research centers or universities, providing resident \ncompanies with the constant access to the expertise, knowledge, and \ntechnology they need to grow. These innovation centers are specifically \ngeared toward the needs of new and small companies, providing a \ncontrolled environment for the incubation of firms and the achievement \nof high growth.\n  It is also vital to point out that the jobs science parks reflect the \nneeds of a high-tech, innovative, and global marketplace. Science parks \nhave helped lead the technological revolution and have created more \nthan 300,000 high-paying science and technology jobs, along with \nanother 450,000 indirect jobs, for a total of 750,000 jobs in North \nAmerica.\n  Our Nation's capacity to innovate is a key reason why our economy \ncontinues to grow and remains the envy of the world. Through America's \ninvestments in science and technology, we continually change our \ncountry for the better. Ideas by innovative Americans in the private \nand public sector have paid enormous dividends, improving the lives of \nmillions throughout the world. We must continue to encourage all \navenues for advancing this vital sector if America is to compete at the \nforefront of innovation, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 585. A bill to provide additional protections for recipients of \nthe earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Taxpayer Abuse \nPrevention Act. Refund anticipation loans, RALs, are short term loans \nfacilitated by tax preparers and secured by a taxpayer's expected tax \nrefund which typically carry a three or four digit interest rate. These \npredatory RALs prey on low-income taxpayers, diminishing their earned \ntax credits.\n  Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC, benefits are intended to help working \nfamilies meet their food, clothing, housing, transportation, and \neducation needs. According to the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, in \n2007 EITC filers made up 63 percent of all RAL consumers despite being \nonly 17 percent of the taxpayer population. The National Consumer Law \nCenter estimates $567 million was drained out of the EITC program in \n2007 by RAL loan and add-on fees. Working families cannot afford to \nlose a significant portion of their EITC funds by expensive, short-term \nRALs.\n  The high interest rates and fees charged on RALs are not justified \nbecause these loans are outstanding for only a short length of time and \npresent minimal risk to lenders because of the Debt Indicator, DI, \nprogram. The DI program is a service provided by the IRS that informs \nthe lender whether or not an applicant owes Federal or State taxes, \nchild support, student loans, or other government obligations, which \nassists tax preparers in ascertaining the ability of applicants to \nobtain their full refund so that the RAL can be repaid.\n  It is troubling that the Department of the Treasury facilitates the \nuse of RALs. In 1995, use of the DI program was suspended because of \nmassive fraud in e-filed returns with RALs. The use of the DI program \nwas reinstated in 1999. The effect of the DI program on total RAL \nvolume is clear: the number of RALs fell dramatically following the \nsuspension of the program in 1995 and rose again to pre-suspension \nlevels immediately following its reinstatement in 1999. Use of the DI \nprogram should once again be stopped because it is helping tax \npreparers make excessive profits from low- and moderate-income \ntaxpayers who utilize RALs. The Department of the Treasury should not \nbe facilitating the use of RALs that allow tax preparers to reap \noutrageous profits by exploiting working families.\n  The Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act will protect consumers against \npredatory loans, reduce the involvement of the Department of the \nTreasury in facilitating the exploitation of taxpayers by terminating \nthe DI program, and expand access to opportunities for saving and \nlending at mainstream financial services. My bill prohibits refund \nanticipation loans that utilize EITC benefits. Other federal benefits, \nsuch as Social Security, have similar restrictions to ensure that the \nbeneficiaries receive the intended benefit.\n  My bill also limits several of the objectionable practices of RAL \nproviders. It will prohibit lenders from using tax refunds to collect \noutstanding obligations for previous RALs. In addition, mandatory \narbitration clauses for RALs that utilize federal tax refunds would be \nprohibited to ensure that consumers have the ability to take future \nlegal action if necessary.\n  Too many working families are susceptible to predatory lending \nbecause they are left out of the financial mainstream. Between 25 and \n56 million adults are unbanked, or not using mainstream, insured \nfinancial institutions. The unbanked rely on alternative financial \nservice providers to obtain cash from checks, pay bills, send \nremittances, utilize payday loans, and obtain credit. Many of the \nunbanked are low- and moderate-income families that can ill afford to \nhave their earnings unnecessarily diminished by reliance on high-cost \nand often predatory financial services. In addition, the unbanked are \nunable to save in preparation for the loss of a job, a family illness, \na down payment on a first home, or education expenses.\n  To address this problem, my bill also expands access to mainstream \nfinancial services. Electronic Transfer Accounts, ETAs, are low-cost \naccounts at banks and credit unions intended for recipients of certain \nFederal benefit payments, such as Social Security payments. My bill \nexpands the eligibility for ETAs to include EITC benefits. These \naccounts will allow taxpayers to receive direct deposit refunds into an \naccount without the need for a RAL.\n  Furthermore, my bill would mandate that low- and moderate-income \ntaxpayers be provided opportunities to open low-cost accounts at \nfederally insured banks or credit unions via appropriate tax forms. \nProviding taxpayers with the option of opening a bank or credit union \naccount through the use of tax forms provides an alternative to RALs \nand immediate access to financial opportunities found at banks and \ncredit unions.\n  The timeliness of this legislation has never been greater. I urge all \nof my colleagues to support this important bill that offers consumer \nprotection from predatory RALs and expand access to mainstream \nfinancial services.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Bingaman and Senator Durbin, \nfor cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 585\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto implement a National Neurotechnology Initative, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would make a tremendous difference in the lives of the \nmillions of Americans suffering from neurological illnesses, injuries, \nor disorders.\n  An estimated one in three Americans suffers from some kind of \nneurological condition, from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's to multiple \nsclerosis. An increasing number of our troops and veterans suffer from \ndisorders such as Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI, and Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder, PTSD.\n  Yet, despite this, we still have only a limited understanding of how \nthe brain works, or how best to treat, diagnose, and cure neurological \ndiseases and conditions. It is taking a terrible toll on our families \nand communities.\n  I know from experience how devastating these brain injuries and \ndisorders are for victims and their families. My own father developed \nMS when I was young, and when he became too sick to work, my family had \nto rely on food stamps for a time just to get by.\n  Every day, we hear heart-wrenching stories of Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans suffering from TBI and PTSD. Veterans with these disorders are \nmore likely to struggle with joblessness, homelessness, substance \nabuse, and depression. Many are in pain, desperate for help, but unsure \nwhere to find it. And, tragically, an increasing number are taking \ntheir own lives as a result.\n  A recent study by the Institute of Medicine, IOM, found that the \nlong-term health consequences of TBI alone include dementia, \nParkinson's-like symptoms, seizures, and problems related to \nsocialization and unemployment. Clearly, TBI and related disorders will \naffect our servicemembers and veterans far into the future, and we owe \nit to them to develop better treatments and understanding of these \ninjuries and disorders.\n  The Neurotechnology Initiative Act of 2009, which I am introducing \ntoday, would coordinate our efforts to support new developments in \nresearch, speed up our understanding of the human brain, and help lead \nto treatments for all victims of neurological disorders.\n  The legislation would make needed improvements to the research system \nin our country, which now is disjointed, often limiting the ability for \nlife-altering research to reach patients in need. For example, it costs \nnearly $100 million more--and takes 2 years longer than average--to \nbring a drug that treats a neurological disease to the market. The \ncombined economic burden of these illnesses and disorders is estimated \nat $1 trillion annually.\n  The National Neurotechnology Initiative Act would increase funding to \nthe National Institutes of Health, NIH; help remove bottlenecks in the \nsystem to speed up research; coordinate neurological research across \nfederal agencies by creating a blueprint for neuroscience at NIH; and \nstreamline the FDA approval process for life-changing neurological \ndrugs--without sacrificing safety.\n  The act also has economic benefits. It will help create jobs in the \nemerging field of neurotechnology. By developing better treatments, we \ncan reduce health care costs for everyone.\n  This research also has the potential to transform highly specialized \nareas of medicine, computing, and defense. Most importantly, it could \nsave or improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n  I am proud that this bill has support in the House, and I look \nforward to working on it with my colleagues here in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 587. A bill to establish a Western Hemisphere Energy Cooperation \nForum to establish partnerships with interested countries in the \nhemisphere to promote energy security through the accelerated \ndevelopment of sustainable biofuels production and energy alternatives, \nresearch, and infrastructure, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The engagement of the United States Government on \n     energy issues with governments of willing countries in the \n     Western Hemisphere is a strategic priority because such \n     engagement can help to--\n       (A) reduce the potential for conflict over energy \n     resources;\n       (B) maintain and expand reliable energy supplies;\n       (C) expand the use of renewable energy; and\n       (D) reduce the detrimental effects of energy import \n     dependence.\n       (2) Several nations in the Western Hemisphere, including \n     Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela, are \n     important for global energy security and climate change \n     mitigation.\n       (3) Current energy dialogues and agreements should be \n     expanded and refocused, as needed, to meet the challenges \n     described in paragraph (1).\n       (4) Countries in the Western Hemisphere can most \n     effectively meet their common needs for energy security and \n     sustainability through partnership and cooperation. \n     Cooperation between governments on energy issues will enhance \n     bilateral and regional relationships among countries in the \n     Western Hemisphere. The Western Hemisphere is rich in natural \n     resources, including biomass, oil, natural gas, and coal, and \n     there are significant opportunities for the production of \n     renewable energy, including hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, \n     and wind power. Countries in the Western Hemisphere can \n     provide convenient and reliable markets for their own energy \n     needs and for foreign trade in energy goods and services.\n       (5) Development of sustainable energy alternatives in \n     countries in the Western Hemisphere can improve energy \n     security, balance of trade, and environmental quality, and \n     can provide markets for energy technology and agricultural \n     products.\n       (6) Brazil and the United States have led the world in the \n     production of ethanol. Deeper cooperation on biofuels with \n     other countries in the hemisphere would extend economic, \n     security, and political benefits. The Government of the \n     United States has actively worked with the Government of \n     Brazil to develop a strong biofuels partnership and to \n     increase the production and use of biofuels. On March 9, \n     2007, the Memorandum of Understanding Between the United \n     States\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\n     and Brazil to Advance Cooperation on Biofuels was signed in \n     Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n       (7) Private sector partnership and investment in all \n     sources of energy is critical to providing energy security in \n     the Western Hemisphere. Several countries in the Western \n     Hemisphere have endangered their investment climate. Other \n     countries in the Western Hemisphere have been unable to make \n     reforms necessary to create investment climates necessary to \n     increase the domestic production of energy.\n       (8) It is the policy of the United States to promote free \n     trade in energy among countries in the Western Hemisphere, \n     which would--\n       (A) help support a growing energy industry;\n       (B) create jobs that benefit development and alleviate \n     poverty;\n       (C) increase energy security through supply \n     diversification; and\n       (D) strengthen integration among countries in the Western \n     Hemisphere through closer cooperation.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Biofuel.--The term ``biofuel'' means any liquid fuel \n     that is derived from biomass.\n       (2) Biomass.--The term ``biomass'' means any organic matter \n     that is available on a renewable or recurring basis, \n     including agricultural crops, trees, wood, wood wastes and \n     residues, plants (including aquatic plants), grasses, \n     residues, fibers, animal wastes, municipal wastes, and other \n     waste materials.\n       (3) Partner country.--The term ``partner country'' means a \n     country that has agreed to conduct a biofuels feasibility \n     study under section 7.\n       (4) Regional development bank.--The term ``regional \n     development bank'' means the African Development Bank, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, the Andean Development \n     Corporation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, and the Asian Development Bank.\n\n     SEC. 4. WESTERN HEMISPHERE ENERGY COOPERATION FORUM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, shall seek to establish a \n     ministerial forum with countries in the Western Hemisphere to \n     be known as the Western Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum \n     (in this subsection referred to as the ``Energy Forum'').\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Energy Forum shall be \n     to--\n       (1) strengthen relationships between countries of the \n     Western Hemisphere through cooperation on energy issues;\n       (2) enhance cooperation, including information and \n     technology cooperation, between major energy producers and \n     major energy consumers in the Western Hemisphere;\n       (3) explore possibilities for countries in the Western \n     Hemisphere to work together to promote renewable energy \n     production (particularly in biofuels) and to lessen \n     dependence on oil imports without reducing food security;\n       (4) ensure the energy supply is sufficient to facilitate \n     continued economic, social, and environmental progress in the \n     countries of the Western Hemisphere;\n       (5) provide an opportunity for open dialogue and joint \n     commitments among partner countries and with private \n     industry;\n       (6) provide partner countries the flexibility necessary to \n     cooperatively address broad challenges posed to the energy \n     supply of the Western Hemisphere and to find solutions that \n     are politically acceptable and practical in policy terms;

A bill to establish a Global Service Fellowship Program and \nto authorize Volunteers for Prosperity, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nGlobal Service Fellowship Act with Senators Voinovich, Whitehouse, \nCochran and Cardin. This important bill would provide more Americans \nthe opportunity to volunteer overseas and strengthen our commitment to \ninternational volunteerism. This bill also authorizes Volunteers for \nProsperity, VFP, an office created by President Bush under Executive \nOrder 13317. As the new administration seeks to rebuild and restore our \nimage abroad, increasing the number of Americans volunteering abroad is \na critical component of that work. The federal government should \nfacilitate such international volunteering experiences for U.S. \ncitizens by promoting both short and long-term opportunities.\n  My bill would not only provide more opportunities for people-to-\npeople engagement, it would also reduce barriers that the average \ncitizen faces when trying to volunteer internationally. First of all, \nmy bill would reduce financial barriers by awarding fellowships \ndesigned to defray some of the costs associated with volunteering. The \nfellowship can be applied toward many of the costs associated with such \ntravel including airfare, housing, or program costs. By providing \nfinancial assistance, the Global Service Fellowship program opens the \ndoor for more Americans to participate--not just those with the \nresources to pay for it.\n  Secondly, my bill reduces volunteering barriers by offering \nflexibility in the length of the volunteer opportunity. I hear \nfrequently from constituents who are unable to participate in volunteer \nprograms because they cannot leave their jobs or family for years or \nmonths at a time, but are interested in creating cross cultural \nconnections and contributing meaningfully to positive global change. A \nsurvey released by the Pew Global Attitudes Project in December 2008 \nindicates that between 2002 and 2008, opinions of the U.S. declined \nsteeply in 14 out of the 19 countries polled. The Global Service \nFellowship Program offers U.S. citizens an immediate opportunity to \nhelp reverse this negative trend on a schedule that works for them--\nfrom a month up to a year. My bill provides a commonsense approach to \nthe time limitations of the average American while also recognizing the \nimportant role people-to-people engagement can play in countering \nnegative views of our country around the world.\n  Not only does this bill make it easier for all Americans to apply for \nfellowships, it also engages Congress by giving Members of Congress the \nopportunity to notify their constituents who are awarded the \nfellowship--and calls on the recipient to report back to USAID and to \ntheir congressional representatives once they have returned from their \ntime abroad. Through this process, Congress will see firsthand the \nbenefit international volunteering brings to their communities and the \nNation.\n  This program would cost $15 million, which is more than offset by a \nprovision in my bill that would require the IRS to deposit all of its \nfee receipts in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. This program \nwould be a valuable addition to our public diplomacy, development, and \nhumanitarian efforts overseas and I encourage my colleagues to support \nthe bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 590. A bill to assist local communities with closed and active \nmilitary bases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation that \nSenator Pryor and I have introduced, the Defense Communities Assistance \nAct of 2009. As base communities nationwide struggle with a host of \nissues--from\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\nthe tumultuous economy, to closures as a result of the latest Defense \nBase Closure and Realignment, BRAC, round, to an influx in service \npersonnel--the Federal Government must provide assistance to its base \ncommunities to effectively implement the various initiatives of the \nDepartment of Defense and to spur economic growth. This legislation, \nwhich is supported by the Association of Defense Communities, ADC, \nseeks to accomplish that goal by providing immediate benefits to all \nbase communities, for both closed and active military installations \nacross the country.\n  During even the best of economic times, the closure of a military \nbase can devastate a local economy. Today, with our economy in a \ntroubling recession, the outlook is even more grim, with communities \nfacing overwhelming challenges in redeveloping a former military \ninstallation. For instance, the closure of the Naval Air Station \nBrunswick, NASB, in my home State of Maine will create profoundly \nnegative economic consequences with an estimated loss of 6,500 jobs. \nGiven these trying economic times, we must ensure that every effort is \nmade to foster redevelopment in communities affected by base closures.\n  There is no question that the negative effects of base closures are \ndisproportionately and unfairly borne by the communities where bases \nhave closed. At the same time, communities surrounding active bases \nmust cope with realignments, global repositioning, and grow the force \ninitiatives to accommodate service personnel influxes at their own \nexpense. That is why this comprehensive measure includes key provisions \nto assist not only bases facing closure, but active base communities \nabsorbing growth impacts.\n  Accordingly, this legislation would grant permanent authority for the \nmilitary departments to exchange real property deemed excess to the \nDOD, in return for the construction of new facilities, or to limit \nencroachments, at other active installations. This authority provides \nmilitary departments with greater flexibility in real estate asset \nmanagement and has previously only been available to property on an \ninstallation that had been closed or realigned.\n  In recent years, the Army has engaged in pilot programs at \ninstallations to procure municipal services, such as water and \nelectricity, from a city or county government. These municipal service \nagreements have been successful, saving the Army several million \ndollars and providing significant benefits. In the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2008, this authority was extended to \nthe other two military departments and allowed each service to purchase \nmunicipal services for three installations. This legislation builds on \nthat success and greatly extends the military departments' authority to \npurchase, from a county government or other local government, municipal \nservices for military installations across the country.\n  Additionally, this bill would address the Defense State Memorandum of \nAgreement, DSMOA, program which was established to facilitate and fund \nState oversight of contaminated DOD sites, including BRAC sites. DOD \nhas recently interpreted DSMOA in a manner that has severely impaired \nstate budgets, which has in turn reduced State oversight at these \nsites. The Defense Communities Assistance Act would ensure that funding \nunder DSMOA may be used for state BRAC property transfer activities \nwhile also preventing withholding DSMOA funds when States exercise \ntheir enforcement authority.\n  Additionally, section 330 of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 1993 was originally adopted with the intention of \nprotecting parties involved in base redevelopment from liability for \nundiscovered pre-existing pollution conditions at closed military \ninstallations. Regrettably, recent court decisions have been \ninconsistent in interpreting section 330 creating uncertainty that has \nleft base closure property holders with difficulty in obtaining \nenvironmental insurance among other problems. This bill provides vital \nclarification to ensure the original intention of protecting parties \ninvolved in base redevelopment from unnecessary liability at closed \nmilitary installations.\n  Furthermore, the national economic problems that our country \ncurrently faces demand swift and efficient action to avert a deeper and \nmore intractable recession. That is why this legislation would repeal \nsection 3006 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2002, thereby encouraging the Secretary of Defense to provide no-cost \nEconomic Development Conveyances, EDCs, to base communities as a \npreferred property disposal mechanism. This provision would help to \nspur job generation and economic development immediately.\n  As a result of five BRAC rounds, hundreds of military installations \nhave been decommissioned or downsized with the expectation that the \nproperties would be available for local reuse and economic development. \nAt the same time, an inconsistent and time consuming transfer process \nby the military departments has left thousands of acres of former \ninstallation property in Federal ownership, with the fallow acreage \nhampering the host community's economic recovery. There is tremendous \nrisk that in the current economic climate, with property values at \ntheir lowest position in the past decade, these properties will sit \nfallow for years without the use of no-cost EDCs.\n  This measure is stimulative in nature by getting property off the \nbooks of the Federal Government and into the hands of developers to be \nredeveloped quickly so that displaced workers in the community will \nonce again become employed. Encouraging expedited free, or less than \nfair market value, property transfers would result in incentives for \nprivate investment, significant infrastructure and public benefits, and \nthe potential generation of tens of thousands of jobs. That is why it \nis a responsible course of action for the Government to provide these \ncommunities with the tools and resources, such as no-cost EDCs, needed \nto recover from a closure.\n  The timeframe and uncertainty of the BRAC transfer process is the \nsingle greatest obstacle to redevelopment of the underutilized lands. \nExpediting transfer of these former military bases would stimulate both \nprivate and public investment in infrastructure and redevelopment, \nresulting in job creation and economic development activity, the \nrebuilding of inadequate local infrastructure funded by the \nredevelopment project, and local, State, and Federal tax generation. \nMoreover, the Federal Government would be relieved of its property \nmanagement responsibilities, saving hundreds of millions of dollars \nannually.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Pryor and me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 590\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The Defense Communities \n     Assistance Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress, that as the Federal \n     Government implements base closures and realignments, global \n     repositioning, and grow the force initiatives, it is \n     necessary to assist local communities coping with the impact \n     of these programs at both closed and active military \n     installations. To aid communities to either recover quickly \n     from closures or to accommodate growth associated with troop \n     influxes, the Federal Government must provide assistance to \n     communities to effectively implement the various initiatives \n     of the Department of Defense.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a National Commission on High-Level \nRadioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that we are closing the \nbook on our Nation's failed nuclear waste policy. After decades of \nfighting the Yucca Mountain project, I can say with confidence that \nNevada will not serve as the Nation's nuclear waste dump.\n  Nevadans and all Americans will be safer and more secure thanks to \nPresident Obama's commitment to finding scientifically sound and \nresponsible solutions to dealing with nuclear waste.\n  I am proud to say that I have been working on a new volume in this \nterribly difficult debate. Bad policy like the Yucca Mountain project \nis easy to oppose. But it is not always easy to craft better policy.\n  That is what I am doing with Senator Ensign today--working to replace \nour failed approach to dealing with nuclear waste with a much better \npolicy. We are unveiling our plan to form a congressional commission to \nevaluate and make recommendations on alternative approaches to managing \nnuclear waste.\n  This is a step that is way past due.\n  I began opposing the idea of dumping nuclear waste in Nevada when it \nwas first proposed in the early 1980s. I was still a member of the \nHouse then, and I continued this fight in the Senate with most Nevadans \nfirmly behind my efforts to kill the project. I have fought against the \nYucca Mountain project vigorously, but from the very beginning I was \nalso calling for long-range planning on nuclear waste because it was \nthe right thing to do.\n  I continued calling for researching alternatives to Yucca in 1995 \nwhen I introduced legislation with my close friend and colleague, \nSenator Dick Bryan, to establish a commission on nuclear waste. \nUnfortunately, Congress did not listen, even though evidence was piling \nup showing that Yucca Mountain could become a death trap for Nevadans.\n  The Government's decades-long focus on Yucca Mountain has left us \nbarren with very few good proposals for dealing with nuclear waste. Now \nthat President Obama and Secretary Chu have taken Yucca Mountain off \nthe table, we need to begin looking closely at new ideas. We should \neven dust off some older ones that have been ignored for far too long.\n  The legislation we are introducing today forms a temporary commission \nto review and make recommendations on a wide variety of alternatives to \nYucca.\n  The commission will look at everything from at-reactor dry cask \nstorage to reprocessing. The commission will consider having the \nFederal Government take title to nuclear waste, but will also consider \nchartering a Federal corporation to manage nuclear waste.\n  Very importantly, the commission will consider the security of \ntemporary storage facilities for nuclear waste so we can give \nassurances to communities near nuclear power plants that their safety \nwill not be compromised.\n  The cosponsors of this legislation do not all share the same views \nabout nuclear power and we do not share the same views about nuclear \nwaste. For example, I have long said that nuclear waste needs to remain \non site where it is produced until the Government has a safe and \nscientifically sound solution. Others would like to reprocess and\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\nreuse nuclear waste in nuclear reactors. Many still feel that some form \nof permanent disposal is a good solution.\n  But forming a commission is something the bill's sponsors and others \nagree upon because it will create a process that will help our Nation \ntake a critical step away from the failed Yucca Mountain policy.\n  I look forward to continuing working with my colleagues to make sure \nwe take responsible actions necessary to begin addressing nuclear \nwaste.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ban the use of bisphenol A in food containers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to ban \nBisphenol A, BPA, from food and drink containers. I am pleased to be \nworking with Congressman Markey on this issue, and he will be \nintroducing identical legislation in the House. I would also like to \nthank my colleague Senator Schumer, who has agreed to cosponsor this \nlegislation.\n  I believe this is a good and necessary bill. The science shows that \nBPA is added to food and drink containers, and leaches into these foods \nand beverages, especially when heated in a plastic container.\n  Make no mistake, chemicals are everywhere, even in our food. In many \ncases, we know very little about their safety. I strongly believe that \nthe time has come to utilize a precautionary standard in all food and \nbeverages with respect to chemical additives. If you do not know for \ncertain the chemical is benign, it should not be used.\n  Bisphenol A, known commonly as BPA, is one such example. It is used \nin consumer products all around us: plastic containers that store food, \ncompact discs, water bottles, canned soups and other canned foods, even \nbaby bottles.\n  More than 100 studies suggest that BPA exposure at very low doses is \nlinked to a variety of health problems, including prostate and breast \ncancer, obesity, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, brain \ndamage, altered immune system, lowered sperm counts, and early puberty.\n  The National Toxicology Program in the Department of Health and Human \nServices has cited ``some concern'' that Bisphenol A may affect neural \ndevelopment in fetuses, infants, and children at current human \nexposures.\n  The solution is simple. My legislation will ban the use of Bisphenol \nA from food and drink containers. This ban will be effective 180 days \nfollowing enactment of the legislation.\n  The bill will create a waiver process, in case a company demonstrates \nthat it is technologically impossible to replace BPA in that time \nframe. A manufacturer can receive a one year waiver, which is \nrenewable, while they work to remove BPA from their product. They must \nsubmit a plan to remove BPA, and their product must be labeled as \ncontaining BPA.\n  The legislation also directs the Food and Drug Administration to \nroutinely review the ``List of Substances Generally Regarded as Safe.'' \nIf new evidence emerges that suggests a chemical is not safe for use in \na particular manner, it will be removed from the product.\n  Scientists have raised alarms regarding BPA for some time. It is an \nendocrine disruptor, mimicking estrogen when it is exposed to a cell.\n  Scientists at Stanford University accidentally discovered BPA's \nestrogen-mimicking effects in 1993. A mysterious estrogen-like chemical \nskewed results of their lab work, and they finally realized that BPA \nwas leaching from laboratory flasks.\n  We know that BPA is found in almost everyone. Data from the National \nHealth and Nutrition Survey, NHANES, conducted by the Centers for \nDisease Control found BPA in the bodies of 92.6 percent of the people \nsurveyed. The study did not examine the exposure of children under 6. \nBut it did find that levels were highest in young children, a troubling \nfinding given that exposure to BPA is potentially most dangerous during \nthese critical early years of development.\n  We know a major source of this exposure: the cans that contain our \nfood,\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\nthe containers we eat from, even the baby bottles used to serve \nformula.\n  The Environmental Working Group commissioned an independent lab to \nstudy BPA in cans in 2007. They tested 97 cans of some of the most \npopular consumer products. Their findings will alarm any consumer: 53 \nof the 97 cans tested had detectable levels of BPA; 20 of the 53 cans \nwith BPA have high enough levels that consuming that canned product \nwould expose a person to levels near those that have been found to \nimpact laboratory rats; 1 in 10 cans contained enough BPA to expose a \npregnant woman or child to more than 200 times the Government's safe \nlevel. The same is true for 1 out of every 3 cans of infant formula.\n  For women who regularly eat canned food, their exposure level \nthroughout a pregnancy may exceed safe doses.\n  These are not exotic products, but the canned goods that are in \npantries across this county: meal replacement shakes, canned soups, \nvegetables, and canned pastas, like ravioli.\n  Baby bottles are also a common exposure source. Multiple studies have \nconfirmed that many of the most popular brands of baby bottles leach \nBPA. A coalition of health and environmental groups, in their recent \nreport ``Baby's Toxic Bottle'', identified several popular brands of \nbaby bottles that leach BPA when heated: Avent; Disney, Dr. Brown's, \nEvenflo; Gerber; Playtex.\n  Now every parent knows that milk served to babies is often heated, at \nleast to room temperature. And these bottles, when heated, leached \nbetween 5 and 8 parts per billion of BPA, a level that is within the \nrange that has been shown to cause harm in animal studies.\n  We know that BPA is a hormone disrupting chemical, and may act like \nestrogen when in the human body. While the science is still emerging, \nresearch is connecting Bisphenol A with a variety of serious health \neffects. These include: early onset of puberty; hyperactivity; lowered \nsperm count; miscarriage.\n  The chemical industry will try to reassure consumers that BPA is \nsafe, and that studies have found these health effects only in \nlaboratory animals exposed to BPA in high doses.\n  But new evidence that goes beyond laboratory rat models is emerging. \nLast year, researchers at the Yale School of Medicine linked BPA to \nproblems in brain function and mood disorders in monkeys, for the first \ntime connecting the chemical to health problems in primates.\n  The Yale scientists exposed monkeys to low levels of BPA, which the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, have deemed safe for humans.\n  Researchers found that this chemical exposure interfered with brain \ncell connections vital to memory, learning and mood.\n  The researchers stated that the findings suggest that exposure to \nlow-dose BPA may cause widespread effects on brain structure and \nfunction.\n  In September of last year, the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, JAMA, published a study that links BPA levels in people to \nseveral serious health problems.\n  The study examined the BPA concentrations found in 1455 adults who \nparticipated in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination \nSurvey, NHANES, a study which detected BPA in more than 90 percent of \nAmericans tested. Using this data, researchers linked higher BPA \nconcentrations to adverse health affects, including: cardiovascular \ndisease; type II diabetes; clinically abnormal concentrations of some \nliver enzymes.\n  The Los Angeles Times reported on the study on September 17th, \nstating ``that the quarter of the group with the highest BPA levels--\nlevels still considered safe by the FDA--were more than twice as likely \nto suffer from diabetes and cardiovascular disease as the quarter with \nthe lowest levels.''\n  This is the first large scale study to be done examining human \nexposure, and I believe it must be taken very seriously.\n  Industry continues to insist that BPA is not harmful. But one study \nshows us why we should be skeptical about research coming from chemical \ncompanies.\n  In 2006, the journal Environmental Research published an article \ncomparing the results of government funded studies into low dose \nexposure to BPA with studies funded by the BPA industry.\n  The results are astounding; 92 percent of the Government funded \nstudies found that exposure to BPA caused health problems in animals.\n  However, none of the industry funded research identified any health \nproblems in animals exposed to low levels of BPA.\n  This raises serious questions about the validity of the chemical \nindustry's studies. It also illustrates why our Nation's regulatory \nagencies should not and cannot solely rely on chemical companies to \nconduct research into their products.\n  The Food and Drug Administration agrees that the science is \nincomplete. The FDA's Science Board released a report in October 2008 \nthat raised serious questions about the previous FDA assessments that \nfound BPA to be safe.\n  In response, the FDA has asked for more studies and more research. \nMore research is fine, but I feel strongly that we must not leave a \ndangerous chemical on the market while scientists learn exactly how \ndangerous it is.\n  Sufficient evidence exists for us to act now. I believe strongly in \ntaking a precautionary approach to our chemical policy; people should \nbe protected from chemicals until we know that they are safe for use.\n  There is a great deal wrong with the regulatory system in this \ncountry and the way we address dangerous chemicals. Our system is \nessentially backwards. Chemicals are added to products before we know \nmuch about them. To be removed from the market, a chemical must be \nproven to be exceedingly dangerous.\n  That means that while we wait for evidence of harm to develop, our \nchildren are using dangerous products, and possibly eating contaminated \nfood.\n  I believe it should be the reverse. We should follow the lead of the \nEuropean Union, and Canada, and remove chemicals until we know them to \nbe safe. We should not be waiting for proof of danger, which too often \ncomes in the form of birth defects, cancer, and other irreversible \nhealth harms.\n  While we continue to work to change our regulatory system, the time \nhas come to apply this precautionary principle to BPA. Without \nquestion, there is more scientific work to be done. But we must not \ncontinue to expose our citizens to these risks while we wait to confirm \nBPA's dangers beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  The Canadian government has already taken this approach with BPA, \nmoving to eliminate polycarbonate baby bottles that contain Bisphenol A \nlast year. Canadian officials stated that because safe alternatives are \nreadily available, this ban is a prudent way to reduce risk for \nvulnerable infants.\n  Many large retailers and producers, including Toys ``R'' Us, Nalgene, \nand Wal-Mart have agreed to no longer sell or produce baby bottles or \nplastic water bottles containing BPA. And just last week, the leading \nmanufacturers of baby bottles announced they would no longer sell baby \nbottles made with BPA.\n  This is great news. I commend them, but we should not be forced to \nrely on retailers to product American consumers from health hazards.\n  The Congress agreed with this precautionary approach and banned six \nplasticizing chemicals, called phthalates, in legislation last year. \nLike BPA, phthalates have been linked to a variety of health problems \nin young children. Instead of doing nothing with the evidence mounts, \nCongress chose to step in and protect children from this risk.\n  The time has come to do the same with Bisphenol A.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 593\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require a report on invasive agricultural pests and \ndiseases and sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to trade before \ninitiating negotiations to enter into a free trade agreement, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Agriculture \nSmart Trade Act along with my colleague Senator Stabenow. The goal of \nthis legislation is to ensure that, as we consider the various free \ntrade agreements that come before the Senate, we are also looking at \nthe big picture, including the increased risk of accidentally importing \ninvasive pests or diseases and the ability for American agricultural \nproducers to access new export markets once trade agreements are in \neffect. Our bill is supported by United Fresh, the national association \nof fruit and vegetable growers and processors, and the U.S. Apple \nAssociation.\n  The bill does two things. First, it requires the administration to \nsend a report to Congress prior to the start of formal trade \nnegotiations with a foreign nation detailing potential invasive pests \nand disease that could pose a risk to U.S. agriculture. Furthermore, \nthis report must identify what additional agricultural inspectors and \nother personnel are needed to prevent these pests and diseases from \nbeing brought into the United States.\n  Second, the bill requires the administration to disclose in the same \nreport all sanitary and photosanitary, also known as SPS, trade \nbarriers that could unduly restrict export markets for American \ncommodities. What we have seen in the past is that a trading partner \nwill raise SPS barriers to prevent American products from entering \ntheir country. Some of these SPS barriers are not grounded in science \nare simply non-tariff trade barriers. As the Administration begins \nnegotiations for a trade agreement, we all need to take a look at what \nkinds of SPS issues we have with potential trading partners. Are their \nSPS concerns based in science? We need to be sure that once an \nagreement is in effect, we will have access to those foreign markets as \nstipulated in the trade agreement.\n  I want to be very clear that this bill does not in any way limit the \nPresident's authority to negotiate trade agreements under Fast-Track, \nnor does it prevent trade legislation from being considered by the \nCongress. What this bill does is provide the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives with a more complete picture of what potential trade \nagreements involve beyond the obvious import and export quotas.\n  Regardless of how any senator feels about the free trade agreements \nthat we review and debate, I think all of my colleagues will agree with \nme that increased international trade means an increased risk of \nimporting bugs and diseases that have the potential to devastate our \nfood sources, jeopardize the\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\nlivelihoods of our farmers, and cost our states a fortune. We need to \nacknowledge the risk and put in place the best safeguards we can to \nprevent the accidental introduction of these harmful pests.\n  I am not merely speculating about the risk of invasive pests and \ndisease. It is a fact that all of our states are battling insects and \ncrop diseases and dreading the next outbreak.\n  Most recently in Pennsylvania we discovered that the western part of \nour state is infested with the Emerald Ash Borer, an invasive beetle \nthat was accidently imported to the U.S. through Detroit via wooden \nshipping pallets from China. This beetle is costing our commercial \nnursery growers millions of dollars in lost stock. Senator Stabenow \nknows better than anyone how much money, time and other resources the \nAsh Borer has cost the states of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and \nPennsylvania. But that's just one example. Orange growers in Florida \nhave spent the past decade fighting to contain and eradicate citrus \ncanker, an invasive disease that causes citrus trees to produce less \nand less fruit until they prematurely die. And California and Texas \nhave dealt with expensive eradication programs to deal with the \nMediterranean fruit fly or ``Med fly.''\n  The list goes on and on. There is not a single state that has not \nbeen impacted by invasive pests or diseases.

Res. 74\n\n       Whereas the United States and Brazil enjoy a longstanding \n     economic partnership sustained by robust trade, investment, \n     and energy cooperation;\n       Whereas investment in and by Brazil promotes economic \n     growth, generates greater wealth and employment, strengthens \n     the manufacturing and services sectors, and enhances \n     research, technology, and productivity;\n       Whereas the United States is the largest direct investor \n     abroad, with total world-wide investments of \n     $2,800,000,000,000 in 2007;\n       Whereas the United States has historically been the largest \n     direct investor in Brazil, investing a total of \n     $41,600,000,000 in 2007;\n       Whereas the sound economic policy of the Government of \n     Brazil was given an investment-grade rating by 2 of the 3 \n     major investment rating agencies in 2008;\n       Whereas the United States is the largest recipient of \n     direct investment in the world, with total foreign direct \n     investments of $2,100,000,000,000 in 2007;\n       Whereas the United States receives direct investment from \n     Brazil, including a total of $1,400,000,000 in 2007;\n       Whereas Brazil is the only country with a gross national \n     product of more than $1,000,000,000,000 with which the United \n     States does not have a bilateral tax treaty;\n       Whereas Brazil is the 4th largest investor in United States \n     Treasury securities, which are important to the health of the \n     United States economy;\n       Whereas Brazil ranked 3rd among other countries in the \n     number of corporations listed on the New York Stock Exchange \n     in 2008, with 31 corporations listed;\n       Whereas a bilateral tax treaty between the United States \n     and Brazil would enhance the partnerships between investors \n     in the United States and Brazil and benefit small and medium-\n     sized enterprises in both the United States and Brazil;\n       Whereas a bilateral tax treaty between Brazil and the \n     United States would promote a greater flow of investment \n     between Brazil and the United States by creating the \n     certainty that comes with a commitment to reduce taxation and \n     eliminate double taxation;\n       Whereas the Brazil-U.S. Business Council and the U.S.-\n     Brazil CEO Forum have worked to advance a bilateral tax \n     treaty between the United States and Brazil;\n       Whereas the Senate intends to closely monitor the progress \n     on treaty negotiations and hold a periodic dialogue with \n     officers of the Department of the Treasury; and\n       Whereas the United States and Brazil will greatly benefit \n     from deeper political and economic ties: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government and the Government of \n     Brazil should continue to develop their partnership; and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Treasury should pursue \n     negotiations with officials of the Government of Brazil for a \n     bilateral tax treaty that--\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\n       (A) is consistent with the existing tax treaty practices of \n     the United States Government; and\n       (B) reflects modern, internationally recognized tax policy \n     principles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/12/senate-section/article/S3090-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 75--COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n         FOUNDING OF THE PHILADELPHIA ZOO: AMERICA'S FIRST ZOO\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to what \nI refer to as the irresponsible and reckless fiscal path we find \nourselves on as a nation and to urge my colleagues to act now to take \nthe first step toward meaningful, comprehensive tax and entitlement \nreform.\n  On Tuesday night, we gathered here to cast our votes on the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act of 2009. I could not vote for this bill because it \nignores the fiscal realities we find ourselves in today. This omnibus \nbill, which includes $408 billion in nonemergency spending, is 8 \npercent larger than it should be. Some agencies in the bill are set to \nget a 40-percent increase in funding. From my experience as a former \nGovernor of Ohio and the mayor of the city of Cleveland, I do not \nbelieve those agencies have the capacity to spend that kind of money. \nThis adds to the $787 billion stimulus bill that was passed last month. \nIt increases the already staggering $10.9 trillion national debt and \ncontinues to expand the size of the Government at what has become an \nalarming rate.\n  As you can see from this chart, Federal spending as a percentage of \nGDP averaged just under 20 percent under President Bush. This year, \nunder President Obama, it will reach almost 28 percent, and his \nadministration projects that it will average out to over 23 percent \nacross two terms. In other words, I came to the Senate in 1999, and \nthis is what we were spending, totally, on Medicare, Medicaid, all the \nother appropriations. Then, as you see, it started to go up. We have to \nbe honest, that is where we started to borrow money because we were not \ntaking in enough money to pay for it, so we started to have deficits. \nThen, under Bush, it started to go up some more.\n  Here we are in 2009. You can see that the size of the Government is \nup to 27.7 percent. That is what we are spending on everything. We have \ngone from 8 percent to 27.7 percent. That is going to start to slide \ndown. In 2012, the President says to us, don't worry, we are going to \nreduce the deficit spending by 50 percent. Look at this, it continues \nto spend out at this point, and by 2016--I have not shown it on the \nchart, but it just keeps going. We just cannot keep going that way. \nThat is over half a trillion dollars a year we are borrowing to run the \nGovernment.\n  To complete what I call the triple whammy to our national debt, the \nadministration adds to the stimulus and omnibus a new 10-year budget \nwhere the lowest deficit for a single year is larger than any annual \ndeficit from the end of World War II.\n  In fact, President Obama's smallest deficit is larger than President \nBush's largest deficit. And that is true despite proposing the largest \ntax increase in American history, including a new energy tax that will \nexpose the false claim that we will not raise taxes on the middle \nclass. This $646 billion tax increases will affect rich, poor and \nmiddle class alike. Yet future generations will still be burdened with \nhigher debt. So we have gone from--and I am not proud of some \nRepublican years, what we did. As I used to say, the Democrats tax and \nspend; the Republicans spent and borrowed. Now we have gone to spend, \nborrow, and tax.\n  In spite of all of that, we are going to have these gigantic deficits \nas far as we can see in this country. Simply put, our spending is out \nof control. We are spending and funding more money at a time when we \nshould be finding ways to work harder and smarter and do more with \nless. I know a little bit about this, because I took over Cleveland, \nthe first city to go into default in the depression of 1979. We were in \ndeep trouble. I took over the State of Ohio. We were $1.5 billion in \ndebt at that time. We had to cut the budget four times, and ultimately \nhad to increase taxes in the margin. I know what this is about.\n  But nobody is talking about ``working harder and smarter'' or ``doing \nmore with less.'' If you look at the stimulus, we spent $787 billion, \nand now some congressional leaders are talking about putting together a \nsecond package. I cannot believe it. We cannot continue down this path.\n  It is our responsibility to make budgeting decisions based on our \nNation's fiscal situation and to take into consideration the impact it \nis having on others but, more importantly, on our children and \ngrandchildren. Over the past year, we have been hit by an economic \navalanche that started in housing, quickly spread to the financial and \ncredit markets, then continued onward to every corner of the economy \nand across the world.\n  We have taken steps over the past months to dig out of the avalanche. \nBut we have not reinforced our tax and entitlement system's crumbling \nfoundation. In other words,--I have been\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\ntalking about this for 8 years--we need to have tax reform and \nentitlement reform. Now all of this other stuff has hit us, but the \nfact of the matter is, that is still there. We need tax reform. We need \nentitlement reform. And that is why, despite the enormity of the \nlegislation passed over the past month, there is still a sense of great \nanxiety on Main Street and my street. I still live in the house that \nJanet and I bought in 1972. I am with real people every day. They are \nvery concerned about the future. They get it.\n  The stimulus and omnibus has caused everyone who paid attention to \nsay: My God, we have to do something to get back on firm fiscal \nfooting. They know that unless we fix our tax and entitlement system we \nmight as well be flying a kamikaze plane.\n  When I arrived in the Senate in 1999, gross Federal debt stood at \n$5.6 trillion or 16 percent of GDP. The Obama administration recently \nprojected the national debt to more than double, to $12.7 trillion by \nthe end of fiscal year 2009. That would amount to a 126-percent \nincrease compared with only a 56-percent increases in the gross \ndomestic product during the same 10-year period.\n  From 2008 to 2009 alone, the Federal debt would increase 27 percent, \nboosting the country's debt-to-income ratio or national debt as a \npercentage of our gross domestic product from 74 percent last year to \n89 percent this year.\n  The Pacman. Here it was in 1999. Federal debt. And it is up to 70. We \nare now up to 89 percent. I think there are still some people who \nunderstand Pacman. When I was Governor of Ohio, I used to say that \nMedicaid--I am sure the Presiding Officer understands that Medicaid is \nthe Pacman that kept eating up the budgets in your State.\n  Under the Obama budget, though, at 2017, for the first time since \n1947 when we were paying down our World War II debt, the national debt \nwill be larger than the size of the entire American economy.\n  At that point, we will be too fat and out of shape to escape from our \ncreditors around the world. That is what it is going to look like. In \n2017, it is more than 100 percent of our gross domestic product. Think \nof that. Today, if we are candid with the American people, when you \nconsider the TARP, the stimulus package, and the money we continuously \nborrow from the Social Security trust fund, we are facing a projected \nbudget deficit of $1.9 trillion, which is more than four times the \nreported 2008 deficit of $455 billion as a share of the economy.\n  The 2009 deficit will become the largest recorded deficit since World \nWar II. Last June when I spoke here on the floor of this fiscal crisis, \nI pointed out that our national debt was $9.4 trillion, and the per \ncapita debt, each American's share of the national debt was $31,000, up \nfrom $20,000 in 1999.\n  This year, that figure will reach $41,000. Let's put that into \nperspective. In 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the \nmedian income for an Ohio family in 2007 for one earner was $40,000. \nThat means each person's share of the national debt is more than many \nhard-working Ohioans make in an entire year.\n  Alarmingly, these figures did not even count our accumulated long-\nterm financial obligations: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, which \ngrew $2.5 trillion last year as a result of the increases in the costs \nof Medicare and Social Security benefits.\n  The baby boomers are here. They are coming on. If we include those \nnumbers, taxpayers are on the hook for a record $57 trillion in Federal \nliabilities to cover the lifetime benefits of everyone eligible for \nMedicare, Social Security, and other Government programs. That is \nnearly $500,000 per household.\n  Now, it does not take an economist to realize that of course we \ncannot keep going. As our former Comptroller General and head of the \nGovernment Accountability Office said, we are facing a fiscal timebomb. \nWe must come to terms with the fact that the U.S. Government is the \nworst credit card abuser in the world, and it is time that we came to \nterms with the fiscal realities of 2009.\n  We cannot continue to heap debt on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren without a second thought. Lip service from Congress and \nthe administration is not going to get the job done. Recently, the \nOffice of Management and Budget Director, Peter Orszag, spoke to a \ngroup of bipartisan Senators who have breakfast regularly to talk about \nsome of the problems.\n  He pointed out that as we are confronted with the economic tsunami \nhitting our country, we are lucky our interest rates are very low, \nbecause many investors in America and around the world are parking \ntheir money in Treasury bills.\n  Mr. Orszag continued on to say, we cannot expect that rate of \nborrowing to last, and it is imperative we take advantage of this \nphenomena now before foreign markets and our people demand more \ninterest for their investment in the U.S. debt.\n  I could not agree more. We cannot rely on luck and foreign investors. \nWhen I met with Larry Summers, Martin Feldstein, and Larry Lindsay, \nthey say our current fiscal path is only sustainable--listen to this--\nas long as the Japanese, the Chinese, and the OPEC and others have \nconfidence that we are going to pay back our debt. And, boy, are they \nwatching whether we are going to do anything about tax reform and \nentitlement reform.\n  Now, this has serious implications. Foreign creditors have provided \nmore than 70 percent of the funds that the United States has borrowed \nsince 2001--70 percent.\n  Today 50 percent, 51 percent of the privately owned national debt is \nheld by foreigners. That is up from 37 percent just 6 years ago. If \nthese foreign investors lose confidence and pull out of U.S. Treasurys, \nKatey bar the door. Borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from \nChina and OPEC nations not only puts our economy but our national \nsecurity at risk. We have to make sure other countries do not control \nour debt.\n  One of the things I pointed out--and the Presiding Officer \nunderstands this--is that we have to become more oil independent. We \nhave a situation today where somebody else controls the supply, the \ncost, and they are buying our debt. If I control the supply and the \ncost and then I am paying for your debt, I put you out of business. \nThat is just a fact of life. We have to wake up to the fact that we \ncannot rely on these other countries to take care of this debt. We \ncannot continue to live in the United States of denial.\n  In 2006, I sent a letter to President Bush urging him to take on \ncomprehensive tax and entitlement reform. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 4, 2006.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: I am respectfully writing to encourage \n     you to take the lead on pursuing fundamental tax reform as we \n     begin the 110th Congress in January. You have an historic \n     opportunity, through fundamental tax reform, to transform the \n     U.S. economy in a manner that will make our nation stronger \n     and more prosperous for generations. In so doing, you will \n     cement your domestic policy legacy, I urge you to carry the \n     banner of tax reform.\n       In 1984, President Ronald Reagan declared to the American \n     people that the tax code was fundamentally unfair, and that \n     he was going to reform it. President Reagan held his belief \n     in the unjustness of the tax code deep in his heart. He knew \n     that hundreds of targeted tax subsidies for the benefit of \n     powerful interests forced average Americans to pay higher \n     marginal rates and reduced economic growth. He saw tax reform \n     not as a retreat from his 1981 tax relief agenda, but rather \n     as a logical continuation and enhancement of that agenda. The \n     Tax Reform Act of 1986 was the culmination of the quest he \n     began in 1981. to create a tax code with low marginal rates \n     that raised the necessary revenue to fund the government with \n     the least possible interference in our free market economy.\n       Likewise, fundamental tax reform that makes the tax code \n     simple, fair, and pro-growth could serve as the third and \n     final phase of the project you began in 2001 and continued in \n     2003. You do not have to choose between making the 2001 and \n     2003 tax relief permanent and reforming the tax code. The \n     latter idea is a complement to, not a competitor with, the \n     former idea. We live in a 21st century global economy, but we \n     suffer from a tax code designed for the 20th century. Small \n     businesses--the engines of job creation--are overwhelmed by \n     complexity. In many cases, neighborhood businesses are forced \n     to comply with the same convoluted rules as multinational \n     corporations. Our international tax rules were designed in an \n     era when the United States accounted for 50 percent of global \n     economic output, and we had no worries about other countries \n     competing with us for jobs and capital. Now we\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\n     live in the most competitive global economy we have known. We \n     have redesigned social programs as targeted tax breaks with \n     complex eligibility criteria and restrictions, completely \n     baffling ordinary families who cannot obtain the benefits of \n     these provisions because they are too complicated to \n     understand.\n       Mr. President, you and I have been advocates for tax reform \n     for years. In 2003, I attached an amendment to the Jobs and \n     Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act that would have created \n     a blue ribbon commission to study fundamental tax reform. The \n     amendment was adopted by voice vote, but later was removed in \n     conference committee. At the 2004 Republican National \n     Convention, you announced that fundamental tax reform would \n     become a top domestic priority. I remember sitting in the \n     front of the audience with the Ohio delegation when you made \n     the announcement, and I leapt to my feet to applaud you. A \n     couple of days later while campaigning in Ohio, you told the \n     audience that when I rose to applaud you, you thought I was \n     going to jump up on stage and hug you.\n       It seemed that the tax reform bandwagon finally had started \n     to roll. In the autumn of 2004, I offered my tax reform \n     commission amendment again, this time to the American Jobs \n     Creation Act. The Senate again adopted my amendment. During \n     conference negotiations, the White House contacted me and \n     requested that I withdraw my amendment because you were \n     preparing to take a leadership role by appointing your own \n     tax reform panel. I enthusiastically agreed to defer to your \n     leadership, and I withdrew my amendment. In January 2005, you \n     announced the creation of an all-star panel, led by former \n     Senators Connie Mack and John Breaux, and that panel spent \n     most of the year engaging the American public to develop \n     proposals to make our tax code simpler, fairer, and more \n     conducive to economic growth. In November 2005, the panel \n     issued its final report. While not perfect in anyone's mind, \n     the panel's two plans provided a starting point for \n     developing tax reform legislation that would represent a huge \n     improvement over the current system. The panel's proposals \n     belong as a key part of the national discussion on \n     fundamental tax reform,\n       Yet, momentum for tax reform seems to have slowed in the \n     more than one year since the panel submitted its report to \n     the Treasury Department. Initially, you indicated that upon \n     receipt of the panel's report, the Treasury Department would \n     analyze the proposals and then provide you with its own \n     recommendations. These recommendations would serve as the \n     basis for legislative action. In the meantime, however, your \n     administration and the Congress have faced other immediate \n     priorities--from Social Security solvency to the global war \n     on terror to relief for victims of Hurricane Katrina. As a \n     result, we missed an opportunity to address fundamental tax \n     reform during the 109th Congress. And now, time is running \n     short. Your 2007 State of the Union address provides an \n     excellent opportunity to take up a cause that will lead you \n     to being remembered as the president who made the tax code \n     simple, fair, and pro-growth.\n       I have discussed fundamental tax reform with OMB Director \n     Rob Portman, Secretary Hank Paulson, and Chief of Staff Josh \n     Bolten. Mr. President you have a great team that, working \n     with you and Congress, can get the job done. I also sense \n     responsiveness in Congress for tax reform. Congressman Frank \n     Wolf and I have introduced the SAFE Commission Act, which \n     would require consideration of tax reform and entitlement \n     reform, in the House and Senate. Senator Bob Bennett has been \n     putting together a Senate working group on tax reform (in \n     which I am actively participating), and other senators have \n     expressed interest in working with us. For example, Senator \n     Ron Wyden, who has introduced his own tax reform legislation, \n     has shown tremendous enthusiasm for organizing a bipartisan \n     Senate effort on tax reform.\n       The American people are ready for tax reform. Unlike Social \n     Security, no one defends the current tax code. Without your \n     leadership, however, the incoming congressional majority \n     likely will propose their own version of ``reform''--but you \n     and I both know it will not be true reform. They will provide \n     new middle class tax breaks and pay for then by raising \n     marginal tax rates on high-income taxpayers and businesses. \n     They will challenge congressional Republicans to vote against \n     these class warfare proposals and they will challenge you to \n     veto them. Raising marginal tax rates on an already-broken \n     tax system will only serve to reduce U.S. competitiveness in \n     the global economy, and ultimately will prove self-defeating. \n     Instead, Republicans and Democrats must work together to \n     reform the tax code in a manner that will raise sufficient \n     revenues to fund important national priorities, while \n     providing an environment conducive to innovation, \n     entrepreneurship, and economic growth.\n       The time to act is now. Twenty years after Ronald Reagan \n     reformed the tax code, he still is remembered fondly as the \n     leader who set the stage for years of prosperity at the end \n     of the 20th century. Working on a bipartisan basis, you have \n     an opportunity to accomplish a similar achievement for the \n     21st century--a lasting legacy for your fellow Americans. I \n     urge you not to pass up this once-in-a-lifetime chance, and \n     if you take up the challenge, I will be your faithful ally.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George V. Voinovich,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Sadly, no action was taken. We missed a gigantic \nopportunity to make meaningful reform while times were relatively good. \nWe are more or less lucking out now, but we cannot count on that luck \nto last forever. We have to tackle tax and entitlement reform to \nmaintain credibility, to turn around our economy, and to regain our \nglobal respectability--not a year from now, not 2 years from now, but \nnow, now, now.\n  Our Tax Code, for example, is imploding from the hundreds of economic \nand social policies Congress pursues through tax incentives and dozens \nof temporary tax provisions. It is a nightmare. Just ask the millions \nof Americans right now who are filing their tax returns. I have said \nthis on the floor before: When we got our tax return back last year, my \nwife and I looked at it. My wife said: Do you understand it?\n  I said: No, I don't understand it.\n  I said: Why don't we call our accountant; maybe he will explain it.\n  She said: Don't you dare. He will charge us $500.\n  It is out of control. For anybody who understands what is going on, \nit is a nightmare.\n  Tinkering with the Tax Code won't work. The argument I made to \nPresident Bush several times was that we know the reduction in marginal \nrates is going to evaporate. We know the capital gains reduction is \ngoing to evaporate in 2010. We know the reduction in taxes on dividends \nis going to evaporate in 2010. Why don't we take this opportunity to \nlook at tax reform and look at those things that are going to encourage \npeople to save and keep the economy going?\n  Frankly, those three things might be wonderful in that regard. But \nyou can't have it unless you make it up with some other taxes that are \nthe least hurtful to savings and the economy.\n  Since the last major tax reform in 1986, we have added over 15,000 \nnew provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. Last year alone, we passed \n500 changes in the Tax Code. It is no wonder why only 13 percent of \nAmericans file their taxes without the help of either a tax preparer or \ncomputer software. Clearly, we have waited too long to act. This is not \njust a matter of saving taxpayers' time and effort, it is also about \nsaving real money.\n  The Tax Foundation calculates conservatively that we all spend about \n$265 billion a year to keep track of our records and pay people to pay \nour taxes. If we could streamline it and make it simple and \nunderstandable, if we could only cut that in half, that would be a \ngigantic tax reduction for the American people and not cost us one \ndime.\n  We must enact fundamental tax reform to help make the Tax Code \nsimpler, fairer, transparent, and economically efficient.\n  Thankfully, there have been some encouraging signs of new \ndevelopments. Earlier this month, I attended a bipartisan press \nconference along with Senator Conrad, Representatives Cooper and Wolf, \nand former U.S. Comptroller General Walker who now heads up the Peter \nG. Peterson Foundation. David Walker and the rest of us urged Congress \nto take action to restore fiscal discipline. In other words, we all \nsaid: This has to be done. We agreed it is time to begin to enact the \nfirst pillar of meaningful comprehensive tax and entitlement reform. \nThat is why I am disappointed that President Obama did not mention a \nvehicle to enact tax and entitlement reform in his address to Congress, \njust as I was very disappointed that the Bush administration never once \nmentioned reducing our national debt after 2001.\n  I am a Republican. He was a Republican President. Our President \nnever, ever mentioned the national debt all the time he was President. \nIt was like it didn't exist. Yet the debt kept going up, up, up, and \nup. I have been calling for the creation of a commission to facilitate \ntax and entitlement reform for some time. In fact, back in 2006, I \nintroduced the Securing America's Future Economy or SAFE Commission \nAct, which I reintroduced in the Senate in the 109th and 110th \nCongresses.\n  Congressman Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Congressman Frank Wolf of \nVirginia introduced a version in the House that enlisted 93 cosponsors \nfrom both parties. This bipartisan, bicameral group had the support \nfrom\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\ncorporate executives, religious leaders, and think tanks across the \npolitical spectrum--the conservative Heritage Foundation and the \nliberal Brookings Institute. All of these people realize where we are.\n  Building on the SAFE Commission, two of my colleagues, the Budget \nCommittee chairman from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, and ranking \nmember from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, introduced a bipartisan bill \nthat would create a tax and entitlement reform task force very similar \nto the SAFE Commission called the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible \nFiscal Action. I signed on as 1 of 19 cosponsors. We will never, ever \ntake the necessary steps toward fiscal responsibility unless we create \nthis BRAC-like, bipartisan commission.\n  The commission would take on the tough issues of Social Security, \nhealth care, and tax reform, and create recommendations that would be \nfast-tracked through a special process and brought to the floor of both \nChambers for a vote. In other words, to do it the traditional way we do \nthings around here it will never, ever get done. If you think we would \nhave been able to close airbases and other bases around the country by \ndoing it through legislation without the BRAC process, you are not in \nthe real world.\n  If we really want to tackle this stuff, we have to get a group \ntogether. We have to work on it and come up with a compromise. If three \nquarters agree, it is the thing to do. We put it through an expedited \nprocedure. The Senate gets it; the House gets it. They have to vote up \nor down.\n  It is important that that happen because it will have legislators on \nit. I know if somebody asked you to spend a year and a half of your \nlife putting something together and then said: Well, once it is done, \nit will go through the regular procedure, you would say: Goodbye. I \ndon't have time for that.\n  But if you knew you put the time in and that if you had three \nquarters who agreed on it and the thing was going to get some action, \nthen you would have some incentive to say: I will stay at the table, \nwork on this, and we will get the job done.\n  The workload would be heavy, and the commission could certainly \nbenefit by taking a look at previous work that has been done to study \nthese issues by foundations and others. It also could start by \nconsidering some of the previous proposals that have been introduced by \nsome of our former colleagues, Senators Mack and Breaux, cochairs of \nthe commission created by the Bush administration to reform our Tax \nCode.\n  I worked like the dickens to say: Let's have this commission to study \nthe Tax Code. I will never forget talking to Karl Rove.\n  I said: I want it to be legislated. That is the way we had it in the \nappropriations bill.\n  He said: No, we will do it with something else. We will put Breaux \nand Mack in charge. I think he said at that time he was afraid that \nPelosi and Steny Hoyer might kill it in the beginning.\n  I said: If they are going to kill it in the beginning, let's find \nout. He said: No, we want the other direction. So Connie Mack and John \nBreaux worked their tails off for over a year. They came back with a \nvery good report. It wasn't perfect, but I expected President Bush to \ntake that and tweak it and send it over here.\n  I will never forget the story John Breaux told me. He went to visit \nwith President Bush. He walked in the Oval Office and he started \nlooking around. The President said to him: John, what are you doing?\n  And he said: Mr. President, I am looking for the report that we did.\n  On the shelf, gathering dust.\n  That is why I was pleased to hear President Obama mention the \nnational debt in his address to Congress. But I was disappointed that \nwhen he mentioned the ``crushing cost'' we face and the reform we can \nno longer afford to put on hold, he only talked about health care. \nAlthough health care costs are a big part of our entitlement problem, \naddressing health care reform alone will not get the job done.\n  It is not the time for dodging and ducking. This is the time for the \ncold hard truth. Everyone knows we need tax and entitlement reform. I \nknow it, the Obama administration knows it, and the American people \nknow it. And I know for sure Peter Orszag does because a couple years \nago, he was as enthusiastic about dealing with this problem as anybody \nin this country.\n  The American people elected President Obama to make the tough \ndecisions to put this country back on the right track. As President \nObama said himself so eloquently:\n\n       We must take responsibility for our future, and for \n     posterity.\n\n  I love that. I love that part of his speech. I thought it was just \ngreat. He cares about me. He cares about my children. He cares about my \ngrandchildren. ``We must take responsibility for our future, and for \nposterity.'' Sadly, so far he is missing in action on tax and \nentitlement reform. In fact, in a February 27 column in the Washington \nPost, Michael Gerson called the President's stance on tax and \nentitlement reform in his joint address to Congress ``timid'' and \n``hardly courageous.''\n  Now, in fairness to our President, he and his administration have \nbeen busy putting out fires. This President has more on his plate than \nmaybe any President we have ever had, maybe since Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt. But if he ignores comprehensive tax and entitlement reform, \nwe could see an economic holocaust.\n  That is why I would suggest to my fellow colleagues who have voiced \nsimilar calls for reform that we should gather our staffs, on a \nbipartisan and bicameral basis, to agree on the language of a vehicle \ncommission that can get the job done--in other words, getting \nRepublicans and Democrats, House and Senate, to get the language of \nwhat this commission should look like. We will work on that. If the \nadministration does not like our proposals, then they would be free to \nweigh in with their own ideas. But doing nothing simply is not an \noption. I have talked to Senator Gregg about this, Senator Conrad. And \nI said it is our duty to position this Nation so we have the greatest \nopportunity for success for the future.\n  I am saying, if the President does not want to do this, let's us get \ntogether and help him. OK. Let's get together. Let's help him and then \nsay: Here, Mr. President, here is something agreed to on a bipartisan \nbasis. We would like to go with it. If you have a better idea on how to \nget it done, amen and hallelujah, but we have to get going.\n  Each and every one of us should be able to look into the eyes of our \nchildren and grandchildren and know in our hearts we have done all we \ncan to make sure that at least they have the same opportunity we have \nhad for our standard of living and quality of life.\n  If I had to name one of the primary contributing factors to our \nworsening economic situation, it would have to be the loss of faith we \nseem to have experienced in ourselves. In many ways, today America is \nmired in a crisis of confidence.\n  I do not share the despair many experts hold concerning the future of \nour country. When I first became mayor of Cleveland in 1979, the city \nwas in default on its bonds. Unemployment for the first couple of years \ncontinued to grow to more than 18 percent. Think of that: 18 percent. \nCynics at the time joked, saying: Will the last person leaving \nCleveland turn out the lights.\n  We decided that no one was going to come to Cleveland and solve our \nproblems for us. We had the courage to be more self-reliant and make \ntough decisions. Through the public-private partnerships we created, we \nwere able to unite everyone behind common goals. We empowered the \ncommunity, and it worked. In fact, at that time, Cleveland was known as \nthe ``comeback city.''\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I know you could identify with this. \nCleveland was named an All America City three times in a 5-year period. \nIt never happened before, and I suspect it will never happen again. It \nwas that public-private partnership, everybody coming together. Our \nmotto was: Together we can do it.\n  Similarly, when I became Governor of Ohio in 1991, we faced a $1\\1/2\\ \nbillion budget shortfall, and we were a no-growth State. We made some \ntough decisions. As I mentioned earlier, I had to cut the budget four \ntimes and raise taxes. But, as a result, we were able to turn the tide, \ncreate 540,000 new jobs--in fact, manufacturing grew for the first time \nin 25 years--and the State's\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\nrainy-day fund grew from 14 cents to over $1 billion. And we put $200 \nmillion aside to take care of any Medicaid problem we would have.\n  Mr. President, I know we can turn things around again. We really can. \nBut we need to stop the spending spree and start making tough decisions \non this tax and entitlement reform. Why don't we work together to get \nAmerica back on track? Let's work together to systemically deal with \neach of the problems, challenges, and opportunities we have in America, \nso we are filled with the same hope and optimism of Ronald Reagan. I \ngot to know Ronald Reagan. He was quite a guy, quite a President. He \nalways had a positive attitude, and he said:\n\n       I know that for America, there will always be a bright dawn \n     ahead.\n\n  Mr. President, the glass is not half empty, the glass is half full. \nIf all of us work together, we can turn this thing around.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
