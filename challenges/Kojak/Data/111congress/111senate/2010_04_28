Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about one of the \nSenate's most senior Members but one of the newest on this side of the \naisle. I have known Senator Arlen Specter for many years. I have worked \nwith him, learned from him, and admired him. He is truly a legal \nscholar.\n  Anyone who has read his books--and I have--knows Senator Specter's \nlife has been a struggle. From his days as the son of immigrants in \nDepression-era Kansas to the treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, he has \nendured, while working as a full-time Senator. He has not had it easy, \nbut he has fought hard.\n  I consider it a privilege to work with Arlen Specter. He is a strong \ncontributor to our caucus, a valuable Member of this body and, most \nimportantly, a fine public servant for the people of Pennsylvania.\n  It would not surprise anyone to learn that over 25 years Senator \nSpecter and I have not always agreed on every issue. But I have never \nseen another Senator with a greater willingness to work in a bipartisan \nmanner, put people over party, and to encourage others to search their \nhearts and to do what is right.\n  Senator Specter has fought to end the partisanship in Washington as \nhard as he has fought for his constituents in Pennsylvania. He has \noften reminded us, in key times, including right here on the Senate \nfloor, that we had to go in a direction he thought was important. He \nwould tell us about that, that we were sent here to govern, not to \ndemagogue.\n  He has warned his former colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nnot to let a strategy of obstructing obscure their responsibility to \ngovern. That is a message with particular relevance with the issue \nbefore us this week. Without Senator Specter's courage to reach across \nthe aisle, we would not have passed the economic recovery plan that is \npulling our Nation out of recession and putting people back to work. \nArlen Specter did not vote for it for political reasons; he supported \nit because he saw what the Great Depression did to his family. It \nforced the Specters to move from their home in Wichita to his aunt's \nhome in Philadelphia. He did not want to see it slip up again and fall \ninto a depression.\n  Senator Specter then came over to our side of the aisle and helped us \npass the historic health care reform law that will help so many \nAmericans afford to live healthier lives. When the\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nanger of the townhall meetings consumed the country last summer, \nSenator Specter found himself on the frontline. He did not back up a \nstep. He did not give in to the myths and misinformation and never lost \nhis cool. As a senior member and former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter played a critical role in the historic \nconfirmation of Justice Sotomayor. I know he will do an equally \ncommendable job this summer when we work to replace Justice Stevens.\n  I wish to thank my friend for his good counsel, his service to the \ngood people of Pennsylvania, and all he does, both publicly and \nprivately, for the Senate.\n  The State of Pennsylvania, of course, is home to some of our \nNations's most significant political history: the Declaration of \nIndependence, the Constitution was drafted in Senator Specter's \nhometown of Philadelphia. He has recorded some history of his own. No \nPennsylvanian has served that State in the Senate of the United States \nlonger than he has.\n  His moderate voice has been an asset to our diverse caucus, and I \nlook forward to working with him for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2716-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can remember as a boy we moved from \nSearchlight, and my dad got a job in Henderson, where I was going to \nhigh school, and we rented a home there. We had a TV set, the first TV \nset. I can remember way back then my mother watching a program called \n``As The World Turns.'' It was a soap opera. I had never watched it on \npurpose but passing by, I guess. She watched that anytime she could, \nanytime she had a TV set.\n  My wife as a young woman, a young mother, to get away from the chores \nof taking care of those children of ours, would watch ``As The World \nTurns.'' This soap opera went from my mother, to my wife. That show is \nstill going on, ``As The World Turns.'' This soap opera is never going \nto end, I guess. I want everyone in the Senate to know that the \nnegotiations we hear so much about are never going to end.\n\n  We have to get on this bill. My friends on the other side of the \naisle should understand, we have negotiated in good faith and we have \ntried and we have to get to this bill. Negotiations are similar to ``As \nThe World Turns.'' Similar to a soap opera, they are never going to \nend, until we get on this bill.\n  I would say to my friends, let's get on this bill because we are \ngoing to continue having rollcall votes on this matter as long as it \ntakes. I am happy when we get on the bill. I have told everybody, on \nnumerous occasions, publicly and privately, on 90 percent of issues \nbrought to this floor we have had open debate.\n  We have had the most open debate in many Congresses. I am happy about \nthat. This issue that is now before us is going to be one where we can \namend, offer amendments and have debate and move forward. My friends on \nboth sides of the aisle want to offer amendments. They have told me \nthat. That is what we will do, but we cannot do that until we get on \nthe bill.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, again, let's stop \ntalking about this negotiation. It is going nowhere. We started off \nmonths of negotiations with the chairman and ranking member, Senator \nShelby, until they broke it off, and then a Senator from Tennessee \nthought he would have his try at it. He tried. That failed. We went \nbefore the committee. There were a lot of amendments filed by the \nRepublicans. They did not offer a single amendment before the \ncommittee. That is why it was reported to the floor.\n  We need to move on. Republicans and Democrats have held months of \nbipartisan meetings, negotiations, and consensus. But the time has come \nto move this conversation from the sidelines to the playing field. It \nis time this debate happened on the Senate floor where it belongs.\n  They think all the negotiations, I guess, should happen behind closed \ndoors. They want all the disagreements to end before the discussion \nbegins. I was so disappointed in one of my friends. I heard her on the \nradio this morning saying: Well, this is a complicated bill, and we \nhave to get it worked out before we are going to let this bill go to \nthe floor. Now that, I say with all due respect, does not make much \nsense.\n  They want everything worked out before we get to the floor. Is that \nthe new standard, they want all the disagreements to end before the \ndiscussion begins? I wonder what they think the purpose of debate is or \nwhy we have an amendment process. Negotiations are not moving forward. \nIt is ``As The World Turns.'' This soap opera never ends.\n  Well, this is going to end. We have to continue on this legislation. \nThe Republican leadership's insistence we work this out in the \nbackrooms is a stalling tactic. Every day they stall it a day, they say \nto Wall Street: Keep up the good work.\n  I have learned a little bit about this debate as we have moved on. I \nhave learned, having been in the past chairman of the Nevada Gaming \nCommission, which is the gambling commission, we tried to make those \ngames fair so people who came to gamble--and they gamble with their own \nmoney--if they lost that money, they lost it fair and square. But one \nthing they lost was their own money.\n  The deal on Wall Street is an interesting gamble. They use our money, \nand then they keep all the profits, and if there are losses, they come \nto us for help. It has been more than 2 years since the financial \ncollapse and months since these negotiations started. It is time to \nmove forward on this legislation.\n  What are my friends afraid of? This is the Senate. We are supposed to \nlegislate. Negotiate? There comes a time when we have to legislate. \nThat time has arrived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2716-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday, I came to the floor and \nnoted that an increasing number of businesses large and small have been \nweighing in on the financial regulatory bill. And what we have seen \nfrom these groups is a growing concern about the adverse effect this \nbill could have on their businesses. Everyone from candy bar companies \nto motorcycle makers, it seems, is now worried about the impact of this \nbill.\n  So this has been a very useful exercise: by giving people time to \nactually look at this bill and study the details for themselves, we \nhave enabled them to assess not only potential impact of the actual \ntext of the bill itself but also some of the unintended consequences it \ncould have.\n  As we know, this is something Americans were denied in the lead-up to \nthe vote on the stimulus bill. Democrats insisted we vote on that bill \nabout 18 hours after we got the text. And we have seen how that turned \nout. This is something Americans were denied again on the health \nspending bill, which was basically written by a few guys in a room, \nthen jammed through the Senate during a blizzard on Christmas Eve. And \nwe have seen how that turned out: a bill that was sold on the promise \nof lower costs and lower premiums is now expected to lead to higher \ncosts and higher premiums.\n  So this time people have actually had a chance to look at one of \nthese massive Democrat bills for a change, and what is perfectly clear \nto most of them is that this bill needs some work, which is precisely \nwhat Republicans have been saying for the last 2 weeks.\n  Let's just start with the basics. The first thing we had to ensure \nwith this bill is that it did not leave taxpayers on the hook for any \nmore Wall Street bailouts. And that is the first thing some of us on \nthis side of the aisle noticed: the loopholes. So I raised the alarm on \nthat issue, and the two parties have been looking into it.\n  But there are other problems. In particular there is growing concern \nthat in an effort to hold Wall Street accountable, this bill could \ncatch the little guys up in the same net as the big banks. And this is \nnow a major concern for a lot of people, a concern we need to address \nhead on.\n  For instance, whether the authors of this bill intended it or not, \nthere is real\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nconcern that this bill could penalize anyone in this country who buys \nor sells something on an installment plan, as a result of some language \nin section 1027.\n  As the New York Times put it this morning, and here I am quoting the \nTimes, ``this bill gives broad powers to a consumer protection agency \nto regulate almost any business that extends credit, meaning that \ncompanies like car dealers and professionals like orthodontists who \nallow customers to pay over time could be subject to a new regulatory \nand supervisory regime.''\n  Does this mean that some graduate student in Louisville looking to \nbuy an engagement ring would now be required to pay a higher interest \nrate, or that the jeweler wouldn't do the deal because this bill would \ncreate new oversight over any nonfinancial institutions that lend money \nto consumers? What about the parent trying to spread out payments for \ntheir child's braces? Will they now have to pay for it all upfront? \nWill the orthodontist be willing to expose his or her practice to \nFederal supervision because they allow patients to pay the bill in more \nthan four installments?\n  I don't know the answer to these questions. But I do like to have a \ngood answer if one of my constituents asks me about it. Right now I \ndon't. No one can deny that the language of the bill is ambiguous, that \nit lends itself to broad interpretation. So let's tighten it up. And \nwhy shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we tighten up the language to make it \ncrystal clear exactly what this bill means and what it doesn't mean?\n  The last thing we want is for the little guy to get hurt by a piece \nof legislation that is intended to rein in bankers on Wall Street. But \nthat is precisely why we have gotten so many letters of opposition to \nthis bill over the last few days from groups like the National \nFederation of Independent Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nAmericans for Tax Reform, and the National Taxpayers Union.\n  That is also why we have gotten so many letters expressing serious \nconcerns from groups like the United States Automobile Association, the \nMilitary Officers Association of America, the National Council of \nFarmer Cooperatives, the Farm Credit Council, the American Council of \nLife Insurers, the Housing Policy Council, the National Association of \nHome Builders, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the \nFertilizer Institute. The list goes on.\n  In fact, the only people who seem willing to come out in support of \nthis bill are the executives at Goldman Sachs, the biggest bankers at \nthe biggest Wall Street firm of all. The CEO of Goldman Sachs was here \non the Hill yesterday discussing his firm's role in the financial \ncrisis, and the point he made about this bill is that he agrees with \nthe President, who said last week that the biggest beneficiaries of \nthis bill are on Wall Street.\n  So the supporters of this bill may have locked up the support of the \nfolks at Goldman Sachs. But Republicans aren't about to rush this bill \njust to make Lloyd Blankfein happy, and not before there's an ironclad \nprotection against any taxpayer funding of Wall Street firms like his. \nAmericans want to knew that this bill will protect them too. And right \nnow, they have got more questions than answers.\n  I already mentioned concerns about section 1027. How about section \n1022? It relates to government collection of information through a new \nBureau of Consumer Protection. Here's what that section of the bill \nsays: ``In conducting research on the offering and provision of \nconsumer financial products or services.'' It continues: ``The Bureau \nshall have the authority to gather information from time to time \nregarding the organization, business conduct, markets, and activities \nof persons operating in consumer financial services markets.''\n  It continues:\n\n       In order to gather such information, the Bureau may make \n     public such information obtained by the Bureau under this \n     section, as is in the public interest in reports or otherwise \n     in the manner best suited for public information and use.\n\n  I have a question: Does having a credit card make you a person \noperating in consumer financial service markets? What if you sell \nsomething on eBay and someone pays you with their credit card through \nPaypal? Does that make you someone operating in consumer financial \nservice market? I am sure it is not the intent of the chairman to give \nthe government the authority to collect personal financial information \non Kentuckians who use Paypal. But why not make it clear?\n  These are just some of the questions people are asking once they have \nhad a chance to look at this bill. And I am just talking now about the \nunintended consequences. Plenty of other groups have pointed out some \nof the real, practical adverse consequences of this bill on people who \nhad absolutely nothing to do with the financial crisis.\n  For instance: I have heard from a number of utilities in Kentucky \nthat use traditional derivatives as a way of keeping prices low for \nthemselves and, by extension, for homeowners and small business owners \nacross my state. General Electric employs more than 5,000 people in \nKentucky, so I want to hear what they have to say about this bill. And \nwhat they are telling me is that this bill could really hurt them. They \nhave got a lot of concerns. They are concerned this bill will increase \nthe cost of managing foreign exchange risk associated with their vast \nglobal supply chain.\n  They are concerned about the potential cost increases related to the \nhedging of commodities they use in the manufacturing process. And they \nare concerned about increased hedging costs related to the financing \nthey provide to suppliers and retail customers who buy GE appliances \nlike washers and dryers and water heaters that are made in Louisville.\n  Homeowners and small business owners in Kentucky didn't have anything \nto do with the financial crisis. I am sure none of the Kentuckians who \nwork at GE in Louisville had anything to do with it either. But because \nthis bill doesn't distinguish between utilities that use derivatives \nfor a legitimate use and those who abused them, ratepayers and others \nin my State will almost certainly get hit by this bill.\n  These are some of the concerns people are raising about this bill. \nAnd the fact is, those concerns are only magnified by the recent \nperformance of the Democrat majority. I am afraid those who claim that \nthis bill wouldn't do any of the things people are afraid of now have a \nhigher hurdle to cross after the assurances they gave the American \npeople on the stimulus, the debt, and health care. A lot of people took \nDemocrats at their word in those debates, and they got burned. Now they \nwant more than a verbal assurance that this bill doesn't allow \nbailouts. They want proof.\n  I don't think anybody really thinks the Fertilizer Institute is \nresponsible for the financial crisis. And I don't think the authors of \nthis bill think Kentucky farmers are to blame for the collapse of \nLehman Brothers. But whether they intended to or not, this bill would \npunish them. And that is not right.\n  So Americans want a number of things in this bill fixed. And they \nwant more than verbal assurances. At this point, Americans want the \nsupporters of this bill to put a highlighter through the relevant \npassages and then tab the pages. Americans expect us to prove we are \ndoing what we say we are doing. And after the past few debates, I don't \nblame them one bit. None of this should be viewed as a burden. After \nall, isn't that how the legislative process is supposed to work: major \nlegislation is proposed, the American people get to take a look at it, \nthey let us know how it would affect them, and then we weigh those \nconcerns against the various problems at hand? The authors of this bill \nmay believe some of these concerns are misplaced. But they are going to \nhave to prove it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2717-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his generous and complimentary comments. As today completes 1 year \nsince my return to the Democratic Party, I have a few observations on \nwhat we should do as Senators, not as Democrats or Republicans, to tend \nto the Nation's business in these difficult days.\n  Partisanship ran high in 2005, with Republican threats to invoke the \nnuclear or constitutional option, which would, in effect, change the \nrule to allow 51 votes to cut off filibusters. The so-called ``Gang of \n14,'' a group of centrists from both parties, structured a compromise \nwhich confirmed some judicial nominees, rejected others, and \nestablished a standard that filibusters should not be employed except \nin ``exceptional circumstances.'' That spirit of compromise, I suggest, \nshould be revisited today.\n  In the threat of a great depression in February 2009, I refused to \njoin the Republican obstructionism and played a key role in the passage \nof the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. I am fully aware that my \nvote put my job on the line.\n  Achieving civility and cooperation for the common good in 2010, as it \noccurred in 2005 with respect to judicial nominations, will require \nindependence and risk-taking by Senators. Senators must be willing to \ncross the aisle and work with their colleagues even at the peril of the \ndisfavor of their own political party. The problems of the country \ntoday are too severe, too many Americans are out of work, too many \nAmericans are fighting and dying in foreign lands, for members of this \nbody to be unwilling to risk their seats for the public good. The \nstakes for America require we all do our level best and permit the \npublic to judge us accordingly.\n  At the moment, there is a pressing need for Republicans to join with \nus in reforming Wall Street to prevent the kind of financial crisis \nthat cost this country 8 million jobs. Both sides agree that \nlegislation is necessary. On a motion to proceed, which is now pending \non this legislation, there is no realistic contention that \n``extraordinary circumstances'' justify a filibuster. Once the bill is \nbeing debated, there will be opportunity for amendments. Forty-one \nRepublican Senators will then have the opportunity to filibuster \nwhatever proposed legislation evolves before final passage occurs. \n``Extraordinary circumstances'' now call for Republicans to join \nDemocrats in passing legislation to prevent another economic crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2718-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2718-S2719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Republican leader on \nhis remarks. Listening to him, I was wondering how Kentuckians would \nrespond to the thought that--as we seem to be hearing now about this \nso-called consumer protection bureau--``We are from Washington and we \nare here to protect you.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to the Senator from Tennessee, now that we \nare getting a chance to take a look at this bill, it is pretty clear \nthat it has a broad reach that would touch a whole lot of people in \nTennessee and Kentucky and has nothing to do with what happened on Wall \nStreet. It is noteworthy that the most conspicuous supporter of this \nbill is the chairman of Goldman Sachs.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if the Republican leader would agree with me, \nif I may say through the Chair, that it is noteworthy that the \nlegislation we are talking about focuses on shop owners, auto dealers, \nreal estate agents, farmers, community bankers, doctors, and dentists \nwho had virtually nothing to do with this recession we are in, but this \nlegislation completely leaves out the two giant Federal housing \nagencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that had almost everything to do \nwith the recession we are in.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Many, if not most experts, believed the crisis began \nthrough Fannie and Freddie. As far as I can tell, they are not \naddressed in this measure at all.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Republican leader.\n  Mr. President, ``We are from Washington and we are here to protect \nyou'' is a promise or an offer that is creating a lot of suspicion \naround my State of Tennessee, and I suspect around the country. I am \nhearing from a lot of people who don't like the sound of that--shop \nowners, auto dealers, real estate agents, community bankers, retailers, \ndoctors, dentists, traders on eBay--they're afraid the so-called \nconsumer protection legislation we are hearing about will make it \nharder to borrow money. It will take more time to borrow money. It will \nbe more expensive to borrow money. They will have to fill out more \nforms to borrow money. They will have fewer choices to borrow money.\n  If the shop owner, the auto dealer, the real estate agent, the \ncommunity banker, the doctor or the dentist, and the traders on eBay \ncan't borrow money, then they can't invest, we can't create jobs, and \nwe can't put an end to this recession.\n  We wouldn't want to pass a piece of legislation, I would not think, \nthat says ``We are from Washington and we are here to protect you,'' \nand the effect of it, to people up and down Main Street, is to make it \nharder to borrow money, take more time to borrow money, and make it \nmore expensive to borrow money.\n  Someone said yesterday, I believe the Senator from North Carolina--if \nthe number of forms one has to fill out to buy a house is what it takes \nto stop a recession or to make sure we don't have one, then we should \nnot be in this one. Anyone who has filled out a mortgage application \nlately knows one has to fill out a stack that high of consumer \nprotection forms.\n  So just adding another layer of consumer protection forms to buying a \nhouse or borrowing money or buying something on credit, what does that \nhave to do with Wall Street? What does that have to do with this great \nrecession?\n  We need to make it possible for community banks to make a loan to a \nsmall business who can then hire a person, who can make an investment \nto help get the economy moving again.\n  Most of us thought this Wall Street bill was about Wall Street, but \nit is turning out to be more about Main Street. The auto dealer and the \ncommunity banker and the retailer and the dentist say: Main Street is \nus. It is about whether we can borrow money, get credit, expand the \nstore, or create a job. ``We are from Washington and we are here to \nprotect you'' sounds hollow to a lot of Americans, and it sounds like \nanother Washington takeover to me.\n  We have already made Washington the new American automotive capital. \nWe have already made Washington the new American health care capital. \nWe have already made Washington the new American student loan capital. \nNow we are going to move Main Street to Washington, DC, for every \nlittle credit transaction up and down Main Street? We need to be \ncareful about that. I don't think Chicago and New York City want to \nmove the great financial centers of this country to Washington. With \nsome of the kind of restrictions we are talking about passing, we may \nmove those financial centers and those jobs to Singapore, to Shanghai, \nto London, or to other places. But moving Main Street to Washington, \nwhat is this all about? Why is this even in the bill?\n  If the bill is about reining in Wall Street, that is a good idea. But \nwhy are we going up and down Main Street reining in Main Street when \nMain Street is having a very hard time these days?\n  The President is in Iowa today talking about Main Street. I hope he \nis explaining why we have a piece of consumer protection legislation \nthat says ``We are from Washington and we are here to protect you,'' \nwhen most realtors, most auto dealers, most community banks, most \ndentists, most traders on eBay say: Wait a minute. We are not sure we \nneed or want that kind of protection, if what it means is to make it \nharder to borrow money, take more time to borrow money, make it more \nexpensive to borrow money, to fill out more forms to borrow money, or \nto have fewer choices to borrow money. If it means all that, we might \nnot be able to create more jobs.\n  Of course, what we are saying on the Republican side is, we want to \nexercise\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\nthe prerogative the Democrats offered when they were in the minority, \nwhich is to provide some checks and balances to the proposals made \nhere. The majority leader, rather than encouraging that, is already the \nworld recordholder in offering ``no'' motions. A ``no'' motion says no \nto more amendments, no to more debate, no to more checks and balances.\n\n  So we will vote on that again today. We want more debate. We want \nmore amendments. We want more checks and balances. We want to exercise \nthe prerogative we have to make sure the people up and down Main Street \nhave a right to see what is in the bill, and so we are well informed \nabout the bill before we pass it.\n  We are writing the rules for the economy of the United States of \nAmerica. We produce 25 percent of all the money in the world. What we \ndo here affects not just Nashville and Maryville and Main Street \nAmerican towns, but it affects the entire world economy. We need to be \ncareful.\n  I suppose our friends on the other side think: Well, maybe it is \npolitically smart to offer all these ``no'' motions. We would like to \nbe known as the party--they may be thinking--that wants to cut off, for \na record number of times, the opportunity to debate, the opportunity to \noffer amendments, the opportunity to have checks and balances. I do not \nthink it is so politically wise. I think it is politically tone deaf.\n  The people in my State do not want to see another big bill run \nthrough Congress as fast as a freight train without checks and \nbalances. We saw that with the health care bill. And do you know what \nwe got? We got a health care law that over the weekend the Obama \nadministration's Chief Actuary said does just what Republicans said it \nwould do: it increases spending, increases premiums, and will have \nMedicare cuts.\n  Republicans said all that. We argued strongly that it would be \nbetter--instead of expanding a health care delivery system that already \nis too expensive--to, instead, focus our attention on reducing the cost \nof health care so more Americans could buy insurance. That was our \neffort at checks and balances. I think we won the argument. But we lost \nthe vote on the floor of the Senate by one vote. We would like to win \nthe argument here on financial regulation as well, to say: let's rein \nin Wall Street, but why are we making it harder to borrow money on Main \nStreet, for heaven's sake?\n  We should be making it easier to create jobs and to make investments \non Main Street. Why are we reining in Main Street and ignoring the two \ngreat housing agencies that were at the root cause of this great \nrecession we are in? Main Street was not the cause of the recession. So \nwe are reining in Main Street lending and we are ignoring Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac--the two great housing agencies.\n  We have some questions that we want to make sure are answered \nproperly. Does this legislation give big banks an advantage over \ncommunity banks? Does it make big banks permanently too big to fail? \nThe Republican leader said: Well, Goldman Sachs supports the bill. \nWell, they may. But yesterday, in my office, the dentists did not, the \nauto dealer did not, the community bankers did not, the people up and \ndown Main Street did not. So what are we to take from that difference \nof opinion?\n  So we are here today to say, let's work together. Let's take \nadvantage of this great system of checks and balances that our Founders \nwrote into the Constitution that says in the Senate we come to \nconsensus. Let's look carefully at this Bureau of Consumer Financial \nProtection, which will have so much independence, which will have a \npartisan appointment, which can choose what financial products can and \ncannot be offered, and could regulate hundreds of thousands of nonbank \nbusinesses. Let's look at a consumer bureau that could place new \nburdens on Main Street businesses that had nothing to do with the \neconomic crisis and have very little to do with the financial world. \nThese mandates and time-consuming requirements and these new forms to \nfill out are not the way to help create new jobs and get the American \neconomy moving again.\n  What we are saying on the Republican side of the aisle is, we think \nwe have a great opportunity. We think, as the President said in his \ncampaign, we can come together, write rules that help to fix the \nproblems that helped create the great recession. We cannot guarantee \nthere will never be another recession, but we can avoid some of the \nabuses. This all started out in a good way with Senator Dodd, the \nchairman of the committee, appointing Republicans and then Democrats, \ndividing them into teams to work on bipartisan legislation, and \nsuddenly, in the middle of the discussions, somebody said: Wait a \nminute, we won the election, we will write the bill and pass it. We \nhave the votes. We do not need the Republicans.\n  But should we not have learned with the health care law that it is \nnot just a matter of passing a bill, it is gaining confidence in the \nbill? Do we not want the country to look up at Washington and say: ``I \nam relieved to see Republican and Democratic Senators are working \ntogether on these great issues, and 70 or 80 of them voted yes. We have \nwritten the rules for the future for the financial system of the United \nStates, which is in some trouble, and it is not going to be changed \nwhether we have a Republican Congress or a Democratic Congress after \nNovember. This is something you can rely on''?\n  Then small businesspeople up and down Main Street, big businesspeople \non Wall Street, the commodities market in Chicago--they can say: We see \nsome certainty because of this stability in Washington, and we are \nready to make investment decisions. We are ready to create new jobs.\n  I believe this could be a tipping point in the economic recovery. So \nwhy would we play politics in the Senate on this? Why would the other \nside keep offering ``no'' motions that cut off our right to debate, our \nright to offer amendments, our constitutional prerogative to offer \nchecks and balances on a runaway Washington government?\n  We think most Americans want those checks and balances. And should we \nhave them, and should we demonstrate a bipartisan bill here, we will \nnot only get a good bill, we will not only help create good rules for \nthe future, we can avoid putting handcuffs on Main Street. We can send \na signal to our country there is certainty in the marketplace. Go ahead \nand make your investment. Go ahead and create your job. The world will \nrespond favorably to that, and we can get out of this great recession \nwe are in.\n  I am here to say today there are a lot of people suspicious about \nthis phrase: We are from Washington, and we are here to protect you. \nThey think it is a better idea to say: We would like to see some checks \nand balances applied to the majority's push for this new consumer \nregulation legislation. And if we do apply those checks and balances, \nand come to a bipartisan agreement on the bill, the country will be \npleased with the work we are doing here, and the economic recovery, \nhopefully, will have a chance to move along a little more rapidly.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I take this time to emphasize the need of \nour Nation to move forward with a comprehensive energy policy. I know \nthe Presiding Officer shares that commitment and is working very hard \non the Environment and Public Works Committee to produce legislation \nthat will solve the three major issues we have in this Nation with \nregard to energy. No. 1 is to create jobs. We need to create good, \nclean energy jobs here in America and not lose them to overseas \ncompetitors. We understand that. We also understand we need an energy \npolicy that boosts our national security. We\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\ndon't want to continue to support the efforts of countries that \ndisagree with our way of life. We have to become energy secure here in \nAmerica. Also, we need such a policy for the sake of our environment. \nWe know greenhouse gas emissions and carbon emissions are polluting our \nair.\n  We know we can answer all three of these issues--creating jobs, \nenhancing national security, and protecting the environment--by using \nalternative and renewable energy sources, by using less energy, and by \nmoving forward with nuclear energy. We need to do all of that.\n  With regard to obtaining sufficient and secure energy supplies, we \ncannot drill our way out of this problem. I say that because America \nhas somewhere around 3 percent of the global oil reserves. We use about \n25 percent. We can't drill our way out of that disequilibrium. \nSecondly, we have to use less carbon-emitting fuel sources for the sake \nof our environment.\n  President Obama recently announced the opening of eight frontier \nOuter Continental Shelf (OCS) areas in the United States for oil and \ngas exploration and development. I oppose that policy. I wish to \nexplain to my colleagues why I oppose that policy.\n  Interior Secretary Salazar said we need to protect our most \nenvironmentally sensitive areas from drilling. I agree. The President's \nplan protects the west coast and the North Atlantic. I can tell my \ncolleagues, just talk to people in this part of the country, and they \nwill tell you that the Chesapeake Bay and our coastlines here in the \nmid-Atlantic region are just as precious and just as vulnerable as the \nwest coast of the United States or the North Atlantic.\n  I oppose the President's policy because there are other OCS areas \nwhich are currently available. Sixty-eight million acres that have not \nyet been explored are already available in this country for oil and gas \nexploration. Many of those areas are along the Outer Continental Shelf, \nso there is no need at this time to expand that network. I must tell my \ncolleagues, the risk-reward ratio is what I am mostly concerned about--\nthe risk of doing environmental damage versus the little oil that may \nbe recovered in these areas. It just doesn't pay.\n  I have heard the advocates of offshore drilling say: Well, modern \ntechnology has substantially reduced the risk. We now know how to deal \nwith this issue and avoid any type of catastrophic environmental risk.\n  Let me share this photo with my colleagues. What we are looking at is \nthe Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. This \nphotograph was taken shortly after an accident that occurred just 8 \ndays ago. There was a tragic explosion and fire and in which 11 people \nlost their lives, which is the greatest tragedy--the loss of life--but \nit also created an environmental disaster.\n  Let me tell my colleagues something. Deepwater Horizon is considered \nto be the most technologically advanced offshore oil rig in the world, \nand $600 million was spent in constructing this rig so it would be \nsafe. My point is, it exploded, capsized, and sank, and it cost people \ntheir lives and it has created an environmental disaster.\n  This oil rig is located 50 miles southeast of Venice, LA. There was \n700,000 gallons of No. 2 fuel onboard that either burned or was spilled \ninto the gulf. It is currently leaking about 1,000 barrels a day into \nthe Gulf of Mexico. The oilspill is spreading.\n  If I could just show my colleagues this image. This is hard to see, \nbut this is a picture taken from space, taking a look at this region of \nthe United States of America. We start to see the coastline of \nLouisiana and Mississippi, and we can also see where the spill is \nlocated. The spill is right here. So in a picture taken from space, one \ncan actually see the spill area. The spill has spread 1,800 miles, an \narea larger than the State of Rhode Island.\n  This is another, close-up view of the spill area. What this is \nshowing is the oil we saw on the surface of the water. This is all oil \nthat is currently in the Gulf of Mexico, and it is spreading.\n  The next image shows the color-coded trajectory of the spill over the \npast several days. What we saw in the previous image includes just this \narea. It doesn't include the green area; it doesn't include this light-\norange area. That is where the spill was projected to go yesterday. So \nyou can see how rapidly the spill is spreading.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, the good news of this--to the extent there \nis good news--is that the winds have been blowing from the north and \nnorthwest. If they hadn't been blowing from that direction, it is very \nlikely this oilspill would be much closer to the Louisiana coastline.\n  There are many areas that are vulnerable as a result of this spill, \nmany coastal areas in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The \nspill is approaching the Delta and Breton National Wildlife Refuges and \nthe Chandeleur Barrier Islands. It threatens our coasts, bird-nesting \nhabitats, oyster production areas, wildlife, wetlands, and the list \ngoes on and on and on.\n  I know the Presiding Officer knows the importance of bird-nesting \nhabitats for the protection of species. He understands that oyster \nspawning and production areas can be destroyed for generations as a \nresult of pollution; that when we lose wildlife, we can lose it \npermanently, and when we lose wetlands, we lose the filtration system \nthat protects us from pollutants coming into estuaries and we lose the \n``speed bumps'' that can slow and absorb storms and hurricanes, causing \nmore havoc when they hit our coasts. This is all happening as a result \nof a fire and a spill from the most technologically advanced rig in the \nworld.\n  An article in the New York Times today says we might have to have a \ncontrolled burn of the oil floating on the surface of the water because \ncapping the well is such a challenge. First, we are told we have \ntechnology to deal with this type of incident; now, we are being told \nwe are going to have burn the oil instead.\n  The first thing to do when we have an event such as this one is that \nwe try to plug the hole so it doesn't spew more oil into the gulf. \nGuess what. We are told that because of the depth of this well--5,000 \nfeet--it could take up to several months to plug the leak by drilling \nwhat are know as relief wells. So what can we do? Oil is pouring out. \nThey said: Well, we are going to try to funnel the oil for collection \nunderwater, before it reaches the surface. This procedure has never \nbeen done before at this depth. They are trying to design and fabricate \nthe equipment right now to deal with that approach. Will it work? I \ndon't know. But these are the risks inherent in offshore drilling. It \nunderscores my concern and opposition to the offshore drilling plan as \nproposed by the President.\n  So let me talk about why this is not just a hypothetical to the \npeople of Maryland but this is a real problem. There is a site known as \nlease sale 220. Lease sale 220 is located off the shore of Virginia. It \nis a 2.9 million-acre site. The site where they want to drill is the \ngreen triangle we see on this chart. The purple shows the current flows \nof the Gulf Stream, and here you see the coasts of New Jersey, \nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This \nchart is instructive because we see how the currents go.\n  Let me also tell my colleagues that the National Atmospheric and \nOceanic Administration (NOAA) tells us that 72 percent of the time, the \nprevailing winds in this region blow toward or along the coast--72 \npercent of the time. If there is a catastrophe, if there is an oilspill \nrelated to this site, the likelihood of oil washing up on the shores of \nNew Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the Outer Banks is quite \nhigh.\n  Here is the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, 50 miles away from this \nsite. As the Presiding Officer knows, we are struggling to deal with \nthe clean-up of the Chesapeake Bay. It is hard enough just dealing with \nthe known pollutants that come in from farming and from development and \nfrom storm runoff. Put into that a potential oilspill and it would set \nus back decades in trying to restart our oyster crops and help our \nwatermen with the blue crabs and to help the rock fish return and \nthrive. It is too great of a risk.\n  As Secretary Salazar said, there are certain parts of this country \nthat are so environmentally sensitive, they are not worth the risk--the \nwest coast of the United States, the North Atlantic, parts of Alaska. \nAnd I tell my colleagues that the coast around the\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nChesapeake Bay falls into that category. We should not permit that type \nof drilling.\n  We can do something about this. We are going to have a chance. I am a \nstrong proponent of what Senator Kerry is attempting to do in bringing \nforward a bill that will solve all three of our problems: creating \njobs, enhancing our national security, and responsibly dealing with \npollutants in our environment while being an international leader in \nthe effort to reduce carbon emissions. We can achieve all of those \nobjectives without this drilling.\n  We will have a chance to say something about it. I urge my colleagues \nto take a look at what happened in the Gulf of Mexico last week, what \ncontinues to happen there, and work with those of us who want to make \nsure we have a sensible and sustainable energy policy in this country \nand help me and help our Nation protect the Chesapeake Bay and protect \nthose lands that are just too valuable and too sensitive to risk oil \ndrilling.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Mr. President, I rise for a few minutes to talk about S. \n3217, the financial regulatory reform bill. I focus, if I could, my \ncomments today on why the cloture vote on financial reform is such an \nimportant key vote.\n  My colleagues from the other side have talked about this vote, and it \nis often referred to as a procedural vote to begin debate. Almost in \nthe same sentence, I think both sides of the aisle recognize that \nnotwithstanding the good work that has been done by Chairman Dodd and \nRanking Member Shelby, there is still much to be done on this bill, and \nthere are still some significant flaws within the bill.\n  The argument goes on to say: Don't worry, these problems can be \nworked out on the Senate floor. We will have a robust debate, and we \nwill have floor amendments. So get the bill to the floor--the argument \ngoes--and the promises made to fix it will then happen.\n  But that is where the logic goes into the ditch. Once this bill does \nget to the floor of the Senate, we all recognize it is going to be very \ndifficult to change it. Look at the health care bill to see how \ndifficult it was to make changes. Let me make that comparison because I \nthink it is a fair comparison.\n  During the health care debate, let me remind my colleagues, there \nwere 488 amendments that were filed. Of those 488 amendments, only 28 \nreceived a vote--28 out of 488. Of those 28 amendments, only 11 \namendments passed. This being said, only 2 percent of all the health \ncare amendments filed actually got passed.\n  If we look at the partisan nature of this bill, it even becomes more \nblatant. If we look at the Republican amendments, we come to the \nconclusion that there was a serious problem. Only one Republican \namendment passed. So the death knell of the amendment depended upon \nwhether it had an ``R'' or a ``D'' behind the name.\n  The notion that we will be able to fix a bill--and again, everybody \nis acknowledging it is a flawed bill--on the Senate floor is pure \nfolly. History is our greatest teacher. Instead, I respectfully suggest \nthat what we need to do is get serious about reaching a bipartisan \ncompromise.\n  I have said publicly, and I will say on the Senate floor every \nopportunity I get, that with a sufficient amount of work, this bill can \nget 70 or 80 votes. We have worked on this issue on the Banking \nCommittee for months and months, trying to understand what went wrong \nand how best to fix it. The American people want Members of the Senate \nto work together on the bill. They wonder what on Earth has come of \nCongress when they see us holding the exact same cloture vote on the \nexact same legislation day after day.\n  They ask a simple question: Why can't you just sit down and work \nthrough these differences of opinion?\n  I am mindful of the fact that this is probably clever messaging--a \nclever messaging ploy by Washington's standards. But by Nebraskan \nstandards, we are tired of Washington cleverness and the partisan \nrhetoric that goes with it. I can tell you that people want a bill that \nwill end too big to fail and protect our economy from financial \nmeltdown. What they don't want is a bill written so broadly that it \nimpacts businesses in segments of our economy that play no part in the \neconomic collapse. I want these same things.\n  I still believe we can accomplish this. My hope is that we can quit \nmaking this an issue of political gamesmanship and talking points and \nstart working toward a solution.\n  I have consistently stated that the issue of regulatory reform isn't \na partisan exercise. The issue just doesn't cut on ``R'' or ``D'' \nlines. We can get a broad, bipartisan bill if we stop the attacks and \nfocus on trying to solve the differences that still exist on this \nbill--important policy differences.\n  Stop the daily cloture votes. I understand the political theater of \nthat, but it doesn't lend itself to solving problems. What we need is a \nbipartisan effort, where people sit down and work through these \ndifferences of opinion.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held the fourth in our \nseries of hearings to explore some of the causes and consequences of \nthe financial crisis. These hearings are the culmination of nearly a \nyear and a half of investigation.\n  The freezing of financial markets and the collapse of financial \ninstitutions that sparked our investigation are not just a matter of \nnumbers on a balance sheet. These are numbers reflecting millions of \nAmericans who lost their jobs, their homes, and their businesses in a \nrecession that the housing crisis sparked, the worst economic decline \nsince the Great Depression. Behind these numbers are American families \nwho are still suffering the effects of a manmade economic catastrophe.\n  Our goal has been to construct a record of the facts in order to try \nto deepen public understanding of what went wrong, to inform a \nlegislative debate about the need for financial reform, and to provide \na foundation for building better defenses to protect Main Street from \nWall Street.\n  Our first hearing, 3 or 4 weeks ago, dealt with the impact of high-\nrisk mortgage lending. It focused on a case study, as our committee \ndoes, of Washington Mutual Bank, known as WaMu, a thrift whose leaders \nembarked on a reckless strategy to pursue higher profits by emphasizing \nhigh-risk loans. WaMu didn't just make loans that were likely to fail; \nthese loans also created real hardships for the borrowers, as well as \nrisk for the bank itself. What happened was there was basically a \nconveyor belt that fed those toxic loans into the financial system like \na polluter dumping poison pollution into a river. That poison came \npackaged in mortgage-backed securities that WaMu sold to get the \nenormous risk of these mortgages off its own books and shifted to \nsomebody else's.\n  Our second hearing examined how Federal regulators at the Office of \nThrift Supervision watched and observed WaMu--saw the problems year \nafter year--and did nothing to stop them. Regulation by the Office of \nThrift Supervision that should have been conducted at arm's length was \ninstead done arm-in-arm with WaMu.\n  The third hearing dealt with credit rating agencies. These are \nspecific case\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\nstudies of Standard & Poor's and Moody's, the Nation's two largest \ncredit raters. And while WaMu and other lenders--and WaMu wasn't alone \nby a long shot--dumped these bad loans, regulators failed to stop the \nbehavior. Credit rating agencies were assuring everybody that the \npoisoned water was safe to drink. Triple A ratings were slapped on \nbottles of high-risk financial products. So that was the third hearing. \nWe have to do something about the inherent conflict of interest that is \ninvolved when the credit rating agencies are paid by the people whose \nactual documents and whose transactions they are rating, putting labels \nof triple A, double A, what have you, on them. There is a built-in \nconflict of interest.\n  Yesterday's hearing explored the role of investment banks in the \ndevelopment of this crisis, and we focused on the period of 2007, when \nthat housing bubble burst, of Goldman Sachs, one of the oldest firms on \nWall Street. Goldman's documents made it very clear that it was betting \nagainst the housing market while it was aggressively selling \ninvestments in the housing market to its own clients. It was selling \nthe clients high-risk, mortgage-backed securities and what they call \nCDOs, and synthetic CDOs, that it wanted to get off its books. They \nwanted to get securities off the books. They were reaching out with one \nhand to prospective buyers and saying: Here. But with the other hand \nthey were betting against those same securities.\n  The bottom line is that what we have discovered in this \ninvestigation, and heard yesterday at our hearing, is that there is a \nconflict of interest too often between what was in Goldman's interest--\nwhat was good for their bottom line--and what was in their clients' \nbest interest.\n  These are deeply troubling findings. There not only was a collapse of \na housing market, there was a collapse of values. Extreme greed is the \nthread that connects these events, starting with those mortgages that \nwere sold out there in the State of Washington by Washington Mutual \nBank; extreme greed that indeed involved the people who were supposed \nto be doing the credit rating, being paid and doing a lousy job of \nrating the financial instruments that pension funds and others they \nwere buying, and the greed, of course, that was involved in Wall Street \nselling securitizing financial instruments which they believed were not \ngood and that they were betting against at the same time they were \nselling them to their clients and customers.\n  What we have to do is build defenses against these kinds of excesses. \nI think most of us at the hearing--Democratic and Republican Senators \non the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations--saw the problems right \nfrom the beginning, upstream where the mortgages were created and \ndownstream where they landed in Wall Street securities. We see the \nproblems and Americans see the problems. We cannot understand, and \nAmericans cannot understand, how a company can design and build a \nproduct and sell that product to its clients while at the same time \nthey are betting that product will fail. It runs contrary to common \nsense--a kind of common ethics.\n  If you are going to sell somebody a pair of shoes, and you know or \nbelieve that pair of shoes is defective and you bet against that pair \nof shoes so that your profit is not just the profit you would make on \nthe immediate sale of that pair of shoes, but when the pair of shoes \nfails there is, in some way, a profit that comes to you as well. When \nyou are betting on the failure of the product and will make money from \nthat bet when that product fails, most Americans, and I think most \nmembers of the committee--hopefully, maybe all of us--would say to \nourselves: That kind of conflict of interest has got to be stopped.\n  That is not what the Wall Street folks were telling us yesterday is \n``making a market,'' where you have someone who comes in and wants to \nsell something and somebody who wants to buy something and they are put \ntogether. That is ``making a market''--bringing a buyer and a seller \ntogether.\n  This is where the firm--the entity that is going to be benefitting is \non one side of the deal--and that entity was Goldman Sachs. They \nactually, in some of these deals, were taking securities from their own \ninventory that they wanted to get rid of, packaging them into a \nfinancial instrument and selling that instrument to their customers. So \nfar, so good, providing they disclose it is their own product they are \nselling. That is okay. But then they take what they call a short \nposition. They take a bet. They make a bet against the very instrument \nthey put together to sell to their customers.\n  That, to me, is incredible. They also are engaged--and a lot of \npeople are engaged--in what we call these credit default swaps, which \nare nothing more than casino bets as to whether something will happen; \nwhere, for instance, people are betting that a particular stock will go \nup or down. Neither party owns the stock, if it is a so-called \nsynthetic default swap. I bet that stock will go up, you bet it will go \ndown. That is okay; if people want to bet on that, let them bet. But \nwhen the government ends up paying the winning bettor, now you have a \nproblem. Where the company that is making those bets, or insuring those \nbets, as it was called in the case of AIG--supposed to be insuring \nthose bets--is too big to fail--they have insured so many bets for so \nmany companies and so many pension funds that if that private company \nfails, the economy is going to be terribly damaged as a result and we \nend up, as taxpayers, paying off those bets--that has got to be stopped \nas well. These are casino bets and we shouldn't be paying them.\n  I yield myself 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now, throughout these hearings we see a lack of \naccountability. Executives of Washington Mutual make the reckless \nmortgage loans--not held accountable. Executives at Goldman Sachs and \ntheir company packaged many of these same loans that were toxic \nsecurities and then took a conflict-of-interest position on it--no \naccountability. Regulators, credit rating agencies that were supposed \nto check these excesses--no accountability. In each case, the senior \nleaders managed to avoid responsibility for their contribution to a \ncrisis which has caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs or \ntheir homes or their businesses.\n  Others may fail to take responsibility for their actions, but we must \nexercise our accountability. We must act. I do not understand our \nRepublican colleagues, knowing what they know about the crisis, knowing \nthere is no real regulator on the beat on Wall Street, can vote against \nbeginning a debate. We don't have a cop on the beat on Wall Street. We \nneed a regulator there. We need credit rating agencies not involved in \nconflicts of interest which are inherent to the way they are now being \npaid. We need a banking regulator which acts; one that doesn't just \nobserve and watch things going off track but acts, and has a \nresponsibility to act as well.\n  The Dodd bill takes very significant steps relative to each of these \nareas. Whether it is the banking area, the regulator area, the credit \nrating area, there are some critical steps that are taken in the Dodd \nbill. There are some people who say they do not like portions of the \nDodd bill. Okay, bring the bill to the floor and let's debate it. Let's \nlegislate.\n  The legislative process is supposed to involve, sooner or later, a \nbill which comes to the floor and then is open to amendment and then \ndebate. There are a lot of areas in this bill that can be strengthened. \nThere are some areas in the bill that some people don't like and wish \nto strike. We have been on this bill now in committees of jurisdiction \nfor months. There have been hearings in those committees. I think we \nknow what the issues are.\n\n  There is no agreement on the resolution of this. There is no \nunanimous consent, obviously, as to exactly what reform should be put \nin place and how that should be written. But we can't always operate in \nthe middle of a crisis by unanimous consent. At some point, where there \nare differences, we have to bring those difference to the floor and \ndebate them and offer amendments on them and vote them up or down. That \nis our responsibility. It is not responsible--it is irresponsible--to \nblock that process from taking place.\n  I think almost all of us say that we want reforms. But there are \nenough of\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nus who say we are not going to allow this to be debated unless we get \nour way that this has been stymied. The reform process has been \nthwarted by a filibuster here. It is wrong. And the remedies that are \noffered and can be debated and can be amended are essential to avoid a \nrepeat of this disaster. These are complex issues. We all know that. \nBut there has been a huge amount of debate, attention, and analysis on \nthese issues. There are going to be differences on these issues, but \nthe place to resolve differences finally is here on the floor.\n  Often we can resolve them before we get to the floor. Fine. But to \nstop a legislative process from taking place, it seems to me, is an \nirresponsible act when we are in the middle of a crisis and where the \npeople of the United States want confidence that their legislators are \naddressing this crisis. So I would hope our Republican colleagues will \nallow this bill to come to the floor and to offer amendments.\n  There are many amendments that are going to be offered. Senator \nMerkley and I have an amendment which we believe will strengthen the \nbill, to give one example. That amendment has not yet been ``worked \nout'' with the sponsors of the bill. Hopefully, we can get them to \nagree to language which will allow for a stronger step to be taken in \nan area which we think involves a serious conflict of interest. But if \nwe can't ``work it out in advance,'' okay. There is such a thing called \nan amendment. It is part of our rule book. You can offer amendments if \nyou want to. You can't always work out things in a back room somewhere. \nI don't want to denigrate working out problems. I try to do it all the \ntime, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I don't denigrate \nthat process of working things out in advance. Lord knows, we work out \nmost things in advance. But with a threat of this size, which requires \nus to act, and where there has been a good-faith effort to come to some \nkind of agreement in advance that proves not to be possible, for \nheaven's sake we have to legislate. We have to have an ability to move \nto the floor with a bill and to go through the legislative process with \nit. That is what has been thwarted. That is what has been denied us \nbecause we don't have 60 votes.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues will see the importance of this \nissue, the essential need for reform, and allow this bill to come to \nthe floor and be legislated upon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Louisiana yield for a question, \nvery briefly?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator how long he expects to hold \nthe floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would expect to hold the floor for 14 minutes, at the \nleast.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from the Louisiana I be recognized for 15 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to strongly agree with Chairman \nLevin that what we have heard in many of these hearings regarding \nGoldman Sachs' activity and others is extremely disturbing--\noutrageous--and I don't support that activity in any way, shape, or \nform. I think I have a lot of credibility saying that, because back in \nthe fall of 2008, I didn't support huge taxpayer bailouts to Goldman \nSachs and the other megafirms. I opposed those taxpayer bailouts. I \nthought it was wrong and counterproductive and moving us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  But I have to disagree with the distinguished chairman that the \npresent version of the Dodd bill fixes these key issues. I don't think \nit does. So I encourage us to have a true bipartisan bill that can come \nto the floor to address the problems that exist.\n  I have three major sets of concerns about the Dodd bill in its \npresent form. The first is very fundamental. It goes exactly to what I \nwas talking about, having opposed all the bailouts. The Dodd bill \nexpands too big to fail. It doesn't end it. The Dodd bill ensures \nfuture bailouts; it does not stop bailouts. That is a big problem to me \nand I believe to American taxpayers.\n\n  It is not just me saying this. It is many educated folks. Take Time \nmagazine, not exactly an arch-conservative publication. They have \nreported:\n\n       Policy experts and economists from both ends of the \n     political spectrum say the bill does little to end the \n     problem of banks becoming so big that the Government is \n     forced to bail them out when they stumble. Some say the \n     proposed financial reform may even make the problem worse.\n\n  Also, Jeffrey Lacker--he is the President of the Richmond Federal \nReserve Board--agrees with that. In a CNBC interview, CNBC asked him: \n``Doesn't the Dodd bill allow for winding down failed institutions?'' \nAnd Lacker said: ``It allows those things but it does not require \nthem.''\n  Let me repeat that because that goes to the heart of the problem:\n\n       It allows those things but it does not require them. \n     Moreover, it provides tremendous discretion for the Treasury \n     and FDIC to use that fund to buy assets from the failed firm, \n     to guarantee liabilities of the failed firm, to buy \n     liabilities of the failed firm. They can support creditors in \n     the failed firm. They have a tremendous amount of discretion.\n\n  Again, they have the ability for more bailouts, for continued pumping \nof taxpayer dollars into failed firms.\n  William Isaac is a respected former Chairman of the FDIC. He agrees.\n\n       Nearly all of our political leaders agree that we must \n     banish the ``too big to fail'' doctrine in banking, but \n     neither the financial reform bill approved in the House nor \n     the bill promoted by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman \n     Chris Dodd will eliminate it.\n\n  Simon Johnson, distinguished MIT professor, put it succinctly:\n\n       Too big to fail is opposed by the right and the left, \n     though not, apparently, by the people drafting legislation.\n\n  These are specific ways the Dodd bill actually expands too big to \nfail, specific authorities, specific sections that clearly do that. A \nlot of the attention has been paid recently to the $50 billion prepaid \nfund, and that is problematic in my mind. But that is not the only, not \neven the most problematic section of the bill that expands too big to \nfail. All these sections go directly to that issue.\n  My second main objection to the bill is, the bill also creates an \nall-powerful superbureaucracy that goes well beyond the need for \ntargeted regulation to prevent what has happened in the last 5 years. \nAgain, these are specific sections that create this huge, new, all-\npowerful superbureaucracy. One of the most worrisome is section 1081. \nThat subjects anybody, any business that accepts four installment \npayments to the CFPB, the new superbureaucracy.\n  That is not just Goldman Sachs. That is not just Citigroup, Bank of \nAmerica. That is my family's orthodontist. That is my neighborhood \nstore that sells electronic equipment. That is a huge coverage \naffecting millions of small businesses throughout America.\n  Imagine, anybody who accepts four installment payments--is that the \nproblem actor we are going after? This is a huge overreach, in terms of \nFederal regulation, and this is a fundamental problem with the bill.\n  Finally, the third major problem with the bill is, the present \nversion of the Dodd bill does nothing to fix certain key causes of the \ncrisis. What do I mean by that? It does nothing on Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac; a 1,100-page bill, supposedly comprehensive financial \nregulatory reform. Yet the four words ``Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac'' are \nnowhere in those 1,100 pages. This was not the only cause of the \ncrisis, but this clearly, admittedly, was a key cause of the crisis--\ndisastrous policy and administration at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As \nLawrence White, distinguished economics professor, has said:\n\n       The silence on Fannie and Freddie is deafening. How can \n     they look at themselves in the mirror every morning thinking \n     that they have a regulatory reform bill and they are totally \n     silent on Fannie and Freddie? It just boggles my mind.\n\n  It boggles my mind as well.\n  Also, there is nothing on lending standards. Clearly, one of the \nfundamental problems that caused the financial crisis is institutions \nwhich lent money, subprime loans, with no meaningful standards. What \nare the new standards we are enacting, putting into this bill? \nAbsolutely nothing--silence on lending standards, underwriting \nstandards. Clearly, that was a huge part of the last crisis.\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\n  Where is the change? These are the top firms that got bailout funds, \nincluding Goldman Sachs. I voted against all these bailouts. But these \nare the firms that got them.\n  These are the billions of taxpayer dollars that they received. This \nis their old regulator, the Federal Reserve, and this is the brave new \nworld this Dodd bill will be introducing--exactly, precisely the same \nregulator. Where is the change?\n  We need meaningful financial reform, but we need it targeted on the \nproblem. We need it to include all the causes of the problem.\n  These are key principles that would mean permanently ending bailouts \nand too big to fail. I fought against the bailouts a few years ago. We \ncannot continue that policy. We need to end it.\n  Ending all bailout authorities for the Federal Reserve and FDIC. It \nis not good enough to say we have a new resolution mechanism. If those \nbailout authorities continue as they do in the Dodd bill, they will be \nused again.\n  Enhanced consumer protection without overreach, without creating this \nnew all-powerful superbureaucracy.\n  Greater transparency for derivatives, while allowing businesses to \nproperly, legitimately manage risk.\n  Begin addressing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Again, the current Dodd \nbill does not include four words, ``Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.''\n  Establish minimum lending standards for mortgages. We had subprimes \nwith no underwriting standards, no lending standards. This present Dodd \nbill does not change that. We must change that.\n  Increase competition for credit rating agencies. They were clearly \npart of the last crisis.\n  Improve coordination and communication among all financial Federal \nregulators.\n  These are the principles of strong regulatory reform. I hope these \nare the principles around which we can come together in a bipartisan \nway. I certainly support that effort by Richard Shelby and Chairman \nDodd. I encourage that effort. But those negotiations will not be \nmeaningful unless we demand on the Senate floor that they be meaningful \nand demand that a bill moving to the Senate floor is true reform and a \nbipartisan approach. I urge that approach. I enthusiastically support \nthat approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in about 1 hour, the Senate will convene \nfor a vote. It is one of the few times this week that the Senate comes \ntogether. Those who are following our proceedings will see Senators \nfrom all over the United States gather on the floor of the Senate. That \ngathering will be for a crucial vote as to whether the Republican \nfilibuster on Wall Street reform will continue or end. This will be the \nthird time this week we have given the Republicans an opportunity to \njoin us in a bipartisan effort to bring real reform to Wall Street and \nthe big banks on Wall Street.\n  Twice now we have failed to get a single Republican who will stand \nand vote with us for Wall Street reform. I don't understand it. \nCertainly, they understand what we have been through as a nation with \nthis recession. They realize that some $16 trillion of value has been \nyanked out of our economy, yanked out of savings accounts and 401(k)s \nand out of business ledgers. They know what has happened when \nbusinesses have failed and millions of Americans are out of work and \nthey realize the root cause of this was on Wall Street, with some of \ntheir dealings that, frankly, were outrageous, and now we are trying to \nchange them. Yet we have failed to come up with one Republican Senator \nwho will vote to begin the debate on Wall Street reform--not one.\n  A colleague of mine analyzed what Wall Street is doing to lobby \nagainst this bill. He took the amount of money that Wall Street banks \nand financial institutions are paying their lobbyists on Capitol Hill \nand divided it and came up with a number. They are spending $120,000 a \nday to stop Wall Street reform--$120,000 a day, 2 to 2\\1/2\\ times the \naverage income of an American, the Wall Street banks are spending each \nday to stop this bill.\n  So far they have been successful. They have convinced every \nRepublican Senator to vote against beginning the debate on this bill. \nThey have convinced every Republican Senator to vote to continue the \nfilibuster because the Wall Street lobbyists know that if this bill \ndoesn't come to the floor, they are not going to have to change their \nways. They can keep doing what they have done for so long and they do \nnot have to face any new laws, any new oversight, any new regulation.\n  Of course, the American people know what has happened too. They saw \nthe hearings yesterday. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, who was just on \nthe floor, presided over the Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations \nof the Committee on Homeland Security. Carl Levin told me he had worked \nfor 16 months in preparation for that hearing, trying to understand the \ncomplexity of Wall Street and how it works. He brought in the highest \nexecutives from Goldman Sachs and asked them point blank to explain \nwhat they had been doing. We saw it on television, last night and this \nmorning.\n  When the men who were called before him, who have literally made \nmillions of dollars out of this investment scheme, were asked to \nexplain it--something as basic as this--how could they sell a product \nto a consumer at Goldman Sachs without disclosing that Goldman Sachs \nwas betting that consumer would lose money, that is what happened. They \nwere so-called shorting the market, meaning they were betting huge sums \nof money that the investment they were selling to their customers was \ngoing to fail. These men sat before that committee and said that is \nbusiness. That is how we do business.\n  That is the sort of thing that has to come to an end in this country. \nThere is a man by the name of Paul Krugman, who writes for the New York \nTimes. He wrote an article about what happened at Goldman Sachs, which \nled to their investigation as well as charges that have been lodged \nagainst them. I would like to read from this article, from April 19 of \nthis year, where Mr. Krugman says:\n\n       We've known for some time that Goldman Sachs and other \n     firms marketed mortgage-backed securities even as they sought \n     to make profits by betting that such securities would plunge \n     in value. This practice, however, while arguably \n     reprehensible, wasn't illegal. But now the S.E.C. is charging \n     that Goldman created and marketed securities that were \n     deliberately designed to fail, so that an important client \n     could make money off that failure.\n\n  Krugman writes, ``That's what I would call looting.''\n  He goes on to say, this legislation we are considering contains \nconsumer financial protection, the strongest law in the history of the \nUnited States. Here is what Krugman writes:\n\n       For one thing, an independent consumer protection bureau \n     could have helped limit predatory lending. Another provision \n     in the proposed Senate bill,--\n\n  Which is before us, being filibustered by the Republicans--\n\n     requiring that lenders retain 5 percent of the value of loans \n     they make, would have limited the practice of making bad \n     loans and quickly selling them off to unwary investors.\n\n  He goes on to write:\n\n       The main moral you should draw from the charges against \n     Goldman, though, doesn't involve the fine print of reform; it \n     involves the urgent need to change Wall Street.\n\n  Listening to financial industrial lobbyists and the Republican \npoliticians who have been huddling with them, you would think that \neverything will be fine as long as the Federal Government promises not \nto do any more bailouts. But that is totally wrong, not just because no \nsuch promise would be credible, but the fact is that much of the \nfinancial industry has become a racket, a game in which a handful of \npeople are lavishly paid to mislead and exploit consumers and \ninvestors. If we do not lower the boom on those practices, the racket \nwill just go on.\n  Every day that the Republican filibuster of Wall Street reform \ncontinues is another day that we will fail to take into consideration \nthis bill, this Financial Stability Act, which is pending before the \nSenate. Each day that the Republican filibuster continues is a victory \nfor the Wall Street lobbyists. That is just wrong. Have we learned \nnothing from the recession we are in? Have we learned nothing from the \nhearing yesterday where these men, these multimillionaires who pay \nthemselves lavishly sat and said they thought it was\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nperfectly acceptable to sell a product to one of their customers that \nthey were betting would fail with their own money? They think that is \njust fine. It is part of the casino they run on Wall Street.\n  Well, John Ensign of Nevada took exception to that and said: That \ngives Las Vegas casinos a bad name because we deal with things \nhonestly, and people know the odds are against them. It is not like the \nsituation on Wall Street where people are misled into believing they \nare making a good bet when the house is betting against them. And that \nis what happened at Goldman Sachs. That is the sort of thing that will \ncome to an end.\n  What this bill does is it holds Wall Street accountable. We are \nfighting to hold them accountable for the reckless gambling that led to \nour recession and the loss of 8 million jobs in America--8 million. \nThere are 8 million families affected by these activities on Wall \nStreet, and the Republican filibuster would stop us from even \nconsidering changes to the regulation and oversight of Wall Street \nactivities.\n  We want to end taxpayer bailouts for good. I listened to the \ncriticism of this bill. I try to draw an analogy which I heard Senator \nMenendez of New Jersey use. What we try to do in this bill is to \ncreate, for lack of a better term, under Senator Menendez's analysis, a \nprepaid burial plan. What it basically means is that if your company--\nfinancial institution--is going to go out of business, we want to make \nsure we have put enough money in the bank to pay for funeral expenses--\nliterally the winding down and liquidation of the company--because we \ndon't want the American taxpayer to do it. So this bill creates a so-\ncalled prepaid corporate funeral fund and says, let the banks \nthemselves fund it so the taxpayers do not have to. I think that is \nreasonable.\n  The Republican approach, though, is to say: Well, let's just bet \nthere is enough money left in the estate to pay for the funeral. Maybe \nthere will be and maybe there will not be. In that case, the taxpayers \nare on the hook again. That is not a good outcome. So trying to create \nsome assurance that there is money to liquidate and wind down these \nfinancial institutions protects taxpayers from another bailout. The \nRepublicans object to that, but they have not come up with a better \nsolution.\n  The third thing we want to do is to put commerce and consumers in \ncontrol in America. I do not have to remind most people, if you open a \nbank account, if you enter into a mortgage, if you decide to sign up \nfor a credit card, go off to buy an automobile, sign up for a student \nloan, sign up for a retirement plan, they usually send you some legal \ndocuments along the way.\n  At a real estate closing--I have been to many as a consumer and a \nlawyer--they give you a stack of papers and you sit there at the bank, \nwith your spouse nearby, signing these papers, one after the other \nafter the other, until after 20 or 30 minutes it is all over, they hand \nyou the keys, and you head on out to see your new house. Well, most \npeople do not know what is in those papers. Even if a lawyer is sitting \nat the table with them, it is unlikely that they have parsed every \nsingle word. As a result, a lot of people end up signing up for things \nthey did not understand. We want to change that. I do not think it is \ntoo much to ask that these financial obligations and instruments be in \nplain English so the average person knows what they are getting into.\n  What we want to do in this bill is to empower consumers so that you \ncan make the right choice for yourself, your family, your business, and \nyour future. We do not want you to fall victim to the tricks and traps \nof the latest little turn of a phrase that can turn your world upside \ndown. That is why the consumer financial protection law is included in \nthis bill. It is the strongest consumer financial protection law in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  There are lobbyists lined up outside this Chamber trying to carve out \nexceptions. They are trying to argue: Wait a minute, we do not want \nthis to apply to pawn brokers; let's give them a pass. We do not want \nthis to apply to casinos; let's give them a pass. We do not want this \nto apply to automobile companies, auto agencies; let's give them a \npass. They want to have loopholes and carve-outs for the favorite \nindustries they represent.\n  I was at the airport coming out here this week, and one of these \nfolks, a good, local businessman in the suburbs of Chicago, came up and \nsaid: I am an honest businessman. I did not cause the recession. I have \nnever had a problem in my life. People do not complain about me. The \nBetter Business Bureau gives me the highest of marks. Why should I be \nregulated? Why should the government look at what I am doing?\n  And I said to him: If you are doing everything you said, you should \nnot worry about it. What you ought to worry about is your competitor \ndown the street who is fleecing people and giving folks in your \nindustry a bad name.\n  These carve-outs and these changes--and they have been arguing for \nthem all morning on the Republican side of the aisle--are the reason \nthey are holding up the bill. They have promised the lobbyists that \nthey will cut out loopholes in this bill for the special interest \ngroups that are represented by them. They would exempt the automobile \ndealers, some of them would exempt the home loan industry, and some of \nthem would exempt pawn brokers. The exemptions could be as long as your \narm, exemptions as long as the list of lobbyists who are trying to push \nthese loopholes.\n  I don't think that is a good outcome. I don't believe we should be \ncreating lobbyist loopholes in this law. Let's hold everyone to the \nsame legal standard, a good-faith standard of real disclosure and \nhonest dealings with consumers; clear English language whether you are \ntaking out a credit card, buying a car, buying a home, a student loan, \nor a retirement benefit for the rest of your life. Shouldn't the \nlanguage be clear? We have to make that clear as part of this.\n  At some point, I hope the Republicans who are filibustering this Wall \nStreet reform will decide, if they have a good cause and they want to \nbring it to the floor, that they can open the debate, provide their \nside of the story, and urge the Members of the Senate to go along with \nthem. If a majority agrees, it will be in the bill. If not, it will be \noutside the bill.\n  If that sounds vaguely familiar, like the Senate you read about when \nyou were going to school, it is. It is what we are supposed to be \ndoing. This is not supposed to be an empty Chamber of desks here \nwaiting as we launch day to day another filibuster vote. Ninety-nine \nSenators are supposed to be out here with me in heated debate over the \nbiggest financial issue of our generation. Instead, the Republicans \ncontinue to filibuster, stop the debate, refuse to go to amendments, \nrefuse to take their special pleadings on what they want to achieve in \nthis bill to the court of public opinion. That is not fair, and it is \nnot right.\n  It is also interesting, when we were in the middle of the health care \ndebate, how many times those on the other side of the aisle stood up \nand said: Do you know what the problem is here? The Democrats are \ntrying to write this bill behind closed doors. They will not bring it \nout to the floor of the Senate.\n  Now fast forward to the current debate. What are the Republicans \nsaying? You know what the problem is here--the Democrats refuse to \nchange this bill behind closed doors. They want to amend it right here \non the Senate floor.\n  It seems to me they are in an inconsistent position.\n  If they believe these amendments are good amendments, they should not \nbe afraid to offer them in front of the American people. But if they \nwant to cook a deal behind closed doors, I do have some problems with \nthat. If they have a good cause, they should bring it to the floor and \ndeal with it. Shady institutions are not good for this country and \nsunlight is good, transparency is good. I believe it is time we stand \nup for the American people and say that reckless gambling on Wall \nStreet with the future of the American economy is absolutely \nunacceptable.\n  Some of them argue: Well, let's go after the biggest financial \ninstitutions. Let's not blame the little people who are involved in the \ncredit business.\n  There was an article in the New York Times on Sunday, April 18, by \nJim Dwyer. He was talking about credit card companies turning $2.50 \nslices of pizza into a $37.50 slice. They did it, of course, when they \nbought a slice of pizza with a debit card that was over\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\nthe limit and the penalty was $35. The question on that fee was, Were \nthe people notified ahead of time what they were going to face? I don't \nthink it is unfair to notify people what they have to pay. I believe \nthis kind of disclosure is important to confidence in our economy.\n  I am urging my colleagues to stand and join us in making sure we have \na chance to bring this bill to the floor. In less than 1 hour, this \nempty floor will be filled with Senators, Democrats and Republicans. We \nneed 60 Senators to step up and say: This recession has taught us a \nlesson. We are not going to let America go through this again because \nof the greed and malpractice of those in Wall Street and financial \ninstitutions. We are going to change the system. We are going to \nrequire them to be more transparent, more accountable, to put their own \nmoney on the table, and to be honest with their customers. We are going \nto require financial institutions to make full disclosure to the people \nthey deal with so that those customers can be empowered to make the \nright decisions for themselves and their families. We are not going to \nexclude certain businesses in America and say they can do whatever they \nlike when what is at stake is the financial security of a family.\n  Everybody is going to be held to the same basic standard of honesty, \na standard which good businesses live up to every single day. I urge \nthe good businesses across America not to stand in defense of the \nbottom feeders. I urge them to stand up for good business practices \nwhich are part of the free market system and have made our Nation so \nstrong as the entrepreneurial spirit has blossomed into more jobs and \neconomic growth. That spirit needs to be regained, the confidence needs \nbe regained.\n  The embarrassing chapter yesterday in the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity, when these Wall Street titans came in and said they saw \nnothing wrong with misleading their customers into millions of dollars \nof losses, has to come to an end. It will only end when the Republican \nfilibuster ends on the floor of the Senate.\n  I will hope at 12:20 when this vote begins that at least a handful of \nRepublicans will stand up and say: Enough is enough. Let's move forward \nwith reform. Let's move forward to putting the American economy back on \ntrack.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3217, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 3217, a bill \n     to promote the financial stability of the United States by \n     improving accountability and transparency in the financial \n     system, to end ``too big to fail,'' to protect the American \n     taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from \n     abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:20 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yesterday, in the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations, chaired by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nMr. Levin, we learned more about the reckless actions of traders and \nexecutives at Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs was hardly the only bad \nactor in bringing our financial system to the brink of collapse in \n2008. Traders and executives at many other financial institutions got \nfabulously wealthy by gaming the unregulated casinos on Wall Street. \nThey walked away with fortunes, even as millions of Americans lost \ntheir jobs, their savings, and their homes.\n  Yet as we witnessed in yesterday's hearing, Wall Street remains quite \narrogant and quite unrepentant and quite unwilling to change its ways. \nIt has the gall to believe it should remain free to do business as \nusual. To that end, I am told it has mobilized a legion of lobbyists--\nan estimated 1,500 of them; 15 lobbyists for every Senator--to try to \nkill or water down, stop this financial regulation reform from coming \nto the floor.\n  It is deeply unfortunate that every one of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle--every single Republican--has joined with Wall \nStreet in obstructing this legislation--every single Republican not \njust filibustering the bill but preventing it from even coming to the \nfloor for debate and amendment.\n  They keep saying they want to improve the bill. Well, is that not \nwhat the debate and amendment process is about? If someone has a better \nidea, offer it as an amendment. Let's debate it. Maybe it is a better \nidea. Maybe we will adopt it; maybe we will not. But it seems that is \nthe way we ought to be conducting the Nation's business on the Senate \nfloor.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues, Senator Dodd and Senator \nLincoln have bent over backwards to consult with them and invite \nbipartisan cooperation. Their good-faith efforts have produced solid, \ncommonsense legislation. But if people on the other side of the aisle \nwant some changes, that is what the amendment process is for. We are \nnot cutting off anyone. It will be open for amendment. Why are the \nRepublicans so afraid of offering amendments on the Senate floor if \nthey have a better idea on how we should do this?\n  It is a bitter irony that, even as we spent a fortune in taxpayer \ndollars to rescue the global financial system, the self-appointed \nmasters of the universe on Wall Street rewarded themselves with \nbillions in bonuses and have geared up to fight the efforts to \nprevent--to prevent--this from happening again.\n  Well, it seems Wall Street is all too used to living a different \nlife, playing by different rules than the rest of the country. Nowhere \nis this disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street more stark than \nin the area of compensation. Over the last decades, compensation in the \nfinancial sector has skyrocketed, with some executives walking away \nwith annual compensation of hundreds of millions of dollars, even as \nthe inflation-adjusted incomes of ordinary working Americans have \nremained stagnant.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber traces the financial industry \nprofits as a share of domestic profits since 1948.\n  From 1948 to about 1980, as you can see, it remained fairly stable, \nbetween 8 percent and 18 percent. Think about everything in this \ncountry, all the profits made. About 8 percent to 18 percent was taken \nby the financial sector on Wall Street. But starting in 1984, financial \nprofits began to rise dramatically. We can see it on the chart, going \nway up.\n  In 2001, financial industry profits were almost 45 percent of all \ndomestic profits in America--almost half; 45 percent--up from about 8 \npercent to 18 percent. Today, despite the 2008 meltdown, they are back \nabove 35 percent. So 35 percent of all the profits made in America are \ngoing to Wall Street, going to the financial sector. This is a \nconcentration of wealth unprecedented in our history.\n  This second chart I have in the Chamber contrasts this explosion of \nwealth on Wall Street to what happened to ordinary Americans on Main \nStreet. From 1990 to 2008, real median household income stagnated at \nabout $50,000 per year. It just stagnated. Since 2000, real median \nhousehold income has actually fallen.\n  From 2000 to today, real median household income has stagnated and \nhas actually fallen from where it was. We had a steady increase over \nthe years. Then, since 1990, it stagnated. Since 2000, it has fallen. \nThat is what is happening to the average household in America, the \nmedian household in America.\n  Well, let's see what was happening to our friends on Wall Street \nthen.\n  Just as median household income was stagnating from about 1990 on, \nlook what happened to the average Wall Street bonus--huge. Wall Street\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\ncompensation skyrocketed nearly 300 percent during this period of time. \nSince 1990, the average Wall Street bonus--I am not even talking about \nsalaries; I am just talking about bonuses--soared from just under \n$50,000 in the early 1990s to more than $200,000 in 2006.\n  Now, go out and talk to our constituents, go out and talk to the Main \nStreet businesspeople who run our shops, and talk to anybody out in \nAmerica today. Did their income increase 300 percent during that period \nof time? No; it stayed level. But look at the bonuses--and that is just \nthe bonuses. I am not even talking about their salaries. These are \nbonuses.\n  Well, I dwell on this and point this out because I think it points to \na larger issue. In my view, a big reason for the financial collapse of \n2008 is that things got out of balance and they got out of whack. As \nGlass-Steagall was repealed--and I might say this forthrightly--there \nwere eight Senators on this floor who voted against the repeal of \nGlass-Steagall. I am proud to say I was one of them. I remember at that \ntime saying: Wait a minute, there is a reason in the 1930s, under \nPresident Roosevelt, we did not want to have this happening again.\n  So we said to commercial banks: If you want to be a bank and take \nbank deposits, fine; you can be a bank. But you cannot do insurance and \nyou cannot do investments. You cannot do swaps and derivatives and all \nthat kind of stuff. You are a commercial bank, and for that we give you \nFDIC protection. We also give you Federal Reserve protection.\n  We said to insurance companies: If you want to be insurance \ncompanies, fine; but you cannot be a bank. We said to investment \nhouses: If you want to take money in to invest, fine; that is your \ndeal. But you cannot take deposits. You are not a depository bank, and \nyou do not get the protections of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve.\n  Well, in 1999, this Congress repealed that, and allowed them all to \ncome together. I said at the time--and the record will show I said it--\nI hope it does not happen. I hope all these smart people know what they \nare doing, but I do not trust them. I do not trust them because we are \ngoing to start having a lot of funny games playing. In the last 10 \nyears, we saw the games they played.\n  Well, after Glass-Steagall was repealed, the special interests \nattacked the very idea of government regulation. The SEC and other \nwatchdog agencies failed to regulate and Wall Street stepped into the \nvoid. And they just drove our economy off a cliff, and ordinary, hard-\nworking Americans had to pick up the tab. That is why we need this \nserious financial reform.\n  As others have noted--and I say again--financial crises in this \ncountry should not be looked upon as floods that just come every 10 \nyears or some kind of natural disaster that we sort of accept; that \nevery so often we are going to have a flood or have a hurricane hit the \ncoast or we are going to have a drought someplace. Financial collapses \nthat happened in the past were not preordained kinds of happenings to \nour system. They happen because we let people run amok with large sums \nof money and gamble it.\n  So, again, to protect ourselves against floods, what do we do? Well, \nwe do a lot of upland treatment. We build dams. We build levees. We do \nall kinds of things to protect ourselves from these things. Well, there \nare some things we can do to protect ourselves from a financial \ncollapse too. It is putting into place the kinds of oversight and \ntransparency and regulations that allow our capitalist system to \noperate, but to operate within some bounds. I don't think anyone wants \nto return to the boom and bust cycle of unbridled capitalism that we \nhad in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. I don't \nthink anybody wants to go back to those days. Yes, we believe in a \ncapitalist system where people can take their savings and invest it, \nmake their money work for them, loan it out to other people so they can \nstart businesses. That is the capitalist model. But should we let \npeople take our money we have saved up for pensions, for example, or \nother kinds of investments, and go to Las Vegas? I don't think so. We \nwant some rules and regulations so they can make true investments, so \nthose investments can be used to start businesses, to invest in \neconomic growth on a broad basis, but not to be used for gross \nspeculation on Wall Street.\n\n  That is why we need this financial reform bill we are trying to get \nto the floor. It will guard against future massive meltdowns that \nalways cost us, not only money, but also in ruined lives.\n  Strong financial reform must include regulations of the derivatives \nmarket. This is something I have been involved in for a long time on \nthe Agriculture Committee, for all the years I have served, working \nwith the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. I am pleased to say \nthe legislation we are trying to bring to the floor includes the \nprovisions that passed out of the Agriculture Committee under the \nleadership of our chairman, Senator Lincoln. Derivatives contracts have \nbeen at the heart of Wall Street's financial manipulation. From \nDecember of 2000 to June of 2008, the height of the Wall Street boom, \nthe notional value of over-the-counter derivatives grew from $95 \nbillion in 2000 to $683 trillion in 2008.\n  I wish to make it clear. People say, Are you against all derivatives? \nI say, No. There are basic derivatives that can be helpful for our \neconomy and for individuals, from businesses to farmers. Farmers use \nderivatives. Businesses use them to protect against currency \nfluctuations. That is fine. These are basic derivatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, since I see no one else on the floor, I \nask unanimous consent for another 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you.\n  As I said, I have no objection to basic derivatives. It is when these \nderivatives get out of hand; it is when you have a derivative on a \nderivative on a derivative and on and on and on. That is what is \nhappening in the derivatives markets.\n  So, despite the usefulness of derivatives in certain cases, it got \nout of hand. The bill we reported out of the Agriculture Committee will \nbring all of these transactions into the light of day. No more behind \nthe scenes; derivatives would be reported to regulators in real time. \nIt would bring the vast majority of these into clearinghouses and \nexchanges. It would help to reduce the concentration of risk and \nbolster public transparency. The legislation we are trying to bring to \nthe floor that the Republicans keep blocking gets to the heart of the \ntoo-big-to-fail problem by prohibiting swaps entities from also being \ncommercial banks. A commercial bank backed by the government or the \nFDIC should not be able to use that government backing to support high-\nstakes gambling. That only magnifies the level of risk in the banking \nsystem. It is unfair to taxpayers, bank customers, and community banks.\n  I met in my office yesterday with some of the community banks in \nIowa. They don't deal in swaps and derivatives. They take deposits, \nthey loan them out for business starts, people who need a loan for \ndifferent things. They are not dealing in swaps and derivatives, so why \nshould we allow these big banks on Wall Street to do it?\n  We also need a strong, independent financial consumer protection \nagency to guard against rip-offs and abuses in mortgages, credit cards, \npayday loans, and other financial profits to protect consumers. It is \nsorely needed.\n  We also need to slam the door on too-big-to-fail financial \ninstitutions. No more AIGs or Citigroups. When companies make bets and \nlose, there ought to be a process for liquidating those companies, \nperiod.\n  To further improve the bill, I have cosponsored legislation \nintroduced by Senator Cantwell that would recreate the Great \nDepression-era regulation that prohibited the mixing of commercial \nbanks, investment banks, and insurance companies. We ought to return to \nthe Glass-Steagall law that worked well for so many years. Senator \nCantwell has been a strong leader for this, and I thank her.\n  I am also a cosponsor of the SAFE Banking Act offered by Senators \nBrown and Kaufman that would limit the size of the largest \ninstitutions. No more too big to fail.\n  In addition, I support legislation by Senators Merkley and Levin that\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\nblocks institutions that are insured by the FDIC from proprietary \ntrading with their own funds. We can't have high-risk gambling with \nmoney that is backed by the taxpayers of this country.\n  Mr. President, America has been through financial collapses and deep \neconomic downturns before. In charting the way forward, we can learn \nimportant lessons from the financial crash of 1929 that led to the \nGreat Depression. FDR answered that crisis by implementing tough new \nregulations to stabilize the financial system, rein in risk taking and \nrecklessness on Wall Street, and made the economy work for ordinary \nAmericans. Because of those reforms made in the 1930s, we had decades \nof shared economic prosperity unprecedented in our Nation's history. \nWell, what we did in the 1930s needs to be our model. Not exactly the \nsame--we have a different system--but it needs to be our model as we \nshape today's financial reform legislation. Financial reform \nlegislation ought to separate these big entities out. We can't have too \nbig to fail. We need to have transparency. We need to stop banks from \nengaging in swaps and derivatives if they are backed by the FDIC.\n  These amendments--the Cantwell amendment, the Merkley-Levin \namendment, the Brown-Kaufman amendment, and others I happen to be \nsupporting--again, we can't offer them unless we get the bill to the \nfloor. I don't know if they will win, but we ought to have the right to \noffer those amendments.\n  I wish to thank Senator Dodd. He has been at the forefront of this \nfight for a long time, trying to bring this bill to the floor, to crack \ndown on abusive speculation, to put in strong regulation, to have a \nconsumer protection agency to protect our consumers. Senator Dodd has \nled this effort. I know where his heart is. I know how he is trying to \nmake certain this system works for everybody, not just Wall Street. I \ndon't want to be on a roll of bashing Wall Street all the time. I know \nthat is a popular sport. Wall Street has a role to play in our society. \nThey surely do.\n  But, let's get Wall Street back to what Wall Street does best: \naccumulating capital and investing that capital in the economic growth \nof America. That is what the Dodd bill does. It gets us back to that \nsystem. It straightens things out and helps to protect us from these \nkinds of collapses in the future.\n  I do not understand why the Republicans will not let this bill come \nto the floor. I don't mind if they want to vote against it. If they \nwant to be on the side of keeping Wall Street speculating with \ntaxpayers' dollars and letting these banks get too big to fail, that is \ntheir right, but why not let the bill come to the floor so we can \ndebate it and amend it. If they want to change it, let them offer \namendments, but we can't do that unless we bring the bill to the floor.\n  I hope the American people understand this. I hope they understand \nthat the Republican side of the aisle will not let this bill even come \nto the floor for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 7 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for all the hard \nwork he has put into this, he and his staff and the committee. It is a \ngood bill. Again, we may not agree on every detail. There are some \nthings I would like to see in it; maybe they will, maybe they won't. It \nis a good bill, a solid bill, and it will help us get control back \nagain over Wall Street and all the wild speculations and it will help \nour country grow as it should, not in one small area, but broadly-based \neconomic growth in our country.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his great leadership on this. I hope my \nRepublican friends will understand that we have to get this bill up on \nthe floor so we can protect the American people from these financial \ncollapses that have happened over the last couple of years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time of the \nDemocratic side has expired, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't have a Republican colleague to ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for a couple of minutes. I ask unanimous consent to be \nallowed to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me first thank my friend from Iowa for his tremendous work on so \nmany issues but also his deep interest in this subject matter. \nObviously, the subject of exotic instruments--derivatives and the \nlike--is a critical issue for all of the country but particularly in \nthe farm State of Iowa where he has played a considerable role. All of \nus have a higher degree of interest in one subject matter or the other, \nbut I am grateful to him for his longstanding interest. His is not an \ninterest that emerged with the problems that spiked 18 months ago, but \ngo back 8 years. In fact, he has written legislation and held hearings \nin his former capacity as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, so he \nknows the subject well. I appreciate his kind comments about the effort \nof the Banking Committee and the effort of Blanche Lincoln, our \ncolleague from Arkansas, and the Agriculture Committee she now chairs \nand where she has been working on a very important piece of our efforts \nhere.\n  There are only a few minutes left before this vote will occur again. \nAs are most people, I am somewhat mystified. I have heard my colleagues \nover the last day or so raise issues, concerns they have with the bill. \nIt is no great shock that would be the case. That is normally what \nhappens with a bill of this size and obviously this complexity, \ncovering as much of an area as we do across the economic spectrum of \nour country. I am somewhat mystified. I understand having objections to \nparts of the bill and wanting to be heard and wanting to have an \nopportunity to change the bill, either add to it or subtract from it; \nthat is how we normally engage in the legislative process, but I can't \nvery well help on that front if I am not allowed to get to the bill.\n  This morning, the major newspapers of the country of course reported \nabout the hearings yesterday here in Washington. I don't need to say \nmuch more about it. Again, the headlines: Looking into mortgage deals \nand the like have reached a certain crescendo. Most people are probably \naware of those things.\n  There was another headline, however, that wasn't at the top of the \nnewspaper but underneath it. In this case, the local paper here in \nWashington had the headline ``Greek debt downgraded to junk.'' It says, \n``European crisis deepens. Dow falls 2 percent on global sell-off.''\n  The reason I mention that here is that obviously the Goldman Sachs \nstory was the one that got the attention, but there are problems \nemerging around the world that affect us as well. Our legislation \ndoesn't write international rules, but the United States has led, \nhistorically, in financial services. If we are unable to get a bill \npassed to change the rules, give us a greater sense of fairness and \ntransparency and protection, then we are missing an opportunity to \ncorrect what over the last number of years helped create some of the \nproblems we are now facing and then to lead globally so that other \nnations will harmonize their rules with ours so that the problems that \nexist in a Shanghai or a Greece can't affect us here.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I expect that if we get on this bill, we \nare going to be working for weeks engaging in several amendments and \nideas to try to strengthen this bill--make it better, if you will.\n  I am one of the authors of the bill. I don't claim this is a perfect \npiece of legislation. I have never seen one of those in my 30 years \nhere. Normally, you bring out a bill and do the best you can. \nObviously, others have different points of view. It would be \npresumptuous of Senator Shelby and me to suggest that we can come to \nsome great agreement here and tell everybody else that, whether you \nlike it or not, this is the deal. That is not what we get elected to do \nhere.\n  I have colleagues on my side who are sympathetic to what I have tried \nto do, but they want to change this bill. There is one amendment by my \ncolleague from Vermont, and I think it\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\nhas 33 cosponsors, two-thirds of whom are on that side of the aisle and \na third are over on this side. They ought to have the right to offer an \namendment to change this bill, which is what they want to do.\n  I am fully prepared as a manager of this product to allow that \namendment process to go forward, engage in that debate. But I cannot \nget there if you won't even allow me to bring up the bill. So the \nincongruity of complaining about the product and simultaneously saying: \nI am not going to let you vote on it, I don't know how you explain that \nto people in this country.\n  At the end of the day, if you want to vote against the bill, do so. \nIf you want to vote for or against amendments, do it. I am not \nsuggesting that anything I am offering at this juncture would preclude \nyou from that conclusion, but you cannot get to that conclusion unless \nwe have the product in front of us.\n  All we have had is a series of speeches over 3 days, denying us the \nnecessary votes in order to move effectively. In effect, a filibuster \nis ongoing here. The only way to break that is by getting 60 votes that \nwill allow us to move to the product. Fifty-seven of us have said: \nLet's get there.\n  I have said this before, and I will say it again. At this juncture, \nthis ought not to be a partisan issue. It may get partisan over some of \nthe ideas. I am fully aware that there are a number of my colleagues \nhere who believe we ought to get to this debate. We ought to get there \nsooner rather than later. That is not to suggest they agree with the \nproduct by taking that position. In fact, I suspect they don't agree \nwith at least some parts of this product. I think they understand the \nimportance of getting to a point where we can try to change this in \nsome way.\n  I will conclude. I make that appeal once more. We have been through \nthis twice already. I hate coming and getting into a partisan debate \nabout this. We should not do this. It doesn't reflect well on this \ninstitution on a matter of this import not to allow this to go forward.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 349, S. 3217, the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n         Christopher J.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I think it has been said before, but \nhere we go again. What we have just seen tells us what the American \npeople ought to know. There are fundamental questions being asked of \nSenators this week, principal of those: Whose side are you on? Whom do \nyou work for?\n  On Monday, Tuesday, and yet again today we got an answer. On the \nother side of the aisle they made it clear. They stand with the big \nbanks. They do not stand with the infrastructure of everyday people who \nmake this country the great place we have become. They do not stand for \nopportunities such as the ones that allowed Americans to come together \nafter World War II to get an education, get jobs, become the greatest \ngeneration that built our Nation into the greatest on Earth.\n  Instead, our friends across the aisle stand with Wall Street \nlobbyists who demand that we do not take up this bill. What an outrage. \nThey stand for maintaining a banking system that denies people and \nbusinesses the funds they need and sells people mortgages they cannot \nafford, while lining executives' pockets with billions in compensation. \nThe picture is quite clear. It is very obvious as to what has taken \nplace here. After hearing the demands of the Wall Street lobbyists, the \nother side of the aisle systematically marches down here and votes no \nin lockstep, not once, not twice but three times. There is no one bold \nenough to say: Yes, we ought to do something about this situation that \nhurt our economy so; that destroyed jobs, lives, and homes.\n  What the Republicans voted against three times this week was simply \nto start debating the Wall Street reform bill, to make it an even \nfairer system. The banking lobbyists may not want us to take up this \nbill, but everyday people do want reform. They do want change. They do \nwant to see capital flowing into small businesses so they can get on \nwith work and planning their families' and their children's future.\n  On behalf of the everyday people, whose side we are on, we will keep \nvoting to take up this bill until the other side understands that is \nwhat the American people want and gives them a break.\n  Some say they voted no because they wanted more time to make a deal. \nThe reality is, the American people are fed up with backroom deals that \nleave them out in the cold. We have carefully listened to testimony \nthat has been developed these days. We are shocked to find out how they \nthink hiding the deals was OK, but they didn't want it to be known to \nthe public. They want us to roll up our sleeves, talk aloud about this \nbill, tell the public the truth, vote on amendments, and pass a strong \nWall Street reform bill. That is what the average person in this \ncountry wants.\n  Why don't the banking lobbyists like our bill? There are several \nreasons: Because it puts an end to giant, taxpayer-funded bailouts by \ncreating a safe, responsible way to liquidate failing firms. They don't \nlike it because it will end the era of too big to fail and stop \nprotecting irresponsible executives who mismanaged their companies and \nbecause it will help prevent reckless gambling with investors' money by \nstarting a new consumer protection watchdog. They don't want those\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\nthings to happen. They don't like it because it moves the derivatives \nmarkets from the shadows to the sunlight so these transactions are \ntransparent, so people understand what is going on.\n  Right now across our country, ordinary Americans are facing real \ntough problems. Many struggle to find a job, meet their monthly bills. \nMany are struggling to pay for a college education. Far too many of our \npeople are unable to keep their homes from falling into foreclosure. \nThat is why we have been working so hard to reform our financial \nsystem, to make big banks accountable, and shine the light on Wall \nStreet--but not on the other side of the aisle.\n  They literally have taken their marching orders directly from Wall \nStreet. We know key Republicans met with Wall Street executives and \npolitical consultants about how to attack this bill, about not \npermitting us to exercise the responsibility we have. But it is not \nworking because we are on the side of everyday people, the people who \nsent us here. They sent us here with a plea: Help us, help us with our \nlives, help us take care of our families, help us educate our kids, \nhelp us protect ourselves when health care is required.\n  The American people have made it clear they are not fooled by the \ndelaying tactics and secret deals. They want Wall Street reformed.\n  In the last decade, we saw how much power the financial sector has \nover our entire economy. Irresponsible actions by big banks led to the \nsubprime bubble that led homes to appreciate far beyond their worth and \nled millions of Americans to take on loans for which they should never \nhave qualified.\n  The results were catastrophic and the collateral damage immense. Many \nof these people were seduced into taking loans they were advised they \ncould handle. They didn't use good judgment, but they paid a heck of a \nprice for it. Eight million jobs were lost, retirement accounts \nshriveled, and small businesses shut their doors.\n  The ethical failures of Wall Street almost brought our economy to the \nbrink of a second Great Depression. As a former CEO of a major company, \nI understand the need for a strong financial sector. But I also come to \nwork every day reminded of the millions of people who have lost their \njobs through no fault of their own.\n  Make no mistake, Wall Street reform, Wall Street change is absolutely \nnecessary, and that is why we are going to keep moving forward on this \ncritical bill. We have to continue to take our message to the American \npeople and let the other people, on the other side of the aisle, say: \nNo, no, no. Those on the other side of the aisle may try to disrupt. \nThey may try to distort. They may try to destruct. But we are going to \ncontinue the fight for ordinary Americans, for people who wake every \nmorning and play by the rules and work hard.\n  I repeat something I said a moment ago; that is, how can we ignore \nsupporting the infrastructure in our country, the people who make the \nthings happen every day, who are there to do whatever the jobs are that \nare necessary, and reserve the best and the most for those few at the \ntop? We can't do it that way. We have an infrastructure that is even \nfar more precious than our fiscal infrastructure; that is, our human \ninfrastructure. We are going to continue to tell the American people \nwhat is happening so we can make changes necessary to avoid the \ncatastrophe we have had over this last couple years.\n  Thank goodness that through the leadership of President Obama and the \nadministration and the work of colleagues we are making progress, but \nthe progress is not rapid enough nor broad enough. We are going to \ninsist on moving down the road of progress. We are going to insist on \ndoing what is right for our country and for our families and for our \nfuture. I hope somebody, someone on the other side of the political \naisle, will say: Listen, we are not getting anywhere by just walking \ndown the steps together and saying no and not permitting change to take \nplace that is critical for our society and our world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, first, I wish to make a couple comments \nabout what has just transpired on the floor of the Senate. For the \nthird time, we had a vote, not on anything relating to the ingredients \nof a bill dealing with financial reform or Wall Street reform, just on \nthe question of the motion to proceed to debate the bill. Just the \nmotion to proceed, yes or no, shall we proceed to bring the bill to the \nfloor and debate it? For the third day in a row, all the members of the \nminority voted, no, we will not even allow the Senate to proceed to \ndebate Wall Street reform.\n  It is unbelievable to me. In the shadow of yesterday's hearings, with \none of the major investment banks of this country and the disclosure of \ne-mails deep from the bowels of that bank that clearly suggested they \nwere peddling securities to clients and customers that they knew to be \nbad securities and also betting against the position of their clients, \nbetting against a recovery for our country--in the shadow of all that, \nhow on Earth can the minority decide we should not even move to debate \nWall Street reform?\n  I find it interesting we have people saying government cannot solve \nthis. There is too much government, too much this, too much that. When \nwe had suffered a Great Depression in this country, it was the Federal \nGovernment that took action to put in place some things to try to \nprotect our country's economy and did so for about 60 or 70 years. They \nsaid: We are not going to allow banks and FDIC-insured banks and \ninvestment banks and securities dealers and others to commingle under \none corporation. We are not going to take banks and put risky \nenterprises fused to those banks. It doesn't make any sense. So \nlegislation was passed to protect this country.\n  About 10 years ago, there were a bunch of smart people who decided \nthat stuff is old-fashioned. We have to compete with the Europeans, \nlet's allow holding companies to be created, and we will bring banks \nand investment banks and real estate and all these things together into \none big holding company, under one roof. It will be fine.\n  It turns out it was not fine. At the same time this was happening, \nbig holding companies now being created in which you brought risky \nthings in the middle of banking enterprises whose very perception of \nsafety and soundness is critical to their future--at the very same time \nthat was happening, we had a bunch of people come to town who were \nsupposed to be regulators, the referees, who said: You know what. We \nare going to be willfully blind. We are not going to regulate. We don't \neven like government. So do what you want. We will not watch, we will \nnot look.\n  At the same time that was going on, Alan Greenspan, at the Federal \nReserve Board, decided we will let all these institutions behave in \ntheir own self-interest, and their self-interest will be what governs \nwhat will be the right thing.\n  He now says that was a huge mistake. Yes, I guess so, probably a $15 \ntrillion mistake. But the fact is, those who were supposed to be \nregulating and decided not to regulate, those who were supposed to be \nthe referees to call the fouls, wear the striped shirts, blow the \nwhistle, call the fouls when the free market system was being abused, \nwere not around. They were out to lunch someplace for years and years \nand years.\n  My colleagues who say, well, we do not want government to do this--\nlook, I do not know who else is going to set the rules here to decide \nwe are not going to let this happen again. Does it take any amount of \nintelligence to understand a mortgage company advertising to people in \nthe following way: Do you have no credit? Slow credit? No pay? \nBankrupt? Come to us. We would like to give you a loan.\n  On the floor of the Senate, I have shown solicitation after \nsolicitation by companies that said: If you have got bad credit, slow \npay, no pay, come to us. We would like to give you a home loan. It does \nnot take a lot of intelligence to understand that does not work.\n  And by the way, they also said: If you have got bad credit, come to \nus. In fact, we will not even ask you what your income is. We will give \nyou a no-document loan. You do not have to document your income. It is \ncalled a no doc. By the way, we will give you a liar's loan. They do \nnot call it that, but a no-doc is a liar's loan.\n\n[[Page S2731]]\n\n  It does not take a genius to understand that is not working very \nwell. But why was everyone anxious to do all of that? Because you could \nwrap it into a big fat security. Then you could sell it to an \ninvestment bank. They could sell it to a hedge fund. They could sell it \nback again. And, meanwhile, whoever made the original loan got rid of \nthe liability once they sold it upstream.\n  They got the rating agencies to rate these things as triple A. \nIncidentally, conveniently, the rating agencies are paid by the very \ncompanies whose securities they rate. Sounds like trouble to me. So all \nof these things were happening, and everybody understands that is not \ngoing to hold up. Ultimately all of this is going to collapse. It is a \nhouse of cards that is being built. So how do you put this back \ntogether?\n  Well, Senator Dodd and the Banking Committee put a bill together. \nThat is the bill we are trying to get to the floor of the Senate. I \nthink it is a pretty good bill. It tightens things up. It gives \nauthorities to regulators they are going to need and will try to \nprevent this from ever happening again.\n  This was not some Hurricane Katrina that came ashore and flattened a \nbunch of buildings. This was not a volcano erupting. This was not a \ntornado that came sweeping through and destroyed the town. This was an \neconomic catastrophe that took away $15 trillion from this country. It \ndevastated a lot of families, put a lot of people out of work, a lot of \npeople out of their homes, and in the meantime we see what has \nhappened. And while there are substantial amounts of misery around this \ncountry for families and people who have still not recovered from the \ndevastation of this financial near collapse, the folks at the top are \nnow making record profits.\n  Yes, the investment bank that testified yesterday, record profits, \nbig bonuses. I described earlier bonuses of $142 billion were projected \non Wall Street. I talked about in the year 2008, at a point when this \nall began to collapse, we had something like $36 billion in losses just \non Wall Street. And those firms that had $36 billion of losses paid $17 \nbillion in bonuses to their employees.\n  I have an MBA and went to business school. There is not any book that \nteaches that in business school: Lose a ton of money and get big \nbonuses. Yet that is what has been happening. It is a carnival of greed \nat the top.\n  By the way, the instruments they created with these mortgage \nsecurities and others, securitizing almost anything they could get \ntheir hands on, with exotic titles such as credit default swaps--credit \ndefault swaps. We have always known about derivatives. I wrote an \narticle which was the cover story for the ``Washington Monthly'' \nmagazine in 1994. That is almost 16 years ago. My cover story for that \nmagazine was titled ``Very Risky Business.'' It was about the danger \nthat derivatives posed to the banking system. That is almost 16 years \nago now.\n  I made the same point in the year 1999 when Glass-Steagall was \nrepealed, and I opposed it. Very risky business. So they create \nsynthetic credit default swaps. Synthetic would be the same as calling \nit naked credit default swaps. That means, instead of having something \nat either end of a contract, there is nothing. It is two people making \na wager or a bet that something else will happen.\n  I happen to think there ought not be what is called a naked credit \ndefault swap. I think they ought to be outlawed. That is gambling. That \nis not investing. That is betting. If you want to bet, there are plenty \nof places to bet in this country, starting with Las Vegas and Atlantic \nCity. They have a business doing that. No one ought to show up on an \nairplane in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, however, with their depositors' \nmoney or with their clients' money and decide that is what they are \ngoing to wager on a craps table or a keno table.\n  Yet that is exactly what has been happening with what are called \nnaked credit default swaps. One study I have seen suggests that of the \ncredit default swaps in England, and I suspect it would hold true here, \n80 percent of them had no insurable value on the other side.\n  I would not be allowed today, this afternoon, to decide I am going to \nbuy an insurance policy on the house of the Presiding Officer in North \nCarolina. It would be illegal for me to say my interest today is to \ninvest in fire insurance on the Presiding Officer's home, because I \nhave no insurable interest in that home. And it might be that I would \nbuy fire insurance, if I could, and walk around with a box of matches. \nThat is a problem. Right? So I have no insurable interest. It would be \nagainst the law for me to buy fire insurance on the home of the \nPresiding Officer.\n  That is not the case with respect to naked credit default swaps. You \ndo not have to have an insurable interest in anything. You, with \nsomeone else, say let's make a wager here on what is going to happen to \nthis bond. There is an investment bank. Perhaps the investment bank \nwill take part of that wager. They will certainly want to arrange it \nbecause they get great big fat fees. That is not investing in America. \nThat is not making loans to small and medium-sized businesses. That is \nnot investing in America's future and strength; that is gambling. And \nthat is what we have come to.\n  You cannot, in a country such as ours, expand our economy without two \nthings: production and finance. There have been, over 200 years, times \nwhen production has the upper hand and when finance has the upper hand. \nWe have been through a period here in the last couple of decades where \nthe financing system of our country has the upper hand.\n  We need a banking system, we need a financing system, with all of the \nlevels of finance. Yes, FDIC-insured banks. Yes, investment banks, \nventure capital. We need all of those things. But we need to get back \nto the basics of the old-fashioned standard of what banking should and \nused to be; that is, taking deposits and then making loans.\n  When you make a loan, you do what is called underwriting; that is, \nyou sit across the desk from someone who needs a loan, and you look \nthem in the eye and you evaluate: What is their income? What is their \nidea; their need; their property; and you decide, yes or no. There has \nbeen no underwriting on many of those loans that helped create this \nfoundation of sand in this economy.\n  There was no underwriting. Because if you could say to someone: You \nknow what, we will give you a new home mortgage and you do not have to \npay any interest, and you do not have to pay any principal, even, and \nyou do not have to tell us what your income is--that is a no-doc liar's \nloan--we will do that for you. Why would someone do that? Because they \nare not going to have any risk. The minute they do it, they get it \nwrapped into a fat security and sell it to someone else.\n  And because the rating agencies think all of these things are triple \nA, whoever else bought it thought it was a safe security, and then they \nsold it again and again and again. You passed the risk forward. This \nwas a cesspool of greed with a lot of people making a lot of money and \ncreating a structure that was destined to fall.\n  The question is: Are we going to do something about that? Is somebody \ngoing to take some action to say that you cannot do that any more? That \nis what the Senator from Connecticut asks with a bill coming from the \nBanking Committee.\n\n  The fact is, he brought that bill out of the Banking Committee, and \nnot one Republican offered an amendment. Not one. They said, we are not \ngoing to participate. After they had had hearings for a year, and the \nSenator from Connecticut had negotiated with them for 5, 6 months, \nfollowing all of that, they had a markup on a bill to write the bill, \nand the Republicans said, we are not going to participate. We will not \noffer any suggestions, no amendments.\n  Then when the bill is now brought to the floor of the Senate, the \nRepublicans say: Well, we were not part of it. Well, sure, they decided \nthey did not want to be part of it, and that is why they were not part \nof it. That was an action they took. They say: Well, we believe this is \na bailout bill. It is not a bailout bill. I will tell them what a \nbailout bill is. I voted against it. A bailout bill was when George W. \nBush and his Treasury Secretary came to the Congress and said: I want \nyou to pass a three-page bill in the next 3 days, putting up $700 \nbillion to bail out America's biggest financial firms. Yes, that was a \nbailout bill. And most of\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nthose who called this a bailout bill voted for that. They know what a \nbailout is because they voted for it. I did not.\n  But, nonetheless, this is not a bailout bill. This is a bill that \nfinally begins to shut the door on activities that should never have \nbeen taking place. Is the bill perfect? No. Should it be changed? There \nare a number of areas where I think it will be changed once it gets to \nthe floor. But you cannot even address those unless you get past the \nmotion to proceed.\n  What the minority is doing is saying, we do not intend to let you \nproceed at all. Well, how about deciding that we are going to do this \ntogether and we will get the best of what both political parties have \nto offer, get the best amendments that can be offered. I have suggested \none; that is, naked credit default swaps. If you have no insurable \ninterest, ban them.\n  Mr. Pearlstein, who writes a column for the Washington Post, made a \nsuggestion that makes a lot of sense to me. Why would you allow more \nsecurities in the form of credit default swaps to insure bonds? Why \nwould you allow more of them than there are bonds to insure?\n  Well, the answer is obvious, because that is gambling above that \nlevel. It is very much like about a year and a half ago when the price \nof oil, or almost 2 years ago, the price of oil went to $147 a barrel \nin day trading, and I made the point on the floor: There was 20 times \nmore oil bought and sold each day than there was produced each day--an \nunbelievable orgy of speculation in the oil market. Nearly broke that \nmarket. Well, it finally came back down and the people who made the \nmoney on the upside also made money on the downside. But, you know, \nthat is what has been happening in this country now for too long.\n  The bill that should come to the floor of the Senate--and my hope is \nthat perhaps the next vote will have a couple of folks on the other \nside who agree with us, let us bring a bill to the Senate, let us \naddress these issues that caused this unbelievable avalanche of greed \non Wall Street and elsewhere, and let us tighten the reins so this \ncannot happen again.\n  Do we want to continue the practice? I showed yesterday on the floor \nof the Senate I think four examples of companies that are still \nadvertising: Do you have bad credit? Come to us. We will give you a \nloan. Do you have no credit? Slow pay? Come to us, we will give you a \nloan. Okay. Are you bankrupt? Come to us, we will give you a loan.\n  It is still going on. All of this is about securitizing everything \nand everybody making big fees and being paid big bonuses. There is a \nsmarter way to do financing and banking in this country. We have \nwatched it work for decades, and it has gotten far afield in the past \ndecade or two. We need to pull it back in and say, that is not what our \ncountry is about. The free market system is the best allocator of goods \nand services that I am aware of, but it is not perfect. Sometimes there \nare fouls in the free market system. Sometimes people try to manipulate \nit and do so successfully. That is why you need a referee and that is \nwhy you need effective regulations that work.\n  That is what the bill is about. Put together those effective \nregulations that work. Prevent this kind of economic collapse from \nhappening again. This is not just some academic exercise. There are \nsomewhere around 16 to 17 million people today in this country who woke \nup this morning and they are jobless and do not have any work. Some of \nthem not only feel jobless, but they feel helpless and hopeless because \nthey cannot find work. Some of them, by the way, have not only lost \ntheir jobs, they have lost their homes. This is a very deep recession \nwe have been in, and it has caused unbelievable pain across this \ncountry. But not for everybody. Because once again, some of the largest \nfinancial institutions in this country are now showing record profits \nand paying record bonuses.\n  The question is, are they doing that because they are making loans \nout there to businesses that are ready to recover and to expand? No. \nThe answer is, unfortunately, no. Once again they are trading \nsecurities back and forth, exchanging fees, securitizing virtually \neverything. There is a much better way to do financing and banking in \nthis country that will strengthen the future of this country. I want to \nget at the business of getting this bill to the floor, having the \nminority stop blocking us, and begin offering amendments so we can get \nthe best of what both parties have to offer.\n  It has been a long time since we have had that sort of thing happen \non the floor of the Senate. I was hoping that if there is one thing \nthat might galvanize some bipartisanship in this body, it might be an \nunderstanding of the unbelievably excruciating pain the American people \nhave felt as a result of the deepest recession since the Great \nDepression and perhaps an understanding that the American people demand \nthat this Congress stand up and do something about it, to try to do the \nthings that plug the holes and shut the gates and prevent this sort of \nthing from ever happening again. I guess that was too much to hope for, \nat least until now, on Wednesday. We will have an opportunity on \nThursday and Friday, perhaps, and I hope perhaps we can get one or two \npeople who agree with us to say: Yes, let's bring this to the floor, \nhave it wide open for amendments, offer amendments, debate amendments, \nand do what is necessary for the people.\n  I know the biggest financial institutions have some big disagreements \nwith this bill, but I have some big disagreements with them. I think \nwhat has gone on is pretty unbelievable. They have a role to play in \nthis country's future going ahead, but it is not a role I consider \nbetting; it is a role I consider to be investing. If they want to \ncontinue to simply make wagers about America and about securities, that \nis not the financing system we have known and grown to believe is \nimportant for this country's future.\n  I know there is a lot of disappointment after this last vote. My hope \nis there will be some who continue to think and rethink. Is this what \nmy constituents want? Do they want me to decide to block even the \nopportunity to address these unbelievable gaping holes in our financing \nstructure that allowed this country to be steered right into the ditch, \nthe biggest economic wreck in 70 years? I think they would understand \nthat is not what citizens and their constituents want for the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me express to my colleagues how \ndisappointed I am that we were unable to move forward with debate on \nWall Street reform. People should know that what we recently voted on \nwas a motion to proceed so a bill could be brought to the floor for \ndebate. It did not speak to how that bill would be considered. It is \nopen to amendment. Each Member of the Senate would have the opportunity \nto submit amendments for consideration.\n  The bill Senator Dodd has brought out of his committee is a bill that \nestablishes the types of reforms of Wall Street that are necessary, \nstrict new regulations to stop Wall Street gambling so that we have a \nclear responsibility in the regulatory framework, so each of the \nfinancial institutions understands the clear roles which they must \noperate under and how those regulations will take place. The framework \nis based upon the size of the institution and the jurisdiction.\n  The bill provides for adequate capital to prevent too big to fail. \nOur first goal is to avoid an institution from becoming so large, so \nvulnerable that its failure jeopardizes the economy. If we have a clear \nregulatory structure and the right capital rules and the right \nregulatory oversight, we have a much better chance of protecting the \npublic's interest. That is why the strict new guidelines to stop Wall \nStreet gambling are critically important, so that we don't run into \nthat situation from the past.\n  No more taxpayer bailouts. I hear that over and over again from my \nconstituents. I agree. If an institution can't make it, it should fail. \nIt should not be getting a government bailout.\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nThis bill makes it clear: no more government bailouts. It gives the \nregulators the authority they need to intervene a lot earlier and, if \nnecessary, to restructure the institution or to break it apart or to \nhave it merge or to close it down. It does not involve public funds. We \nwill have a regulatory structure.\n  Today, we see institutions that call themselves banks that are not \nregulated under banking statutes. We find insurance companies that \nclaim they are insurance companies but they do things other than \ninsurance and get themselves into trouble, and there is no regulatory \nconsistency. That will change with the bill Senator Dodd has brought to \nthe floor.\n  This bill puts consumers in control of information in plain English, \nby a strong consumer provision within the bill. This is absolutely \nnecessary. We know today that consumers and small businesses are being \nvictimized under the current financial structure. Consumers have been \nvictimized by predatory lending. Small businesses have been victimized \nby banks that won't make loans to small businesses. We need a strong \nconsumer presence. Senator Dodd, in his bill, has brought out an \nindependent consumer agency.\n  What this bill provides is tough regulation, the framework in which \nwe can intervene earlier in order to protect the economy, no government \nbailout, and a way in which consumer issues can be handled \nindependently to protect consumers.\n  Why not move forward? I am puzzled. I listened to my colleagues who \noppose bringing this bill forward speak on the floor. I still don't \nunderstand their argument. If we move forward, amendments are in order. \nAmendments that are germane will have to be considered, will have to be \nvoted on. Those are the rules of the Senate. For us to move the bill \noff the floor, we will need at least 60 votes. We know that. It should \nnot take it. It should be an up-or-down vote. But we know from the \nprior record that the minority will insist upon 60 votes. We should be \nwilling, on an important issue such as this, to vote up or down on \namendments and final passage, but they will still have that right. So \nthey are not jeopardizing the ability of the minority to block final \nconsideration of the bill.\n  What they are doing is blocking debate on the bill. The only thing I \ncan think of is that they would prefer to work out their issues behind \nclosed doors rather than on the floor of the Senate. The reason is kind \nof self-evident: If you are trying to weaken the regulatory framework \nand you don't want your fingerprints on it, it would be easier to do \nthat outside of the spotlight of the Chamber. If you are trying to \ndiminish the consumer protections in the bill, you certainly would \nrather have that in a bill brought to the floor than having to offer an \namendment to change it. I can only presume from the delay that the \nopposition is not to negotiate in good faith; the opposition is to \navoid the public knowing the changes they are seeking in the bill or to \nweaken this bill or, even worse, in the hopes that major sections of \nthis bill will be deleted or struck. That is not what the process \nshould be about.\n  We need to move forward with Wall Street reform. We all know how our \neconomy was brought to near the brink of destruction. We know how many \nmillions of Americans have been adversely affected by what happened on \nWall Street. People of Maryland, the people of the Nation are saying: \nLet's reform Wall Street. Let's make sure the reckless gambling doesn't \ntake place in the future. Let's make sure too big to fail ends. Let's \nmake sure those who are responsible are held accountable. The Dodd bill \nis a very good start to the process.\n  Debating the issue is what we should be doing in the Senate. The \ndelay is aimed at preventing the public from knowing what is going on \nor, even worse, weakening this bill or making sure it doesn't pass.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider. Let's move forward and debate the \nWall Street reform bill. Let's get on with the people's business first, \nour Nation's security first, our Nation's economic growth first. Let's \nbring this bill to the floor for immediate debate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2733-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2733-S2750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, since the beginning of the financial \ncrisis, the Federal Reserve, the Fed, has provided over $2 trillion in \ntaxpayer-backed loans and other financial assistance to some of the \nlargest financial institutions and corporations in the world. Let me \nrepeat that: over $2 trillion--with a ``t''--$2 trillion.\n  Over a year ago, as a member of the Budget Committee, I asked Ben \nBernanke, the Chairman of the Fed, a very simple question--very simple \nquestion; it could not be simpler--and the question, in so many words, \nwas: Mr. Bernanke, you lent out $2 trillion. Who got that money? Who \nreceived the money? What were the terms of those loans?\n  Mr. Bernanke's answer was: No; I am not going to tell you, Senator \nSanders. I am not going to tell the Budget Committee, and I am not \ngoing to tell the American people.\n  I think that is outrageous. I think when $2 trillion of taxpayers' \nmoney is placed at risk, the American people have a right to know. How \nmany debates have we had on the floor of the Senate about legislation \ndealing with $5 million, $30 million, with feverish debate--whether it \nis a good idea or a bad idea--and now you are looking at trillions of \ndollars of taxpayer money being placed at risk, and we do not know who \nreceived that. That, to me, is an outrage and that, to me, is \nunacceptable.\n  On that very day, after Ben Bernanke denied the American people the \nright to know who received those loans, I introduced legislation \nrequiring the Fed to put that information on their Web site.\n  The Presiding Officer knows as well as I do, millions of lives have \nbeen ruined by the greed, the recklessness, and the illegal behavior of \nWall Street. While the Fed was providing secret loans, at virtually no \ninterest, to some of the largest financial institutions in this \ncountry, millions of Americans were losing their jobs, their homes, \ntheir life savings, their ability to send their kids to college--as a \ndirect result of the same Wall Street firms the Fed was propping up.\n  So you have a situation where all over this country families are \nsuffering, small- and medium-sized businesses are in desperate need of \naffordable loans. Yet you have the Fed providing trillions of dollars \nto the people who caused the recession and to some of the wealthiest \nand most powerful CEOs in the country.\n  The very least we can do for the American people is to tell them, to \ngive them the information as to who got bailed out by the Fed. I do not \nthink that is too much to ask. We have to explore whether there were \nconflicts of interest. How does it work when financial institutions get \nhuge amounts of zero or near zero interest loans? Who sits on the \ncommittee? Are there conflicts of interest?\n  We have to know, for example, what I believe to be the case: that \nsome of those financial institutions that received billions in zero or \nnear zero interest loans may have invested that money in T-bills, in \nTreasury bonds, earning 3 or 4 percent interest. What kind of scam is \nthat? You get zero interest loans from the Fed, and you invest in \ngovernment-backed T bonds at 3 or 4 percent interest. That is an \nincredible scam. Did some of those financial institutions do that? I \nsuspect they did. But we do not know what they did with that money and \nwe have a right to find out.\n  Let us be very clear: The money put at risk does not belong to the \nFed. It belongs to the American people. The American people have a \nright to know where their taxpayer dollars are going. Therefore, during \nthe debate on financial reform, I will be offering an amendment to \naudit the Federal Reserve and to require that the Fed release all the \ndetails regarding the more than $2 trillion in virtually zero interest \nloans the Fed has provided to large financial institutions since the \nbeginning of the economic crisis.\n  We talk a lot around here about the need for bipartisanship or \ntripartisanship. I am an Independent.\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\nWell, this amendment does that. I do not know that there is any \namendment out there that has more bipartisan support. This amendment is \nbeing cosponsored by Senators Feingold, Leahy, Wyden, Dorgan, and \nBoxer; Democrats. It is being cosponsored by Senators DeMint, McCain, \nGrassley, Vitter, Brownback, Graham, Risch, and Wicker; Republicans. \nBut, quite significantly, on the base bill I introduced, from which \nthis amendment comes, this legislation is being supported by 32 \ncosponsors; that is, 22 Republicans and 10 Democrats, and they run the \ngamut from some of the most conservative Members of the Senate to some \nof the most progressive.\n  The Senators who are supporting the base bill are Senators Barrasso, \nBennett, Boxer, Brownback, Burr, Cardin, Chambliss, Coburn, Cochran, \nCornyn, Crapo, DeMint, Dorgan, Feingold, Graham, Grassley, Harkin, \nHatch, Hutchison, Inhofe, Isakson, Landrieu, Leahy, Lincoln, McCain, \nMurkowski, Risch, Thune, Vitter, Webb, Wicker, and Wyden.\n  That is a very broad cross-section of the Senate, from some of the \nmost conservative to some of the most progressive Members on the base \nbill, who say it is absurd that the Fed could lend out trillions of \ndollars without the American people knowing who has received that \nmoney.\n  Let me tell you what our amendment would do, and it is pretty simple. \nNo. 1, it would require the nonpartisan Government Accountability \nOffice, the GAO, to conduct an independent and comprehensive audit of \nthe Fed within 1 year. Secondly, it would require the Fed to disclose \nthe names of the financial institutions that received over $2 trillion \nin virtually zero interest loans since the start of the recession. That \nis it. That is the whole amendment. Pretty simple. I would hope and \nexpect we would have widespread bipartisan support for this amendment \nwhen it gets to the floor.\n  This amendment also has widespread community support from \norganizations all over this country. It has the support of Americans \nfor Financial Reform--a coalition of over 250 consumer, employee, \ninvestor, community, and civil rights groups, including the AFL-CIO and \nthe AARP.\n  I should also mention that increasing transparency at the Fed is \nobviously something the American people want to see, and poll after \npoll suggests that.\n  This amendment is similar to the Federal Reserve Transparency Act \nthat was introduced in the House by Congressman Ron Paul and now has \n320 bipartisan cosponsors. That is a lot. There are 435 Members of the \nHouse, and 320 are on the House bill. A version of that bill passed the \nHouse Financial Services Committee by a vote of 43 to 28 and was \nincorporated into the financial reform bill that passed the House last \nDecember. So not only do we have widespread bipartisan support in the \nSenate, that same type of support exists in the House.\n  Last year, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said Congress \nshould ask the Fed to put this information ``on the Internet like \nthey've done with the recovery package and the budget.'' That is \nexactly what this amendment would do. Interestingly enough, not only do \nwe have widespread bipartisan support in the Congress, not only has the \nHouse moved vigorously on this issue already, but, importantly, the \ncourts have ruled in support of what we are trying to do.\n  Bloomberg News has been very aggressive on this issue, and they have \nwon court decisions requiring the Fed to release this information to \nthe public. But despite widespread congressional support, despite two \ncourt decisions, the Fed continues to resist the transparency which our \ncountry desperately needs.\n  As long as the Fed is allowed to keep the information on their loans \nsecret, we may never know the true financial condition of the banking \nsystem. This has resulted in a whole myriad of problems, and I think it \nis time we brought some sunshine to the goings on of the Fed.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: The American people are outraged, \nregardless of their political views, by the behavior of Wall Street. \nThey have seen the greed of Wall Street lead us into a recession in \nwhich millions of jobs have been lost, homes have been lost, savings \nhave been lost, families have been destroyed, and they want to make \nsure we do everything we can to make sure what caused this terrible \nrecession never happens again.\n\n  I think one of the most important things we can do in terms of Wall \nStreet reform is to bring transparency to the Fed. So this is an \nincredibly simple amendment. This is an amendment that has grassroots \nsupport. This is an amendment that has support from the most \nprogressive and conservative Members of the Congress.\n  When I bring up this amendment, I certainly hope we can get a great \ndeal of support from Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Vermont yield for \na question?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am very pleased to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont, through the \nChair, about another issue in this bill relative to the interest rates \nthat are being charged across America. I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Vermont if he would tell me his take or evaluation of the \nprovision in this bill which exempts usury laws and interest rates from \nthe consideration of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has an interest in some exploitation \nthat is occurring in her State of North Carolina--frankly, in my State \nof Illinois, and probably across this Nation--by the so-called payday \nloan and title loan operations, where average people who are struggling \neconomically go in for high-interest loans that are then rolled over, \ntime and time and time again, until they lose whatever security has \nbeen offered for the loan and, frankly, find themselves even deeper in \ndebt.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont, whom I have discussed \nthis with on many occasions, his thoughts about consumer financial \nprotections and the interest rates being charged across this Nation.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my friend from Illinois for raising that \nquestion. I wish to congratulate him because our colleagues should know \nhe has been a leader on this issue for many years and has already \nachieved some significant success.\n  My memory is, we had payday lenders that, if you can believe this, \nwere charging men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces--who, in many \ncases, do not have a lot of money, who are trying to take care of their \nfamilies--outrageously high interest rates on check cashing and payday \nloans. The Senator from Illinois led the effort successfully to put a \ncap on that, and I thank him very much for doing that. That is a start.\n  But, clearly, as the Senator from Illinois indicates, we have to go \nfurther. Here is the story. Just a couple weeks ago, there was a rally, \nright here on Capitol Hill, led by religious groups--religious groups--\nwho said it is immoral and unacceptable that in the United States of \nAmerica we are now seeing usury and loan sharking taking place by some \nof the largest financial institutions in this country. So we are not \njust talking, I would say to my friend from Illinois, about an economic \nissue; we are talking about a basically moral issue. If one reads the \nBible, the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Koran, every major \nreligion on this planet has said that usury is immoral; that if you are \ndesperate and you need money, I cannot charge you outrageously high \ninterest rates. That is immoral and the wrong thing to do. Yet in this \ncountry today, as a result of a Supreme Court decision some years ago, \nwe have millions of Americans who are paying 25, 30, 35, 40 percent \ninterest rates. This is not from loan shark gangsters on a street \ncorner in Chicago; this is from some of the largest, most distinguished \nfinancial institutions in the world. We have to put an end to that.\n\n  I would tell my friend from Illinois that the legislation we have \noffered would put a cap of 15 percent, except under extraordinary \ncircumstances, on the interest rates banks can charge the American \npeople. We came up with this idea because this is what credit unions in \nthis country have been doing for several decades, and they have been \ndoing it successfully.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to ask through the Chair again--\nfirst, I wish to give credit where it is due. The original amendment we\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\ntalked about that protects military families was offered by Senator Jim \nTalent of Missouri, and I supported it and everyone supported it \nbecause we found men and women in the military trained to defend our \ncountry who signed up for these payday loans and quick loans, and they \nbecame so deeply mired in debt they were forced to leave military \nservice. So we said as a matter of national security, we can't \nsacrifice well-trained men and women who can keep us safe as a nation \nto loan sharks who have these storefront operations in my hometown of \nSpringfield and in your hometown in Vermont and all across the Nation.\n  I would say to the Senator from Vermont--and he and I have joked \nabout this a little bit--I tried to come up with a number to say this \nwill be the maximum interest rate that can be charged. I went to a \nmutual friend whom I respect and said: What is a number that no one can \nargue with? She said 36 percent. When I mentioned that number to people \nback in Illinois and other places, they were aghast. They said: We \ndon't want to pay 36 percent for anything. I said: I don't either. But \nthis is like a ceiling.\n  Well, it turned out it is a little more confusing than illuminating. \nI happen to think the Senator from Vermont is certainly right with the \ncap he is suggesting.\n  Now, is it not true, I ask the Senator from Vermont, as this rollcall \nvote reflects, if the Republican Senators in this Chamber continue this \nfilibuster against this financial reform bill, this Wall Street reform \nbill, this consumer financial protection bill, we can't even engage in \nthis debate, let alone this amendment, to try to protect families \nacross America from being preyed upon by these outrageous reptilian \ncredit operations?\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Senator from Illinois is, of course, absolutely \nright. The point the Senator from Illinois is making, which makes \neminent sense, is if our friends disagree, if our friends want to offer \nan amendment, if the Republicans want to alter the bill, that is their \nright. That is what the Senate is about. But we can't proceed or go \nforward in putting a cap on the outrageous interest rates financial \ninstitutions are charging the American people--the loan sharking--\nunless we get this bill going. We can't talk about Fed transparency \nunless we get this bill going.\n  So I certainly agree with my friend from Illinois. People have a \nright to disagree, but the American people are disgusted and frustrated \nwith what is going on on Wall Street. They want action. So to simply \nhave our Republican friends saying: No, no, no, we are not going \nforward, doesn't make any sense to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would ask the Senator from Vermont \nthrough the Chair, as informative and as entertaining as our \npresentations are on the floor, the fact is, 98 chairs are empty on the \nSenate floor, chairs that could be filled with Members of the Senate \nfrom both political parties debating the issues we are talking about; \nactually voting on amendments, proposing changes in the law to \nultimately work with the House and send it to the President to solve \nsome of the problems of our Nation. But as long as we are facing--and \nwe have had three filibuster votes so far this week with more to \nfollow--as long as we are facing this Republican filibuster where not \none single Republican Senator will break with the Republican caucus or \nthe Wall Street position that opposes any reform, we can't even bring \nthis bill to the floor for debate so we can address the biggest \neconomic and financial challenge America has faced in decades.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, my friend from Illinois is exactly \nright. Let me just add to it. We have the House of Representatives that \nvoted to go forward. We have the President of the United States who \nwants to go forward. We have 57, or whatever the number is, Senators \nwho wish to go forward. Now is the time to go forward.\n  I would add to what my friend from Illinois has just said. Let's be \nvery clear about this. Last year, in 2009, as I understand it, our \nfriends on Wall Street who are doing everything they can to make sure \nCongress does nothing to reform the way they do business--that is what \nthey want; let's be clear about it--do you know what they spent last \nyear? I would tell my friend from Illinois that my understanding is \nthey spent $300 million on lobbying and campaign contributions.\n  I know my friend from Illinois knows that we can't walk around the \nCapitol without bumping in to one or another lobbyist representing Wall \nStreet. Why are they here? Why are they representing hedge fund \nmanagers who make billions of dollars in a year? They want to be able \nto continue to do the exact same things they have done in the past \nwhich has led to this terrible recession.\n  So let's not be naive. There are huge amounts of money flooding \nCapitol Hill right now, and the goal is, no matter what anybody may \nsay: Let's do no Wall Street reform.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding for \nquestions. I yield the floor and unless someone----\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nIllinois for his continued efforts on Wall Street reform and the \nexcellent work he has done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, we just witnessed a few moments ago the \nthird attempt to try to do something about financial reform legislation \nin this body, and for the third time, it went down. I am an old \nbaseball player. I played a lot of baseball in my young days, and there \nis a rule in baseball that says three strikes and you are out. Well, we \nhave had three tries at this financial reform, and I will tell my \ndistinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle: We are not \nout. We are just beginning to fight under the circumstances we are \nconfronted with because we are fighting on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Earlier this week, our distinguished majority leader called for a \nvote to open the debate on major financial reform. We have seen well-\ndesigned proposals from the Senator from Connecticut, Chairman Dodd. \nThis bill reflects the priorities articulated by President Obama and \nsupported by an overwhelming majority of the American people. It will \nend the so-called ``too big to fail'' and prevent massive banks from \nmaking risky decisions that threaten the entire American economy. It \nwill eliminate the need for government bailouts, and it will institute \ncommonsense regulations so companies cannot create investments that are \ndesigned to fail and then bet against them.\n  In short, this legislation is a good starting point. As a matter of \nfact, we have heard Chairman Dodd say time and time again we have to \nget it on the Senate floor so we can improve this legislation. I know I \nam supportive of a couple of amendments that would be beneficial to \nimprove the legislation. It may not be the complete Wall Street reform \npackage in its final form, but it contains a number of good provisions, \nand it is worth debating. So I am asking my colleagues, let's stop \ndebating to debate.\n\n  The majority leader scheduled a vote to bring this bill to the floor \nso Members of both parties could offer amendments and make \nimprovements. This was not a vote on the legislation itself. Leader \nReid was not asking the Senate to pass the bill without debate or \nwithout amendment. He simply wanted to start the process. He wanted to \nbegin deliberations on the floor of this Chamber in front of C-SPAN \ncameras and in front of the American people. But when the roll was \ncalled and my colleagues and I came to the Chamber, every single one of \nmy Republican friends voted to block the debate, plus one of ours.\n  So we will try again, I hope, this afternoon, if not tomorrow, but we \nare not playing baseball on the floor of the Senate. This is not the \nall-American game, but it is the all-American future.\n  There was a second vote to start debate--to move ahead this process \nand take up the consideration of financial reform. But for a third \ntime, my Republican friends stood in the way. They know they will have \nplenty of opportunity to try and defeat the bill once it\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nis on the Senate floor, but they decided to drag their feet anyway.\n  We have seen this kind of thing before. This is the same Republican \nplaybook we saw with health care reform, the same obstructionism, the \nsame tired politics. In the past, they have been able to use this \nstrategy to score political points. This time, I would respectfully \nsuggest that my Republican friends have miscalculated. The issue of \nhealth care reform was complicated, so when it came time for debate, it \nwas easy to distract and delay and to spread misinformation.\n  It was easy to muddy the waters so they could gain traction and delay \nPresident Obama's agenda. When the health care debate was over, good \npolicy won out over good politics, and we passed the bill--but not \nbefore my friends on the other side had scored some political points.\n  This time it is different. Financial reform itself is very complex. \nThat is why it is so easy for big banks to take advantage of consumers. \nThat is why it is difficult to apply the kind of oversight we should \nhave seen in the years leading up to the recent collapse.\n  The issue itself is hard. This time around, the tactics of \ndistraction and delay will not work. That is because Americans are \nsmarter than that. They know who the bad guys are.\n  About 2 years ago, Lehman brothers was one of the first dominoes to \nfall. Next came Bernie Madoff. Then a handful of other Ponzi schemes \ncame crashing down. Most recently--just yesterday--we witnessed Goldman \nSachs, one of the largest and most respected firms on Wall Street, was \ncharged with fraud.\n  When it comes to financial reform, we know where the problem lies. My \nRepublican friends can try to distract and obstruct all they want, but \nthey will not succeed in confusing the American people. Ordinary folks \nhave had their pocketbooks bled dry by this financial crisis. They have \nseen their hard-earned savings disappear and their future become \ndramatically less secure, and they know exactly who to blame.\n  For far too long, Wall Street banks have been subject to relaxed \noversight. As a result, the focus of their business has changed. It \nstopped being about lending money to businesses, making smart \ninvestments, and encouraging free enterprise. When I was in the banking \nbusiness, that is what we did. I was at the biggest bank in Illinois, \nthe seventh largest bank in America, where we worked with companies, \nmade loans, collected interest, and took the people's deposits in and \npaid them interest. And we kept the economy going.\n  Instead, Wall Street has basically turned into a casino. Look at the \nderivatives market. Here you essentially have an object that is being \ntraded that has no value of its own. It has no ties to the actual \neconomy. There is no product, no business idea, and no actual \ninvestment. It is just a high-stakes bet.\n  Without intelligent risk management, capital standards, and basic \nrules of the road, these bets have the potential to undermine the \nstrength of our entire economy. Wall Street is a casino gone wild, and \nthey are gambling with our money not theirs. They are making money off \nof our money.\n  The American people know this. They can see through the distractions \nand political posturing. They recognize the need to reform Wall Street \nso we can end bailouts, put commonsense rules in place, and make sure \nwe never experience this kind of economic crisis ever again.\n  I am not sure what my Republican friends hope to gain by blocking our \ndebate on this bill. They say they want to improve it, but that is \nexactly what we would be able to do once it is on the floor. Maybe they \nbelieve they can water down our reform package by dragging out this \nprocess. Maybe they would like the chance to hold some more Wall Street \nfundraisers before they have to take a vote on the legislation itself. \nMaybe they simply don't have an alternative plan, and they know they \ncannot win this argument on the floor of the Senate, with the eyes of \nthe Nation on them.\n  I am not sure what they hope to gain by stalling financial reform. I \nurge my distinguished colleagues on the other side to please let us \nmove ahead with this process. I urge them to set aside these political \ntactics and bring their ideas to the table so we can strengthen this \nbill and make sure our economic future is safe.\n  I call upon them to join us in debating, amending, and improving this \nimportant legislation rather than dragging their feet on a bill that \nhas so much public support.\n  When we pass this into law, after extensive discussion, it will be a \nvictory for the American people. If my Republican friends join us in \nthis effort, it can be a victory for both political parties, as well. \nWe will all benefit. The American people will benefit.\n  This legislation deserves to be debated in open session. I ask my \nRepublican friends to let us move ahead. But if they will not, and they \ncontinue to delay and obstruct, then I challenge them to come to the \nfloor and explain. I challenge any one of my distinguished colleagues \non the other side of the aisle to walk into the Senate Chamber today \nand seek recognition from the Chair. I challenge them to stand before \nthe American people and tell them why American families should be asked \nto fund Wall Street's recklessness and greed.\n  I want them to explain that, Mr. President. I believe we need to end \nthese practices. I believe we need to take up the issue of financial \nreform without delay. If my friends on the other side disagree, it is \ntheir privilege to do so. But I believe they owe the American people an \nexplanation. I am pretty sure it will be very difficult to explain to \nthem why they are holding up this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am delighted to join in this debate, and I \ninvite my friends on the other side to listen to what the people in \ncommunities in our home States are saying, who don't spend time \nsoliciting funds on Wall Street.\n  Let's be very clear: We all agree we need to hold Wall Street \naccountable for the havoc wreaked on Main Street. We all agree we need \nto enact reform to prevent another financial crisis. Where we disagree \non is what the responsible reform looks like. I have real concerns \nthat, in its current form, the Democrats' bill, written with the White \nHouse, is a massive government overreach that will punish Main Street, \nhurt families, and cost jobs by stifling small businesses and \nentrepreneurs.\n  To sum it up, Democrats want to treat Main Street, our community \nbanks, our farm lenders, and our auto dealers like they were Goldman \nSachs or others on Wall Street. We Republicans want to ensure we fix \nWall Street, without crippling Main Street. The only way to do that is \nto force the Democrats to listen to the concerns of Main Street, to \nopen this up and make it a bipartisan process. It has not been, and it \nisn't going to be until we get some discussion and real substantive \nchanges in what I view as a very dangerous bill to the economic climate \nand health of our country, our States, our communities, and the \ncreation of jobs.\n  Today, let me share with you some of the concerns I have heard from \nMain Street. Like families in every community and every State, small \nbusinesses were the victims. They weren't the perpetrators of the \nfinancial crisis caused, among other places, on Wall Street.\n  Small businesses were not responsible for the financial crisis and \nshould not be treated as if they were. But that is exactly what this \nbill does. This 1,400-page bill reaches far beyond Wall Street and will \nimpose new costs and onerous new regulations on small businesses to fix \na problem they were not responsible for causing. In short, this bill \nwould change the way every American does business.\n  We are not just talking about changing the way Wall Street banks do \nbusiness, but also how every community banker, local dentist, farm \nlender, and auto dealer does business. I urge my colleagues to take \ntime away from the floor and listen to the people at home. They have a \nvery different message than that which we are hearing from our friends \non the other side of the aisle.\n  These concerns are not just Republican concerns. I hope my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are also hearing from their constituents \nback home about disturbing provisions in the Democrats' proposal and \nhave begun to agree with Senate Republicans that there is a lot of work \nto be\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\ndone before we bring this 1,400-page monstrosity to the floor.\n  Don't misunderstand me. Like the nearly two-thirds of all Americans \nwho favor some sort of reform of Wall Street, so do I and my Republican \ncolleagues. But we need responsible and bipartisan reform that all \nAmericans and businesses can be proud of. I want to work with my \nfriends on the other side to ensure that the concerns I have heard from \nMissourians--1,000 miles away from Wall Street--are addressed as the \nprocess moves forward.\n\n  First, I continue to be stumped that any real form of our financial \nsystem could ignore Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were \nsignificant--if not the majority--contributors to the financial crisis. \nBut that is what this bill does. That is a mistake, and so is leaving \nout the rating agencies who gave triple-A ratings to bad paper that was \nfoisted on the system.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--these government-sponsored GSEs--\ncontributed to the financial meltdown by buying high-risk loans made to \npeople who could not afford them. In addition to the cost to taxpayers, \nthese irresponsible actions turned the American dream into the American \nnightmare for too many families who faced foreclosure, lost their \nhomes, which devastated entire neighborhoods and communities as the \nproperty values diminished, as well as the credit rating of the \nfamilies displaced.\n  Responsible reform must address the GSEs. Responsible reform would \nput an end to the taxpayer-funded bailout of Fannie and Freddie and \nrefocus them on promoting affordable housing.\n  Next, it is critical that in reforming Wall Street, we are not \npunishing Main Street. Instead, we should be protecting small business \nstartups that are so critical to job creation.\n  Unfortunately, this bill will kill small business startups. While \ntitle IX of the Dodd bill has been little noticed, it would have \ndevastating consequences. Specifically, this provision would kill small \nbusiness startups by delaying and limiting the availability of private \ninvestor seed capital, which is essential for the survival and growth \nof these startups.\n  Through new, burdensome regulation by the SEC, innovators and \nentrepreneurs would be subject to registering with the Commission for a \n4-month review before they could get out and start soliciting money. \nThis tying up of vital venture capital dollars needed for immediate use \nby small businesses would cripple their startup efforts. This is not a \nmeasure that will protect people from Wall Street. This is not a \nmeasure needed because venture capitalists and small startup \nentrepreneurs and innovators were causing the crisis. No, they are part \nof the solution of the jobless problems we have now.\n  This provision is an overreach by the Federal Government, which would \nshut down the job creation that Main Street provides, which this \ncountry desperately needs. Raising the net worth threshold for those \nwho can invest in these venture capital firms to $2.3 million from the \nexisting $1 million, and raising the annual household income threshold \nto $450,000, as the Dodd bill proposes to do, would disqualify two-\nthirds of the current accredited investors, according to the Wall \nStreet Journal, who otherwise would help fund small startups in our \ncommunities. These are the people whom these innovators and \nentrepreneurs have to go to, and this will make it impossible for them \nto get the money they need. Therefore, some woman, some man with a \ngreat idea is much less likely in your hometown to be able to get the \nfunds she or he needs to start a business.\n\n  I believe strongly--and I have always said and will continue to say--\nthat small businesses and the startup companies are the backbone of our \ncountry. I understand the critical role these so-called angel investors \ncan play in the creation and development of new companies, small or \nlarge. Let me tell you about my position. Right now, in Missouri, I \nhave been working to help build an agri-biotech corridor across the \nState. In Missouri, we have the potential to foster a whole new \nindustry in advanced agricultural research and biotechnology. This \nagriculture research and biotech industry is our best opportunity to \nstimulate and create high-paying skilled jobs in rural Missouri, rural \nAmerica, and in the cities as well.\n  The stimulus these biotech companies are spurring in Missouri is also \nhappening in other States across the Nation. According to the Kauffman \nFoundation, located in Kansas City, between 1980 and 2005, companies \nless than 5 years old accounted for all--all--net job growth in the \nUnited States. As a matter of fact, the same study showed that in 2008, \nangel investors provided roughly $19 billion in more than 55,000 \ncompanies. You are going to put an end to that with this bill?\n  Let us go back and think about it before we bring this monstrosity to \nthe floor. The new bill, if enacted, would deny immediate access to \ncapital. If enacted, it would say to innovators and entrepreneurs: You \nare too small to succeed, too small to survive. That is far different \nfrom what this bill was promised and promoted as doing--stopping too \nbig to fail. Yes, I am going to see in my communities and you are going \nto see in your communities too small to survive. That is not where we \nshould be going.\n  Killing small business startups and jobs on Main Street is not the \nonly unintended consequence of the Democrats' current proposal that has \ncome to light. Caught up in the Democrats' fervor to pass a bill--any \nbill--without careful consideration, are members of the U.S. military \nand their families. Last week, I heard from active-duty and retired \nmilitary members who fear this bill would hurt their financial \nsecurity. You see, under the Democrats' bill, United Services \nAutomobile Association--USAA, a financial and insurance provider for \nmembers of the U.S. military and their families--would, after an 87-\nyear track record, no longer be able to manage their own portfolio.\n  Also as a result of the Dodd bill, this company that serves our \nmilitary and veterans would have their ability to offer certain \ncompetitive products to servicemembers and their families jeopardized \nand their ability to return money to servicemembers and their families \nlimited by this massive expansion of government authority. This must be \nfixed. I would urge my colleagues to listen to the military and \nveterans and their families in your States. See what they think.\n  Unfortunately, the unintended consequences of this bill keep piling \nup. The next major concern I have heard from Missouri community banks \nthat provide critical lending to families and small businesses is the \ncreation of the so-called Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--CFPB. \nThis massive new government bureaucracy has unprecedented authority and \nenforcement powers to impose mandates on any entities that extend \ncredit. We are not just talking about big Wall Street banks here but \nalso your community banker, your local dentist. Dentists are telling me \nthat if they offer credit, they would be regulated. Farm lenders would \nfind it very difficult for them to be able to operate to make their \nfarm loans and to be able to hedge the risk that they normally do. Auto \ndealers can sell cars only through the benefit of private sector \nfinancing. As a result, there will be no choice but to pass the costs \non for this financing, if they can get it, to the consumers--the very \npeople this bill is supposed to protect. And it may cut some of them \nout of getting credit altogether.\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses, a strong voice for \nsmall businesses, voiced their serious concern over the creation of \nthis new bureaucracy. I am sure you all have received it, but if you \nhave not, I would urge you to check your mail, because the letter from \nthe NFIB to Congress says:\n\n       These small businesses had nothing to do with the Wall \n     Street meltdown and should not be faced with onerous new and \n     duplicative regulations because of a problem they did not \n     cause. Further, as the most recent NFIB Small Business \n     Economic Trends survey shows, small businesses continue to \n     struggle with lost sales, and such regulations could make \n     these problems worse--stifling any small business recovery.\n\n  In other words, they are saying: We do this and small businesses are \ngoing to be even less likely to be able to create jobs. We have already \nput too much debt on the Federal books. We are threatening to increase \ntheir taxes by a tremendous amount, and now we see regulations that are \ngoing to interfere with their normal credit operations. That is a cause \nfor concern.\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\n  This very high unemployment the stimulus bill didn't touch, other \nthan getting more people working for the Federal Government. It was \nsupposed to bring our unemployment rate down to 8 percent, but it is \ngoing to continue to fail and fail miserably if we stifle the ability \nof small businesses to create jobs.\n  The only way to ensure that the CFPB does not unintentionally hurt \nMain Street but still protects consumers is to narrow the scope and \nauthority with clear language outlining exactly who this new regulator \nwill regulate and what it will do. Instead of unlimited authority, this \nnew regulator should focus on the shadow banking entities operating \noutside of the regulatory framework and preying on vulnerable people. \nThe banks and the savings and loans that issue loans are regulated by \ngovernment regulators. Are the people who are making these large loans, \nsuch as home loans, regulated? In a lot of areas they are not. CFPB \ncould look at those.\n  I proposed 2 years ago a mortgage origination commission to make sure \neverybody originating mortgages was regulated by some appropriate State \nagency. Well, we haven't done it. We also need to ensure that we are \nnot empowering, through this new government agency regulator, the same \norganizations which pushed home ownership at any cost onto families who \ncould not afford to repay their loans. This is one of the key problems \nwe had. People who couldn't afford homes were told that they could get \nthem with no downpayment, even if they had bad credit. If they didn't \nhave the money to have a home, they were told they could have a home \nanyhow. These are the people who saw their American dream turn into the \nAmerican nightmare. These are the people whose houses were foreclosed, \ntheir families thrown out, their communities devastated, and ultimately \nthe entire network of not only America's financial system but the \nworld's financial system brought down by this bad paper.\n  Surely, my colleagues would not want to vote for a bill that creates \na new government bureaucracy without knowing exactly what the \nbureaucracy is empowered to do and if it will take on the real bad \nactors who got us into this mess. This CFPB is a perfect example of how \nthe ``one size fits all'' of this hurried legislation will have \nunintended consequences for those who did not contribute to the \nfinancial meltdown. Treating community banks like Goldman Sachs is a \nmistake, and one we cannot afford to make.\n  If we are aware of these unintended consequences now, why won't we \ncorrect them now? Why do my colleagues want to bring these unintended \nconsequences in the bill closer to being codified into law on the \nSenate floor? If you want to have some real consumer protection, I \npurchased several homes, as we have moved around recently, and I can \ntell you that the best thing we can do for consumer protection is to \nrepeal all the laws that require a stack of paper that high that you \nare supposed to sign saying you have read it. Have consumer protection \nwith a very simple one- or two-page form. I have talked about that \nbefore. That is simple consumer protection. Let people know, for people \nwho are not adequately informed on financial situations.\n  The one thing we found out when I joined with the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator Dodd, in pushing home foreclosure \ncounseling, as we worked with agencies that were counseling people who \nwere losing their homes through foreclosure, is these agencies were \ncrying out and saying: We need financial counseling for these people \nbefore they get into homes. That is the best way to avoid foreclosure. \nLet us go back to that. It sounds simple, but it happens to be the \nthing that would work.\n\n  I doubt my Democratic colleagues intend to pass a bill that will hurt \nfamilies every time they turn on the light switch or try to heat their \nhome, but that is what this bill in its current form will do, once \nagain, trying to go for the easy one-size-fits-all approach to entities \nthat it does not fit in any way. The $592 trillion over-the-counter \nderivatives market needs stronger rules of transparency on the things \nthat are run through Wall Street. Some of these derivatives traded in \nthis market played a significant role in the recent crisis, through \nproducts such as credit default swaps.\n  I have called these derivatives computer game derivatives. They were \nso complex. They were something somebody thought up and ran through a \ncomputer. You know what. Our regulators fell down on the job. They \ndidn't look at these derivatives. They were not transparent. They were \nnot regulated. Some of that is the fault of the regulators, who are now \nscrambling to come in and file suits. They are supposed to regulate and \nmake sure that these products that are complicated are fully \ntransparent and related to reality and go to those who are at least \nsophisticated. You can't guarantee that they win or lose, but at least \nknow what they are; make sure they are clearly understood by everybody; \nget the rating agencies to judge them independently, not as captured \nentities for the people who issue them and will pay the rating agency \nif they get the rating they want.\n  But there is an important distinction between the computer game \nderivatives or the very sophisticated derivatives that are traded on \nWall Street. You can make good financial arguments for them, so long as \nthey are traded on an exchange--the Wall Street derivatives, so long as \nsomebody is looking at them to make sure there is some integrity in \nthem. But not all derivative contracts pose systemic risk. As a matter \nof fact, commercial contracts initiated by energy companies, utilities, \nand the agricultural industry are used to manage risks associated with \ntheir daily commercial operation, from cost fluctuations in materials \nand commodities to foreign currencies used in international business. \nThese end users, these commodity hedgers, make up less than 3 percent \nof the market.\n  I don't know of any farmer or any farm agency or any utility who \ncaused the crisis on Wall Street by entering into a long-term supply-\nand-purchase contract. There is no reason to make this be traded on an \nexchange when you have an ongoing partner; no reason to acquire \ncollateral to be posted. The end users, as they are called, do so in \norder to plan for future pricing so they can provide the least \nexpensive goods or services to the consumer as possible. Costly margin \nrequirements for the end users will be directly passed on to their \nfamilies. Guess who pays for that? That is us. That is us. Because all \nAmericans will see their costs go up whenever they turn on their \nlights, put food on their table, and use any form of transportation--\nwhether it be cars, trucks, buses, or airplanes. This is a problem that \nmust be fixed.\n  For the purpose of my time on the floor, I won't go into each and \nevery problem I have heard about in the bill. I have only been given \nminutes to speak rather than hours. But the current concerns I have \noutlined are critical. The unintended consequences on which I have \nshined a light must be stopped. Americans do not want another massive \nflawed bill that will kill more jobs, make it harder to get a home or \ncar loan, or make it more expensive to heat their homes.\n  Yes, Americans are rightfully angry and frustrated about the bad \nactors on Wall Street who caused the financial crisis, costing many \nAmericans their jobs and even their homes. Americans are rightfully \nangry and frustrated about the trillions of dollars the government has \ncommitted to rescuing the financial industry when so many of them are \nstill struggling to pay their bills. These are the people from whom I \nam hearing. I agree with the majority of Americans who believe it is \nunfair for bad actors who caused this financial crisis to get bailed \nout with their tax dollars--with our tax dollars--when there is no \nbailout for families who lost their savings or jobs. I agree with the \nmajority of Americans who are rightly skeptical of the Democrats' bill \nand the rush the majority wants to pass it in. It is no surprise that \nmy constituents are skeptical. After all, it is the few bad actors on \nWall Street who caused the financial crisis who are now cheerleading \nthis so-called reform bill.\n\n  I was stunned when I read that the head of the investment bank \nGoldman Sachs, Mr. Blankfein, said, ``The biggest beneficiary of reform \nis Wall Street itself.'' The head of Goldman Sachs said that the \nbiggest beneficiary of this reform bill is Wall Street. Did you hear \nthat, everybody who has been looking at Goldman Sachs? I also \nunderstand that Citigroup now supports\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\nthis measure. They are huge Wall Street players who have had access to \nthe White House and the majority leaders of both Houses to push for all \nthe good things this bill does for them. They are the ones who have \nbeen in there. They are the major contributors. Look where the money \ngoes. If you want to say: OK, who is looking for contributions, look at \nthat and see what is in the bill.\n  This bill clobbers Main Street and it glances off of Wall Street. \nInstead of helping Wall Street, I want to ensure a bill is passed that \nwill protect Main Street. While Wall Street may be cheering this bill, \nI am here to ensure this bill represents Main Street concerns. What I \nam hearing from Main Street, they are concerned, and it doesn't address \ntheir concerns, it puts more burdens on them. I urge you, I ask you to \nlisten to the folks at home.\n  We need to hold Wall Street accountable for the havoc wreaked on Main \nStreet and enact reform to prevent another financial crisis. This bill \nis too large, too costly for consumers, and will kill job creation at a \ntime when working Americans need to be left to do what they do best; \nthat is, succeed.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle can hold vote after vote, \nbut until this bill fixes the problems and I can be sure it is not just \nGoldman Sachs, Citigroup, and the rest of Wall Street that will \nbenefit, I will continue to force Democrats to listen to the concerns \nof Main Street America.\n  I urge my colleagues to turn up the hearing and turn down the volume \nand listen to what the people in your States are saying.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday we and the nation heard from \nGoldman Sachs executives indicating they had no regrets about the \nfinancial crisis, a crisis that has left 8.5 million people without \njobs and stripped billions of dollars of retirement savings from \nworking Americans. In fact, the Pew Institute released a study that \nindicates the financial crisis and recession have already cost U.S. \nhouseholds $100,000, on average, in lost wealth and income. That is a \nhuge blow to the families who are struggling to pay for their \nretirement, to pay for their children's education, and provide a better \nlife for themselves and their children.\n\n  We have seen, in the last five quarters, because of this financial \ncrisis associated with and connected with the recession, $648 billion \nless in gross domestic product than was projected initially--$648 \nbillion of productive enterprises. The cost of this crisis is something \nwe all should not only recognize but commit to preventing in the \nfuture. We also should calculate the cost not just in terms of gross \ndomestic product and how well executives on Wall Street are doing, who \nare doing pretty well, but how well the average family in this country \nis doing, and how well they will do in the future. We must consider how \nmuch in terms of their wealth has been diminished, if not lost, in \nrebuilding our economy.\n  One of the major functions of any financial sector in any part of the \nworld is to efficiently allocate capital to grow domestic product--not \nto reduce it--to invest in productive enterprise and employ people. The \nfinancial sector shouldn't undercut companies or force them to lay off \nworkers. All of this, in the last few months, I think has represented a \nfailure in that basic function of making sure capital is accumulated \nand then efficiently allocated to productive means.\n  So Wall Street, I think, has a lot to regret about their role, and we \nhave a lot to do to improve the situation, to ensure the regulatory \nstructure is in place, and to set clear rules for the conduct of \nfinancial business that will protect families, protect consumers, and \nprotect the taxpayers.\n  This is the third time our colleagues on the other side have blocked \nsuch efforts to begin the discussion. We recognize this is a complex \ntopic, with many different parts: credit rating agencies, capital \nrequirements, financial institutions, derivatives. You can go on and on \nand on. So anyone who implies they have all the wisdom, I think, will \nfind themselves sadly mistaken. But we have to get on with this bill \nbecause unless we bring the bill to the floor, we cannot begin to, in \nthe open, talk about those policy issues that people can disagree on--\npeople have different approaches--and ultimately resolve this and \ncreate a better regulatory structure and a stronger foundation for our \neconomy.\n  But in the last several days, this has been, again, ``say no and the \nproblem might go away.'' Well, if they continue to say no, the problem \nwill get worse. We are looking across the globe today at a crisis in \nEurope because of Greek sovereign debt. It is spiraling. Already, \nSpanish debt has been downgraded. If we think we are immune from these \nglobal currents, both good and bad, we are mistaken. If we do not put \nin a stronger structure of regulation, the next crisis might not be \nstarting on Wall Street, but the impact on Main Street could be the \nsame, and it could be just as devastating.\n  We have to look forward. We have to move on. The notion that we have \nall the time in the world and we can sort of nonchalantly go about our \nbusiness--or in some cases, if it is a political judgment that it is \nbetter to resist--is not serving the people of this Nation well.\n  We recognize there are principle differences. Let's resolve them, as \nwe do on the floor through debate, through discussion, and through a \nvote, and let's move on. We have a lot of work to do. The underlying \nbill Senator Dodd has brought to the floor already incorporates so many \nof these disparate views, and I think in a very sensible way.\n  Let me, for the record, recall that legislation like this has been \npending for months and months and months. The Presiding Officer will \nrecall--because he participated with me in the first markup last \nNovember--Senator Dodd brought a bill to the committee, opened it up to \namendment, and it was quite clear there was going to be no serious \ndiscussion. In fact, our colleagues on the other side said: We need \nmore time. We want to participate with you. I think it was done with \ngreat sincerity. Senator Dodd entertained those proposals for months. \nFrom November until a few weeks ago, we were working collaboratively \nand creatively to try to bridge our gaps and bring a bill to the floor.\n  Well, finally--and somewhat in exacerbation--Senator Dodd concluded \nthis was leading nowhere, except to more delay, if not denial of the \ngreat problem we face. So we had a committee markup. Again, it was an \nopportunity for our colleagues on the other side to bring forth their \nproposals, their ideas, in a markup in which we would be able to \nconsider their views, vote on them, and then move that bill to the \nfloor. But it was a perfunctory session. They had concluded that, no, \nthey were not quite yet ready to offer their proposals, their ideas, \nand to engage in the business of legislation.\n  So now the bill is before us, months after we started this process, \nmonths after we have entertained and incorporated proposals that have \nbeen made by our colleagues because they are very good proposals. It \nwas Senator Corker and Senator Warner--who have done an outstanding \njob--who structured the whole issue of resolution, that there would be \nan upfront fund so that financial institutions--not taxpayers--would \npay for the failure of a financial institution.\n  Yet when that bill was brought to the floor--or we attempted to do \nit--that provision, that bipartisan provision was singled out for, \nshall we say, criticism, if not ridicule, as a perpetual bailout bill. \nThat was a misrepresentation of the bill and it, frankly, contradicted \nthe whole effort, the whole bipartisan effort to come up with something \nthat both sides could support.\n  But this bill incorporates so many different ideas and aspects that \nhave been shared. In fact, it was interesting, in the lead up to this \nfloor consideration, so many times on both sides of the aisle, people \nwould say, routinely: well, we agree on 80 percent of the bill. I think \nif you have 80 percent of the bill agreed to, at least conceptually, \nyou are probably ready to bring the bill up for debate and to vote. Yet \nagain, the Republican side refuses to do that.\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\n  They are, I think, assuming, I guess, they have a lot of time. But as \nyou look around the globe, at the crises in Europe, at the stock market \nfalling dramatically yesterday because of Europe, I think we have to \nmove aggressively to protect American families, and that means getting \nthe bill on the floor and voting for it.\n  This bill will make changes that are urgently necessary. Again, the \nissue of too big to fail--through the extraordinary effort, painstaking \neffort, the hours of discussions by Senator Warner and Senator Corker, \nthere was a proposal for resolution that effectively ends too big to \nfail. In fact, Sheila Bair, who is the Chairwoman of the FDIC and was \nappointed by President Bush, says it virtually eliminates the \npossibility of a taxpayer bailout. So that is part of it. Strengthening \nconsumer protection. There has been, I think, an unfortunate \ngeneralization that consumer protections are bad for business. Frankly, \nwe should have discovered in the last several months that good consumer \nprotections are very good for business. Many of those consumer laws--\nwhich would have protected people seeking mortgages--which were ignored \nor exempted would have, I think, improved dramatically the mortgage \nsituation. It would have improved business. It would have made that \noverriding issue of efficient allocation of capital much easier.\n  But when you have very little protections for consumers, they are at \nthe mercy of people who will exploit them for a quick buck. And that is \nwhat happened. Mortgages were given to people who were not qualified. \nWhy? Because no one was watching out for them. But not only that, the \nindividual issuing the mortgage did not have, as they say, any skin in \nthe game because they simply sent it in to the big securitization \nprocess. Someone got a fee for securitizing it. Someone wrapped it up \ninto a big mortgage-backed security. Someone else wrapped it up into a \ncollateralized debt obligation, which is a collection of securities. \nThen someone else wrapped that up into a synthetic collateralized debt \nobligation and sold it off. Not a lot of efficient allocation of \ncapital for productive means, but a lot of fees for investment bankers, \nsecuritizers, and mortgage brokers. At the very beginning, good \nconsumer protections would have been an effective way to mitigate some \nof that damage. They are in this bill.\n  We are attempting to eliminate huge gaps and loopholes in financial \nregulation. Our regulatory scheme has grown up over many years, in \nfact, through the life of this country. So we have a national bank \nauthority that was created in the 1860s. We have an Office of Thrift \nSupervision that was created many years later because of thrift \ninstitutions. We have the FDIC, which was created in the 1930s by \nFranklin Roosevelt as a result of the Depression and the need to insure \ndeposits. We have the Federal Reserve System that monitors local banks \nand large banks that was created in the Wilson administration.\n\n  All of them have a little different piece of the action, and all of \nthem have been routinely used in what is termed regulatory arbitrage, \nto move to the most favorable position for your business, which may not \nbe favorable to the overall economy. Some of the big mortgage lenders \nthat ultimately collapsed started off being regulated by the Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency, and then they decided they would have \na better deal at OTS. Frankly, if they had an opportunity--if they were \nstill with us--they would be looking elsewhere. Hit and run, I think, \nwas probably the business plan. We have to stop that.\n  This bill takes a strong step forward, consolidating that \nsupervision, by consolidating the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, by limiting the \nsupervision of the Federal Reserve over a countless number of small \nbanks, and concentrating their efforts at the big institutions, where \ntheir expertise and their focus should make a difference.\n  This is a huge improvement over what the present system is. Yet our \ncolleagues are not recognizing the need to improve and the need to move \nforward. We have been engaged, through Senator Lincoln and Senator \nDodd, with derivatives legislation, which, for the first time, \nrecognizes and regulates those derivatives. There was a great debate \nhere in the 1990s, and through that debate derivatives were left \nunregulated. Today we have to recognize we have to put them back under \nregulatory supervision.\n  The legislation creates the steps, the architecture, which will go a \nlong way to prevent some of the problems we have seen. It requires \nreporting all derivative transactions to a data repository which the \nregulators will have access to so they can see firsthand in real time \nwhat is happening out there. Is there a big buildup in Greek debt? Are \nthere huge positions in credit default swaps on Greek bonds? They can \nquickly get a macro sense of what is happening.\n  Then, with limited exceptions, all derivatives have to be cleared on \na clearing platform. That takes away the bilateral nature of \ntransactions. Someone says: I will sell you insurance on this interest \nrate for a fee. You give me the fee, et cetera. That is bilateral. If \none of these parties is unable to carry out its obligations, the \ntransaction fails. In a clearing platform, there is a central party \nthat assumes the risk of one of the parties failing. It is a \nmutualization, really, of risk, and it is a step forward.\n  But we have to step even farther than that. We have to push as many \nof these trades onto a trading platform, not just clearing it and \nholding collateral, but actually pricing it. Because of the complexity \nof some of these products, unless there is a market, no one knows the \nreal value. On a trading platform, there is a market value and people \ncan value it because basically if someone will buy it, that is the \nvalue. So we have to do that. This legislation goes a long way to doing \nthat.\n  With respect to credit rating agencies, one of the great failures is \nthe credit rating agencies. As to all of these exotic mortgage products \nthat collapsed in value, most of them were rated investment grade--AA, \nAAA, according to whatever the rating is--and yet they failed. Part of \nit was because of the way credit rating agencies operate.\n  Senator Levin conducted recently some very good hearings on this \nissue. The familiarity between the investment bank that is bringing the \nproduct to the street and the raters, the interconnectedness, the \nfailure to have the appropriate checks on the models that raters were \nusing, an independent risk analysis within the rating agency that is \ngoing to look at these models not for the benefit of who is paying for \nit but for the propriety and correctness of the model. That is in the \nlegislation.\n\n  We have done something else too: We have inserted language that would \nallow someone who has invested their savings through a pension plan or \nother method to go to court and make the case that they should find out \nwhat happened within the rating agency with respect to the poorly rated \ninvestment that caused them to lose their savings. Today, these cases \nare routinely dismissed before anyone can question the rating agency. \nOur legislation would allow them to get beyond the pleadings stage. But \nit would also give the rating agencies an affirmative defense. They \nwould have to factually check their models. They would have to actually \nlook at some of these mortgages. Frankly, this might be 20/20 \nhindsight, but if someone drove out to one of those counties in Florida \nwhere there were all of these exotic mortgages but no one seemed to be \nliving there and the communities were deteriorating, I think they would \npretty quickly check their rating. That appears not to have been done.\n  For the first time, hedge funds are regulated. They would have to \nregister with the SEC and be subject to registration, notifying the SEC \nof the size of their pool and other basic information.\n  Well, we have had months of opportunities to share additional \nthoughts and work together to amend the bill in committee, which was \nnot done, but, more importantly, to begin today--in fact, we should \nhave begun last week--this issue of finally passing a Senate bill that \nresponds to the crisis we saw; that builds a stronger foundation of \nfinancial expansion; that protects consumers and taxpayers as well as \nleads to the increase in the wealth of families, not to the dramatic \ndecrease and decline we have witnessed because of some of these forces \nat work today in the marketplace on Wall Street, which still have to be \naddressed.\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\n  There will be parts of the proposals that come up that will be an \nattempt to weaken some of these provisions, particularly with respect \nto consumer protection. Again, I think it flows from the false logic \nthat if it is good for consumers, it is bad for business. Actually, I \nalways thought, in smalltown business, the customer is always right. \nYou believed the customer, made sure you provided value for your \nproduct, and made sure he or she would come back because they were \nhappy and satisfied. Apparently, that old-fashioned rule has been \ntossed out, but I think that old-fashioned rule has to be \nreestablished.\n  We have seen, as a way to deflect attention from the need to reform \nand the need to move this legislation, misrepresentations about the \nbill. I mentioned one: It is a bailout bill. Well, I think that has \nbeen dropped because it was transparently misleading. Indeed, this \nbailout mechanism was a bipartisan product of two of our distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Warner and Senator Corker. Now we are at the old \nstandby: It is going to hurt business. I will tell my colleagues what \nhas hurt business, and that is the behavior on Wall Street.\n  I can recall that several years ago there was a study by the McKinsey \nCompany that said that if we did not loosen further the already, I \nthink, lax rules, we would lose all the securities business; all of \nWall Street would go to England or other places; we would lose \nthousands of jobs. Guess what. They have lost, unfortunately, thousands \nof jobs there. And it wasn't because regulation was too stringent; it \nwas because it was too lax.\n  Again, if there is any case to be made for what hurts business, it is \nirrational allocation of capital; lax rules with respect to consumers; \na market driven not by value but by compensation, not by long-term \ngrowth but by short-term profit. That is what has cost every family in \nAmerica $100,000.\n  So if we move purposely and with the input of our colleagues, which \nwe have already accepted, we can establish a framework where business \nwill begin to grow again. So I reject the argument that what we are \ndoing will hurt business. In fact, I think this uncertainty of whether \nwe will have this reform or that reform continues to, at least to a \ndegree, impede capital formation and to impede investments in the \ncountry. When there are clear rules of the road, then the economy will \nagain begin to pick up, as it is beginning to pick up for other \nreasons.\n  If we don't take up this bill, work on it, and pass good legislation, \nwho wins? Well, I will tell my colleagues who wins. It is the big banks \nthat have survived this crisis today, that are reporting record \nprofits. What are they making their money on? Giving loans to small \nbusiness men and women across America? Investing in municipalities? No. \nThey are making huge profits in trading--betting, in some respects, on \nhow the economy is going to do. Well, we need a situation in which \ncapital is dedicated to growth and to investment and productivity.\n  The speculators will continue to reap billions of dollars of profits. \nI am sure there are several clever people who are doing quite well over \nthe demise of sovereign wealth in Greece, who have taken short \npositions on Greek bonds and are making a lot of money. That is not \nhelping us, it is not helping the country, and indeed it is not helping \nour trading partners across the globe. That, unchecked, will continue.\n  The opaque and unregulated market that I just referred to in \nderivatives, a $600 trillion notional market. When you talk to people \nabout clearing of derivatives, it is not billions, no; it is trillions \nof dollars. That market is unregulated, and if it goes the wrong way \nquickly, the consequences can be devastating. We have seen that with \nthe mortgage crisis.\n  So we have to move. We have to move at every level, not just the big \nbanks, but we have to provide appropriate regulation for people in \nterms of the mortgage industry so those abuses in mortgages will be \ncorrected. We have to go ahead and look at payday lenders who are \ncharging 900 percent interest, who are stripping people of their hard-\nwon resources. We have to look at the credit card companies. We have \npassed legislation, but we have to look at what they are doing. If \nthose people--the payday lenders and the mortgage brokers--can continue \nto operate with impunity, the bankers win. Who loses? Well, consumers \nlose--paying the excessive rates, seeing their homes devalued, all of \nthat.\n  I think we have to stand up and start the work of legislating. The \nstatus quo is no longer affordable, and I think the notion that we will \nnever see another crisis is undercut by looking around. If there are \nnot today some steady hands at the tiller in Europe in terms of the \nEuropean community and their financial arrangements, the cascading \neffect of Greece to Spain to Ireland, et cetera, could be another \nproblem we have to deal with.\n  We have lots of work to do, and the longer we delay, the more we are \nneglecting the real needs of our constituents. I urge that on the next \nvote we get down to business.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak on the motion to proceed for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have now voted three times--\nonce on Monday, the second time on Tuesday, and a third time today--\nmerely trying to get to the Wall Street financial reform bill. Each \ntime we have been blocked from being able to proceed because we can't \nmuster 60 votes to cut off the debate to get to the bill.\n  The Republican leadership remains united in opposition to bringing up \nthe bill, at a time in which we have just seen a display of \nextraordinarily intense, shall we say, arrogance on the part of \nexecutives at a major Wall Street firm in the way they conducted \nthemselves in front of Senator Carl Levin's investigation subcommittee \nyesterday in a hearing. It is rather extraordinary that the Republican \nleadership is not letting us come up with the bill so we can get it out \nhere, debate it, and amend it.\n  This Senator has a number of amendments that I would like to offer in \norder to, as we say, perfect the Banking Committee's bill. But we can't \neven get to that.\n  I don't know what the thinking of the Republican leadership is that \nthey would do this, especially in light of the fact that the American \npeople want some changes with the way investments are handled on Wall \nStreet. They want to see some movement. They want to see some action. \nSo when we attempt to bring up a comprehensive bill to reform Wall \nStreet and the reckless practices that nearly brought down the global \neconomy, we are prevented from having a free and open debate on the \nbill and we are prevented from perfecting that bill by adopting \namendments.\n  I guess the Republican leadership's alternative to this, since we \ncan't do it out here in the normal legislative process, is to do this \nin the backroom, behind closed doors, outside of the sunshine. They \nwant to have a deal cut before it comes to the floor in order to avoid \nan open and free debate to reform the financial system.\n  Why do they want to do this? Well, it seems to me common sense would \ntell us it is because they want to water down the bill. They want to \nwater it down to the point where Wall Street--where we are trying to \ntighten the screws in order to better regulate them and prevent another \nnear financial meltdown such as we had--will sign off on a final \ncompromise, and that is why they are blocking the motion to proceed to \nget to the bill.\n  Does this tactic sound familiar? It is the exact kind of backroom \nwheeling and dealing the American people have come to resent. The only \ndifference between now and decades ago is that in the old days those \ndeals were cut in smoke-filled backrooms. At least now there is not a \nlot of tobacco that is being consumed in those backrooms. But what is \nsimilar is that the special interests are still calling the shots.\n  So my plea is that we break this filibuster. Let's get a bill in \nfront of the\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\nSenate so it can be in the full light and the glare of the headlights \nand the cameras. Let's get it in front of the American people and then \nlet's let the legislative process work its will as we amend the bill.\n  Listen to some of the arguments the Republican leadership, over and \nover and over, has used. They have said the Banking Committee bill \nguarantees future bailouts. Well, that is not true. It might be a good \nsound bite, but it is simply untrue. The Banking Committee bill puts an \nend to the promise of future bailouts.\n  The Republican leadership attacks the $50 billion resolution fund \ncreated in the bill. This Senator is not convinced we need that fund, \nand I am certainly not convinced it is going to survive the debate on \nthe floor, but we ought to have some honest debate about that \nparticular provision. The fund is paid for in the Banking Committee \nbill directly from the coffers of the largest banks. The fund acts, in \nthe way it is devised by the Banking Committee, as a buffer to protect \ntaxpayers so that if there is another breakup, another potential \nmeltdown, the fund is there--already funded by the banks--so the \ntaxpayers don't have to go in and do the rescue operation such as we \nhave done in the past.\n  Under the Banking Committee bill, the fund can only be used to \nliquidate a financial institution, to break it up. In short, it is a \nfuneral tax. It is a funeral tax on the largest banks, not the \ntaxpayers. The $50 billion fund in that Banking Committee bill only \ngets tapped to pay for their funeral expenses.\n  So here we are. The American people hear the Republican leadership \ntalking about all this, and it is a red herring. The American people \nwant action, and here we are stuck in procedural gridlock. Guess who \nthe only real winners are. As we sit here, trying to break a filibuster \non Monday, again Tuesday, and again today, shortly after noon, the only \nwinners are the Wall Street bankers who have mastered the art of using \nthe broken financial regulatory system to almost bring down the \ncountry's finances by deceiving investors and, ultimately, in order to \nsave our system, milking the American taxpayer.\n  One of the major beneficiaries of the current system is the credit \nrating agencies. This is a subject matter the Senator from Minnesota--\nwho now sits in the Presiding Officer's chair--has some familiarity \nwith and on which he will be offering an amendment. This Senator is \ngoing to join him in that amendment. Credit rating agencies--something \nthat normally is down in the weeds because it is so complicated--are \nprivate companies that assess the creditworthiness of various types of \ndebt instruments, such as bonds and mortgage-backed securities, as well \nas the issuers--rating the issuers of those instruments.\n  They typically assign a letter grade that is designed to convey the \nrisk of default, and there are three major credit rating agencies on \nWall Street: There is Moody's, there is Standard & Poor's, and there is \nFitch Ratings. For most of the last century, the rating agencies were \npaid by investors who subscribed to their services. Why did they do \nthat? Because it made sense. Investors were the ones who were investing \ntheir money and they were the consumers of the ratings. They wanted the \nbest information regarding the risk that they would have in that \ninvestment.\n  Well, unfortunately, in the 1970s, all this changed and the business \nmodel flipped. The rating agencies began charging the issuers of the \nbonds, not the people who were seeking to know if it was a good credit \nrisk in order to invest their money. It was reversed. It was the very \nissuers of the credit, rather than the investors, who were charging for \ntheir services. So beginning in the 1970s, rating agencies began to be \npaid by the very same people who had a vested interest in receiving a \nhigh investment grade.\n  Think about that. The very issuers of the bonds who wanted people to \ninvest their money in these bonds needed a high credit rating on that \nbond in order to get people to invest. If they could be rated at AAA, \nas opposed to B, people were much more willing to put their money into \nthis instrument.\n  Well, talk about a conflict of interest. Now the issuers of the \nbonds, who have an interest in a high AAA rating, go out and hire the \nservices of the credit rating agencies.\n  Did you ever hear the old adage, ``He who pays the piper calls the \ntune''? Well, those who were going to pay the piper were going to call \nwhat that tune was. Do you think if you are paying the bill to the \ncredit rating agency that you have a better chance of getting a AAA \nrating than a lower rating? Of course you do. That is a walking \nconflict of interest.\n  How could we allow this unavoidable conflict of interest to exist and \nallow it to exist since the 1970s is unfathomable and unbelievable. Yet \nthat is the way it is. Credit rating agencies failed miserably in the \nrunup to the financial crisis, and it sure looks like--looking \nbackward--they put profits ahead of professionalism. They failed to \ndetect the severe deterioration in lending standards that began in the \nlate 1990s. They failed to review all available information about the \nloans on which the securities they were rating were based. The conflict \nof interest in their business model gave the rating agencies an \nenormous incentive to overlook problems in mortgage-backed security \nmarkets.\n\n  In 2006, Congress passed the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act. I put \nthat in quotes, the Credit Rating Agency ``Reform'' Act. The bill was \nwritten in the Senate by the Republican leadership, and it had the full \nsign-off of the credit rating industry. Here is what the bill did--\n2006. It standardized the process for registering rating agencies, and \nit gave the SEC some new oversight powers over rating agencies. At the \nsame time, however, this so-called reform act prohibited the SEC from \nregulating ``the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and \nmethodologies by which any rating agency determines credit ratings.'' \nIt gutted the ability to double-check credit rating agencies.\n  Furthermore, to add insult to injury, the act also clarified that it \ncreates no private right of action. So if a party invested in a \nparticular financial instrument because that credit rating was high, \nand it turned out to be a dog and they lost lots of money, they had no \nprivate right of action through the courts.\n  No wonder the industry supported that legislation back in 2006. The \nbill, written by the Republican leadership, took away any power of \nFederal regulators that they might have had to crack down on the \nbaseless credit ratings that were fueling the boom in subprime lending. \nTo make matters worse, the bill made it clear it was not empowering the \nprivate sector to hold the credit rating agencies liable for their \nratings.\n  The bill we hope one day, at some hour, to get to the floor so we can \nstart working on it does some important things to improve credit rating \nagencies. It requires these agencies to disclose their methodologies \nand their ratings track record. Wouldn't you think you would want to \nknow their track record if you are going to invest a lot of money based \non their triple-A rating? It requires agencies to consider information \nin their ratings that comes from outside sources. But when it comes to \naddressing the fundamental conflict of interest in the credit rating \nagency business model, this bill coming out on the Senate floor falls \nshort.\n  It would require the rating agencies to separate ratings activities \nfrom their sales and marketing activities, and that is like saying my \nleft arm has no idea what my right arm is doing. In reality, it is the \nbrain in your head that controls both the right arm and the left arm, \nand no one is proposing to chop off the head. So we have to deal with \nthis conflict of interest, and we are going to. Here is what we are \ngoing to do.\n  We are going to do this with the help of the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate. We are going to offer an amendment that would establish a \nclearinghouse to randomly assign rating assignments with rating \nissuers. As simple as that, we can end the conflict of interest in the \ncredit rating industry if, randomly, it is going to be assigned among \ncompanies that rate issuers of financial instruments.\n  Second, this Senator is going to offer an amendment to require the \nrating agencies to monitor, to review, and to update their credit \nratings after the initial issuance of their credit rating so it does \nnot become stale. They are going to have to continue to look at it,\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\nto review it, to update it, and to publish it. The rating agency should \nnot be able to walk away from a rating after it has been issued. It is \ngoing to be fresh. The rating agencies ought to conduct continued \nsurveillance of these securities and update them along the line.\n  The credit rating agency reform is just one of the many areas the \nSenate needs to debate. But as long as the Republican leadership \ncontinues to prevent the bill from coming to the floor, this broken \nsystem remains in place. The Wall Street bankers win and the American \npublic loses.\n  Let me give some other examples. Remember the name ``AIG''? It was \nthis Goliath organization that started out as an insurance company. It \nbecame this huge financial institution. The core product of this \ncompany was its insurance. It was deemed too big to fail at the time of \nthe near meltdown of our financial system. This was back in the fall of \n2008.\n  It was deemed that when we passed the Troubled Assets Relief Program, \nTARP, that money had to go into this big, Goliath organization, all the \nway to the tune of about $80 billion of taxpayer money, as I last \nrecall. It may be a lot more than that.\n  Guess what this did. They had already issued, in effect, an insurance \npolicy that had a fancy name. It was called a credit default swap. It \nwas an insurance policy against some of the companies if their \ninvestments went bad. That is not bad. But what happened was, when the \nAmerican taxpayer dollars went in to save AIG, AIG took those taxpayer \ndollars and turned around and paid off those insurance policies, 100 \ncents on the dollar. Is that fair, when folks like some of these folks \nwho have been in the news recently, such as Goldman Sachs, got paid off \nto the tune of $13 billion instead of going in and negotiating a lower \npayoff since it was taxpayer money? We ought to change that, and I \nthink we will if we can ever get to the bill, if the Republican \nleadership will ever allow us to get to the bill.\n  Let's take another example. What about the same insurance policies \ncalled credit default swaps? Let's say the same set of circumstances \nwith AIG occurred, but AIG had not been bailed out by the American \ntaxpayer and instead had gone into bankruptcy. AIG, in this \nhypothetical example, had a lot of creditors that would get in line \nunder the bankruptcy law to get whatever they could. But, oh, no; these \ninsurance policies called credit default swaps would be exempt from the \nbankruptcy laws. They would get paid off in full first instead of \nhaving to get in line with all the other creditors under the bankruptcy \nlaw.\n  That is not right. This Senator is going to have an amendment to the \nBanking Committee's bill to correct that. There is no reason those \ninsurance policies should be at the head of the line of everybody else \nin the case of bankruptcy.\n  Are we pleased about the executive compensation of some of these \nfolks who have nearly caused the financial collapse of our country? \nWhen taxpayer money, through the TARP system, was bailing out these \ninstitutions--whether it was directly, such as into AIG, or directly \ninto a place such as Bank of America, or whether it was indirectly \ncoming through these credit default swaps that were getting paid off \n100 cents on the dollar that I just described, through the conduit of \nAIG--what was happening to the compensation of those executives? Were \nthey still getting bonuses? Were they still getting high salaries? Were \nthey having to tighten up their belts when, in fact, their financial \ninstitutions were kept alive by the American taxpayer bailing them out?\n  No, we didn't see that tightening of the belt. We did not see any \nevidence of humility. We didn't see any evidence of appreciation. But, \ninstead, we saw arrogance displayed through huge bonuses that were \nbeing given with a total disregard for the American people's sacrifice, \nof putting their hard-earned taxpayer dollars in to save those \nfinancial institutions.\n  Mr. President, I think you will see once we get out here on the floor \nthat we are, in fact, going to get a number of amendments, including \nthe amendment of this Senator, on a limitation--not on executive \ncompensation but a limitation on the ability to deduct from their tax \nliability excessive executive compensation, and a tie of that excessive \nexecutive compensation to, in fact, performance for that company that \npays their salary. We are going to see that. Sooner or later, we, in \nfact, are going to get to the bill, even though the Republican \nleadership continues to try to obstruct and delay because sooner or \nlater the American people are going to have their way. They clearly \nwant Wall Street financial reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the financial \nregulatory reform, and particularly the effect of the Dodd proposal \nthat came out of the Banking Committee on which I sit, that we have \nbeen voting on cloture on for this whole week.\n  I heard Senators from the other side talk about delay; the \nRepublicans are delaying this bill. I have heard them for the last week \nsay it is because we are siding with Wall Street, Republicans are \nsiding with Wall Street.\n  That is odd to me because it is the Wall Street big banks that are \nfor this bill. It is Citigroup, it is Goldman Sachs that are in support \nof this bill. They are publicly supporting the bill.\n  It is the community banks that are flooding my office and the offices \nof my colleagues. It is the community banks that had nothing to do with \nthe financial meltdown that are hugely concerned with this bill.\n  That is the issue. The groups that are opposing Dodd's bill are the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses, the small businesses of \nour country; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Americans for Tax Reform; \nthe Americans for Limited Government; Freedom Works; the National \nTaxpayer Union; the United States Automobile Association.\n  We have had auto dealers in our offices all week who are very \nconcerned about not being able to get credit from the little banks and \nthe ability to finance the buying of automobiles. It is the Military \nOfficers Association that has concerns with this bill; the National \nCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives; the Farm Credit Council; the National \nAssociation of Home Builders; the Fertilizer Institute.\n  This is a bill that is going to affect our economy. So many of the \ngroups I have named are the groups that are providing jobs in our \ncountry that we want to encourage to create more jobs, not discourage \nin a time such as this. So, yes, Republicans have been trying to have \ninput on this bill. There has not been any Republican input at all. If \nwe have learned one thing as Republicans, it is that we know what it is \nlike to be completely shut out. We were completely shut out of the \nhealth care debate. We had amendments offered day after day after day. \nOh, the process worked. Not one Republican amendment was passed. Not \none. Neither was there one Republican vote in the House or Senate on \nthe health care bill. So we have had that experience. So this time, \nbecause we see the dangers in the Dodd bill to our economy and the \nsmall businesses and the small banks, we are saying we are not going to \nlet this bill go to the floor if we have the power to stop it until \nthere is Republican input.\n  The biggest failure in the bill is that it still allows taxpayer \nbailouts. That is wrong. That is why Republicans are voting not to \nbring it up yet, because we are trying to change the language in the \nbill before it comes to the floor to assure that the taxpayers will not \nhave the responsibility to bail out big financial institutions that \ntook gambles with other peoples' money. That is the holdup.\n  This bill is not a bill that is favored by community and little \nbanks. It is favored by the big banks. It is favored by Goldman Sachs \nand Citigroup. So let's be clear about that. As we consider the bill \nbefore us, the Dodd bill, it should focus on the gaps and holes in \nregulations that led to our nation's financial crisis from which we \nhave not yet recovered, because there are still millions of people who \nare unemployed because of the financial crisis.\n  We must end too big to fail. We must end taxpayer bailouts. That is \nnot done in this bill, and that is why Republicans are saying: Stop \nthis bill from coming to the floor until it does at least that one \nmajor thing; that is, to be clear, that we stop too big to fail in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n\n  Putting the big banks in one level of operation and scrutiny and one \nlevel of access to the Fed, which this bill does, the Fed keeps its \nscrutiny of every bank company holding company of $50 billion or more \nin assets. That is it. All of the other banks in our system throughout \nour country are not allowed access to the Federal Reserve. They cannot \nbe members of the Federal Reserve under the Dodd bill. That is the \nmajor reason I am not supporting this bill.\n  In fact, I have an amendment, if this bill comes to the floor, I am \ngoing to offer that says the law today will prevail, that is, that \ncommunity banks may join the Fed, the State-chartered banks may join \nthe Fed, because if you do not do that, you are going to give the \nimpression that the $50-billion-and-above banks are in one category, \nthat they are going to be taxpayer protected. That means they are going \nto be able to give lower rates in competition with the community banks \nbecause it will be perceived that the risk is less.\n  That is not what we ought to be doing. So I am going to offer an \namendment to the Dodd bill which would eliminate that part of the Dodd \nbill that takes away Fed access to the community banks. The other \nreason it is important is that we have regional Fed banks. The reason \nit was set up that way is so that throughout the country the Federal \nReserve would be able to make monetary policy with input, with input \nfrom Kansas City, and Dallas, and Houston, and San Antonio, and Los \nAngeles, and San Francisco, and San Diego, and Minnesota, and \nWisconsin.\n  That was the concept of the regional Fed bank. Let me give you an \nexample. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is headed by Richard \nFisher, who came to see me last week. He said: I would go from \nregulating about $70 billion in bank assets, with all the community \nbank members that we have in the Dallas Regional Fed, to 3.\n  If the Fed is going to listen in Washington, when they are making the \nmonetary policy, to the Kansas City Fed chief who completely agrees \nthat we need to keep access for State and community banks to the Fed, \nfor their information, as well as the level playing field. So that will \nbe my amendment.\n  Community banks did not cause the financial meltdown. In fact, they \nprovided lending and depository services to families and small \nbusinesses across Texas and across our country. Even in the hard times \nthey were mostly the ones that helped small business get their \ninventory loans and the help they needed for liquidity.\n  A lot of people I talked to in my home State, when I visit the small \nbusinesses and the community, felt as though nobody was lending. The \nbig banks certainly were not. So the community banks are continuing to \nmake credit available, much more than the big banks, so businesses and \nconsumers can invest and create jobs that will lift our Nation into a \nrecovery.\n  Do not talk to me about recovery when it is still a jobless--that is \nan oxymoron--a jobless recovery. There are millions of people out there \nunemployed. Is that a recovery? No. ``Jobless recovery'' should be out \nof our lexicon. That is wrong. If we are going to build jobs in this \ncountry, it is going to be through small businesses. The big businesses \nare not hiring. Do you know why the stock market is up right now? It is \nbecause the big businesses are not hiring. They have lowered their \ncosts. Yes, they are more profitable because they are working with \nfewer people. I do not considering that a success. I think we have to \nsave our community banks. This bill before us is going to hurt them. \nThat is why we are holding it up.\n  I wish I could say that is the only part of the bill that hurts \ncommunity banks, but there is another part. It is the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau that is created in the Dodd bill that will \nadd a new layer of regulations and a new agency issuing new regulations \nthat will affect those same community banks that are already fully \nregulated.\n  We have seen the effect of poor and predatory lending standards in \nthis financial meltdown. We need reform in that area. Americans should \nunderstand all the terms of a transaction, and they need to be \ncreditworthy. Subprime loans to people who are not creditworthy are not \nhealthy for our economy. We have learned that for sure. We do not need \na new bureaucracy housed in the Fed but without Fed oversight, which is \nsort of a non sequitur. But that is the way it is in this bill, which I \nhope we can change. Community banks are already regulated. They have \nall of the regulations, either State bank regulation or by the FDIC \ninsuring them, requiring reserves. They are doing their job.\n  The new agency would remove safety and soundness from consumer \nprotection and have unlimited and unchecked rule-writing authority. The \nlegislation does include an exemption which would allow a community \nbank with less than $10 billion in assets to retain examination from \nits prudential regulators, or the regulators they have now.\n  But the exemption is false because community banks will still be \nsubject to the new agency's new rules, pricing, and prohibitions, all \nof which will only serve to curtail consumer credit options.\n  Enhancing consumer protections should instead focus on leveraging the \nexperience of agencies that are already in place, such as the Federal \nTrade Commission. I am the ranking Republican on the Commerce \nCommittee. I see the work the FTC is doing on a daily basis to stop \nunfair and deceptive practices that prey on consumers of financial \nproducts and services offered by nonbank entities such as mortgage loan \nservices.\n  As an example, in 2009 alone, the FTC and the States, working \ntogether closely, brought more than 200 cases against firms that \npeddled phony mortgage modification and foreclosure rescue scams. \nRather than focusing on too big to fail or the practices of large \nbanks, the Dodd bill overreaches and threatens the authority of the FTC \nto protect consumers of nonbank financial products, as it has for many \nyears.\n  The FTC wrote a letter to me as ranking member of Commerce, and our \nchairman, Jay Rockefeller, and asked for assistance with preserving \ntheir consumer protection and enforcement authority. I am working now \nwith Chairman Rockefeller. He is very focused on this. I can tell you \nhe is very focused, because I talked to him on the telephone yesterday \nseveral times, including at 8 o'clock last night, because he is so \nconcerned that we are not going to fix this bill to make sure the FTC \nis not shut off from what it already does, what it already has in \nplace, with a new overlay of a new agency that does not have the \nexperience, that does not now exist, and would need startup time and \nmore taxpayer dollars.\n  Instead, Senator Rockefeller will have an amendment, and I will \ncosponsor it, that will keep the FTC exactly where it is now with the \nenforcement actions against companies that offer nonbank financial \nproducts. I hope Senator Dodd will work with us on that amendment. In \nfact, I am going to expand it even beyond that and say: We should put \nall of the nonbank regulation into the FTC instead of this new agency \nthat will be another bureaucracy that will be confusing in many \ninstances to the banks which are already regulated.\n  I hope we can do something in this bill that is right in the \nregulatory area, and particularly the area that contributed to the \nfinancial meltdown, such as the nonbank financial institutions, not the \nbanks. The community banks did not have a part in this financial \nmeltdown. I hope we can fix this bill when it comes to the floor.\n  It appears that the chairman of the Banking Committee and the ranking \nRepublican, Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby, have come to an agreement \non the language that will tighten and close the loophole in too big to \nfail. We are going to hear exactly what that language is in a few \nminutes in our Republican caucus. That will be very good for us to be \nable to then come to the floor, if the Democrats will allow Republicans \nto have some input into this bill on the other issues, such as Federal \nTrade Commission jurisdiction, the new consumer agency that I think is \noverreach and overkill, and most certainly to keep community banks \nwithout a competitive disadvantage against the big banks. I want a \nlevel playing field because I don't want the community banks to suffer \nin this country. They are the lifeblood of the heartland, and they are \nin peril with this bill.\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\n  I am somewhat frustrated at hearing some of the speeches in the last \nweek that have railed against Republicans for holding up this bill. \nSometimes ``no'' is the right answer because if we bring a bill to the \nfloor with no ability to amend it and we don't fix too big to fail, \nthen once again, like the health care reform bill that was jammed \nthrough the Senate and the House with no Republican support and no \ninput, we will be doing it to our economy and our financial \ninstitutions. I hope we will not do that again.\n  I hope that we will have a bill we can all agree closes the loopholes \non too big to fail so that taxpayers will not be on the hook again for \nbig financial institutions that bet with other people's money on fancy \nderivatives and all of the hedges that don't make sense; that we \nprotect the hedges that do make sense, that are used by the end user to \nkeep a budget in place rather than passing big price hikes on to \nconsumers in oil and commodities. That is what derivatives are supposed \nto be for, and we don't need to stop that. We just need to know what is \nin those big derivatives so that people will have the information and \nso will the regulators.\n  We can do this job right. This should not be political. Democrats and \nRepublicans aren't going to get an advantage for passing a financial \nregulation bill because most people are not going to know how it will \naffect them until it is passed and in place. Why don't we do it right? \nLet's bring the bill to the floor with some key parts that are agreed \nto, and then let's start having amendments. I am not saying every \nRepublican amendment should pass, but I think it should have a fair \nhearing. And I think some of them should pass if this bill is going to \npass the test of a true bipartisan bill that will have more than just a \npartisan vote out of the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair for listening--not that it was his choice, but I \nappreciate it anyway.\n  I hope we will do the right thing on this bill. It will affect our \nfinancial communities, every community in Texas, and especially small \nbusinesses and community banks that are going to be the reason we \nrecover, if we do this right.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 12 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        General Motors and TARP\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks some letters to which I will \nrefer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last Thursday, I wrote Secretary \nGeithner asking why the Treasury Department allowed General Motors to \nuse TARP money from a Treasury escrow account to repay its \nmultibillion-dollar TARP taxpayer loan. This afternoon, I received a \nresponse from Treasury. I would like to say a few words about the reply \nand the questions that remain unanswered.\n  Last week, Treasury and GM announced with press releases and \nnationwide TV commercials that GM had repaid its TARP loans ``in full, \nwith interest, ahead of schedule, because more customers are buying [GM \nvehicles].''\n  However, the hype does not match the reality. Taxpayers have not been \nrepaid in full--far from it. Many billions of TARP dollars remain \ninvested by Treasury in GM, and much of it will never be repaid. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers will lose around \n$30 billion on GM.\n  In addition, the payment that occurred last week did not come from \nrevenue GM earned by selling cars, despite what was claimed. Instead, \nTreasury allowed GM to use funds in a separate escrow account to pay \nits TARP debt. The Treasury Department's response to me today makes a \npoint of saying that GM ``owns'' the money in the escrow account, as if \nthat somehow justifies all the hoopla about GM's so-called \n``repayment.''\n  Well, let's look at how GM came to ``own'' those escrow funds in the \nfirst place. The escrow funds were part of the TARP money Treasury paid \nfor GM stock coming out of the bankruptcy. The money was supposed to be \nused by GM for expenses, as Treasury concedes. Treasury had the power \nto approve or disapprove GM's use of the money to repay the TARP \ntaxpayer loan. Treasury approved, and GM pretended it was paying the \nloan back from revenue because business had improved.\n  Business may have improved, but that is not how they paid the loan. \nTaking TARP money out of one account to pay back TARP loans in another \naccount is not at all the same as paying off a loan with earnings, as \nGM's TV commercials imply they have done. That is why I called it ``an \nelaborate TARP money shuffle'' and nothing in Treasury's reply today \nchanges that.\n  The public would know nothing about the TARP escrow money being the \nsource of the supposed repayment from simply watching GM's TV \ncommercials or reading Treasury's press release. Treasury's letter \ntoday says all these details are public knowledge and nothing new. \nWell, that may be technically correct, but it wasn't clearly \ncommunicated that way to the average citizen. Most Americans don't pore \nthrough SEC filings and special inspectors general reports.\n  The GM commercial also did not mention that GM could have used the \nTARP escrow funds to repay a $2.5 billion 9 percent loan it received \nfrom its union health plan as part of the bankruptcy process. The union \nloan runs until 2017. The TARP loan was at 7 percent and ran until \n2015. What sort of money manager would advise you to pay off a lower \ninterest loan before a higher interest loan? GM and Treasury have still \nnot explained that, and I have asked the TARP watchdog, Special \nInspector Neil Barofsky, to get to the bottom of it. And to make \nmatters worse, Treasury has admitted that it let GM take an additional \n6.6 billion of TARP dollars out of the escrow fund last week with no \nstrings attached. That money, too, could have been used to repay the \nhigh interest union loan.\n  There are reports that GM also applied to the Department of Energy \nfor a $10 billion 5 percent loan to retool its plants to meet fuel \neconomy standards. GM seems to be using government money to pay back \ngovernment money, and then asking for more government money at a lower \ninterest rate. It sounds like a plan to refinance GM's government debt \nwith more taxpayer money--not pay it back.\n  GM had to ask permission from Treasury to use the taxpayers' stock \ninvestment to pay off the taxpayers' loan. Treasury's response to my \nletter says that ``Treasury retained approval rights over GM's use of \nfunds from the escrow account in order to protect the taxpayer.'' Well, \nwhy didn't they protect the taxpayer then?\n  Why would Treasury allow GM to use its equity investment to pay off \nthe loan when it means giving up the legal right to 7 percent rate of \nreturn for the taxpayers in exchange for essentially nothing? Since the \ntaxpayer has an equity stake in the company, it's true that future \ngrowth of GM could theoretically make taxpayers whole, but taxpayers \nalready had that equity interest before this latest transaction and \ndidn't get any more equity as a result of the transaction.\n  Another key question is: Why would GM orchestrate a major media \ncampaign to make the public think this all represents some big \naccomplishment by GM when the truth is that the taxpayers are still on \nthe hook for billions that we may never recover?\n  Using the taxpayers' stock investment in GM to reduce its debt to the \ntaxpayers is not the same as repaying that debt from money actually \nearned by selling cars. Treasury's reply today does not explain why it \napproved this transaction. Maybe it is a step in the right direction, \nmaybe not. But instead of misleading the American people, we should be \nclear and up front about what happened here.\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2010.\n     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Geithner: General Motors (GM) yesterday \n     announced that it repaid its TARP loans. I am concerned, \n     however, that this announcement is not what it seems. In \n     fact, it appears to be nothing more than an elaborate TARP \n     money shuffle.\n       On Tuesday of this week, Mr. Neil Barofsky, the Special \n     Inspector General for TARP, testified before the Senate \n     Finance Committee. During his testimony Mr. Barofsky \n     addressed GM's recent debt repayment activity, and stated \n     that the funds GM is using to repay its TARP debt are not \n     coming from GM earnings. Instead, GM seems to be using TARP \n     funds from an escrow account at Treasury to make the debt \n     repayments. The most recent quarterly report from the Office \n     of the Special Inspector General for TARP says ``The source \n     of funds for these quarterly [debt] payments will be other \n     TARP funds currently held in an escrow account.'' See, Office \n     of the Special Inspector General for TARP, Quarterly Report \n     to Congress dated April 20, 2010, page 115.\n       Furthermore, Exhibit 99.1 of the Form 8K filed by GM with \n     the SEC on November 16, 2009, seems to confirm that the \n     source of funds for GM's debt repayments was a multi-billion \n     dollar escrow account at Treasury--not from earnings. In the \n     8K filing GM acknowledged:\n       Of the $42.6 billion in cash and marketable securities \n     available to GM as of September, 30, 2009, $17.4 billion came \n     from an escrow account with Treasury,\n       $6.7 billion of the escrow account available to GM was \n     allocable to the repayment of loans to Treasury,\n       $5.6 billion in cash would remain in the Treasury escrow \n     account following the repayment by GM of their loans, and\n       Upon repaying Treasury, any balance of escrow funds would \n     be released to GM.\n       Therefore, it is unclear how GM and the Administration \n     could have accurately announced yesterday that GM repaid its \n     TARP loans in any meaningful way. In reality, it looks like \n     GM merely used one source of TARP funds to repay another. The \n     taxpayers are still on the hook, and whether TARP funds are \n     ultimately recovered depends entirely on the government's \n     ability to sell GM stock in the future. Treasury has merely \n     exchanged a legal right to repayment for an uncertain hope of \n     sharing in the future growth of GM. A debt-for-equity swap is \n     not a repayment.\n       I am also troubled by the timing of this latest maneuver. \n     According to Mr. Barofsky, Treasury had supervisory authority \n     over GM's use of these TARP escrow funds. Since GM's exit \n     from bankruptcy court, Treasury had approved the use of the \n     escrow funds for costs such as GM's obligations to its parts \n     supplier Delphi. See, Office of the Special Inspector General \n     for TARP, Additional Insight on Use of Troubled Asset Relief \n     Program Fund (SIGTARP-10-004), dated December 10, 2009, at \n     page 6. According to the GM 8K, GM had planned to use the \n     TARP funds in escrow to pay back the TARP loans on a \n     quarterly basis beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. But \n     following the April 20, 2010, hearing of the Senate Finance \n     Committee, where Treasury's decision to exempt GM from the \n     bank TARP excise tax was questioned and GM's refusal to \n     testify was noted, it is odd that GM suddenly drew down on \n     the TARP escrow and accelerated the repayment of the \n     remaining balance of GM's outstanding TARP loans.\n       The bottom line seems to be that the TARP loans were \n     ``repaid'' with other TARP funds in a Treasury escrow \n     account. The TARP loans were not repaid from money GM is \n     earning selling cars, as GM and the Administration have \n     claimed in their speeches, press releases and television \n     commercials. When these criticisms were put to GM's Vice \n     Chairman Stephen Girsky in a television interview yesterday, \n     he admitted that the criticisms were valid:\n       Question: Are you just paying the government back with \n     government money?\n       Mr. Girsky: Well listen, that is in effect true, but a year \n     ago nobody thought we'd be able to pay this back.\n       Mr. Girsky then said that GM originally planned to pay the \n     loan over the next five years. So the question is why--other \n     than a desire to justify excluding GM from the \n     administration's TARP tax proposal--would Treasury and GM \n     reduce GM's TARP debt with TARP equity and then \n     mischaracterize it as a repayment from earnings? Accordingly, \n     please explain:\n       Your department's justification for allowing GM to use \n     funds from the TARP escrow account to repay TARP loans,\n       The amount of funds remaining in the TARP escrow account at \n     Treasury that may be released to GM, and\n       The date that you anticipate that the remaining funds in \n     escrow will be released to GM.\n       Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Please provide \n     the requested information by April 30, 2010. Should you have \n     any questions regarding the contents of this letter please do \n     not hesitate to contact Jason Foster.

Grassley,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2010.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for your letter dated \n     April 22, 2010 to the Secretary regarding General Motors' \n     (GM) repayment of its loan from the Department of the \n     Treasury. He asked me to respond on his behalf.\n       Your letter states that the repayment of the loan was made \n     with funds from ``an escrow account at Treasury'' and that it \n     constituted a ``debt-for-equity'' swap. These statements are \n     not accurate.\n       On April 20, GM repaid the Treasury loan with cash in an \n     escrow account that it owns. The escrow account was created \n     last summer in connection with the restructuring of GM. The \n     money used to fund the escrow account came from a portion of \n     the proceeds of a loan made by both the Treasury and the \n     Canadian government. The escrowed funds were expected to be \n     used for extraordinary expenses, and a portion of the funds \n     were so used. Treasury retained approval rights over GM's use \n     of fluids from the escrow account in order to protect the \n     taxpayer, but the cash was still the property of GM.\n       In making its April 20 loan repayment, GM determined that \n     it did not need to retain the escrowed funds for expenses. \n     The fact that GM made that determination and repaid the \n     remaining $4.7 billion to the U.S. government now is good \n     news for the company, our investment, and the American \n     people. Consistent with Treasury's goal of recovering funds \n     for the taxpayer and exiting TARP investments as soon as \n     practicable, we approved GM's loan repayment.\n       It has long been public knowledge that GM would use these \n     specific funds to repay the Treasury and Canadian loans, if \n     it did not otherwise need them for expenses. Under GM's loan \n     agreement with Treasury, any funds in the escrow account on \n     June 30, 2010 had to be used to repay the Treasury and \n     Canadian loans. We have highlighted the repayment requirement \n     in our monthly Section 105(a) reports to Congress. During a \n     meeting last fall, we also informed the staff of the Special \n     Inspector General of TARP (SIGTARP), Neil Barofsky, that we \n     expected GM to use these funds to repay these loans. In fact, \n     according to the SIGTARP Report on the Use of Funds (released \n     on December 10, 2009), ``GM officials stated that it intends \n     to seek release of additional escrow funds to repay its \n     outstanding $6.7 billion loan to Treasury and $1.3 billion \n     loan to the Canadian Government.''\n       After the full repayment of the Treasury loan, \n     approximately $6.6 billion remained in GM's escrow account. \n     These funds became unrestricted on April 20 and available for \n     GM's general use.\n       In addition, it is not correct that the timing of the \n     repayment was motivated by concurrent Senate hearings.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the very important \nbill we are very hopeful we can move on today to start the debate on \nWall Street reform. I understand there may be an agreement to move \nforward with this bill. We don't know that yet. If it is true that we \nhave an agreement to start the debate on this bill, then it is very \nfitting that I go through why this bill is so important. If we don't \nhave an agreement, then it is even more fitting because we know the \nAmerican people got severely hurt by the crisis on Wall Street, by the \nfall of many of our financial institutions, and they were not the ones \nwho were supposed to be hurt. So we need to fix this so it doesn't \nhappen again.\n  Nearly 3 years after the financial system began to melt down, America \ncontinues to suffer the effects of the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, homes, \nand their retirement savings. Although some key indicators are \nbeginning to move in the right direction, many families, such as those \nwe know in Minnesota, are still struggling, and the economic damage is \nvery slow to heal in their towns.\n  On Wall Street, however, it seems to be back to business as usual.\n  Last year, Wall Street's largest firms handed out record bonuses \ntotaling nearly $146 billion, an 18-percent increase from 2008. \nMeanwhile, overall U.S. per capita income declined 2.6 percent. So it \nis little surprise that Wall Street financiers are not enthusiastic \nabout reforms that could change the way they do business. In fact, some \nof them claim Wall Street just has a few potholes that need fixing. \nWell, I think they need more than that. What Wall Street needs is more \nstop signs and key intersections and some good traffic cops.\n  This bill we have is the product of months of bipartisan \nnegotiations. For the first time ever, this bill would create a nine-\nmember financial oversight council chaired by the Treasury Secretary \nand made up of Federal financial regulators. This council would serve \nas an early warning system for systemic risk, something that was \nclearly lacking 3 years ago when these institutions that people were \nadvertising as gold and their investments as gold went tumbling down \nonto the people of this country.\n  The domino effect of deeply interconnected financial companies, such \nas insurance giant AIG, didn't just create economic ripples, they sent \na tsunami surging through the entire economy. This financial oversight \ncouncil will be charged with scanning the system for systemic risks and \nputting speed bumps in place to ensure we never see a crisis such as \nthis one again. This council will, for the first time, bring the \nregulators together to form a picture of the entire system, so one \nregulator will not be dealing with one problem while another is dealing \nwith another with no information being shared. This way there will be \none place where they can look at the entire financial system and look \nfor those warning signs of problems.\n  This bill will also stand at the intersection and make firms slow \ndown by increasing the costs of being large and complex. The most \ninterconnected firms will be required to hold larger levels of capital \nto minimize their risk to the system if the investments go bad. All we \nare asking for, so taxpayers don't have to bail out these firms, is \nthat they have significant resources and enough resources on hand in \ncase they face troubled times again. If firms are going to create risk \nto the system, they need to take some responsibility. We clearly saw in \nthis crisis what a lack of capital can do, how it can bring a firm to \nthe brink, and the downward spiral it can cause when they are unable to \nattract new investors.\n  As much as we would like, we simply can't predict how a future crisis \nmight unfold. I believe one of the most important lessons we can take \nfrom this crisis is that the American taxpayer should never again be \nleft on the hook for the unconscionable bets of Wall Street. The \nAmerican taxpayers' money is not meant to be used to play games within \na casino, where you can throw their money around and then maybe some of \nit will come back and some of it will not. We have to make sure this \ndoesn't happen again. Preventing American taxpayers from being forced \nto bail out financial firms starts with strengthening big financial \nfirms to better withstand stress, looking out for systemic risk, and \nputting a price on activities that pose a risk to the financial system.\n  In the event that a firm was to fail, this bill creates a safe way to \nliquidate failed financial firms that will not leave the taxpayer on \nthe hook. First of all, it updates the Federal Reserve's authority to \nallow systemwide support but no longer allows it to prop up an \nindividual firm. Second, it requires large, complex financial companies \nto submit plans for their rapid and orderly shutdown should they start \nto go under. These plans will help regulators understand the structure \nof the companies they oversee and serve as a roadmap for shutting them \ndown if the company fails.\n  Under this plan, most large financial companies are expected to be \nresolved through the bankruptcy process. Bankruptcy allows those who \ninvest in a firm to better access their risks, and it allows the \npossibility that a company will emerge again in some way intact. If we \nhave a situation where a firm would not go into bankruptcy and its \nfailure could bring down the whole system, we make the process of \nresolution as hard as we can on that firm. We start by shutting down \nthe business and throwing out those who caused the mess. This is a very \ndifferent route than we took in this crisis where we propped up firms \nand kept them alive because of the risk it was going to pose for the \nentire financial system. We don't want to be in that position again. \nThe taxpayers don't want to be in that position again.\n  If a firm chooses our resolution, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the \nFederal Reserve must first all agree to put a company into the orderly \nliquidation process. A panel of three bankruptcy judges must then \nconvene and agree within 24 hours that a company is insolvent. At that \npoint, the FDIC would step in and resolve the firm through this orderly \nprocess and in a way that doesn't harm the overall system. The cost of \nresolution would be paid for not by the taxpayer but by a $50 billion \nfund built up over time--and this is key--paid for by the industry, \npaid for by the industry, not by the taxpayers.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about a key portion of the bill that came out \nof the Agriculture Committee, a committee on which I serve, led by \nChairman Lincoln. The portion of that bill I wish to talk about is the \nfocus on transparency and accountability to the over-the-counter \nderivatives market.\n  Bringing transparency and accountability to the over-the-counter \nderivatives market is essential to our economic system and the American \ntaxpayer and is as important as any other piece of reform we are going \nto be debating. Reckless trading of unregulated over-the-counter \nderivatives played a significant role in triggering the financial \ncrisis in the fall of 2008. AIG, using a type of derivative known as a \ncredit default swap, took enormous risks in guaranteeing at least $400 \nbillion worth of other companies' loans, including those of Lehman \nBrothers. When the financial crisis hit and AIG was unable to make good \non its commitments, Treasury and the Federal Reserve were forced to \nstep in to accept untold, unknown risk to the financial system. In\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\nthe end, the government put up $180 billion of taxpayer money to save \nAIG from collapse.\n  I bring up AIG to point out the dangers of an unregulated, over-the-\ncounter derivatives market. Derivatives, when used properly and backed \nby sufficient collateral, play a crucial role in our financial and \neconomic systems. We think about airlines that want to hedge their risk \nwith the price of oil. You think about agribusinesses. All over this \ncountry that goes on. But this is a whole different issue we are \ntalking about. When irresponsible financial institutions are allowed to \nmake unconscionable bets, hidden from the view of the markets and its \nregulators, the stability of our entire financial system is threatened.\n\n  Right now, the over-the-counter market counts its transactions in the \nhundreds of trillions of dollars, but under the current system, there \nare almost no requirements that the most basic terms of these contracts \nor even their existence be disclosed to regulators or the public. Think \nabout it: Trillions of dollars changing hands and no one even knows \nwhat is happening.\n  The goal of the bill we have today is to finally bring transparency \nand accountability to these unregulated markets. For the first time, \nunder this bill, all trades will be required to be reported to the \nregulators and to the public. With this information, regulators will be \nable to effectively monitor risks to the system and prevent market \nmanipulation and abuse. Transparency will also benefit those who use \nderivatives to hedge risks, as they will be better equipped to evaluate \nthe market, as price information will finally be made public. By \nrequiring mandatory clearing and trading for standardized derivatives, \nthis bill will greatly reduce the ability of risk to build up to a \npoint that could, once again, burst and threaten the financial \nstability of our financial system.\n  I have often said that when Wall Street gets a cold, Main Street gets \npneumonia. We can't let this happen again. In this bill, careful \nconsideration has been made to ensure that commercial entities--this \nwas the work done in our Agriculture Committee--to make sure that \ncommercial entities that hedge solely to mitigate their own commercial \nrisk are not brought under requirements meant to address the failures \nof a market they had no hand in. We think about all the people who \ndidn't have a hand in this problem that got affected. We think even \nabout our small banks in the State of Minnesota. They didn't engage in \nthis kind of risky behavior. I think about them sometimes standing \nthere with their briefcases in the heartland, with those credit default \nrisks swirling around their head that they never used or engaged in, \nsaying: Toto, we are not in Kansas anymore. Because, as we know, some \nbanks in this country had a brain. Some banks didn't go to Oz and think \nthey could go back with the American taxpayers' money. So we have to \nremember that as we go forward.\n  But the most important thing is to make sure we put a traffic cop at \nthose intersections, that we put some stop signs at those \nintersections, that Wall Street isn't allowed to drive down in their \nFerraris while the government is following behind in a Model T Ford.\n  Enacting these reforms is not just important for our financial \nmarkets, it is important for ordinary Americans. While very few people \noutside of those involved in these markets understand or see the impact \nof derivatives on their daily lives, their misuse contributed to a \nrecession that left millions without jobs, businesses shuttered, and \ntrillions in household savings lost. The legislation we passed out of \nthe Agriculture Committee and that Chairman Dodd has worked to \nincorporate into this bill will bring these dark markets into the light \nof day and ensure they will never again threaten the stability of this \nfinancial system.\n  It is very important that we bring this before the Senate, that we \nbegin debate on this bill. That is why, as we look at the rumors \nswirling around that, in fact, there is a deal and that we are going to \nbe able to at least begin the debate on whether to proceed--not debate \non the bill--we are still working out the details. We think this is a \ngood bill. We look forward to working with our colleagues on it, but we \ncan't even get to ``go,'' we can't even get to ``start'' if we can't \nget this bill on the floor to debate.\n  So we are looking forward to discussing this bill, debating for the \nAmerican public and getting it done. The Americans who lost their jobs, \ntheir homes and their savings and are scared every day that it is going \nto happen again because of the recklessness of Wall Street deserve no \nless.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the motion to \nproceed to S. 3217 be agreed to; and that once the bill is reported \ntonight, the Senate then proceed to a period of morning business, with \nSenators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, and on \nThursday, April 29, following the recognition of the leaders or their \ndesignees, the Senate then resume consideration of S. 3217; that after \nthe reporting of the bill and recognition of Senators Dodd and Shelby \nto make opening statements on the bill, Senator Lincoln then be \nrecognized to speak for up to 20 minutes; that on Thursday, no \namendments or motions be in order prior to the offering of the Dodd-\nLincoln substitute amendment; and that once the substitute amendment is \noffered, it be considered read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments here to \nthank the distinguished Senator from Alabama who has been our leader on \nthe Banking Committee and an expert on this very complex subject of \nfinancial regulation, for his steadfast effort in bringing us to where \nwe are today. As Senate Republicans plus Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska \nhave demonstrated over the last few days, we believed the bill we \nstarted with was not insignificant but that it needed to be improved. \nSenator Shelby was given the opportunity, as a result of us staying \ntogether, to be empowered to improve the bill that had previously come \nout of the Banking Committee on a straight party-line vote. So I want \nto take the opportunity to thank all of my Republican colleagues, plus \nSenator Nelson of Nebraska, in giving us the opportunity to improve the \nunderlying bill.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Alabama for his efforts in that \nregard. I think we have a better starting place than we would have had \nearlier and we look forward to, as the majority leader indicated, an \nopen amendment process and plenty of opportunities to treat this like \nthe serious comprehensive bill it is. We have many amendments we intend \nto offer. Our members will be prepared to accept reasonable and short \ntime agreements so we can get these amendments up and voted on, and \nhopefully have an opportunity to make further improvements in the bill.\n  I know Senator Shelby may want to make a few observations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Alabama and my \nfriend from Connecticut, but I want to say a few words first. I too \nhave great respect for my friend Senator Shelby. He and I were \nneighbors in the Longworth Building many years ago and we have \nmaintained that friendship since. There are times when we disagree on \nissues but our relationship is one of friendship.\n  Chris Dodd has had an extremely difficult year. He has had to \nlegislate on some of the most difficult issues to come before this \nbody, and he has been the one who has been the chairman of that \ncommittee and had to do it. In addition to that, his dear friend, his \nbest friend, Senator Kennedy, was ill. He had to take over that \ncommittee and do his Banking Committee. It has been a tremendously \ndifficult year for him. He has done it with mastery of the Senate rules \nand with the ability to articulate his position as well as anyone who \nhas ever served in the Senate. I admire and appreciate him so very \nmuch.\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\n  We also have a new chairman, Senator Lincoln, on the Ag Committee. \nShe has done a very good job. She took it over a couple of months ago \nbut stepped into that committee and has done a remarkably good job on \nan extremely difficult issue dealing with derivatives and things such \nas that. I admire her work and I appreciate so much the ability of \nSenator Dodd and her to work together. Their staffs worked all weekend, \ntrying to put together this substitute amendment we will offer \ntomorrow. I am very grateful for their leadership in the conference, \nthe Democratic conference. They do good work all the time.\n  We have so much to do in the weeks ahead in this work period. But \nthis is the issue we are going to go on. The American people waited \nlong enough for their leaders to get to work cleaning up Wall Street--\nfirst on Monday, then on Tuesday, and twice more today. We didn't have \nto vote today. That is a decision that Senator McConnell and I made--\nthat there was no need to have a vote. There was an agreement to move \nto the bill and that is what we have been trying to do all week.\n  Senate Democrats have asked one thing, that we be allowed to debate, \nwe simply be allowed to do our job as legislators and legislate. We \nbelieve in this bill to crack down on Wall Street, to protect families' \nsavings and seniors' pensions. We never asked the Senate to unanimously \nor blindly approve a single policy. We never sought to send this bill \ndirectly from the committee room to the President's desk. The only \nthing we fought for is the opportunity to have that conversation.\n  After months of bipartisan meetings and negotiations, it is time to \nmove this debate from the sidelines to the playing field, to the Senate \nfloor, which is where it belongs. Senate Republicans have finally \nagreed to let us begin this debate. I appreciate that and I hope it \nforeshadows more cooperation to come. I know Republicans have their own \nsuggestions and amendments for improving this bill. So do Democrats. \nNow that we will be able to begin that process, the American people \nwill finally have the opportunity to watch and weigh those ideas. \nNothing has changed from our end since Monday. The only thing that is \ndifferent is the date. We have always wanted to start the debate on \nWall Street reform with an open, bipartisan amendment process.\n  I will offer the first amendment combining the best parts of the \nBanking Committee and Agriculture Committee's bills. That will be what \nwe will work from. Obstruction has wasted enough of the American \npeople's time. Now let's do our work and do our utmost to make the \nAmerican people proud of our efforts. Let's work for them, the American \npeople. Let them know Wall Street needs reforming. Democrats and \nRepublicans all over America believe it, so let's show the American \npeople we will listen to what they say.\n  There will be no more votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say again before turning to \nSenator Shelby how much we appreciate his leadership on this and how \nmuch we appreciate all of our Republican colleagues, plus Senator \nNelson, giving him the ability to improve the bill that came out of \ncommittee. Much has indeed changed since Monday. I thank Senator Shelby \nfor his leadership. I also commend Senator Dodd for the spirit in which \nthose discussions were commenced.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be brief.\n  First, I thank the Republican leader Senator McConnell for his kind \nwords. Also I thank my friend, the majority leader, Senator Reid, for \nhelping bring us where we are today.\n  But more than that, I commend Senator Dodd, the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, with whom I have worked for years and years. We have \nworked exceedingly closely on many issues dealing with the Banking \nCommittee. What we are bringing to the floor now is something very \ncomplex, very far reaching. The idea that something should be too big \nto fail is very important to me. Nothing should be too big to fail, in \nmy judgment, in this country.\n  I commend Senator Dodd. In our negotiations, they haven't been all \nloss--we have reached some assurances in that. He and his staff have \nmade some recommendations that we like. We made some they liked. I \nthink we have made real progress. I know we have to seal it all, but I \nthink Senator Dodd is working in good faith on that.\n  But we have the derivatives title and we have the consumer products \ndeal. We have not been able to resolve those yet. I hope we will on the \nfloor of the Senate. We have moved to a new forum and it is going to be \na very important debate in the weeks ahead here because this is very \nimportant to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me begin by thanking the majority leader for his work. \nI thank the minority leader as well. This has been a bit acrimonious \nover the last 10 days or so as we tried to get to the floor with this \nbill.\n  Of course I thank Richard Shelby. He and I, as he points out, have \nbeen working together over the last about 37 months during my \nstewardship of the Banking Committee that I inherited in January of \n2007.\n  I noted the other day there are some 42 measures we brought out of \nour committee and 37 of them have become the law of the land. This is a \ngood result. We will now be on this bill, which the American people \nwant us to be on. This is an important issue. As I pointed out this \nmorning, we had the headlines, the hearings here yesterday involving \nmortgage deals and the other headlines about Greece and its debt. Its \nbonds were sinking, causing economic problems in Europe and potentially \nhere.\n  These problems are huge. As Senator Shelby has said and I have said \nover and over, this is a complex area of law we are talking about and \nit has to be gotten right. We have had very good conversations on a \nnumber of issues, but on this over many weeks, going back, obviously, \nand clearly we both share, as everyone does in this Chamber, our \ndetermination that we never again have institutions that become too big \nto fail where there is that implicit guarantee that the Federal \nGovernment will bail them out.\n  I am satisfied that our bill does that already, but I appreciate that \nthere are others who would like to see it tighter, who think we can do \nmore to make it better and more workable. I am anxious to hear them.\n  I know our colleague from California, Barbara Boxer, has some ideas \non this as well that she has raised and I mentioned those with my \nfriend from Alabama. He has raised issues with me that I like as well, \nand he can help us get there. As he rightly points out, we have not \nsealed anything but we have had great conversations, as two people of \ngood will can have, that I think will allow us to get there.\n  We are going to have a very busy couple of weeks coming up now. There \nare a lot of Members who have very strong feelings about this bill. My \njob--our job--will be to see to it people have a chance to offer their \namendments, to debate them, to go through that process.\n  I may sound pretty old-fashioned in this regard. I pointed out last \nnight, I first got involved in this Chamber as a young person sitting \nhere in the same outfits as these young people in their blue suits, as \na page, watching Lyndon Johnson sitting in that chair where you are, \nMr. President, and watching Mike Mansfield in that chair over here and \nEverett Dirkson in that chair.\n  I remember sitting there and listening to the debates on civil rights \nin the early 1960s, when this Chamber, in difficult moments, worked \ntogether to achieve great results for our country. I have great \nreverence for this institution and I want to see it work as our \nFounders intended, where you have a great, important debate--and this \nis one--that we work together as American citizens chosen by our \nrespective States to represent them in this great hall. That is what I \nintend to do as the manager of this bill, to make sure that each and \nevery one of my colleagues--whether they sit on this side of the aisle \nor that side of the aisle--are all in this Chamber together to try to \nimprove the quality of life for the people who have been so badly hurt, \nhomes\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\nlost, jobs that have evaporated, retirement accounts that disappeared \nfor people. They want to see us work together to get a job done to make \na difference for our country and I firmly believe we can do that. I \nwill do my very best, I say to my friend from Alabama, I say to the \nminority leader, as I said to the majority leader, to act with \nfairness, to work together to try to resolve matters so we can have a \ngood outcome on this bill.\n  Obviously we cannot predict that. I know there are some who want to \nmake this a great fight--that this is a great, great issue, maybe, for \nthe day or the week you do it--who wins, who loses. That is a great \nstory. But this is not an athletic contest we are involved in. It is a \ndecision to try to put our country on a far more sound and secure \nfooting than it is today. I look forward to the opportunity to work, as \nI have, with Senator Shelby. We are good friends. I admire him \nimmensely. He was chairman of this committee before I was. He \nunderstands the job of being a chairman.\n  I am determined to get this job right. I encourage our colleagues who \nhave ideas and amendments to come forward and share them with us. We \nare going to set up shop over the weekend to make sure we are there. So \nwe have ideas to consider, accept, maybe modify, make it work right. If \nthat spirit comes forward we can do a good job here and we can leave \nthis Chamber at the end of this Congress, knowing we confronted a \nserious problem and stepped up to the best of our ability to try to \nsolve it for the people we seek to represent.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader and the staff and others for their \nwork. I thank Senator Shelby in his work. This conversation will \ncontinue. We have a lot of work to do. It has been very worthwhile and \nvery productive over these last number of weeks and we intend to keep \nit in that form. I thank the minority leader as well and the Republican \nConference. I know it must have been probably a healthy, good, vibrant \nconversation for the last hour and a half in there. But for those who \nquestion whether we can do this, I want this institution to get back \nagain to the idea of listening to each other, debating the issues, \ntaking our votes and putting together the best product we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2733-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2733-S2750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, since the beginning of the financial \ncrisis, the Federal Reserve, the Fed, has provided over $2 trillion in \ntaxpayer-backed loans and other financial assistance to some of the \nlargest financial institutions and corporations in the world. Let me \nrepeat that: over $2 trillion--with a ``t''--$2 trillion.\n  Over a year ago, as a member of the Budget Committee, I asked Ben \nBernanke, the Chairman of the Fed, a very simple question--very simple \nquestion; it could not be simpler--and the question, in so many words, \nwas: Mr. Bernanke, you lent out $2 trillion. Who got that money? Who \nreceived the money? What were the terms of those loans?\n  Mr. Bernanke's answer was: No; I am not going to tell you, Senator \nSanders. I am not going to tell the Budget Committee, and I am not \ngoing to tell the American people.\n  I think that is outrageous. I think when $2 trillion of taxpayers' \nmoney is placed at risk, the American people have a right to know. How \nmany debates have we had on the floor of the Senate about legislation \ndealing with $5 million, $30 million, with feverish debate--whether it \nis a good idea or a bad idea--and now you are looking at trillions of \ndollars of taxpayer money being placed at risk, and we do not know who \nreceived that. That, to me, is an outrage and that, to me, is \nunacceptable.\n  On that very day, after Ben Bernanke denied the American people the \nright to know who received those loans, I introduced legislation \nrequiring the Fed to put that information on their Web site.\n  The Presiding Officer knows as well as I do, millions of lives have \nbeen ruined by the greed, the recklessness, and the illegal behavior of \nWall Street. While the Fed was providing secret loans, at virtually no \ninterest, to some of the largest financial institutions in this \ncountry, millions of Americans were losing their jobs, their homes, \ntheir life savings, their ability to send their kids to college--as a \ndirect result of the same Wall Street firms the Fed was propping up.\n  So you have a situation where all over this country families are \nsuffering, small- and medium-sized businesses are in desperate need of \naffordable loans. Yet you have the Fed providing trillions of dollars \nto the people who caused the recession and to some of the wealthiest \nand most powerful CEOs in the country.\n  The very least we can do for the American people is to tell them, to \ngive them the information as to who got bailed out by the Fed. I do not \nthink that is too much to ask. We have to explore whether there were \nconflicts of interest. How does it work when financial institutions get \nhuge amounts of zero or near zero interest loans? Who sits on the \ncommittee? Are there conflicts of interest?\n  We have to know, for example, what I believe to be the case: that \nsome of those financial institutions that received billions in zero or \nnear zero interest loans may have invested that money in T-bills, in \nTreasury bonds, earning 3 or 4 percent interest. What kind of scam is \nthat? You get zero interest loans from the Fed, and you invest in \ngovernment-backed T bonds at 3 or 4 percent interest. That is an \nincredible scam. Did some of those financial institutions do that? I \nsuspect they did. But we do not know what they did with that money and \nwe have a right to find out.\n  Let us be very clear: The money put at risk does not belong to the \nFed. It belongs to the American people. The American people have a \nright to know where their taxpayer dollars are going. Therefore, during \nthe debate on financial reform, I will be offering an amendment to \naudit the Federal Reserve and to require that the Fed release all the \ndetails regarding the more than $2 trillion in virtually zero interest \nloans the Fed has provided to large financial institutions since the \nbeginning of the economic crisis.\n  We talk a lot around here about the need for bipartisanship or \ntripartisanship. I am an Independent.\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\nWell, this amendment does that. I do not know that there is any \namendment out there that has more bipartisan support. This amendment is \nbeing cosponsored by Senators Feingold, Leahy, Wyden, Dorgan, and \nBoxer; Democrats. It is being cosponsored by Senators DeMint, McCain, \nGrassley, Vitter, Brownback, Graham, Risch, and Wicker; Republicans. \nBut, quite significantly, on the base bill I introduced, from which \nthis amendment comes, this legislation is being supported by 32 \ncosponsors; that is, 22 Republicans and 10 Democrats, and they run the \ngamut from some of the most conservative Members of the Senate to some \nof the most progressive.\n  The Senators who are supporting the base bill are Senators Barrasso, \nBennett, Boxer, Brownback, Burr, Cardin, Chambliss, Coburn, Cochran, \nCornyn, Crapo, DeMint, Dorgan, Feingold, Graham, Grassley, Harkin, \nHatch, Hutchison, Inhofe, Isakson, Landrieu, Leahy, Lincoln, McCain, \nMurkowski, Risch, Thune, Vitter, Webb, Wicker, and Wyden.\n  That is a very broad cross-section of the Senate, from some of the \nmost conservative to some of the most progressive Members on the base \nbill, who say it is absurd that the Fed could lend out trillions of \ndollars without the American people knowing who has received that \nmoney.\n  Let me tell you what our amendment would do, and it is pretty simple. \nNo. 1, it would require the nonpartisan Government Accountability \nOffice, the GAO, to conduct an independent and comprehensive audit of \nthe Fed within 1 year. Secondly, it would require the Fed to disclose \nthe names of the financial institutions that received over $2 trillion \nin virtually zero interest loans since the start of the recession. That \nis it. That is the whole amendment. Pretty simple. I would hope and \nexpect we would have widespread bipartisan support for this amendment \nwhen it gets to the floor.\n  This amendment also has widespread community support from \norganizations all over this country. It has the support of Americans \nfor Financial Reform--a coalition of over 250 consumer, employee, \ninvestor, community, and civil rights groups, including the AFL-CIO and \nthe AARP.\n  I should also mention that increasing transparency at the Fed is \nobviously something the American people want to see, and poll after \npoll suggests that.\n  This amendment is similar to the Federal Reserve Transparency Act \nthat was introduced in the House by Congressman Ron Paul and now has \n320 bipartisan cosponsors. That is a lot. There are 435 Members of the \nHouse, and 320 are on the House bill. A version of that bill passed the \nHouse Financial Services Committee by a vote of 43 to 28 and was \nincorporated into the financial reform bill that passed the House last \nDecember. So not only do we have widespread bipartisan support in the \nSenate, that same type of support exists in the House.\n  Last year, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said Congress \nshould ask the Fed to put this information ``on the Internet like \nthey've done with the recovery package and the budget.'' That is \nexactly what this amendment would do. Interestingly enough, not only do \nwe have widespread bipartisan support in the Congress, not only has the \nHouse moved vigorously on this issue already, but, importantly, the \ncourts have ruled in support of what we are trying to do.\n  Bloomberg News has been very aggressive on this issue, and they have \nwon court decisions requiring the Fed to release this information to \nthe public. But despite widespread congressional support, despite two \ncourt decisions, the Fed continues to resist the transparency which our \ncountry desperately needs.\n  As long as the Fed is allowed to keep the information on their loans \nsecret, we may never know the true financial condition of the banking \nsystem. This has resulted in a whole myriad of problems, and I think it \nis time we brought some sunshine to the goings on of the Fed.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: The American people are outraged, \nregardless of their political views, by the behavior of Wall Street. \nThey have seen the greed of Wall Street lead us into a recession in \nwhich millions of jobs have been lost, homes have been lost, savings \nhave been lost, families have been destroyed, and they want to make \nsure we do everything we can to make sure what caused this terrible \nrecession never happens again.\n\n  I think one of the most important things we can do in terms of Wall \nStreet reform is to bring transparency to the Fed. So this is an \nincredibly simple amendment. This is an amendment that has grassroots \nsupport. This is an amendment that has support from the most \nprogressive and conservative Members of the Congress.\n  When I bring up this amendment, I certainly hope we can get a great \ndeal of support from Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Vermont yield for \na question?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am very pleased to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont, through the \nChair, about another issue in this bill relative to the interest rates \nthat are being charged across America. I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Vermont if he would tell me his take or evaluation of the \nprovision in this bill which exempts usury laws and interest rates from \nthe consideration of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has an interest in some exploitation \nthat is occurring in her State of North Carolina--frankly, in my State \nof Illinois, and probably across this Nation--by the so-called payday \nloan and title loan operations, where average people who are struggling \neconomically go in for high-interest loans that are then rolled over, \ntime and time and time again, until they lose whatever security has \nbeen offered for the loan and, frankly, find themselves even deeper in \ndebt.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont, whom I have discussed \nthis with on many occasions, his thoughts about consumer financial \nprotections and the interest rates being charged across this Nation.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my friend from Illinois for raising that \nquestion. I wish to congratulate him because our colleagues should know \nhe has been a leader on this issue for many years and has already \nachieved some significant success.\n  My memory is, we had payday lenders that, if you can believe this, \nwere charging men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces--who, in many \ncases, do not have a lot of money, who are trying to take care of their \nfamilies--outrageously high interest rates on check cashing and payday \nloans. The Senator from Illinois led the effort successfully to put a \ncap on that, and I thank him very much for doing that. That is a start.\n  But, clearly, as the Senator from Illinois indicates, we have to go \nfurther. Here is the story. Just a couple weeks ago, there was a rally, \nright here on Capitol Hill, led by religious groups--religious groups--\nwho said it is immoral and unacceptable that in the United States of \nAmerica we are now seeing usury and loan sharking taking place by some \nof the largest financial institutions in this country. So we are not \njust talking, I would say to my friend from Illinois, about an economic \nissue; we are talking about a basically moral issue. If one reads the \nBible, the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Koran, every major \nreligion on this planet has said that usury is immoral; that if you are \ndesperate and you need money, I cannot charge you outrageously high \ninterest rates. That is immoral and the wrong thing to do. Yet in this \ncountry today, as a result of a Supreme Court decision some years ago, \nwe have millions of Americans who are paying 25, 30, 35, 40 percent \ninterest rates. This is not from loan shark gangsters on a street \ncorner in Chicago; this is from some of the largest, most distinguished \nfinancial institutions in the world. We have to put an end to that.\n\n  I would tell my friend from Illinois that the legislation we have \noffered would put a cap of 15 percent, except under extraordinary \ncircumstances, on the interest rates banks can charge the American \npeople. We came up with this idea because this is what credit unions in \nthis country have been doing for several decades, and they have been \ndoing it successfully.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to ask through the Chair again--\nfirst, I wish to give credit where it is due. The original amendment we\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\ntalked about that protects military families was offered by Senator Jim \nTalent of Missouri, and I supported it and everyone supported it \nbecause we found men and women in the military trained to defend our \ncountry who signed up for these payday loans and quick loans, and they \nbecame so deeply mired in debt they were forced to leave military \nservice. So we said as a matter of national security, we can't \nsacrifice well-trained men and women who can keep us safe as a nation \nto loan sharks who have these storefront operations in my hometown of \nSpringfield and in your hometown in Vermont and all across the Nation.\n  I would say to the Senator from Vermont--and he and I have joked \nabout this a little bit--I tried to come up with a number to say this \nwill be the maximum interest rate that can be charged. I went to a \nmutual friend whom I respect and said: What is a number that no one can \nargue with? She said 36 percent. When I mentioned that number to people \nback in Illinois and other places, they were aghast. They said: We \ndon't want to pay 36 percent for anything. I said: I don't either. But \nthis is like a ceiling.\n  Well, it turned out it is a little more confusing than illuminating. \nI happen to think the Senator from Vermont is certainly right with the \ncap he is suggesting.\n  Now, is it not true, I ask the Senator from Vermont, as this rollcall \nvote reflects, if the Republican Senators in this Chamber continue this \nfilibuster against this financial reform bill, this Wall Street reform \nbill, this consumer financial protection bill, we can't even engage in \nthis debate, let alone this amendment, to try to protect families \nacross America from being preyed upon by these outrageous reptilian \ncredit operations?\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Senator from Illinois is, of course, absolutely \nright. The point the Senator from Illinois is making, which makes \neminent sense, is if our friends disagree, if our friends want to offer \nan amendment, if the Republicans want to alter the bill, that is their \nright. That is what the Senate is about. But we can't proceed or go \nforward in putting a cap on the outrageous interest rates financial \ninstitutions are charging the American people--the loan sharking--\nunless we get this bill going. We can't talk about Fed transparency \nunless we get this bill going.\n  So I certainly agree with my friend from Illinois. People have a \nright to disagree, but the American people are disgusted and frustrated \nwith what is going on on Wall Street. They want action. So to simply \nhave our Republican friends saying: No, no, no, we are not going \nforward, doesn't make any sense to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would ask the Senator from Vermont \nthrough the Chair, as informative and as entertaining as our \npresentations are on the floor, the fact is, 98 chairs are empty on the \nSenate floor, chairs that could be filled with Members of the Senate \nfrom both political parties debating the issues we are talking about; \nactually voting on amendments, proposing changes in the law to \nultimately work with the House and send it to the President to solve \nsome of the problems of our Nation. But as long as we are facing--and \nwe have had three filibuster votes so far this week with more to \nfollow--as long as we are facing this Republican filibuster where not \none single Republican Senator will break with the Republican caucus or \nthe Wall Street position that opposes any reform, we can't even bring \nthis bill to the floor for debate so we can address the biggest \neconomic and financial challenge America has faced in decades.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, my friend from Illinois is exactly \nright. Let me just add to it. We have the House of Representatives that \nvoted to go forward. We have the President of the United States who \nwants to go forward. We have 57, or whatever the number is, Senators \nwho wish to go forward. Now is the time to go forward.\n  I would add to what my friend from Illinois has just said. Let's be \nvery clear about this. Last year, in 2009, as I understand it, our \nfriends on Wall Street who are doing everything they can to make sure \nCongress does nothing to reform the way they do business--that is what \nthey want; let's be clear about it--do you know what they spent last \nyear? I would tell my friend from Illinois that my understanding is \nthey spent $300 million on lobbying and campaign contributions.\n  I know my friend from Illinois knows that we can't walk around the \nCapitol without bumping in to one or another lobbyist representing Wall \nStreet. Why are they here? Why are they representing hedge fund \nmanagers who make billions of dollars in a year? They want to be able \nto continue to do the exact same things they have done in the past \nwhich has led to this terrible recession.\n  So let's not be naive. There are huge amounts of money flooding \nCapitol Hill right now, and the goal is, no matter what anybody may \nsay: Let's do no Wall Street reform.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding for \nquestions. I yield the floor and unless someone----\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nIllinois for his continued efforts on Wall Street reform and the \nexcellent work he has done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, we just witnessed a few moments ago the \nthird attempt to try to do something about financial reform legislation \nin this body, and for the third time, it went down. I am an old \nbaseball player. I played a lot of baseball in my young days, and there \nis a rule in baseball that says three strikes and you are out. Well, we \nhave had three tries at this financial reform, and I will tell my \ndistinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle: We are not \nout. We are just beginning to fight under the circumstances we are \nconfronted with because we are fighting on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Earlier this week, our distinguished majority leader called for a \nvote to open the debate on major financial reform. We have seen well-\ndesigned proposals from the Senator from Connecticut, Chairman Dodd. \nThis bill reflects the priorities articulated by President Obama and \nsupported by an overwhelming majority of the American people. It will \nend the so-called ``too big to fail'' and prevent massive banks from \nmaking risky decisions that threaten the entire American economy. It \nwill eliminate the need for government bailouts, and it will institute \ncommonsense regulations so companies cannot create investments that are \ndesigned to fail and then bet against them.\n  In short, this legislation is a good starting point. As a matter of \nfact, we have heard Chairman Dodd say time and time again we have to \nget it on the Senate floor so we can improve this legislation. I know I \nam supportive of a couple of amendments that would be beneficial to \nimprove the legislation. It may not be the complete Wall Street reform \npackage in its final form, but it contains a number of good provisions, \nand it is worth debating. So I am asking my colleagues, let's stop \ndebating to debate.\n\n  The majority leader scheduled a vote to bring this bill to the floor \nso Members of both parties could offer amendments and make \nimprovements. This was not a vote on the legislation itself. Leader \nReid was not asking the Senate to pass the bill without debate or \nwithout amendment. He simply wanted to start the process. He wanted to \nbegin deliberations on the floor of this Chamber in front of C-SPAN \ncameras and in front of the American people. But when the roll was \ncalled and my colleagues and I came to the Chamber, every single one of \nmy Republican friends voted to block the debate, plus one of ours.\n  So we will try again, I hope, this afternoon, if not tomorrow, but we \nare not playing baseball on the floor of the Senate. This is not the \nall-American game, but it is the all-American future.\n  There was a second vote to start debate--to move ahead this process \nand take up the consideration of financial reform. But for a third \ntime, my Republican friends stood in the way. They know they will have \nplenty of opportunity to try and defeat the bill once it\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nis on the Senate floor, but they decided to drag their feet anyway.\n  We have seen this kind of thing before. This is the same Republican \nplaybook we saw with health care reform, the same obstructionism, the \nsame tired politics. In the past, they have been able to use this \nstrategy to score political points. This time, I would respectfully \nsuggest that my Republican friends have miscalculated. The issue of \nhealth care reform was complicated, so when it came time for debate, it \nwas easy to distract and delay and to spread misinformation.\n  It was easy to muddy the waters so they could gain traction and delay \nPresident Obama's agenda. When the health care debate was over, good \npolicy won out over good politics, and we passed the bill--but not \nbefore my friends on the other side had scored some political points.\n  This time it is different. Financial reform itself is very complex. \nThat is why it is so easy for big banks to take advantage of consumers. \nThat is why it is difficult to apply the kind of oversight we should \nhave seen in the years leading up to the recent collapse.\n  The issue itself is hard. This time around, the tactics of \ndistraction and delay will not work. That is because Americans are \nsmarter than that. They know who the bad guys are.\n  About 2 years ago, Lehman brothers was one of the first dominoes to \nfall. Next came Bernie Madoff. Then a handful of other Ponzi schemes \ncame crashing down. Most recently--just yesterday--we witnessed Goldman \nSachs, one of the largest and most respected firms on Wall Street, was \ncharged with fraud.\n  When it comes to financial reform, we know where the problem lies. My \nRepublican friends can try to distract and obstruct all they want, but \nthey will not succeed in confusing the American people. Ordinary folks \nhave had their pocketbooks bled dry by this financial crisis. They have \nseen their hard-earned savings disappear and their future become \ndramatically less secure, and they know exactly who to blame.\n  For far too long, Wall Street banks have been subject to relaxed \noversight. As a result, the focus of their business has changed. It \nstopped being about lending money to businesses, making smart \ninvestments, and encouraging free enterprise. When I was in the banking \nbusiness, that is what we did. I was at the biggest bank in Illinois, \nthe seventh largest bank in America, where we worked with companies, \nmade loans, collected interest, and took the people's deposits in and \npaid them interest. And we kept the economy going.\n  Instead, Wall Street has basically turned into a casino. Look at the \nderivatives market. Here you essentially have an object that is being \ntraded that has no value of its own. It has no ties to the actual \neconomy. There is no product, no business idea, and no actual \ninvestment. It is just a high-stakes bet.\n  Without intelligent risk management, capital standards, and basic \nrules of the road, these bets have the potential to undermine the \nstrength of our entire economy. Wall Street is a casino gone wild, and \nthey are gambling with our money not theirs. They are making money off \nof our money.\n  The American people know this. They can see through the distractions \nand political posturing. They recognize the need to reform Wall Street \nso we can end bailouts, put commonsense rules in place, and make sure \nwe never experience this kind of economic crisis ever again.\n  I am not sure what my Republican friends hope to gain by blocking our \ndebate on this bill. They say they want to improve it, but that is \nexactly what we would be able to do once it is on the floor. Maybe they \nbelieve they can water down our reform package by dragging out this \nprocess. Maybe they would like the chance to hold some more Wall Street \nfundraisers before they have to take a vote on the legislation itself. \nMaybe they simply don't have an alternative plan, and they know they \ncannot win this argument on the floor of the Senate, with the eyes of \nthe Nation on them.\n  I am not sure what they hope to gain by stalling financial reform. I \nurge my distinguished colleagues on the other side to please let us \nmove ahead with this process. I urge them to set aside these political \ntactics and bring their ideas to the table so we can strengthen this \nbill and make sure our economic future is safe.\n  I call upon them to join us in debating, amending, and improving this \nimportant legislation rather than dragging their feet on a bill that \nhas so much public support.\n  When we pass this into law, after extensive discussion, it will be a \nvictory for the American people. If my Republican friends join us in \nthis effort, it can be a victory for both political parties, as well. \nWe will all benefit. The American people will benefit.\n  This legislation deserves to be debated in open session. I ask my \nRepublican friends to let us move ahead. But if they will not, and they \ncontinue to delay and obstruct, then I challenge them to come to the \nfloor and explain. I challenge any one of my distinguished colleagues \non the other side of the aisle to walk into the Senate Chamber today \nand seek recognition from the Chair. I challenge them to stand before \nthe American people and tell them why American families should be asked \nto fund Wall Street's recklessness and greed.\n  I want them to explain that, Mr. President. I believe we need to end \nthese practices. I believe we need to take up the issue of financial \nreform without delay. If my friends on the other side disagree, it is \ntheir privilege to do so. But I believe they owe the American people an \nexplanation. I am pretty sure it will be very difficult to explain to \nthem why they are holding up this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am delighted to join in this debate, and I \ninvite my friends on the other side to listen to what the people in \ncommunities in our home States are saying, who don't spend time \nsoliciting funds on Wall Street.\n  Let's be very clear: We all agree we need to hold Wall Street \naccountable for the havoc wreaked on Main Street. We all agree we need \nto enact reform to prevent another financial crisis. Where we disagree \non is what the responsible reform looks like. I have real concerns \nthat, in its current form, the Democrats' bill, written with the White \nHouse, is a massive government overreach that will punish Main Street, \nhurt families, and cost jobs by stifling small businesses and \nentrepreneurs.\n  To sum it up, Democrats want to treat Main Street, our community \nbanks, our farm lenders, and our auto dealers like they were Goldman \nSachs or others on Wall Street. We Republicans want to ensure we fix \nWall Street, without crippling Main Street. The only way to do that is \nto force the Democrats to listen to the concerns of Main Street, to \nopen this up and make it a bipartisan process. It has not been, and it \nisn't going to be until we get some discussion and real substantive \nchanges in what I view as a very dangerous bill to the economic climate \nand health of our country, our States, our communities, and the \ncreation of jobs.\n  Today, let me share with you some of the concerns I have heard from \nMain Street. Like families in every community and every State, small \nbusinesses were the victims. They weren't the perpetrators of the \nfinancial crisis caused, among other places, on Wall Street.\n  Small businesses were not responsible for the financial crisis and \nshould not be treated as if they were. But that is exactly what this \nbill does. This 1,400-page bill reaches far beyond Wall Street and will \nimpose new costs and onerous new regulations on small businesses to fix \na problem they were not responsible for causing. In short, this bill \nwould change the way every American does business.\n  We are not just talking about changing the way Wall Street banks do \nbusiness, but also how every community banker, local dentist, farm \nlender, and auto dealer does business. I urge my colleagues to take \ntime away from the floor and listen to the people at home. They have a \nvery different message than that which we are hearing from our friends \non the other side of the aisle.\n  These concerns are not just Republican concerns. I hope my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are also hearing from their constituents \nback home about disturbing provisions in the Democrats' proposal and \nhave begun to agree with Senate Republicans that there is a lot of work \nto be\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\ndone before we bring this 1,400-page monstrosity to the floor.\n  Don't misunderstand me. Like the nearly two-thirds of all Americans \nwho favor some sort of reform of Wall Street, so do I and my Republican \ncolleagues. But we need responsible and bipartisan reform that all \nAmericans and businesses can be proud of. I want to work with my \nfriends on the other side to ensure that the concerns I have heard from \nMissourians--1,000 miles away from Wall Street--are addressed as the \nprocess moves forward.\n\n  First, I continue to be stumped that any real form of our financial \nsystem could ignore Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were \nsignificant--if not the majority--contributors to the financial crisis. \nBut that is what this bill does. That is a mistake, and so is leaving \nout the rating agencies who gave triple-A ratings to bad paper that was \nfoisted on the system.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--these government-sponsored GSEs--\ncontributed to the financial meltdown by buying high-risk loans made to \npeople who could not afford them. In addition to the cost to taxpayers, \nthese irresponsible actions turned the American dream into the American \nnightmare for too many families who faced foreclosure, lost their \nhomes, which devastated entire neighborhoods and communities as the \nproperty values diminished, as well as the credit rating of the \nfamilies displaced.\n  Responsible reform must address the GSEs. Responsible reform would \nput an end to the taxpayer-funded bailout of Fannie and Freddie and \nrefocus them on promoting affordable housing.\n  Next, it is critical that in reforming Wall Street, we are not \npunishing Main Street. Instead, we should be protecting small business \nstartups that are so critical to job creation.\n  Unfortunately, this bill will kill small business startups. While \ntitle IX of the Dodd bill has been little noticed, it would have \ndevastating consequences. Specifically, this provision would kill small \nbusiness startups by delaying and limiting the availability of private \ninvestor seed capital, which is essential for the survival and growth \nof these startups.\n  Through new, burdensome regulation by the SEC, innovators and \nentrepreneurs would be subject to registering with the Commission for a \n4-month review before they could get out and start soliciting money. \nThis tying up of vital venture capital dollars needed for immediate use \nby small businesses would cripple their startup efforts. This is not a \nmeasure that will protect people from Wall Street. This is not a \nmeasure needed because venture capitalists and small startup \nentrepreneurs and innovators were causing the crisis. No, they are part \nof the solution of the jobless problems we have now.\n  This provision is an overreach by the Federal Government, which would \nshut down the job creation that Main Street provides, which this \ncountry desperately needs. Raising the net worth threshold for those \nwho can invest in these venture capital firms to $2.3 million from the \nexisting $1 million, and raising the annual household income threshold \nto $450,000, as the Dodd bill proposes to do, would disqualify two-\nthirds of the current accredited investors, according to the Wall \nStreet Journal, who otherwise would help fund small startups in our \ncommunities. These are the people whom these innovators and \nentrepreneurs have to go to, and this will make it impossible for them \nto get the money they need. Therefore, some woman, some man with a \ngreat idea is much less likely in your hometown to be able to get the \nfunds she or he needs to start a business.\n\n  I believe strongly--and I have always said and will continue to say--\nthat small businesses and the startup companies are the backbone of our \ncountry. I understand the critical role these so-called angel investors \ncan play in the creation and development of new companies, small or \nlarge. Let me tell you about my position. Right now, in Missouri, I \nhave been working to help build an agri-biotech corridor across the \nState. In Missouri, we have the potential to foster a whole new \nindustry in advanced agricultural research and biotechnology. This \nagriculture research and biotech industry is our best opportunity to \nstimulate and create high-paying skilled jobs in rural Missouri, rural \nAmerica, and in the cities as well.\n  The stimulus these biotech companies are spurring in Missouri is also \nhappening in other States across the Nation. According to the Kauffman \nFoundation, located in Kansas City, between 1980 and 2005, companies \nless than 5 years old accounted for all--all--net job growth in the \nUnited States. As a matter of fact, the same study showed that in 2008, \nangel investors provided roughly $19 billion in more than 55,000 \ncompanies. You are going to put an end to that with this bill?\n  Let us go back and think about it before we bring this monstrosity to \nthe floor. The new bill, if enacted, would deny immediate access to \ncapital. If enacted, it would say to innovators and entrepreneurs: You \nare too small to succeed, too small to survive. That is far different \nfrom what this bill was promised and promoted as doing--stopping too \nbig to fail. Yes, I am going to see in my communities and you are going \nto see in your communities too small to survive. That is not where we \nshould be going.\n  Killing small business startups and jobs on Main Street is not the \nonly unintended consequence of the Democrats' current proposal that has \ncome to light. Caught up in the Democrats' fervor to pass a bill--any \nbill--without careful consideration, are members of the U.S. military \nand their families. Last week, I heard from active-duty and retired \nmilitary members who fear this bill would hurt their financial \nsecurity. You see, under the Democrats' bill, United Services \nAutomobile Association--USAA, a financial and insurance provider for \nmembers of the U.S. military and their families--would, after an 87-\nyear track record, no longer be able to manage their own portfolio.\n  Also as a result of the Dodd bill, this company that serves our \nmilitary and veterans would have their ability to offer certain \ncompetitive products to servicemembers and their families jeopardized \nand their ability to return money to servicemembers and their families \nlimited by this massive expansion of government authority. This must be \nfixed. I would urge my colleagues to listen to the military and \nveterans and their families in your States. See what they think.\n  Unfortunately, the unintended consequences of this bill keep piling \nup. The next major concern I have heard from Missouri community banks \nthat provide critical lending to families and small businesses is the \ncreation of the so-called Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--CFPB. \nThis massive new government bureaucracy has unprecedented authority and \nenforcement powers to impose mandates on any entities that extend \ncredit. We are not just talking about big Wall Street banks here but \nalso your community banker, your local dentist. Dentists are telling me \nthat if they offer credit, they would be regulated. Farm lenders would \nfind it very difficult for them to be able to operate to make their \nfarm loans and to be able to hedge the risk that they normally do. Auto \ndealers can sell cars only through the benefit of private sector \nfinancing. As a result, there will be no choice but to pass the costs \non for this financing, if they can get it, to the consumers--the very \npeople this bill is supposed to protect. And it may cut some of them \nout of getting credit altogether.\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses, a strong voice for \nsmall businesses, voiced their serious concern over the creation of \nthis new bureaucracy. I am sure you all have received it, but if you \nhave not, I would urge you to check your mail, because the letter from \nthe NFIB to Congress says:\n\n       These small businesses had nothing to do with the Wall \n     Street meltdown and should not be faced with onerous new and \n     duplicative regulations because of a problem they did not \n     cause. Further, as the most recent NFIB Small Business \n     Economic Trends survey shows, small businesses continue to \n     struggle with lost sales, and such regulations could make \n     these problems worse--stifling any small business recovery.\n\n  In other words, they are saying: We do this and small businesses are \ngoing to be even less likely to be able to create jobs. We have already \nput too much debt on the Federal books. We are threatening to increase \ntheir taxes by a tremendous amount, and now we see regulations that are \ngoing to interfere with their normal credit operations. That is a cause \nfor concern.\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\n  This very high unemployment the stimulus bill didn't touch, other \nthan getting more people working for the Federal Government. It was \nsupposed to bring our unemployment rate down to 8 percent, but it is \ngoing to continue to fail and fail miserably if we stifle the ability \nof small businesses to create jobs.\n  The only way to ensure that the CFPB does not unintentionally hurt \nMain Street but still protects consumers is to narrow the scope and \nauthority with clear language outlining exactly who this new regulator \nwill regulate and what it will do. Instead of unlimited authority, this \nnew regulator should focus on the shadow banking entities operating \noutside of the regulatory framework and preying on vulnerable people. \nThe banks and the savings and loans that issue loans are regulated by \ngovernment regulators. Are the people who are making these large loans, \nsuch as home loans, regulated? In a lot of areas they are not. CFPB \ncould look at those.\n  I proposed 2 years ago a mortgage origination commission to make sure \neverybody originating mortgages was regulated by some appropriate State \nagency. Well, we haven't done it. We also need to ensure that we are \nnot empowering, through this new government agency regulator, the same \norganizations which pushed home ownership at any cost onto families who \ncould not afford to repay their loans. This is one of the key problems \nwe had. People who couldn't afford homes were told that they could get \nthem with no downpayment, even if they had bad credit. If they didn't \nhave the money to have a home, they were told they could have a home \nanyhow. These are the people who saw their American dream turn into the \nAmerican nightmare. These are the people whose houses were foreclosed, \ntheir families thrown out, their communities devastated, and ultimately \nthe entire network of not only America's financial system but the \nworld's financial system brought down by this bad paper.\n  Surely, my colleagues would not want to vote for a bill that creates \na new government bureaucracy without knowing exactly what the \nbureaucracy is empowered to do and if it will take on the real bad \nactors who got us into this mess. This CFPB is a perfect example of how \nthe ``one size fits all'' of this hurried legislation will have \nunintended consequences for those who did not contribute to the \nfinancial meltdown. Treating community banks like Goldman Sachs is a \nmistake, and one we cannot afford to make.\n  If we are aware of these unintended consequences now, why won't we \ncorrect them now? Why do my colleagues want to bring these unintended \nconsequences in the bill closer to being codified into law on the \nSenate floor? If you want to have some real consumer protection, I \npurchased several homes, as we have moved around recently, and I can \ntell you that the best thing we can do for consumer protection is to \nrepeal all the laws that require a stack of paper that high that you \nare supposed to sign saying you have read it. Have consumer protection \nwith a very simple one- or two-page form. I have talked about that \nbefore. That is simple consumer protection. Let people know, for people \nwho are not adequately informed on financial situations.\n  The one thing we found out when I joined with the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator Dodd, in pushing home foreclosure \ncounseling, as we worked with agencies that were counseling people who \nwere losing their homes through foreclosure, is these agencies were \ncrying out and saying: We need financial counseling for these people \nbefore they get into homes. That is the best way to avoid foreclosure. \nLet us go back to that. It sounds simple, but it happens to be the \nthing that would work.\n\n  I doubt my Democratic colleagues intend to pass a bill that will hurt \nfamilies every time they turn on the light switch or try to heat their \nhome, but that is what this bill in its current form will do, once \nagain, trying to go for the easy one-size-fits-all approach to entities \nthat it does not fit in any way. The $592 trillion over-the-counter \nderivatives market needs stronger rules of transparency on the things \nthat are run through Wall Street. Some of these derivatives traded in \nthis market played a significant role in the recent crisis, through \nproducts such as credit default swaps.\n  I have called these derivatives computer game derivatives. They were \nso complex. They were something somebody thought up and ran through a \ncomputer. You know what. Our regulators fell down on the job. They \ndidn't look at these derivatives. They were not transparent. They were \nnot regulated. Some of that is the fault of the regulators, who are now \nscrambling to come in and file suits. They are supposed to regulate and \nmake sure that these products that are complicated are fully \ntransparent and related to reality and go to those who are at least \nsophisticated. You can't guarantee that they win or lose, but at least \nknow what they are; make sure they are clearly understood by everybody; \nget the rating agencies to judge them independently, not as captured \nentities for the people who issue them and will pay the rating agency \nif they get the rating they want.\n  But there is an important distinction between the computer game \nderivatives or the very sophisticated derivatives that are traded on \nWall Street. You can make good financial arguments for them, so long as \nthey are traded on an exchange--the Wall Street derivatives, so long as \nsomebody is looking at them to make sure there is some integrity in \nthem. But not all derivative contracts pose systemic risk. As a matter \nof fact, commercial contracts initiated by energy companies, utilities, \nand the agricultural industry are used to manage risks associated with \ntheir daily commercial operation, from cost fluctuations in materials \nand commodities to foreign currencies used in international business. \nThese end users, these commodity hedgers, make up less than 3 percent \nof the market.\n  I don't know of any farmer or any farm agency or any utility who \ncaused the crisis on Wall Street by entering into a long-term supply-\nand-purchase contract. There is no reason to make this be traded on an \nexchange when you have an ongoing partner; no reason to acquire \ncollateral to be posted. The end users, as they are called, do so in \norder to plan for future pricing so they can provide the least \nexpensive goods or services to the consumer as possible. Costly margin \nrequirements for the end users will be directly passed on to their \nfamilies. Guess who pays for that? That is us. That is us. Because all \nAmericans will see their costs go up whenever they turn on their \nlights, put food on their table, and use any form of transportation--\nwhether it be cars, trucks, buses, or airplanes. This is a problem that \nmust be fixed.\n  For the purpose of my time on the floor, I won't go into each and \nevery problem I have heard about in the bill. I have only been given \nminutes to speak rather than hours. But the current concerns I have \noutlined are critical. The unintended consequences on which I have \nshined a light must be stopped. Americans do not want another massive \nflawed bill that will kill more jobs, make it harder to get a home or \ncar loan, or make it more expensive to heat their homes.\n  Yes, Americans are rightfully angry and frustrated about the bad \nactors on Wall Street who caused the financial crisis, costing many \nAmericans their jobs and even their homes. Americans are rightfully \nangry and frustrated about the trillions of dollars the government has \ncommitted to rescuing the financial industry when so many of them are \nstill struggling to pay their bills. These are the people from whom I \nam hearing. I agree with the majority of Americans who believe it is \nunfair for bad actors who caused this financial crisis to get bailed \nout with their tax dollars--with our tax dollars--when there is no \nbailout for families who lost their savings or jobs. I agree with the \nmajority of Americans who are rightly skeptical of the Democrats' bill \nand the rush the majority wants to pass it in. It is no surprise that \nmy constituents are skeptical. After all, it is the few bad actors on \nWall Street who caused the financial crisis who are now cheerleading \nthis so-called reform bill.\n\n  I was stunned when I read that the head of the investment bank \nGoldman Sachs, Mr. Blankfein, said, ``The biggest beneficiary of reform \nis Wall Street itself.'' The head of Goldman Sachs said that the \nbiggest beneficiary of this reform bill is Wall Street. Did you hear \nthat, everybody who has been looking at Goldman Sachs? I also \nunderstand that Citigroup now supports\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\nthis measure. They are huge Wall Street players who have had access to \nthe White House and the majority leaders of both Houses to push for all \nthe good things this bill does for them. They are the ones who have \nbeen in there. They are the major contributors. Look where the money \ngoes. If you want to say: OK, who is looking for contributions, look at \nthat and see what is in the bill.\n  This bill clobbers Main Street and it glances off of Wall Street. \nInstead of helping Wall Street, I want to ensure a bill is passed that \nwill protect Main Street. While Wall Street may be cheering this bill, \nI am here to ensure this bill represents Main Street concerns. What I \nam hearing from Main Street, they are concerned, and it doesn't address \ntheir concerns, it puts more burdens on them. I urge you, I ask you to \nlisten to the folks at home.\n  We need to hold Wall Street accountable for the havoc wreaked on Main \nStreet and enact reform to prevent another financial crisis. This bill \nis too large, too costly for consumers, and will kill job creation at a \ntime when working Americans need to be left to do what they do best; \nthat is, succeed.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle can hold vote after vote, \nbut until this bill fixes the problems and I can be sure it is not just \nGoldman Sachs, Citigroup, and the rest of Wall Street that will \nbenefit, I will continue to force Democrats to listen to the concerns \nof Main Street America.\n  I urge my colleagues to turn up the hearing and turn down the volume \nand listen to what the people in your States are saying.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday we and the nation heard from \nGoldman Sachs executives indicating they had no regrets about the \nfinancial crisis, a crisis that has left 8.5 million people without \njobs and stripped billions of dollars of retirement savings from \nworking Americans. In fact, the Pew Institute released a study that \nindicates the financial crisis and recession have already cost U.S. \nhouseholds $100,000, on average, in lost wealth and income. That is a \nhuge blow to the families who are struggling to pay for their \nretirement, to pay for their children's education, and provide a better \nlife for themselves and their children.\n\n  We have seen, in the last five quarters, because of this financial \ncrisis associated with and connected with the recession, $648 billion \nless in gross domestic product than was projected initially--$648 \nbillion of productive enterprises. The cost of this crisis is something \nwe all should not only recognize but commit to preventing in the \nfuture. We also should calculate the cost not just in terms of gross \ndomestic product and how well executives on Wall Street are doing, who \nare doing pretty well, but how well the average family in this country \nis doing, and how well they will do in the future. We must consider how \nmuch in terms of their wealth has been diminished, if not lost, in \nrebuilding our economy.\n  One of the major functions of any financial sector in any part of the \nworld is to efficiently allocate capital to grow domestic product--not \nto reduce it--to invest in productive enterprise and employ people. The \nfinancial sector shouldn't undercut companies or force them to lay off \nworkers. All of this, in the last few months, I think has represented a \nfailure in that basic function of making sure capital is accumulated \nand then efficiently allocated to productive means.\n  So Wall Street, I think, has a lot to regret about their role, and we \nhave a lot to do to improve the situation, to ensure the regulatory \nstructure is in place, and to set clear rules for the conduct of \nfinancial business that will protect families, protect consumers, and \nprotect the taxpayers.\n  This is the third time our colleagues on the other side have blocked \nsuch efforts to begin the discussion. We recognize this is a complex \ntopic, with many different parts: credit rating agencies, capital \nrequirements, financial institutions, derivatives. You can go on and on \nand on. So anyone who implies they have all the wisdom, I think, will \nfind themselves sadly mistaken. But we have to get on with this bill \nbecause unless we bring the bill to the floor, we cannot begin to, in \nthe open, talk about those policy issues that people can disagree on--\npeople have different approaches--and ultimately resolve this and \ncreate a better regulatory structure and a stronger foundation for our \neconomy.\n  But in the last several days, this has been, again, ``say no and the \nproblem might go away.'' Well, if they continue to say no, the problem \nwill get worse. We are looking across the globe today at a crisis in \nEurope because of Greek sovereign debt. It is spiraling. Already, \nSpanish debt has been downgraded. If we think we are immune from these \nglobal currents, both good and bad, we are mistaken. If we do not put \nin a stronger structure of regulation, the next crisis might not be \nstarting on Wall Street, but the impact on Main Street could be the \nsame, and it could be just as devastating.\n  We have to look forward. We have to move on. The notion that we have \nall the time in the world and we can sort of nonchalantly go about our \nbusiness--or in some cases, if it is a political judgment that it is \nbetter to resist--is not serving the people of this Nation well.\n  We recognize there are principle differences. Let's resolve them, as \nwe do on the floor through debate, through discussion, and through a \nvote, and let's move on. We have a lot of work to do. The underlying \nbill Senator Dodd has brought to the floor already incorporates so many \nof these disparate views, and I think in a very sensible way.\n  Let me, for the record, recall that legislation like this has been \npending for months and months and months. The Presiding Officer will \nrecall--because he participated with me in the first markup last \nNovember--Senator Dodd brought a bill to the committee, opened it up to \namendment, and it was quite clear there was going to be no serious \ndiscussion. In fact, our colleagues on the other side said: We need \nmore time. We want to participate with you. I think it was done with \ngreat sincerity. Senator Dodd entertained those proposals for months. \nFrom November until a few weeks ago, we were working collaboratively \nand creatively to try to bridge our gaps and bring a bill to the floor.\n  Well, finally--and somewhat in exacerbation--Senator Dodd concluded \nthis was leading nowhere, except to more delay, if not denial of the \ngreat problem we face. So we had a committee markup. Again, it was an \nopportunity for our colleagues on the other side to bring forth their \nproposals, their ideas, in a markup in which we would be able to \nconsider their views, vote on them, and then move that bill to the \nfloor. But it was a perfunctory session. They had concluded that, no, \nthey were not quite yet ready to offer their proposals, their ideas, \nand to engage in the business of legislation.\n  So now the bill is before us, months after we started this process, \nmonths after we have entertained and incorporated proposals that have \nbeen made by our colleagues because they are very good proposals. It \nwas Senator Corker and Senator Warner--who have done an outstanding \njob--who structured the whole issue of resolution, that there would be \nan upfront fund so that financial institutions--not taxpayers--would \npay for the failure of a financial institution.\n  Yet when that bill was brought to the floor--or we attempted to do \nit--that provision, that bipartisan provision was singled out for, \nshall we say, criticism, if not ridicule, as a perpetual bailout bill. \nThat was a misrepresentation of the bill and it, frankly, contradicted \nthe whole effort, the whole bipartisan effort to come up with something \nthat both sides could support.\n  But this bill incorporates so many different ideas and aspects that \nhave been shared. In fact, it was interesting, in the lead up to this \nfloor consideration, so many times on both sides of the aisle, people \nwould say, routinely: well, we agree on 80 percent of the bill. I think \nif you have 80 percent of the bill agreed to, at least conceptually, \nyou are probably ready to bring the bill up for debate and to vote. Yet \nagain, the Republican side refuses to do that.\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\n  They are, I think, assuming, I guess, they have a lot of time. But as \nyou look around the globe, at the crises in Europe, at the stock market \nfalling dramatically yesterday because of Europe, I think we have to \nmove aggressively to protect American families, and that means getting \nthe bill on the floor and voting for it.\n  This bill will make changes that are urgently necessary. Again, the \nissue of too big to fail--through the extraordinary effort, painstaking \neffort, the hours of discussions by Senator Warner and Senator Corker, \nthere was a proposal for resolution that effectively ends too big to \nfail. In fact, Sheila Bair, who is the Chairwoman of the FDIC and was \nappointed by President Bush, says it virtually eliminates the \npossibility of a taxpayer bailout. So that is part of it. Strengthening \nconsumer protection. There has been, I think, an unfortunate \ngeneralization that consumer protections are bad for business. Frankly, \nwe should have discovered in the last several months that good consumer \nprotections are very good for business. Many of those consumer laws--\nwhich would have protected people seeking mortgages--which were ignored \nor exempted would have, I think, improved dramatically the mortgage \nsituation. It would have improved business. It would have made that \noverriding issue of efficient allocation of capital much easier.\n  But when you have very little protections for consumers, they are at \nthe mercy of people who will exploit them for a quick buck. And that is \nwhat happened. Mortgages were given to people who were not qualified. \nWhy? Because no one was watching out for them. But not only that, the \nindividual issuing the mortgage did not have, as they say, any skin in \nthe game because they simply sent it in to the big securitization \nprocess. Someone got a fee for securitizing it. Someone wrapped it up \ninto a big mortgage-backed security. Someone else wrapped it up into a \ncollateralized debt obligation, which is a collection of securities. \nThen someone else wrapped that up into a synthetic collateralized debt \nobligation and sold it off. Not a lot of efficient allocation of \ncapital for productive means, but a lot of fees for investment bankers, \nsecuritizers, and mortgage brokers. At the very beginning, good \nconsumer protections would have been an effective way to mitigate some \nof that damage. They are in this bill.\n  We are attempting to eliminate huge gaps and loopholes in financial \nregulation. Our regulatory scheme has grown up over many years, in \nfact, through the life of this country. So we have a national bank \nauthority that was created in the 1860s. We have an Office of Thrift \nSupervision that was created many years later because of thrift \ninstitutions. We have the FDIC, which was created in the 1930s by \nFranklin Roosevelt as a result of the Depression and the need to insure \ndeposits. We have the Federal Reserve System that monitors local banks \nand large banks that was created in the Wilson administration.\n\n  All of them have a little different piece of the action, and all of \nthem have been routinely used in what is termed regulatory arbitrage, \nto move to the most favorable position for your business, which may not \nbe favorable to the overall economy. Some of the big mortgage lenders \nthat ultimately collapsed started off being regulated by the Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency, and then they decided they would have \na better deal at OTS. Frankly, if they had an opportunity--if they were \nstill with us--they would be looking elsewhere. Hit and run, I think, \nwas probably the business plan. We have to stop that.\n  This bill takes a strong step forward, consolidating that \nsupervision, by consolidating the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, by limiting the \nsupervision of the Federal Reserve over a countless number of small \nbanks, and concentrating their efforts at the big institutions, where \ntheir expertise and their focus should make a difference.\n  This is a huge improvement over what the present system is. Yet our \ncolleagues are not recognizing the need to improve and the need to move \nforward. We have been engaged, through Senator Lincoln and Senator \nDodd, with derivatives legislation, which, for the first time, \nrecognizes and regulates those derivatives. There was a great debate \nhere in the 1990s, and through that debate derivatives were left \nunregulated. Today we have to recognize we have to put them back under \nregulatory supervision.\n  The legislation creates the steps, the architecture, which will go a \nlong way to prevent some of the problems we have seen. It requires \nreporting all derivative transactions to a data repository which the \nregulators will have access to so they can see firsthand in real time \nwhat is happening out there. Is there a big buildup in Greek debt? Are \nthere huge positions in credit default swaps on Greek bonds? They can \nquickly get a macro sense of what is happening.\n  Then, with limited exceptions, all derivatives have to be cleared on \na clearing platform. That takes away the bilateral nature of \ntransactions. Someone says: I will sell you insurance on this interest \nrate for a fee. You give me the fee, et cetera. That is bilateral. If \none of these parties is unable to carry out its obligations, the \ntransaction fails. In a clearing platform, there is a central party \nthat assumes the risk of one of the parties failing. It is a \nmutualization, really, of risk, and it is a step forward.\n  But we have to step even farther than that. We have to push as many \nof these trades onto a trading platform, not just clearing it and \nholding collateral, but actually pricing it. Because of the complexity \nof some of these products, unless there is a market, no one knows the \nreal value. On a trading platform, there is a market value and people \ncan value it because basically if someone will buy it, that is the \nvalue. So we have to do that. This legislation goes a long way to doing \nthat.\n  With respect to credit rating agencies, one of the great failures is \nthe credit rating agencies. As to all of these exotic mortgage products \nthat collapsed in value, most of them were rated investment grade--AA, \nAAA, according to whatever the rating is--and yet they failed. Part of \nit was because of the way credit rating agencies operate.\n  Senator Levin conducted recently some very good hearings on this \nissue. The familiarity between the investment bank that is bringing the \nproduct to the street and the raters, the interconnectedness, the \nfailure to have the appropriate checks on the models that raters were \nusing, an independent risk analysis within the rating agency that is \ngoing to look at these models not for the benefit of who is paying for \nit but for the propriety and correctness of the model. That is in the \nlegislation.\n\n  We have done something else too: We have inserted language that would \nallow someone who has invested their savings through a pension plan or \nother method to go to court and make the case that they should find out \nwhat happened within the rating agency with respect to the poorly rated \ninvestment that caused them to lose their savings. Today, these cases \nare routinely dismissed before anyone can question the rating agency. \nOur legislation would allow them to get beyond the pleadings stage. But \nit would also give the rating agencies an affirmative defense. They \nwould have to factually check their models. They would have to actually \nlook at some of these mortgages. Frankly, this might be 20/20 \nhindsight, but if someone drove out to one of those counties in Florida \nwhere there were all of these exotic mortgages but no one seemed to be \nliving there and the communities were deteriorating, I think they would \npretty quickly check their rating. That appears not to have been done.\n  For the first time, hedge funds are regulated. They would have to \nregister with the SEC and be subject to registration, notifying the SEC \nof the size of their pool and other basic information.\n  Well, we have had months of opportunities to share additional \nthoughts and work together to amend the bill in committee, which was \nnot done, but, more importantly, to begin today--in fact, we should \nhave begun last week--this issue of finally passing a Senate bill that \nresponds to the crisis we saw; that builds a stronger foundation of \nfinancial expansion; that protects consumers and taxpayers as well as \nleads to the increase in the wealth of families, not to the dramatic \ndecrease and decline we have witnessed because of some of these forces \nat work today in the marketplace on Wall Street, which still have to be \naddressed.\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\n  There will be parts of the proposals that come up that will be an \nattempt to weaken some of these provisions, particularly with respect \nto consumer protection. Again, I think it flows from the false logic \nthat if it is good for consumers, it is bad for business. Actually, I \nalways thought, in smalltown business, the customer is always right. \nYou believed the customer, made sure you provided value for your \nproduct, and made sure he or she would come back because they were \nhappy and satisfied. Apparently, that old-fashioned rule has been \ntossed out, but I think that old-fashioned rule has to be \nreestablished.\n  We have seen, as a way to deflect attention from the need to reform \nand the need to move this legislation, misrepresentations about the \nbill. I mentioned one: It is a bailout bill. Well, I think that has \nbeen dropped because it was transparently misleading. Indeed, this \nbailout mechanism was a bipartisan product of two of our distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Warner and Senator Corker. Now we are at the old \nstandby: It is going to hurt business. I will tell my colleagues what \nhas hurt business, and that is the behavior on Wall Street.\n  I can recall that several years ago there was a study by the McKinsey \nCompany that said that if we did not loosen further the already, I \nthink, lax rules, we would lose all the securities business; all of \nWall Street would go to England or other places; we would lose \nthousands of jobs. Guess what. They have lost, unfortunately, thousands \nof jobs there. And it wasn't because regulation was too stringent; it \nwas because it was too lax.\n  Again, if there is any case to be made for what hurts business, it is \nirrational allocation of capital; lax rules with respect to consumers; \na market driven not by value but by compensation, not by long-term \ngrowth but by short-term profit. That is what has cost every family in \nAmerica $100,000.\n  So if we move purposely and with the input of our colleagues, which \nwe have already accepted, we can establish a framework where business \nwill begin to grow again. So I reject the argument that what we are \ndoing will hurt business. In fact, I think this uncertainty of whether \nwe will have this reform or that reform continues to, at least to a \ndegree, impede capital formation and to impede investments in the \ncountry. When there are clear rules of the road, then the economy will \nagain begin to pick up, as it is beginning to pick up for other \nreasons.\n  If we don't take up this bill, work on it, and pass good legislation, \nwho wins? Well, I will tell my colleagues who wins. It is the big banks \nthat have survived this crisis today, that are reporting record \nprofits. What are they making their money on? Giving loans to small \nbusiness men and women across America? Investing in municipalities? No. \nThey are making huge profits in trading--betting, in some respects, on \nhow the economy is going to do. Well, we need a situation in which \ncapital is dedicated to growth and to investment and productivity.\n  The speculators will continue to reap billions of dollars of profits. \nI am sure there are several clever people who are doing quite well over \nthe demise of sovereign wealth in Greece, who have taken short \npositions on Greek bonds and are making a lot of money. That is not \nhelping us, it is not helping the country, and indeed it is not helping \nour trading partners across the globe. That, unchecked, will continue.\n  The opaque and unregulated market that I just referred to in \nderivatives, a $600 trillion notional market. When you talk to people \nabout clearing of derivatives, it is not billions, no; it is trillions \nof dollars. That market is unregulated, and if it goes the wrong way \nquickly, the consequences can be devastating. We have seen that with \nthe mortgage crisis.\n  So we have to move. We have to move at every level, not just the big \nbanks, but we have to provide appropriate regulation for people in \nterms of the mortgage industry so those abuses in mortgages will be \ncorrected. We have to go ahead and look at payday lenders who are \ncharging 900 percent interest, who are stripping people of their hard-\nwon resources. We have to look at the credit card companies. We have \npassed legislation, but we have to look at what they are doing. If \nthose people--the payday lenders and the mortgage brokers--can continue \nto operate with impunity, the bankers win. Who loses? Well, consumers \nlose--paying the excessive rates, seeing their homes devalued, all of \nthat.\n  I think we have to stand up and start the work of legislating. The \nstatus quo is no longer affordable, and I think the notion that we will \nnever see another crisis is undercut by looking around. If there are \nnot today some steady hands at the tiller in Europe in terms of the \nEuropean community and their financial arrangements, the cascading \neffect of Greece to Spain to Ireland, et cetera, could be another \nproblem we have to deal with.\n  We have lots of work to do, and the longer we delay, the more we are \nneglecting the real needs of our constituents. I urge that on the next \nvote we get down to business.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak on the motion to proceed for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have now voted three times--\nonce on Monday, the second time on Tuesday, and a third time today--\nmerely trying to get to the Wall Street financial reform bill. Each \ntime we have been blocked from being able to proceed because we can't \nmuster 60 votes to cut off the debate to get to the bill.\n  The Republican leadership remains united in opposition to bringing up \nthe bill, at a time in which we have just seen a display of \nextraordinarily intense, shall we say, arrogance on the part of \nexecutives at a major Wall Street firm in the way they conducted \nthemselves in front of Senator Carl Levin's investigation subcommittee \nyesterday in a hearing. It is rather extraordinary that the Republican \nleadership is not letting us come up with the bill so we can get it out \nhere, debate it, and amend it.\n  This Senator has a number of amendments that I would like to offer in \norder to, as we say, perfect the Banking Committee's bill. But we can't \neven get to that.\n  I don't know what the thinking of the Republican leadership is that \nthey would do this, especially in light of the fact that the American \npeople want some changes with the way investments are handled on Wall \nStreet. They want to see some movement. They want to see some action. \nSo when we attempt to bring up a comprehensive bill to reform Wall \nStreet and the reckless practices that nearly brought down the global \neconomy, we are prevented from having a free and open debate on the \nbill and we are prevented from perfecting that bill by adopting \namendments.\n  I guess the Republican leadership's alternative to this, since we \ncan't do it out here in the normal legislative process, is to do this \nin the backroom, behind closed doors, outside of the sunshine. They \nwant to have a deal cut before it comes to the floor in order to avoid \nan open and free debate to reform the financial system.\n  Why do they want to do this? Well, it seems to me common sense would \ntell us it is because they want to water down the bill. They want to \nwater it down to the point where Wall Street--where we are trying to \ntighten the screws in order to better regulate them and prevent another \nnear financial meltdown such as we had--will sign off on a final \ncompromise, and that is why they are blocking the motion to proceed to \nget to the bill.\n  Does this tactic sound familiar? It is the exact kind of backroom \nwheeling and dealing the American people have come to resent. The only \ndifference between now and decades ago is that in the old days those \ndeals were cut in smoke-filled backrooms. At least now there is not a \nlot of tobacco that is being consumed in those backrooms. But what is \nsimilar is that the special interests are still calling the shots.\n  So my plea is that we break this filibuster. Let's get a bill in \nfront of the\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\nSenate so it can be in the full light and the glare of the headlights \nand the cameras. Let's get it in front of the American people and then \nlet's let the legislative process work its will as we amend the bill.\n  Listen to some of the arguments the Republican leadership, over and \nover and over, has used. They have said the Banking Committee bill \nguarantees future bailouts. Well, that is not true. It might be a good \nsound bite, but it is simply untrue. The Banking Committee bill puts an \nend to the promise of future bailouts.\n  The Republican leadership attacks the $50 billion resolution fund \ncreated in the bill. This Senator is not convinced we need that fund, \nand I am certainly not convinced it is going to survive the debate on \nthe floor, but we ought to have some honest debate about that \nparticular provision. The fund is paid for in the Banking Committee \nbill directly from the coffers of the largest banks. The fund acts, in \nthe way it is devised by the Banking Committee, as a buffer to protect \ntaxpayers so that if there is another breakup, another potential \nmeltdown, the fund is there--already funded by the banks--so the \ntaxpayers don't have to go in and do the rescue operation such as we \nhave done in the past.\n  Under the Banking Committee bill, the fund can only be used to \nliquidate a financial institution, to break it up. In short, it is a \nfuneral tax. It is a funeral tax on the largest banks, not the \ntaxpayers. The $50 billion fund in that Banking Committee bill only \ngets tapped to pay for their funeral expenses.\n  So here we are. The American people hear the Republican leadership \ntalking about all this, and it is a red herring. The American people \nwant action, and here we are stuck in procedural gridlock. Guess who \nthe only real winners are. As we sit here, trying to break a filibuster \non Monday, again Tuesday, and again today, shortly after noon, the only \nwinners are the Wall Street bankers who have mastered the art of using \nthe broken financial regulatory system to almost bring down the \ncountry's finances by deceiving investors and, ultimately, in order to \nsave our system, milking the American taxpayer.\n  One of the major beneficiaries of the current system is the credit \nrating agencies. This is a subject matter the Senator from Minnesota--\nwho now sits in the Presiding Officer's chair--has some familiarity \nwith and on which he will be offering an amendment. This Senator is \ngoing to join him in that amendment. Credit rating agencies--something \nthat normally is down in the weeds because it is so complicated--are \nprivate companies that assess the creditworthiness of various types of \ndebt instruments, such as bonds and mortgage-backed securities, as well \nas the issuers--rating the issuers of those instruments.\n  They typically assign a letter grade that is designed to convey the \nrisk of default, and there are three major credit rating agencies on \nWall Street: There is Moody's, there is Standard & Poor's, and there is \nFitch Ratings. For most of the last century, the rating agencies were \npaid by investors who subscribed to their services. Why did they do \nthat? Because it made sense. Investors were the ones who were investing \ntheir money and they were the consumers of the ratings. They wanted the \nbest information regarding the risk that they would have in that \ninvestment.\n  Well, unfortunately, in the 1970s, all this changed and the business \nmodel flipped. The rating agencies began charging the issuers of the \nbonds, not the people who were seeking to know if it was a good credit \nrisk in order to invest their money. It was reversed. It was the very \nissuers of the credit, rather than the investors, who were charging for \ntheir services. So beginning in the 1970s, rating agencies began to be \npaid by the very same people who had a vested interest in receiving a \nhigh investment grade.\n  Think about that. The very issuers of the bonds who wanted people to \ninvest their money in these bonds needed a high credit rating on that \nbond in order to get people to invest. If they could be rated at AAA, \nas opposed to B, people were much more willing to put their money into \nthis instrument.\n  Well, talk about a conflict of interest. Now the issuers of the \nbonds, who have an interest in a high AAA rating, go out and hire the \nservices of the credit rating agencies.\n  Did you ever hear the old adage, ``He who pays the piper calls the \ntune''? Well, those who were going to pay the piper were going to call \nwhat that tune was. Do you think if you are paying the bill to the \ncredit rating agency that you have a better chance of getting a AAA \nrating than a lower rating? Of course you do. That is a walking \nconflict of interest.\n  How could we allow this unavoidable conflict of interest to exist and \nallow it to exist since the 1970s is unfathomable and unbelievable. Yet \nthat is the way it is. Credit rating agencies failed miserably in the \nrunup to the financial crisis, and it sure looks like--looking \nbackward--they put profits ahead of professionalism. They failed to \ndetect the severe deterioration in lending standards that began in the \nlate 1990s. They failed to review all available information about the \nloans on which the securities they were rating were based. The conflict \nof interest in their business model gave the rating agencies an \nenormous incentive to overlook problems in mortgage-backed security \nmarkets.\n\n  In 2006, Congress passed the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act. I put \nthat in quotes, the Credit Rating Agency ``Reform'' Act. The bill was \nwritten in the Senate by the Republican leadership, and it had the full \nsign-off of the credit rating industry. Here is what the bill did--\n2006. It standardized the process for registering rating agencies, and \nit gave the SEC some new oversight powers over rating agencies. At the \nsame time, however, this so-called reform act prohibited the SEC from \nregulating ``the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and \nmethodologies by which any rating agency determines credit ratings.'' \nIt gutted the ability to double-check credit rating agencies.\n  Furthermore, to add insult to injury, the act also clarified that it \ncreates no private right of action. So if a party invested in a \nparticular financial instrument because that credit rating was high, \nand it turned out to be a dog and they lost lots of money, they had no \nprivate right of action through the courts.\n  No wonder the industry supported that legislation back in 2006. The \nbill, written by the Republican leadership, took away any power of \nFederal regulators that they might have had to crack down on the \nbaseless credit ratings that were fueling the boom in subprime lending. \nTo make matters worse, the bill made it clear it was not empowering the \nprivate sector to hold the credit rating agencies liable for their \nratings.\n  The bill we hope one day, at some hour, to get to the floor so we can \nstart working on it does some important things to improve credit rating \nagencies. It requires these agencies to disclose their methodologies \nand their ratings track record. Wouldn't you think you would want to \nknow their track record if you are going to invest a lot of money based \non their triple-A rating? It requires agencies to consider information \nin their ratings that comes from outside sources. But when it comes to \naddressing the fundamental conflict of interest in the credit rating \nagency business model, this bill coming out on the Senate floor falls \nshort.\n  It would require the rating agencies to separate ratings activities \nfrom their sales and marketing activities, and that is like saying my \nleft arm has no idea what my right arm is doing. In reality, it is the \nbrain in your head that controls both the right arm and the left arm, \nand no one is proposing to chop off the head. So we have to deal with \nthis conflict of interest, and we are going to. Here is what we are \ngoing to do.\n  We are going to do this with the help of the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate. We are going to offer an amendment that would establish a \nclearinghouse to randomly assign rating assignments with rating \nissuers. As simple as that, we can end the conflict of interest in the \ncredit rating industry if, randomly, it is going to be assigned among \ncompanies that rate issuers of financial instruments.\n  Second, this Senator is going to offer an amendment to require the \nrating agencies to monitor, to review, and to update their credit \nratings after the initial issuance of their credit rating so it does \nnot become stale. They are going to have to continue to look at it,\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\nto review it, to update it, and to publish it. The rating agency should \nnot be able to walk away from a rating after it has been issued. It is \ngoing to be fresh. The rating agencies ought to conduct continued \nsurveillance of these securities and update them along the line.\n  The credit rating agency reform is just one of the many areas the \nSenate needs to debate. But as long as the Republican leadership \ncontinues to prevent the bill from coming to the floor, this broken \nsystem remains in place. The Wall Street bankers win and the American \npublic loses.\n  Let me give some other examples. Remember the name ``AIG''? It was \nthis Goliath organization that started out as an insurance company. It \nbecame this huge financial institution. The core product of this \ncompany was its insurance. It was deemed too big to fail at the time of \nthe near meltdown of our financial system. This was back in the fall of \n2008.\n  It was deemed that when we passed the Troubled Assets Relief Program, \nTARP, that money had to go into this big, Goliath organization, all the \nway to the tune of about $80 billion of taxpayer money, as I last \nrecall. It may be a lot more than that.\n  Guess what this did. They had already issued, in effect, an insurance \npolicy that had a fancy name. It was called a credit default swap. It \nwas an insurance policy against some of the companies if their \ninvestments went bad. That is not bad. But what happened was, when the \nAmerican taxpayer dollars went in to save AIG, AIG took those taxpayer \ndollars and turned around and paid off those insurance policies, 100 \ncents on the dollar. Is that fair, when folks like some of these folks \nwho have been in the news recently, such as Goldman Sachs, got paid off \nto the tune of $13 billion instead of going in and negotiating a lower \npayoff since it was taxpayer money? We ought to change that, and I \nthink we will if we can ever get to the bill, if the Republican \nleadership will ever allow us to get to the bill.\n  Let's take another example. What about the same insurance policies \ncalled credit default swaps? Let's say the same set of circumstances \nwith AIG occurred, but AIG had not been bailed out by the American \ntaxpayer and instead had gone into bankruptcy. AIG, in this \nhypothetical example, had a lot of creditors that would get in line \nunder the bankruptcy law to get whatever they could. But, oh, no; these \ninsurance policies called credit default swaps would be exempt from the \nbankruptcy laws. They would get paid off in full first instead of \nhaving to get in line with all the other creditors under the bankruptcy \nlaw.\n  That is not right. This Senator is going to have an amendment to the \nBanking Committee's bill to correct that. There is no reason those \ninsurance policies should be at the head of the line of everybody else \nin the case of bankruptcy.\n  Are we pleased about the executive compensation of some of these \nfolks who have nearly caused the financial collapse of our country? \nWhen taxpayer money, through the TARP system, was bailing out these \ninstitutions--whether it was directly, such as into AIG, or directly \ninto a place such as Bank of America, or whether it was indirectly \ncoming through these credit default swaps that were getting paid off \n100 cents on the dollar that I just described, through the conduit of \nAIG--what was happening to the compensation of those executives? Were \nthey still getting bonuses? Were they still getting high salaries? Were \nthey having to tighten up their belts when, in fact, their financial \ninstitutions were kept alive by the American taxpayer bailing them out?\n  No, we didn't see that tightening of the belt. We did not see any \nevidence of humility. We didn't see any evidence of appreciation. But, \ninstead, we saw arrogance displayed through huge bonuses that were \nbeing given with a total disregard for the American people's sacrifice, \nof putting their hard-earned taxpayer dollars in to save those \nfinancial institutions.\n  Mr. President, I think you will see once we get out here on the floor \nthat we are, in fact, going to get a number of amendments, including \nthe amendment of this Senator, on a limitation--not on executive \ncompensation but a limitation on the ability to deduct from their tax \nliability excessive executive compensation, and a tie of that excessive \nexecutive compensation to, in fact, performance for that company that \npays their salary. We are going to see that. Sooner or later, we, in \nfact, are going to get to the bill, even though the Republican \nleadership continues to try to obstruct and delay because sooner or \nlater the American people are going to have their way. They clearly \nwant Wall Street financial reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the financial \nregulatory reform, and particularly the effect of the Dodd proposal \nthat came out of the Banking Committee on which I sit, that we have \nbeen voting on cloture on for this whole week.\n  I heard Senators from the other side talk about delay; the \nRepublicans are delaying this bill. I have heard them for the last week \nsay it is because we are siding with Wall Street, Republicans are \nsiding with Wall Street.\n  That is odd to me because it is the Wall Street big banks that are \nfor this bill. It is Citigroup, it is Goldman Sachs that are in support \nof this bill. They are publicly supporting the bill.\n  It is the community banks that are flooding my office and the offices \nof my colleagues. It is the community banks that had nothing to do with \nthe financial meltdown that are hugely concerned with this bill.\n  That is the issue. The groups that are opposing Dodd's bill are the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses, the small businesses of \nour country; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Americans for Tax Reform; \nthe Americans for Limited Government; Freedom Works; the National \nTaxpayer Union; the United States Automobile Association.\n  We have had auto dealers in our offices all week who are very \nconcerned about not being able to get credit from the little banks and \nthe ability to finance the buying of automobiles. It is the Military \nOfficers Association that has concerns with this bill; the National \nCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives; the Farm Credit Council; the National \nAssociation of Home Builders; the Fertilizer Institute.\n  This is a bill that is going to affect our economy. So many of the \ngroups I have named are the groups that are providing jobs in our \ncountry that we want to encourage to create more jobs, not discourage \nin a time such as this. So, yes, Republicans have been trying to have \ninput on this bill. There has not been any Republican input at all. If \nwe have learned one thing as Republicans, it is that we know what it is \nlike to be completely shut out. We were completely shut out of the \nhealth care debate. We had amendments offered day after day after day. \nOh, the process worked. Not one Republican amendment was passed. Not \none. Neither was there one Republican vote in the House or Senate on \nthe health care bill. So we have had that experience. So this time, \nbecause we see the dangers in the Dodd bill to our economy and the \nsmall businesses and the small banks, we are saying we are not going to \nlet this bill go to the floor if we have the power to stop it until \nthere is Republican input.\n  The biggest failure in the bill is that it still allows taxpayer \nbailouts. That is wrong. That is why Republicans are voting not to \nbring it up yet, because we are trying to change the language in the \nbill before it comes to the floor to assure that the taxpayers will not \nhave the responsibility to bail out big financial institutions that \ntook gambles with other peoples' money. That is the holdup.\n  This bill is not a bill that is favored by community and little \nbanks. It is favored by the big banks. It is favored by Goldman Sachs \nand Citigroup. So let's be clear about that. As we consider the bill \nbefore us, the Dodd bill, it should focus on the gaps and holes in \nregulations that led to our nation's financial crisis from which we \nhave not yet recovered, because there are still millions of people who \nare unemployed because of the financial crisis.\n  We must end too big to fail. We must end taxpayer bailouts. That is \nnot done in this bill, and that is why Republicans are saying: Stop \nthis bill from coming to the floor until it does at least that one \nmajor thing; that is, to be clear, that we stop too big to fail in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n\n  Putting the big banks in one level of operation and scrutiny and one \nlevel of access to the Fed, which this bill does, the Fed keeps its \nscrutiny of every bank company holding company of $50 billion or more \nin assets. That is it. All of the other banks in our system throughout \nour country are not allowed access to the Federal Reserve. They cannot \nbe members of the Federal Reserve under the Dodd bill. That is the \nmajor reason I am not supporting this bill.\n  In fact, I have an amendment, if this bill comes to the floor, I am \ngoing to offer that says the law today will prevail, that is, that \ncommunity banks may join the Fed, the State-chartered banks may join \nthe Fed, because if you do not do that, you are going to give the \nimpression that the $50-billion-and-above banks are in one category, \nthat they are going to be taxpayer protected. That means they are going \nto be able to give lower rates in competition with the community banks \nbecause it will be perceived that the risk is less.\n  That is not what we ought to be doing. So I am going to offer an \namendment to the Dodd bill which would eliminate that part of the Dodd \nbill that takes away Fed access to the community banks. The other \nreason it is important is that we have regional Fed banks. The reason \nit was set up that way is so that throughout the country the Federal \nReserve would be able to make monetary policy with input, with input \nfrom Kansas City, and Dallas, and Houston, and San Antonio, and Los \nAngeles, and San Francisco, and San Diego, and Minnesota, and \nWisconsin.\n  That was the concept of the regional Fed bank. Let me give you an \nexample. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is headed by Richard \nFisher, who came to see me last week. He said: I would go from \nregulating about $70 billion in bank assets, with all the community \nbank members that we have in the Dallas Regional Fed, to 3.\n  If the Fed is going to listen in Washington, when they are making the \nmonetary policy, to the Kansas City Fed chief who completely agrees \nthat we need to keep access for State and community banks to the Fed, \nfor their information, as well as the level playing field. So that will \nbe my amendment.\n  Community banks did not cause the financial meltdown. In fact, they \nprovided lending and depository services to families and small \nbusinesses across Texas and across our country. Even in the hard times \nthey were mostly the ones that helped small business get their \ninventory loans and the help they needed for liquidity.\n  A lot of people I talked to in my home State, when I visit the small \nbusinesses and the community, felt as though nobody was lending. The \nbig banks certainly were not. So the community banks are continuing to \nmake credit available, much more than the big banks, so businesses and \nconsumers can invest and create jobs that will lift our Nation into a \nrecovery.\n  Do not talk to me about recovery when it is still a jobless--that is \nan oxymoron--a jobless recovery. There are millions of people out there \nunemployed. Is that a recovery? No. ``Jobless recovery'' should be out \nof our lexicon. That is wrong. If we are going to build jobs in this \ncountry, it is going to be through small businesses. The big businesses \nare not hiring. Do you know why the stock market is up right now? It is \nbecause the big businesses are not hiring. They have lowered their \ncosts. Yes, they are more profitable because they are working with \nfewer people. I do not considering that a success. I think we have to \nsave our community banks. This bill before us is going to hurt them. \nThat is why we are holding it up.\n  I wish I could say that is the only part of the bill that hurts \ncommunity banks, but there is another part. It is the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau that is created in the Dodd bill that will \nadd a new layer of regulations and a new agency issuing new regulations \nthat will affect those same community banks that are already fully \nregulated.\n  We have seen the effect of poor and predatory lending standards in \nthis financial meltdown. We need reform in that area. Americans should \nunderstand all the terms of a transaction, and they need to be \ncreditworthy. Subprime loans to people who are not creditworthy are not \nhealthy for our economy. We have learned that for sure. We do not need \na new bureaucracy housed in the Fed but without Fed oversight, which is \nsort of a non sequitur. But that is the way it is in this bill, which I \nhope we can change. Community banks are already regulated. They have \nall of the regulations, either State bank regulation or by the FDIC \ninsuring them, requiring reserves. They are doing their job.\n  The new agency would remove safety and soundness from consumer \nprotection and have unlimited and unchecked rule-writing authority. The \nlegislation does include an exemption which would allow a community \nbank with less than $10 billion in assets to retain examination from \nits prudential regulators, or the regulators they have now.\n  But the exemption is false because community banks will still be \nsubject to the new agency's new rules, pricing, and prohibitions, all \nof which will only serve to curtail consumer credit options.\n  Enhancing consumer protections should instead focus on leveraging the \nexperience of agencies that are already in place, such as the Federal \nTrade Commission. I am the ranking Republican on the Commerce \nCommittee. I see the work the FTC is doing on a daily basis to stop \nunfair and deceptive practices that prey on consumers of financial \nproducts and services offered by nonbank entities such as mortgage loan \nservices.\n  As an example, in 2009 alone, the FTC and the States, working \ntogether closely, brought more than 200 cases against firms that \npeddled phony mortgage modification and foreclosure rescue scams. \nRather than focusing on too big to fail or the practices of large \nbanks, the Dodd bill overreaches and threatens the authority of the FTC \nto protect consumers of nonbank financial products, as it has for many \nyears.\n  The FTC wrote a letter to me as ranking member of Commerce, and our \nchairman, Jay Rockefeller, and asked for assistance with preserving \ntheir consumer protection and enforcement authority. I am working now \nwith Chairman Rockefeller. He is very focused on this. I can tell you \nhe is very focused, because I talked to him on the telephone yesterday \nseveral times, including at 8 o'clock last night, because he is so \nconcerned that we are not going to fix this bill to make sure the FTC \nis not shut off from what it already does, what it already has in \nplace, with a new overlay of a new agency that does not have the \nexperience, that does not now exist, and would need startup time and \nmore taxpayer dollars.\n  Instead, Senator Rockefeller will have an amendment, and I will \ncosponsor it, that will keep the FTC exactly where it is now with the \nenforcement actions against companies that offer nonbank financial \nproducts. I hope Senator Dodd will work with us on that amendment. In \nfact, I am going to expand it even beyond that and say: We should put \nall of the nonbank regulation into the FTC instead of this new agency \nthat will be another bureaucracy that will be confusing in many \ninstances to the banks which are already regulated.\n  I hope we can do something in this bill that is right in the \nregulatory area, and particularly the area that contributed to the \nfinancial meltdown, such as the nonbank financial institutions, not the \nbanks. The community banks did not have a part in this financial \nmeltdown. I hope we can fix this bill when it comes to the floor.\n  It appears that the chairman of the Banking Committee and the ranking \nRepublican, Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby, have come to an agreement \non the language that will tighten and close the loophole in too big to \nfail. We are going to hear exactly what that language is in a few \nminutes in our Republican caucus. That will be very good for us to be \nable to then come to the floor, if the Democrats will allow Republicans \nto have some input into this bill on the other issues, such as Federal \nTrade Commission jurisdiction, the new consumer agency that I think is \noverreach and overkill, and most certainly to keep community banks \nwithout a competitive disadvantage against the big banks. I want a \nlevel playing field because I don't want the community banks to suffer \nin this country. They are the lifeblood of the heartland, and they are \nin peril with this bill.\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\n  I am somewhat frustrated at hearing some of the speeches in the last \nweek that have railed against Republicans for holding up this bill. \nSometimes ``no'' is the right answer because if we bring a bill to the \nfloor with no ability to amend it and we don't fix too big to fail, \nthen once again, like the health care reform bill that was jammed \nthrough the Senate and the House with no Republican support and no \ninput, we will be doing it to our economy and our financial \ninstitutions. I hope we will not do that again.\n  I hope that we will have a bill we can all agree closes the loopholes \non too big to fail so that taxpayers will not be on the hook again for \nbig financial institutions that bet with other people's money on fancy \nderivatives and all of the hedges that don't make sense; that we \nprotect the hedges that do make sense, that are used by the end user to \nkeep a budget in place rather than passing big price hikes on to \nconsumers in oil and commodities. That is what derivatives are supposed \nto be for, and we don't need to stop that. We just need to know what is \nin those big derivatives so that people will have the information and \nso will the regulators.\n  We can do this job right. This should not be political. Democrats and \nRepublicans aren't going to get an advantage for passing a financial \nregulation bill because most people are not going to know how it will \naffect them until it is passed and in place. Why don't we do it right? \nLet's bring the bill to the floor with some key parts that are agreed \nto, and then let's start having amendments. I am not saying every \nRepublican amendment should pass, but I think it should have a fair \nhearing. And I think some of them should pass if this bill is going to \npass the test of a true bipartisan bill that will have more than just a \npartisan vote out of the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair for listening--not that it was his choice, but I \nappreciate it anyway.\n  I hope we will do the right thing on this bill. It will affect our \nfinancial communities, every community in Texas, and especially small \nbusinesses and community banks that are going to be the reason we \nrecover, if we do this right.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks some letters to which I will \nrefer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last Thursday, I wrote Secretary \nGeithner asking why the Treasury Department allowed General Motors to \nuse TARP money from a Treasury escrow account to repay its \nmultibillion-dollar TARP taxpayer loan. This afternoon, I received a \nresponse from Treasury. I would like to say a few words about the reply \nand the questions that remain unanswered.\n  Last week, Treasury and GM announced with press releases and \nnationwide TV commercials that GM had repaid its TARP loans ``in full, \nwith interest, ahead of schedule, because more customers are buying [GM \nvehicles].''\n  However, the hype does not match the reality. Taxpayers have not been \nrepaid in full--far from it. Many billions of TARP dollars remain \ninvested by Treasury in GM, and much of it will never be repaid. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers will lose around \n$30 billion on GM.\n  In addition, the payment that occurred last week did not come from \nrevenue GM earned by selling cars, despite what was claimed. Instead, \nTreasury allowed GM to use funds in a separate escrow account to pay \nits TARP debt. The Treasury Department's response to me today makes a \npoint of saying that GM ``owns'' the money in the escrow account, as if \nthat somehow justifies all the hoopla about GM's so-called \n``repayment.''\n  Well, let's look at how GM came to ``own'' those escrow funds in the \nfirst place. The escrow funds were part of the TARP money Treasury paid \nfor GM stock coming out of the bankruptcy. The money was supposed to be \nused by GM for expenses, as Treasury concedes. Treasury had the power \nto approve or disapprove GM's use of the money to repay the TARP \ntaxpayer loan. Treasury approved, and GM pretended it was paying the \nloan back from revenue because business had improved.\n  Business may have improved, but that is not how they paid the loan. \nTaking TARP money out of one account to pay back TARP loans in another \naccount is not at all the same as paying off a loan with earnings, as \nGM's TV commercials imply they have done. That is why I called it ``an \nelaborate TARP money shuffle'' and nothing in Treasury's reply today \nchanges that.\n  The public would know nothing about the TARP escrow money being the \nsource of the supposed repayment from simply watching GM's TV \ncommercials or reading Treasury's press release. Treasury's letter \ntoday says all these details are public knowledge and nothing new. \nWell, that may be technically correct, but it wasn't clearly \ncommunicated that way to the average citizen. Most Americans don't pore \nthrough SEC filings and special inspectors general reports.\n  The GM commercial also did not mention that GM could have used the \nTARP escrow funds to repay a $2.5 billion 9 percent loan it received \nfrom its union health plan as part of the bankruptcy process. The union \nloan runs until 2017. The TARP loan was at 7 percent and ran until \n2015. What sort of money manager would advise you to pay off a lower \ninterest loan before a higher interest loan? GM and Treasury have still \nnot explained that, and I have asked the TARP watchdog, Special \nInspector Neil Barofsky, to get to the bottom of it. And to make \nmatters worse, Treasury has admitted that it let GM take an additional \n6.6 billion of TARP dollars out of the escrow fund last week with no \nstrings attached. That money, too, could have been used to repay the \nhigh interest union loan.\n  There are reports that GM also applied to the Department of Energy \nfor a $10 billion 5 percent loan to retool its plants to meet fuel \neconomy standards. GM seems to be using government money to pay back \ngovernment money, and then asking for more government money at a lower \ninterest rate. It sounds like a plan to refinance GM's government debt \nwith more taxpayer money--not pay it back.\n  GM had to ask permission from Treasury to use the taxpayers' stock \ninvestment to pay off the taxpayers' loan. Treasury's response to my \nletter says that ``Treasury retained approval rights over GM's use of \nfunds from the escrow account in order to protect the taxpayer.'' Well, \nwhy didn't they protect the taxpayer then?\n  Why would Treasury allow GM to use its equity investment to pay off \nthe loan when it means giving up the legal right to 7 percent rate of \nreturn for the taxpayers in exchange for essentially nothing? Since the \ntaxpayer has an equity stake in the company, it's true that future \ngrowth of GM could theoretically make taxpayers whole, but taxpayers \nalready had that equity interest before this latest transaction and \ndidn't get any more equity as a result of the transaction.\n  Another key question is: Why would GM orchestrate a major media \ncampaign to make the public think this all represents some big \naccomplishment by GM when the truth is that the taxpayers are still on \nthe hook for billions that we may never recover?\n  Using the taxpayers' stock investment in GM to reduce its debt to the \ntaxpayers is not the same as repaying that debt from money actually \nearned by selling cars. Treasury's reply today does not explain why it \napproved this transaction. Maybe it is a step in the right direction, \nmaybe not. But instead of misleading the American people, we should be \nclear and up front about what happened here.\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2010.\n     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Geithner: General Motors (GM) yesterday \n     announced that it repaid its TARP loans. I am concerned, \n     however, that this announcement is not what it seems. In \n     fact, it appears to be nothing more than an elaborate TARP \n     money shuffle.\n       On Tuesday of this week, Mr. Neil Barofsky, the Special \n     Inspector General for TARP, testified before the Senate \n     Finance Committee. During his testimony Mr. Barofsky \n     addressed GM's recent debt repayment activity, and stated \n     that the funds GM is using to repay its TARP debt are not \n     coming from GM earnings. Instead, GM seems to be using TARP \n     funds from an escrow account at Treasury to make the debt \n     repayments. The most recent quarterly report from the Office \n     of the Special Inspector General for TARP says ``The source \n     of funds for these quarterly [debt] payments will be other \n     TARP funds currently held in an escrow account.'' See, Office \n     of the Special Inspector General for TARP, Quarterly Report \n     to Congress dated April 20, 2010, page 115.\n       Furthermore, Exhibit 99.1 of the Form 8K filed by GM with \n     the SEC on November 16, 2009, seems to confirm that the \n     source of funds for GM's debt repayments was a multi-billion \n     dollar escrow account at Treasury--not from earnings. In the \n     8K filing GM acknowledged:\n       Of the $42.6 billion in cash and marketable securities \n     available to GM as of September, 30, 2009, $17.4 billion came \n     from an escrow account with Treasury,\n       $6.7 billion of the escrow account available to GM was \n     allocable to the repayment of loans to Treasury,\n       $5.6 billion in cash would remain in the Treasury escrow \n     account following the repayment by GM of their loans, and\n       Upon repaying Treasury, any balance of escrow funds would \n     be released to GM.\n       Therefore, it is unclear how GM and the Administration \n     could have accurately announced yesterday that GM repaid its \n     TARP loans in any meaningful way. In reality, it looks like \n     GM merely used one source of TARP funds to repay another. The \n     taxpayers are still on the hook, and whether TARP funds are \n     ultimately recovered depends entirely on the government's \n     ability to sell GM stock in the future. Treasury has merely \n     exchanged a legal right to repayment for an uncertain hope of \n     sharing in the future growth of GM. A debt-for-equity swap is \n     not a repayment.\n       I am also troubled by the timing of this latest maneuver. \n     According to Mr. Barofsky, Treasury had supervisory authority \n     over GM's use of these TARP escrow funds. Since GM's exit \n     from bankruptcy court, Treasury had approved the use of the \n     escrow funds for costs such as GM's obligations to its parts \n     supplier Delphi. See, Office of the Special Inspector General \n     for TARP, Additional Insight on Use of Troubled Asset Relief \n     Program Fund (SIGTARP-10-004), dated December 10, 2009, at \n     page 6. According to the GM 8K, GM had planned to use the \n     TARP funds in escrow to pay back the TARP loans on a \n     quarterly basis beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. But \n     following the April 20, 2010, hearing of the Senate Finance \n     Committee, where Treasury's decision to exempt GM from the \n     bank TARP excise tax was questioned and GM's refusal to \n     testify was noted, it is odd that GM suddenly drew down on \n     the TARP escrow and accelerated the repayment of the \n     remaining balance of GM's outstanding TARP loans.\n       The bottom line seems to be that the TARP loans were \n     ``repaid'' with other TARP funds in a Treasury escrow \n     account. The TARP loans were not repaid from money GM is \n     earning selling cars, as GM and the Administration have \n     claimed in their speeches, press releases and television \n     commercials. When these criticisms were put to GM's Vice \n     Chairman Stephen Girsky in a television interview yesterday, \n     he admitted that the criticisms were valid:\n       Question: Are you just paying the government back with \n     government money?\n       Mr. Girsky: Well listen, that is in effect true, but a year \n     ago nobody thought we'd be able to pay this back.\n       Mr. Girsky then said that GM originally planned to pay the \n     loan over the next five years. So the question is why--other \n     than a desire to justify excluding GM from the \n     administration's TARP tax proposal--would Treasury and GM \n     reduce GM's TARP debt with TARP equity and then \n     mischaracterize it as a repayment from earnings? Accordingly, \n     please explain:\n       Your department's justification for allowing GM to use \n     funds from the TARP escrow account to repay TARP loans,\n       The amount of funds remaining in the TARP escrow account at \n     Treasury that may be released to GM, and\n       The date that you anticipate that the remaining funds in \n     escrow will be released to GM.\n       Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Please provide \n     the requested information by April 30, 2010. Should you have \n     any questions regarding the contents of this letter please do \n     not hesitate to contact Jason Foster.

Grassley,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2010.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for your letter dated \n     April 22, 2010 to the Secretary regarding General Motors' \n     (GM) repayment of its loan from the Department of the \n     Treasury. He asked me to respond on his behalf.\n       Your letter states that the repayment of the loan was made \n     with funds from ``an escrow account at Treasury'' and that it \n     constituted a ``debt-for-equity'' swap. These statements are \n     not accurate.\n       On April 20, GM repaid the Treasury loan with cash in an \n     escrow account that it owns. The escrow account was created \n     last summer in connection with the restructuring of GM. The \n     money used to fund the escrow account came from a portion of \n     the proceeds of a loan made by both the Treasury and the \n     Canadian government. The escrowed funds were expected to be \n     used for extraordinary expenses, and a portion of the funds \n     were so used. Treasury retained approval rights over GM's use \n     of fluids from the escrow account in order to protect the \n     taxpayer, but the cash was still the property of GM.\n       In making its April 20 loan repayment, GM determined that \n     it did not need to retain the escrowed funds for expenses. \n     The fact that GM made that determination and repaid the \n     remaining $4.7 billion to the U.S. government now is good \n     news for the company, our investment, and the American \n     people. Consistent with Treasury's goal of recovering funds \n     for the taxpayer and exiting TARP investments as soon as \n     practicable, we approved GM's loan repayment.\n       It has long been public knowledge that GM would use these \n     specific funds to repay the Treasury and Canadian loans, if \n     it did not otherwise need them for expenses. Under GM's loan \n     agreement with Treasury, any funds in the escrow account on \n     June 30, 2010 had to be used to repay the Treasury and \n     Canadian loans. We have highlighted the repayment requirement \n     in our monthly Section 105(a) reports to Congress. During a \n     meeting last fall, we also informed the staff of the Special \n     Inspector General of TARP (SIGTARP), Neil Barofsky, that we \n     expected GM to use these funds to repay these loans. In fact, \n     according to the SIGTARP Report on the Use of Funds (released \n     on December 10, 2009), ``GM officials stated that it intends \n     to seek release of additional escrow funds to repay its \n     outstanding $6.7 billion loan to Treasury and $1.3 billion \n     loan to the Canadian Government.''\n       After the full repayment of the Treasury loan, \n     approximately $6.6 billion remained in GM's escrow account. \n     These funds became unrestricted on April 20 and available for \n     GM's general use.\n       In addition, it is not correct that the timing of the \n     repayment was motivated by concurrent Senate hearings. In \n     fact, GM's Board of Directors approved the loan repayment at \n     its monthly meeting on April 13, 2010.\n       As is widely known, Treasury continues to hold $2.1 billion \n     in preferred stock and 60.8% of the GM's common equity that \n     it received in the restructuring in July 2009. Treasury will \n     begin selling equity once GM makes an initial public \n     offering.\n       Thank you again for your attention to this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Herbert M. Allison, Jr.,\n     Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             Reserve Notice\n\n     U.S. Department of the Treasury,\n     1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Attention: [XXXXX]\n     Telecopy: [XXXXX]\n     Email: [XXXXX]\n\n     with a copy to:\n\n     The U.S. Department of the Treasury,\n     1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Attention: Cash Management Officer\n     Telephone (for borrowing requests): [XXXXX]\n     Email: [XXXXX]\n       Reference is made to that certain $7,072,488,605 Second \n     Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement dated as of \n     August 12, 2009, as amended, supplemented or modified from \n     time to time (the ``Credit Agreement''), among General Motors \n     Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \n     ``Borrower''), the Guarantors named therein and The United \n     States Department of the Treasury (the ``Lender'').

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the very important \nbill we are very hopeful we can move on today to start the debate on \nWall Street reform. I understand there may be an agreement to move \nforward with this bill. We don't know that yet. If it is true that we \nhave an agreement to start the debate on this bill, then it is very \nfitting that I go through why this bill is so important. If we don't \nhave an agreement, then it is even more fitting because we know the \nAmerican people got severely hurt by the crisis on Wall Street, by the \nfall of many of our financial institutions, and they were not the ones \nwho were supposed to be hurt. So we need to fix this so it doesn't \nhappen again.\n  Nearly 3 years after the financial system began to melt down, America \ncontinues to suffer the effects of the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, homes, \nand their retirement savings. Although some key indicators are \nbeginning to move in the right direction, many families, such as those \nwe know in Minnesota, are still struggling, and the economic damage is \nvery slow to heal in their towns.\n  On Wall Street, however, it seems to be back to business as usual.\n  Last year, Wall Street's largest firms handed out record bonuses \ntotaling nearly $146 billion, an 18-percent increase from 2008. \nMeanwhile, overall U.S. per capita income declined 2.6 percent. So it \nis little surprise that Wall Street financiers are not enthusiastic \nabout reforms that could change the way they do business. In fact, some \nof them claim Wall Street just has a few potholes that need fixing. \nWell, I think they need more than that. What Wall Street needs is more \nstop signs and key intersections and some good traffic cops.\n  This bill we have is the product of months of bipartisan \nnegotiations. For the first time ever, this bill would create a nine-\nmember financial oversight council chaired by the Treasury Secretary \nand made up of Federal financial regulators. This council would serve \nas an early warning system for systemic risk, something that was \nclearly lacking 3 years ago when these institutions that people were \nadvertising as gold and their investments as gold went tumbling down \nonto the people of this country.\n  The domino effect of deeply interconnected financial companies, such \nas insurance giant AIG, didn't just create economic ripples, they sent \na tsunami surging through the entire economy. This financial oversight \ncouncil will be charged with scanning the system for systemic risks and \nputting speed bumps in place to ensure we never see a crisis such as \nthis one again. This council will, for the first time, bring the \nregulators together to form a picture of the entire system, so one \nregulator will not be dealing with one problem while another is dealing \nwith another with no information being shared. This way there will be \none place where they can look at the entire financial system and look \nfor those warning signs of problems.\n  This bill will also stand at the intersection and make firms slow \ndown by increasing the costs of being large and complex. The most \ninterconnected firms will be required to hold larger levels of capital \nto minimize their risk to the system if the investments go bad. All we \nare asking for, so taxpayers don't have to bail out these firms, is \nthat they have significant resources and enough resources on hand in \ncase they face troubled times again. If firms are going to create risk \nto the system, they need to take some responsibility. We clearly saw in \nthis crisis what a lack of capital can do, how it can bring a firm to \nthe brink, and the downward spiral it can cause when they are unable to \nattract new investors.\n  As much as we would like, we simply can't predict how a future crisis \nmight unfold. I believe one of the most important lessons we can take \nfrom this crisis is that the American taxpayer should never again be \nleft on the hook for the unconscionable bets of Wall Street. The \nAmerican taxpayers' money is not meant to be used to play games within \na casino, where you can throw their money around and then maybe some of \nit will come back and some of it will not. We have to make sure this \ndoesn't happen again. Preventing American taxpayers from being forced \nto bail out financial firms starts with strengthening big financial \nfirms to better withstand stress, looking out for systemic risk, and \nputting a price on activities that pose a risk to the financial system.\n  In the event that a firm was to fail, this bill creates a safe way to \nliquidate failed financial firms that will not leave the taxpayer on \nthe hook. First of all, it updates the Federal Reserve's authority to \nallow systemwide support but no longer allows it to prop up an \nindividual firm. Second, it requires large, complex financial companies \nto submit plans for their rapid and orderly shutdown should they start \nto go under. These plans will help regulators understand the structure \nof the companies they oversee and serve as a roadmap for shutting them \ndown if the company fails.\n  Under this plan, most large financial companies are expected to be \nresolved through the bankruptcy process. Bankruptcy allows those who \ninvest in a firm to better access their risks, and it allows the \npossibility that a company will emerge again in some way intact. If we \nhave a situation where a firm would not go into bankruptcy and its \nfailure could bring down the whole system, we make the process of \nresolution as hard as we can on that firm. We start by shutting down \nthe business and throwing out those who caused the mess. This is a very \ndifferent route than we took in this crisis where we propped up firms \nand kept them alive because of the risk it was going to pose for the \nentire financial system. We don't want to be in that position again. \nThe taxpayers don't want to be in that position again.\n  If a firm chooses our resolution, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the \nFederal Reserve must first all agree to put a company into the orderly \nliquidation process. A panel of three bankruptcy judges must then \nconvene and agree within 24 hours that a company is insolvent. At that \npoint, the FDIC would step in and resolve the firm through this orderly \nprocess and in a way that doesn't harm the overall system. The cost of \nresolution would be paid for not by the taxpayer but by a $50 billion \nfund built up over time--and this is key--paid for by the industry, \npaid for by the industry, not by the taxpayers.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about a key portion of the bill that came out \nof the Agriculture Committee, a committee on which I serve, led by \nChairman Lincoln. The portion of that bill I wish to talk about is the \nfocus on transparency and accountability to the over-the-counter \nderivatives market.\n  Bringing transparency and accountability to the over-the-counter \nderivatives market is essential to our economic system and the American \ntaxpayer and is as important as any other piece of reform we are going \nto be debating. Reckless trading of unregulated over-the-counter \nderivatives played a significant role in triggering the financial \ncrisis in the fall of 2008. AIG, using a type of derivative known as a \ncredit default swap, took enormous risks in guaranteeing at least $400 \nbillion worth of other companies' loans, including those of Lehman \nBrothers. When the financial crisis hit and AIG was unable to make good \non its commitments, Treasury and the Federal Reserve were forced to \nstep in to accept untold, unknown risk to the financial system. In\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\nthe end, the government put up $180 billion of taxpayer money to save \nAIG from collapse.\n  I bring up AIG to point out the dangers of an unregulated, over-the-\ncounter derivatives market. Derivatives, when used properly and backed \nby sufficient collateral, play a crucial role in our financial and \neconomic systems. We think about airlines that want to hedge their risk \nwith the price of oil. You think about agribusinesses. All over this \ncountry that goes on. But this is a whole different issue we are \ntalking about. When irresponsible financial institutions are allowed to \nmake unconscionable bets, hidden from the view of the markets and its \nregulators, the stability of our entire financial system is threatened.\n\n  Right now, the over-the-counter market counts its transactions in the \nhundreds of trillions of dollars, but under the current system, there \nare almost no requirements that the most basic terms of these contracts \nor even their existence be disclosed to regulators or the public. Think \nabout it: Trillions of dollars changing hands and no one even knows \nwhat is happening.\n  The goal of the bill we have today is to finally bring transparency \nand accountability to these unregulated markets. For the first time, \nunder this bill, all trades will be required to be reported to the \nregulators and to the public. With this information, regulators will be \nable to effectively monitor risks to the system and prevent market \nmanipulation and abuse. Transparency will also benefit those who use \nderivatives to hedge risks, as they will be better equipped to evaluate \nthe market, as price information will finally be made public. By \nrequiring mandatory clearing and trading for standardized derivatives, \nthis bill will greatly reduce the ability of risk to build up to a \npoint that could, once again, burst and threaten the financial \nstability of our financial system.\n  I have often said that when Wall Street gets a cold, Main Street gets \npneumonia. We can't let this happen again. In this bill, careful \nconsideration has been made to ensure that commercial entities--this \nwas the work done in our Agriculture Committee--to make sure that \ncommercial entities that hedge solely to mitigate their own commercial \nrisk are not brought under requirements meant to address the failures \nof a market they had no hand in. We think about all the people who \ndidn't have a hand in this problem that got affected. We think even \nabout our small banks in the State of Minnesota. They didn't engage in \nthis kind of risky behavior. I think about them sometimes standing \nthere with their briefcases in the heartland, with those credit default \nrisks swirling around their head that they never used or engaged in, \nsaying: Toto, we are not in Kansas anymore. Because, as we know, some \nbanks in this country had a brain. Some banks didn't go to Oz and think \nthey could go back with the American taxpayers' money. So we have to \nremember that as we go forward.\n  But the most important thing is to make sure we put a traffic cop at \nthose intersections, that we put some stop signs at those \nintersections, that Wall Street isn't allowed to drive down in their \nFerraris while the government is following behind in a Model T Ford.\n  Enacting these reforms is not just important for our financial \nmarkets, it is important for ordinary Americans. While very few people \noutside of those involved in these markets understand or see the impact \nof derivatives on their daily lives, their misuse contributed to a \nrecession that left millions without jobs, businesses shuttered, and \ntrillions in household savings lost. The legislation we passed out of \nthe Agriculture Committee and that Chairman Dodd has worked to \nincorporate into this bill will bring these dark markets into the light \nof day and ensure they will never again threaten the stability of this \nfinancial system.\n  It is very important that we bring this before the Senate, that we \nbegin debate on this bill. That is why, as we look at the rumors \nswirling around that, in fact, there is a deal and that we are going to \nbe able to at least begin the debate on whether to proceed--not debate \non the bill--we are still working out the details. We think this is a \ngood bill. We look forward to working with our colleagues on it, but we \ncan't even get to ``go,'' we can't even get to ``start'' if we can't \nget this bill on the floor to debate.\n  So we are looking forward to discussing this bill, debating for the \nAmerican public and getting it done. The Americans who lost their jobs, \ntheir homes and their savings and are scared every day that it is going \nto happen again because of the recklessness of Wall Street deserve no \nless.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the motion to \nproceed to S. 3217 be agreed to; and that once the bill is reported \ntonight, the Senate then proceed to a period of morning business, with \nSenators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, and on \nThursday, April 29, following the recognition of the leaders or their \ndesignees, the Senate then resume consideration of S. 3217; that after \nthe reporting of the bill and recognition of Senators Dodd and Shelby \nto make opening statements on the bill, Senator Lincoln then be \nrecognized to speak for up to 20 minutes; that on Thursday, no \namendments or motions be in order prior to the offering of the Dodd-\nLincoln substitute amendment; and that once the substitute amendment is \noffered, it be considered read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments here to \nthank the distinguished Senator from Alabama who has been our leader on \nthe Banking Committee and an expert on this very complex subject of \nfinancial regulation, for his steadfast effort in bringing us to where \nwe are today. As Senate Republicans plus Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska \nhave demonstrated over the last few days, we believed the bill we \nstarted with was not insignificant but that it needed to be improved. \nSenator Shelby was given the opportunity, as a result of us staying \ntogether, to be empowered to improve the bill that had previously come \nout of the Banking Committee on a straight party-line vote. So I want \nto take the opportunity to thank all of my Republican colleagues, plus \nSenator Nelson of Nebraska, in giving us the opportunity to improve the \nunderlying bill.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Alabama for his efforts in that \nregard. I think we have a better starting place than we would have had \nearlier and we look forward to, as the majority leader indicated, an \nopen amendment process and plenty of opportunities to treat this like \nthe serious comprehensive bill it is. We have many amendments we intend \nto offer. Our members will be prepared to accept reasonable and short \ntime agreements so we can get these amendments up and voted on, and \nhopefully have an opportunity to make further improvements in the bill.\n  I know Senator Shelby may want to make a few observations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Alabama and my \nfriend from Connecticut, but I want to say a few words first. I too \nhave great respect for my friend Senator Shelby. He and I were \nneighbors in the Longworth Building many years ago and we have \nmaintained that friendship since. There are times when we disagree on \nissues but our relationship is one of friendship.\n  Chris Dodd has had an extremely difficult year. He has had to \nlegislate on some of the most difficult issues to come before this \nbody, and he has been the one who has been the chairman of that \ncommittee and had to do it. In addition to that, his dear friend, his \nbest friend, Senator Kennedy, was ill. He had to take over that \ncommittee and do his Banking Committee. It has been a tremendously \ndifficult year for him. He has done it with mastery of the Senate rules \nand with the ability to articulate his position as well as anyone who \nhas ever served in the Senate. I admire and appreciate him so very \nmuch.\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\n  We also have a new chairman, Senator Lincoln, on the Ag Committee. \nShe has done a very good job. She took it over a couple of months ago \nbut stepped into that committee and has done a remarkably good job on \nan extremely difficult issue dealing with derivatives and things such \nas that. I admire her work and I appreciate so much the ability of \nSenator Dodd and her to work together. Their staffs worked all weekend, \ntrying to put together this substitute amendment we will offer \ntomorrow. I am very grateful for their leadership in the conference, \nthe Democratic conference. They do good work all the time.\n  We have so much to do in the weeks ahead in this work period. But \nthis is the issue we are going to go on. The American people waited \nlong enough for their leaders to get to work cleaning up Wall Street--\nfirst on Monday, then on Tuesday, and twice more today. We didn't have \nto vote today. That is a decision that Senator McConnell and I made--\nthat there was no need to have a vote. There was an agreement to move \nto the bill and that is what we have been trying to do all week.\n  Senate Democrats have asked one thing, that we be allowed to debate, \nwe simply be allowed to do our job as legislators and legislate. We \nbelieve in this bill to crack down on Wall Street, to protect families' \nsavings and seniors' pensions. We never asked the Senate to unanimously \nor blindly approve a single policy. We never sought to send this bill \ndirectly from the committee room to the President's desk. The only \nthing we fought for is the opportunity to have that conversation.\n  After months of bipartisan meetings and negotiations, it is time to \nmove this debate from the sidelines to the playing field, to the Senate \nfloor, which is where it belongs. Senate Republicans have finally \nagreed to let us begin this debate. I appreciate that and I hope it \nforeshadows more cooperation to come. I know Republicans have their own \nsuggestions and amendments for improving this bill. So do Democrats. \nNow that we will be able to begin that process, the American people \nwill finally have the opportunity to watch and weigh those ideas. \nNothing has changed from our end since Monday. The only thing that is \ndifferent is the date. We have always wanted to start the debate on \nWall Street reform with an open, bipartisan amendment process.\n  I will offer the first amendment combining the best parts of the \nBanking Committee and Agriculture Committee's bills. That will be what \nwe will work from. Obstruction has wasted enough of the American \npeople's time. Now let's do our work and do our utmost to make the \nAmerican people proud of our efforts. Let's work for them, the American \npeople. Let them know Wall Street needs reforming. Democrats and \nRepublicans all over America believe it, so let's show the American \npeople we will listen to what they say.\n  There will be no more votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say again before turning to \nSenator Shelby how much we appreciate his leadership on this and how \nmuch we appreciate all of our Republican colleagues, plus Senator \nNelson, giving him the ability to improve the bill that came out of \ncommittee. Much has indeed changed since Monday. I thank Senator Shelby \nfor his leadership. I also commend Senator Dodd for the spirit in which \nthose discussions were commenced.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be brief.\n  First, I thank the Republican leader Senator McConnell for his kind \nwords. Also I thank my friend, the majority leader, Senator Reid, for \nhelping bring us where we are today.\n  But more than that, I commend Senator Dodd, the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, with whom I have worked for years and years. We have \nworked exceedingly closely on many issues dealing with the Banking \nCommittee. What we are bringing to the floor now is something very \ncomplex, very far reaching. The idea that something should be too big \nto fail is very important to me. Nothing should be too big to fail, in \nmy judgment, in this country.\n  I commend Senator Dodd. In our negotiations, they haven't been all \nloss--we have reached some assurances in that. He and his staff have \nmade some recommendations that we like. We made some they liked. I \nthink we have made real progress. I know we have to seal it all, but I \nthink Senator Dodd is working in good faith on that.\n  But we have the derivatives title and we have the consumer products \ndeal. We have not been able to resolve those yet. I hope we will on the \nfloor of the Senate. We have moved to a new forum and it is going to be \na very important debate in the weeks ahead here because this is very \nimportant to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me begin by thanking the majority leader for his work. \nI thank the minority leader as well. This has been a bit acrimonious \nover the last 10 days or so as we tried to get to the floor with this \nbill.\n  Of course I thank Richard Shelby. He and I, as he points out, have \nbeen working together over the last about 37 months during my \nstewardship of the Banking Committee that I inherited in January of \n2007.\n  I noted the other day there are some 42 measures we brought out of \nour committee and 37 of them have become the law of the land. This is a \ngood result. We will now be on this bill, which the American people \nwant us to be on. This is an important issue. As I pointed out this \nmorning, we had the headlines, the hearings here yesterday involving \nmortgage deals and the other headlines about Greece and its debt. Its \nbonds were sinking, causing economic problems in Europe and potentially \nhere.\n  These problems are huge. As Senator Shelby has said and I have said \nover and over, this is a complex area of law we are talking about and \nit has to be gotten right. We have had very good conversations on a \nnumber of issues, but on this over many weeks, going back, obviously, \nand clearly we both share, as everyone does in this Chamber, our \ndetermination that we never again have institutions that become too big \nto fail where there is that implicit guarantee that the Federal \nGovernment will bail them out.\n  I am satisfied that our bill does that already, but I appreciate that \nthere are others who would like to see it tighter, who think we can do \nmore to make it better and more workable. I am anxious to hear them.\n  I know our colleague from California, Barbara Boxer, has some ideas \non this as well that she has raised and I mentioned those with my \nfriend from Alabama. He has raised issues with me that I like as well, \nand he can help us get there. As he rightly points out, we have not \nsealed anything but we have had great conversations, as two people of \ngood will can have, that I think will allow us to get there.\n  We are going to have a very busy couple of weeks coming up now. There \nare a lot of Members who have very strong feelings about this bill. My \njob--our job--will be to see to it people have a chance to offer their \namendments, to debate them, to go through that process.\n  I may sound pretty old-fashioned in this regard. I pointed out last \nnight, I first got involved in this Chamber as a young person sitting \nhere in the same outfits as these young people in their blue suits, as \na page, watching Lyndon Johnson sitting in that chair where you are, \nMr. President, and watching Mike Mansfield in that chair over here and \nEverett Dirkson in that chair.\n  I remember sitting there and listening to the debates on civil rights \nin the early 1960s, when this Chamber, in difficult moments, worked \ntogether to achieve great results for our country. I have great \nreverence for this institution and I want to see it work as our \nFounders intended, where you have a great, important debate--and this \nis one--that we work together as American citizens chosen by our \nrespective States to represent them in this great hall. That is what I \nintend to do as the manager of this bill, to make sure that each and \nevery one of my colleagues--whether they sit on this side of the aisle \nor that side of the aisle--are all in this Chamber together to try to \nimprove the quality of life for the people who have been so badly hurt, \nhomes\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\nlost, jobs that have evaporated, retirement accounts that disappeared \nfor people. They want to see us work together to get a job done to make \na difference for our country and I firmly believe we can do that. I \nwill do my very best, I say to my friend from Alabama, I say to the \nminority leader, as I said to the majority leader, to act with \nfairness, to work together to try to resolve matters so we can have a \ngood outcome on this bill.\n  Obviously we cannot predict that. I know there are some who want to \nmake this a great fight--that this is a great, great issue, maybe, for \nthe day or the week you do it--who wins, who loses. That is a great \nstory. But this is not an athletic contest we are involved in. It is a \ndecision to try to put our country on a far more sound and secure \nfooting than it is today. I look forward to the opportunity to work, as \nI have, with Senator Shelby. We are good friends. I admire him \nimmensely. He was chairman of this committee before I was. He \nunderstands the job of being a chairman.\n  I am determined to get this job right. I encourage our colleagues who \nhave ideas and amendments to come forward and share them with us. We \nare going to set up shop over the weekend to make sure we are there. So \nwe have ideas to consider, accept, maybe modify, make it work right. If \nthat spirit comes forward we can do a good job here and we can leave \nthis Chamber at the end of this Congress, knowing we confronted a \nserious problem and stepped up to the best of our ability to try to \nsolve it for the people we seek to represent.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader and the staff and others for their \nwork. I thank Senator Shelby in his work. This conversation will \ncontinue. We have a lot of work to do. It has been very worthwhile and \nvery productive over these last number of weeks and we intend to keep \nit in that form. I thank the minority leader as well and the Republican \nConference. I know it must have been probably a healthy, good, vibrant \nconversation for the last hour and a half in there. But for those who \nquestion whether we can do this, I want this institution to get back \nagain to the idea of listening to each other, debating the issues, \ntaking our votes and putting together the best product we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2750-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RESTORING AMERICAN FINANCIAL STABILITY ACT OF 2010\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Connecticut and \nAlabama for all their hard work on this issue. I am delighted that \nafter three votes and 3 full days of pressuring those on the other side \nof the aisle to allow us to at least begin debating this critical bill, \nit appears they have relented. Finally, it appears they are willing to \nlisten to not only what Democrats have been saying about the importance \nof a strong new reform bill for Wall Street but what the American \npeople have been saying.\n  What we have been saying is it is time to hold Wall Street \naccountable. It is time to pass strong reforms that cannot be ignored \nor sidestepped. It is time to end bailouts and give Wall Street the \nresponsibility of cleaning up their own mess. It is time credit card \nstatements are in plain English, in loan terms that are spelled out. It \nis time for Wall Street to come out of the shadows and into the light \nof day. It is time for negotiations to come out of the back room and on \nto the Senate floor. It is time to put an end to obstruction and begin \nworking for American families.\n  I am glad we are finally now on this bill. For most American \nfamilies, this debate is not complex; it is simple. It is not about \nderivatives or credit default swaps. It is about fundamental fairness. \nIt is a debate about when they walk into a bank to sign a mortgage or \napply for a credit card or start a retirement plan, are the rules on \ntheir side? Are they with the big banks or Wall Street?\n  For far too long, the financial rules of the road have not favored \nthe American people. Instead, they favored big banks and credit card \ncompanies and Wall Street. For too long they have abused those rules. \nWhether it was gambling with the money in our pension funds or making \nbets they could never cover or peddling mortgages to people they knew \ncould never pay them, Wall Street made expensive choices that came at \nthe expense of working families. That is exactly the reason we have all \nfought so hard to move forward now with a strong bill.\n  It is why we have refused to back down or sit by while it was watered \ndown, and it is why we were ready to stay up all night or vote to move \nforward with this bill all week long. It is why we have insisted on a \nbill that includes the strongest protection for consumers ever enacted, \nan end to taxpayer bailouts, and tools to give individuals the \nresources they need to make smart financial decisions because each of \nus knows what the ``anything goes'' rules on Wall Street have meant for \nour States and our constituents.\n  Each one of us has talked to people who have been hurt through no \nfault of their own. We have all seen the tremendous cost of Wall \nStreet's excesses. In my home State of Washington, it has cost us over \n150,000 jobs. It has cost small businesses access to credit they need \nto grow and hire. It has cost workers their retirement accounts they \nwere counting on to carry them through their golden years. It has cost \nstudents their college savings that would help launch their careers. It \nhas cost homeowners the value of their most important asset, as \nneighborhoods have been decimated by foreclosures. It has cost our \nschoolteachers, our police officers, and our communities.\n  It has cost young people such as David Corrado of Seattle, whose \nmother, since he was very young, would take $400 out of her paycheck \nand put it toward David's education fund. It was a long-term, smart \ninvestment she knew would pay off for David's future. When the \nfinancial crisis occurred, he lost one-third of his college fund, \n$10,000.\n  It has also cost older people such as Edward Diaz, who is also from \nWashington State. He was not only laid off from his job of 21 years due \nto the recession, he also lost $100,000 from his 401(k) account. On the \nverge of retirement, Edward tells me he now scours the classifieds \nevery day searching for any way to get back to work.\n  In the days ahead, as we debate this bill, those are the people we \nhave to remember constantly. We have to keep them in mind as we work to \nprotect against this happening ever again; the people who, through no \nfault of their own, paid the price for the risks and irresponsible \nbehavior of Wall Street. There are people in my State and across the \ncountry who scrimped and saved and made right decisions and were left \nholding the bag.\n  Now is not the time for half measures. The American people are \nlooking to us now for real reform and to put progress before politics. \nWe have to put people before Wall Street.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business, and \nSenators are able to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\nspeak for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is good news we just received that \nour Republican colleagues have decided to allow us to proceed to the \ndebate on the Wall Street reform bill. I was, frankly, confused as to \nwhy they were objecting. But in any event, without going through that, \nI am very pleased they have backed down in terms of their objection \nbecause we want to get to this bill.\n  Many of us have ways we feel it can be made stronger. I bet there \nwill be some amendments to make it weaker. And that is what the process \nis all about. The most important thing for the American people to know \ntonight is that an issue of critical importance is moving forward in \nthe Senate.\n  I think it is important for us to remember the real reasons as to why \nwe are taking up this bill. Even though it is painful to review the \ndark times of 2008, when our economy and the world economy were really \non the brink, I believe it is important for us to do that review.\n  I asked my staff to put together some of the headlines from those \ndays. We are going to go through a couple of charts and I will read a \nfew of them, because we need to remember what it was like in those dark \nmoments in our history.\n  Here is a picture of a Wall Street trader and he is under a headline \nthat says ``Black Monday.'' It was at a moment when the first bailout \nhappened. It says, ``Bailout Fails, Stock Drop Most In History.'' Then \nwe look at this one: ``Where Do We Go From Here?'' ``NASDAQ: The \nBiggest Fall Since Dot.com Crash.'' ``Dow Down 778.'' ``Time'' \nmagazine, ``Wall Street's Latest Downfall: Madoff Charged With Fraud.'' \n``Feds' Rescue Plan: The Bailout To End All Bailouts.'' ``Jobs, Wages, \nNowhere Near Rock Bottom Yet.'' ``Credit Crunch Continues As Lending \nRates Climb.'' ``U.S. Consumer Sentiment Decreases To A 28-Year Low.'' \n``U.S. Loses 533,000 Jobs In The Biggest Drop Since 1974.''\n  That is one chart, and I have one other, just to remind us where we \nwere. San Jose Mercury News: ``Foreclosure Wave: San Jose Fights To \nProtect Neighborhoods.'' ``Carnage Continues: 524,000 Jobs Lost.'' \n``Wall Street Employees Set To Get $145 billion.'' That is in bonuses \nduring all of this. ``Economy In Crisis,'' ``Foreclosure,'' ``Lehman \nFiles For Bankruptcy,'' ``Merrill Sold,'' ``AIG Seeks Cash.'' We know \nall about that. ``What now?'' ``The Dow Falls 777,'' ``Economy On The \nBrink.'' ``U.S. Pension Insurer Lost Billions In The Market.'' \n``Housing Prices Take Biggest Dive Since 1991.'' ``U.S. Drafts Sweeping \nPlan To Fight Crisis As Turmoil Worsens In Credit Markets.'' And here \nis one: ``Full Of Doubts, U.S. Shoppers Cut Spending.''\n  I read these headlines to my colleagues to bring back those dark, \ndark, dark days and why we are here today trying to make sure it never \nhappens again. If we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat \nit, and we have learned and we are ready to make sure this never \nhappens again.\n  Those dark times came because we allowed Wall Street to engage in \nunregulated and unsupervised gambling. I have to say I am an economics \nmajor. That goes back quite a bit of time. Many years ago, before any \nof these kinds of exotic instruments were created, I worked on Wall \nStreet as a stockbroker. I can tell my colleagues that every time the \nPresident of the United States would sneeze and the market went down a \nfew points, I worried. I can just imagine how I would have felt if I \nwould have had clients in this kind of situation where there was no \ncontrol.\n  A shadow banking system grew up that fueled an unsustainable housing \nbubble. From 2001 to 2007, the issuance of toxic private mortgage-\nbacked securities increased by over 400 percent. These securities were \nrated by credit rating agencies--the credit rating agencies that were \nsupposed to be tellers of the truth. They are supposed to say to the \nconsumer, uh-oh--I sound like my grandchild who says uh-oh--that is \nwhat they are supposed to say: Don't buy those securities because they \nare not good. But these credit agencies, rating agencies such as \nMoody's and Standard & Poor's, frankly, acted as though they were in \nthe pockets of the issuers who paid them. In other words, they gave a \ngood answer. If you wanted to issue securities--I don't care whether it \nis Goldman or anybody else--you go to these fellows, you pay them, and \nthey tell you something good. What went wrong? That is a disaster. \nWhere is the fiduciary responsibility in any of these relationships?\n  The unregulated over-the-counter derivatives market also grew by over \n400 percent to a value greater than the entire U.S. economy. The \nunregulated over-the-counter derivatives market grew by over 400 \npercent to a value greater than the entire United States economy. Wall \nStreet institutions critical to our economy purposely created complex \npaper instruments that had no real value. In these hearings Senator \nLevin is holding, we see what happened when one company--Goldman--\nknew--and I can't use the words they used because it would be improper \non the floor--they knew a product they were selling was just plain junk \nand they sold it to their customers, to their clients. One of the \npeople said in an e-mail: Wow, think of all the orphans and the widows \nwe are hurting. That sounds to me like the Enron scandal where we had \ntraders doing the same thing when energy prices went through the roof.\n  In 2007 and in the first part of 2008, the house of cards began to \ncollapse, because backing up these new complex instruments Wall Street \ncreated were these exotic loans that consumers could never repay unless \nhousing prices continued to soar to unrealistic levels. So they created \nthese instruments that were backed by these mortgages that were doomed \nto fail unless the economy continued to shoot like a star straight up \nand the housing market went up. The housing bubble began to deflate, \nand think about all of these derivatives and all of these exotic \nsecurities that were based on housing. Mortgage lenders and financial \ninstitutions began to fail; first Countrywide, then Bear Stearns. The \nFederal Reserve had to intervene behind the scenes to try and keep \ncredit flowing. Remember, in a capitalist society, in our economy, we \nhave to have credit flowing. Credit, that is what the small businesses \nneed. That is what governments need, overnight credit. The State of \nCalifornia couldn't even get overnight credit. The worst crisis hit in \nSeptember 2008--the worst since the 1929 Great Depression.\n  Listen to this: Over just 3 days, September 13, 14, and 15, three \nmajor financial institutions failed--Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch. \nOh, my God, the shock in the country. Regulators were unprepared. They \nhad no warning. Panic spread from this Wall Street debacle as banks \nlost confidence in the solvency of the financial system and they \nrefused to lend. Credit was frozen. Consumers started to withdraw their \nmoney from failing money market funds, and some of them found out that \nthey weren't insured, the money markets. We had to actually create \ninsurance.\n  The stock market dropped 25 percent in September alone, part of a \nlarger 50-percent drop from 2008 to 2009. Trillions of dollars in \npensions and savings wealth were lost. Without the tools to handle the \ncrisis, the Bush administration was forced to approach us for direct \ntaxpayer assistance. I will never forget the day when the Republican \nTreasury Secretary Hank Paulson looked me in the eye, along with all of \nmy colleagues, and said capitalism was on the brink of collapse. I will \ntell my colleagues, I asked him a number of questions that day about \nthe role that credit default swaps played in this, and derivatives, and \nto be totally candid, he didn't have an answer. He was so concerned \nabout staving off this collapse.\n  It was too late. It was too late to stop Wall Street's crisis from \nimpacting the rest of our economy. Business lending plummeted. I know \nthe Presiding Officer knows that small businesses have created 64 \npercent of all of the new jobs in the last 15 years. When those good, \nstrong businesses couldn't get credit, some of them couldn't keep the \ndoors open. I can tell my colleagues that none of them expanded. They\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\ncouldn't. They didn't have the capital. Retail spending fell by 14 \npercent, driven by historic declines in consumer confidence, and \nbecause consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of our economy, this \nwas another disaster on another disaster on another disaster.\n  As the recession fueled by the financial crisis spread, job losses \nexploded to 750,000 a month, the highest ever recorded. Some 8.4 \nmillion jobs were lost in 2008 and 2009. In my own home State of \nCalifornia, almost 1 out of every 10 jobs was lost--1 out of every 10 \njobs. To put a human face on that and think about those families in \nthat situation where not only did they lose a lot of their net worth in \nthe stock market which was going down, down, down, they were losing the \nvalue of their home, and then they lost their job, and it exacerbated \nthe problem. Unemployment rose above 10 percent for the first time in \n28 years. In my State it is over 12 percent today. Even though we are \nnow creating jobs in California and in the country, they are not at a \nfast enough pace as more people come into the jobs market. We had a \nsituation where almost one out of every five Americans who wanted to \nwork was underemployed.\n  I don't see how anyone who knows this history--and all you had to do \nwas wake up and read the paper or, if you didn't do that, put on the TV \nor, if you didn't do that, look at your Internet or, if you didn't do \nthat, listen to the radio. And if you were without all that, you could \nhave listened to what we were debating here, and there were probably \nnot too many people doing that. So how could we ever for one second \ndeny the need for the Dodd bill, which reflects the President's Wall \nStreet reform bill, even for a minute? I can't imagine anyone living \nthrough this crisis could ever doubt the need to do the bill that we, \nthank goodness, are on right now.\n  The bill directly addresses the problems that led to the crisis. It \ngives regulators the tools they need to prevent a crisis in the future \nwithout ever turning to taxpayers.\n  I am going to quickly go through the provisions of the Dodd bill. I \nam going to go through six provisions.\n  First, the bill ends taxpayer bailouts. The bill guarantees taxpayers \nwill never again be forced to bail out Wall Street firms. Failing \ncompanies will be liquidated. Any losses will be absorbed by companies \nand the financial sector, not taxpayers.\n  That is a jobs bill.\n  By the way, when I heard my colleagues on the other side say they \ndidn't think this is true, I went up to Senator Dodd and I talked to \nthe administration. I said I am going to offer an amendment that says \nthis in plain English; will you accept it? They did. So we will have \nthat amendment accepted.\n  If anybody ever says to you this bill is about giving more taxpayer \nfunds to bail out Wall Street, you can say: Excuse me, you are looking \nat the wrong bill.\n  Second, it puts a cop on the beat for consumers. The bill creates the \nconsumer financial protection bureau, which will have the sole job of \nprotecting the American consumers from the kind of deceptive and \nabusive financial practices that fueled the crisis. It will also look \nout for credit cards and other things.\n  We will finally have disclosure in these dark markets. Remember, I \ntalked about these toxic assets--assets made up of slices of mortgages, \nmany of which had no value. They were in the dark. Now these dark \nmarkets are over, derivatives markets will be open, and the shadow \nbanking system will be over--over. No more darkness but transparency, \nopenness, and the rest that goes with it.\n  Here is what the Dodd bill does. It curbs risky behavior on Wall \nStreet. It says, essentially, no more gambling. There will be strict \nnew capital and borrowing requirements, so you cannot go out and \nsuperleverage. You have to be able to have some balance in your bank. \nThere will be an early warning system to prevent a future crisis. There \nwill be a financial stability oversight council to focus on problems \nbefore they lead to a crisis.\n  As a last resort, the regulators can break up a company that is too \nbig to fail. Too big to fail is over. If anyone tells you it is not \nover, they have not read the bill, because this bill completely and \nclearly says if a company is too big to fail, the regulators can break \nit up. We will see protection against securities market scams.\n  The bill mandates management improvements and increased funding for \nthe SEC. A new office in SEC will be created to look at credit rating \nagencies. Remember, I mentioned that, the credit rating agencies were \njust giving AAA ratings to junk. No more. They will have someone \nlooking over their shoulders. That is very important.\n  I want to put the headlines back up. Clearly, this bill does what we \nneed to do. The bill stops taxpayer bailouts, and if ever there was a \ntime to agree on one thing, it would be that.\n  Again, to eliminate all doubt, I proposed an amendment to Senator \nDodd, which he is in agreement with and the President's people are in \nagreement with, to make it clear that failing firms cannot be bailed \nout. It is very clear because it says it in this amendment. It cannot \nkeep a company alive, on life support, and it cannot stop it from \nfailing. When it is liquidated, the cost of that liquidation will be \npaid for by Wall Street firms.\n  I am excited about the fact that we are finally moving to this bill. \nBy the way, the last sentence in the Boxer amendment is very short on \nthis page:\n\n       Taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of any \n     authority under the title.\n\n  So if anyone says to you this bill isn't clear, I have to say they \nare making it up because it is very clear. Senator Dodd would never \nhave accepted this amendment if it wasn't in concert with the bill.\n  Again, I know that many colleagues have ideas for changing the bill. \nThat is why we are here. My Republican friends decided not to make any \namendments in committee, so this is their opportunity to do so. I look \nforward to seeing their ideas. I say that with sincerity. A lot of \nRepublican amendments were included in the health care bill, and that \nis good. We want to see some of their ideas to strengthen this bill \nbecause, as Senator Dodd has said many times, no Senator has a corner \non wisdom. We have to work together, and we can get our best ideas by \nworking together.\n  I am going to work with anyone on either side of the aisle who has \nthe goal of protecting the American taxpayers and has the goal of \nprotecting the American economy from future crises. I will vote for a \ncouple of colleagues' amendments to strengthen this bill. I am looking \nforward to that.\n  Let's not oppose this bill on the grounds that to do nothing is \nbetter, because, clearly, to do nothing will lead us back to this road \nof getting up in the morning and shaking in our boots about what is \nhappening with unemployment and with the loss of our pension funds. It \nis extraordinary to go back, just to 2007, not that long ago, when this \nall started. We have to commit ourselves to never having it happen \nagain.\n  Now is the time for Wall Street reform. I am very pleased at this \nchange of heart on the other side. I was ready to spend the evening \nhere, and I am happy that I can actually go home to my family tonight. \nAs much as I enjoy my colleagues' company, I would prefer to be with my \nfamily, my grandkids, my husband, and not have to spend the night here. \nBut I was prepared to spend the weekend here or whatever it took \nbecause once in a while an opportunity for reform comes along. It did \nwith health care. We are in an era of reform, and we have to keep doing \nit. It is all expressed right here on this chart. We know what will \nhappen if we keep this going. Deregulation on steroids didn't work. We \nneed sensible regulations, sensible rules of the road.\n  We want everyone to prosper, but we don't want to see gambling lead \nto the pain and suffering that is still going on throughout this \ncountry. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2752-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2752-S2753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

CUMMINGS II\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nextraordinary work of Arthur M. Cummings II, who has served with \ndistinction for more than 20 years with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation.\n  Mr. Cummings was appointed on January 9, 2008 as executive assistant \ndirector of the FBI's National Security branch. In that position, Mr. \nCummings worked diligently to oversee the FBI's counterterrorism, \ncounterintelligence, weapons of mass destruction and intelligence \nprograms, as well as the Terrorist Screening Center. His outstanding \nwork leading the FBI in the coordination and liaison with the U.S. \nDirector of National Intelligence and the rest of the Intelligence \ncommunity contributed greatly to the FBI and the entire intelligence \nfield. Mr. Cummings brought to the job a wealth of investigative and \nmanagerial experience.\n  Since becoming an FBI special agent in 1987, Mr. Cummings was \nassigned to five field offices and to the Counterterrorism Division at \nFBI headquarters. He managed ounterterrorism, counterintelligence, \nviolent crimes and drug programs in several field offices, and had \ndeployed overseas to support several major counterterrorism \ninvestigations.\n  Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Mr. Cummings \nplayed an instrumental role in the reorganization of the FBI's \ncounterterrorism program and later served as chief of the \nCounterterrorism Operational Response Section, responsible for the \ndevelopment and oversight of FBI operations in foreign theaters such as \nAfghanistan. In 2003, Mr. Cummings became Chief of the International \nTerrorism Operations Section, responsible for developing and managing \nFBI strategy and operations directed against al-Qaida and its \naffiliated organizations and networks. Mr. Cummings also served in \n2004-05 as deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, \nNCTC, a multiagency organization dedicated to eliminating the terrorist \nthreat to U.S. interest domestically and abroad.\n  After his tenure at NCTC, Mr. Cummings was named special agent-in-\ncharge of the Counterterrorism Division and Intelligence branch of the \nFBI's Washington field office.\n  In recognition of his accomplishments, Mr. Cummings was awarded the \n2004 Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service and the 2006 \nPresidential Rank Award for Meritorious Executive. Mr. Cummings is a \nformer Navy SEAL and speaks Mandarin Chinese. He is a graduate of the \nUniversity of California in San Diego.\n  I, along with all of my Senate colleagues, congratulate Arthur on his \nwell-deserved retirement after such a distinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2753-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THOMAS MORRIS GRIFFIN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \nwork of Thomas Morris Griffin, Jr., during his 12 years with the U.S. \nSecret Service.\n  In his prior positions, Special Agent Griffin was assigned to train \nagents, handle daily operations of the First Lady Whip and protect the \nPresident of the United States. Special Agent Griffin began his law \nenforcement career in 1985 at the Richland County Sheriff's Office in \nColumbia, SC. This department of more than 300 sworn officers served a \ncounty of more than 300,000 citizens. At that agency, he served as a \ndetective and sergeant in the Major Crimes Unit and as a team leader in \nthe narcotic division. Special Agent Griffin also served as a Sheriff's \nDeputy with the uniform division, greatly enhancing the safety and \nsecurity of Columbia, SC.\n  Special Agent Griffin received his bachelor of science in criminal \njustice from the University of South Carolina, received hundreds of \nhours of training as a special agent, and was duly recognized in 1994 \nwith the Medal of Valor for hunting down and exchanging fire with a \nmurderer who had shot three people, killing two of them.\n  Special Agent Griffin's work at the Capitol since 2007 has greatly \nenhanced the safety and security of United States Secret Service \nprotectees and, ultimately, those working in and visiting the Capitol \ncomplex. He has cultivated and maintained partnerships with the United \nStates Capitol Police, and the offices of the Senate Sergeant and Arms \nand House Sergeant at Arms. Through these relationships, the needs of \nthe United States Secret Service protective missions are communicated \nand security plans coordinated. As he is promoted to special agent-in-\ncharge, Special Agent Griffin leaves the United States Capitol where he \nhas forged great partnerships as the assistant to the special agent-in-\ncharge of the United States Secret Service Liaison Division.\n  I wish Special Agent Griffin all the best in his promotion and new \nassignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2753-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I have expressed to Senator Harkin and \nto Secretary Duncan, I am concerned that the Student Aid and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act, SAFRA, may not adequately provide for the \nreplacement of the early college awareness, default prevention, \nfinancial literacy, and school support services that are provided by \nState guaranty agencies in some States. The citizens of my State rely \nupon the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, PHEAA, to \nprovide these services. Over the years, PHEAA has funded these services \nwith the earnings they have retained from their role as a State \nguaranty agency, lender, and servicer. It is my understanding that some \nof these earnings will no longer be available to PHEAA or to other \nsimilar agencies across the country.\n  Would Senator Harkin agree that some of the services provided by \nthese agencies are vital and should, to the extent possible, be \ncontinued?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am pleased that this bill provides significant support \nto continue outreach and default aversion activities through the \nCollege Access Challenge Grant Program funded at $750 million, more \nthan double the amount we have provided for these grants in years past. \nHowever, I agree that these activities are very important and we could \ndo more to assist students.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as Senator Gillibrand and I have \nexpressed to Senator Harkin, we share Senator Specter's concerns. The \ncitizens of our State rely upon the New York State Higher Education \nServices Corporation, HESC, to provide similar services, which have \nalso been funded with the earnings HESC has retained from their role as \na State guaranty agency.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask does Senator Harkin agree that \nthe Secretary of Education has the authority to contract for these \ntypes of services?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. And, Mr. President, I ask if Senator Schumer would \nalso agree that in our State and many other States these agencies \nprovide valuable services to students and families?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, I do. That is why Senator Gillibrand, Senator \nSpecter, and I believe it would be beneficial for the Secretary of \nEducation to use this authority for State guaranty agencies that \nprovide valuable services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2753-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2753-S2754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FIRE GRANTS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, yesterday Senators Dodd, Collins, \nCarper, McCain, and I introduced the Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of \n2010.\n  The bill we presented to the Senate is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that provides support to our Nation's firefighters and \nemergency medical service responders. It reauthorizes the Assistance to \nFirefighters, AFG, program and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and \nEmergency Response program, SAFER--two highly successful programs I \nworked to establish in 2000 and 2003, respectively.\n  I think we are all aware of the great sacrifices first responders \nmake for us. Since September 11 and the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe, \nfirefighters in communities large and small have assumed a greater role \nin overall national emergency preparedness. They are now the frontline \nof defense in most communities for disasters of all\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\ntypes. More than ever, firefighters need the training and equipment to \ndeal not only with fires but also with hazardous materials, nuclear, \nradioactive and explosive devices, and other potential threats.\n  The demands on firefighters have increased in other ways as well. As \nthe New York Times reported last year, firefighters are responding more \nand more to medical emergencies--15.8 million in 2008, a 213 percent \nincrease from 1980. Right here in Washington, DC, at Fire Engine \nCompany 10--known as the ``House of Pain'' for its grueling schedule--\n80 percent of the calls are for medical emergencies. Our Nation's \nfirefighters--like other first responders are the first to arrive and \nthe last to leave whenever trouble hits. They deserve all the support \nwe can give them.\n  Regrettably, they do not always get it. Firefighters often lack the \nequipment and vehicles they need to do their jobs safely and \neffectively. The U.S. Fire Administration reported in 2006 that 60 \npercent of fire departments did not have enough breathing apparatuses \nto equip all firefighters on a shift, 65 percent did not have enough \nportable radios, and 49 percent of all fire engines were at least 15 \nyears old.\n  We can and should do more so that these brave men and women have what \nthey need to protect their communities and themselves as they perform a \nvery dangerous job. Our bill takes much-needed steps to ensure that \nthey do.\n  To start with, because career, volunteer, and combination fire \ndepartments all suffer from shortages in equipment, vehicles, and \ntraining, our bill requires that each type receives at least 25 percent \nof the available AFG grant funding. The remaining funds will be \nallocated based on factors such as risk and the needs of individual \ncommunities and the country as a whole. This creates an appropriate \nbalance, ensuring that funds are directed at departments facing the \nmost significant risks while guaranteeing that no department is left \nout.\n  We have also taken a number of steps in our bill to help fire \ndepartments recover from the recession. Faced with economic \ndifficulties, local governments have reduced spending on vital \nservices, including fire departments. Among other things, these cuts \nhave prevented many departments from replacing old equipment and forced \nthem to lay off needed firefighters. To help departments rebuild, we \nhave lowered the matching requirements for AFG and SAFER. Departments \nare still required to match some of their grant awards with funds of \ntheir own--ensuring they have some skin in the game--but the reduced \namount will make it easier for them to accept awards.\n  We have also created an economic hardship waiver for both grant \nprograms that will allow FEMA to waive certain requirements, such as \nrequiring that grantees provide matching funds, for departments in \ncommunities that have been especially hard hit by tough economic times.\n  Our bill contains a number of other important provisions. It raises \nthe maximum grant amounts available under AFG. As common sense would \nsuggest, large communities often require a substantial amount of \nequipment, and they will now be able to apply for funding in amounts \nmore in line with what they need.\n  We also would provide funding for national fire safety organizations \nand institutions of higher education that wish to create joint programs \nestablishing fire safety research centers. There is a great need for \nresearch devoted to fire safety and prevention and improved technology. \nThe work these centers do will help us reduce fire casualties among \nfirefighters and civilians and make communities safer.\n  As important as it is to help our firefighters, we must also demand \naccountability when we spend taxpayer dollars. For this reason, we \nrequire that FEMA create performance management systems for these \nprograms, complete with quantifiable metrics that will allow us to see \nhow well they perform. Going forward, this will allow us to see what \nworks in these programs and what does not so that we can make needed \nimprovements when required.\n  We have also included provisions to prevent earmarks from being \nattached to these programs. AFG and SAFER have never been earmarked--an \nimpressive accomplishment--and we want to keep it that way. The funding \nfor these programs needs to go to firefighters, not pet projects.\n  Finally, this legislation authorizes $950 million each for these \nvital programs. This is actually less than what was authorized in the \npast. We believe that supporting our nation's firefighters and \nemergency medical service responders ought to be a priority, but we \nrecognize that these tough fiscal times require some belt-tightening. \nAuthorizing funding for AFG and SAFER at these amounts sends the \nmessage that Congress can direct funding where it is needed while also \nshowing discipline.\n  These programs address a vital national need. Our legislation ensures \nthat fire departments get the support they need to protect their \ncommunities while also protecting taxpayer dollars. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the reauthorization of these \nimportant programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2754-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING NICS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, April 16 marked the 3-year anniversary of \nthe deadliest shooting rampage in our Nation's history, a tragedy that \ntook the lives of 32 Virginia Tech students and faculty members and \nwounded 17 more. In the aftermath of the shooting, investigations \nuncovered that the gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, was able to purchase two guns \nin violation of Federal law. Due to his history of mental illness, Mr. \nCho was legally prohibited from purchasing these firearms. However, the \ntransaction was not blocked because the State of Virginia had not \nprovided his mental health records to the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System, NICS. The Virginia Tech tragedy serves as a \nsomber illustration of the importance of the NICS database containing \naccurate criminal history and mental health records of prohibited \nindividuals.\n  The Virginia Tech shooting prompted the passage of the NICS \nImprovement Amendments Act of 2007, Public Law 110-180, which \nauthorized funds to assist States and State courts in the automation of \nmental health and criminal records and in the transmittal of these \nrecords to the Federal NICS database. Unfortunately, due to budget \nconstraints, some States still have not fully digitized their criminal \nhistory records, nor do they have the funds necessary to process the \ntransfer of State records into NICS. According to the group Mayors \nAgainst Illegal Guns, the NICS database contains less than 20 percent \nof the mental health records it should. In addition, according to the \nBrady Campaign, NICS is missing 25 percent of the necessary felony \nconviction data from States. These gaps in needed records weaken the \nability of current Federal law to stop firearms from getting into the \nhands of dangerous or potentially dangerous individuals.\n  It is essential that States and State courts have the resources \nneeded to ensure that the Federal background check system contains \ncomprehensive and up-to-date records. To that end, I recently joined \nseven of my colleagues in urging the Senate Appropriations Committee to \ninclude $325 million in the fiscal year 2011 Commerce, Justice, \nScience, and Related Agencies appropriations bill to fully implement \nthe NICS Improvement Amendments Act. NICS is a powerful tool in the \nprevention of gun violence that deserves full congressional support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2754-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2754-S2755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WORKER'S MEMORIAL DAY 2010\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, each year, we set aside April 28 as \nWorkers Memorial Day, a time to remember and honor those who have been \nkilled or injured or have contracted a serious illness in the \nworkplace. Since the passage of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act and \nOccupational Safety and Health Act four decades ago, countless lives \nhave been saved and the number of workplace accidents has been \ndramatically reduced.\n  Yet too many workers still remain in harm's way. In 2008, over 5,200 \npeople were killed at work in the United States and roughly 50,000 \nworkers died from occupational diseases. Millions more were injured on \nthe job. This means that, on an average day, 151 workers lose their \nlives, 14 from injuries and 137 from job-related diseases. These are \nworkers from all walks of life--firefighters, police officers, coal \nminers and farmers, men and women\n\n[[Page S2755]]\n\nwho are working to put food on the table to support their families and \nloved ones. These deaths are tragedies that can and should be \nprevented.\n  Our entire Nation mourned when we learned of the terrible tragedy \nthat killed 29 miners in Montcoal, WV. But it is important to remember \nthat mines aren't our only dangerous workplaces. Our Nation suffered \nanother great loss when we learned of the 11 missing oil rig workers \noff the coast of Louisiana, and we still mourn the lives of those \nworkers who died in explosions in Washington State and Connecticut \nearlier this year. All of these incidents could have been prevented. \nThese terrible tragedies illustrate the dangers hardworking Americans \nface on the job every day, and why we need to redouble our efforts to \nmake every workplace a safe workplace.\n  Every April 28, for the past 9 years, Mary Davis and her family have \nobserved Workers Memorial Day in honor of her husband Jeff Davis, a \nboilermaker who was killed in a sulfuric acid tank farm explosion at a \nrefinery in Delaware. His body was never recovered, most likely because \nit was dissolved in acid. The disaster also injured eight other workers \nand caused major environmental impact in the surrounding area. Motiva, \nthe company that owned the refinery, pleaded guilty to discharging \npollutants into the Delaware River and negligently releasing sulfuric \nacid into the air, both in violation of the Clean Air Act, resulting in \na $10 million fine. For the same accident, OSHA initially cited three \nserious and two willful violations against Motiva for Jeff Davis' \ndeath. The Agency proposed a penalty of $175,000 that Motiva later was \nable to reduce through settlement for a total of only $132,000.\n  I recently spoke with Holly Shaw, a school teacher living in \nPennsylvania. Her husband Scott drowned after falling into the \nSchuylkill River while working on two barges, helping to dredge the \nriver. The barges had no life jackets for workers to wear, and no life \npreservers in the event of an accident. The two barges were connected \nby a series of old tires that workers had to navigate to move from \nbarge to barge. OSHA found Armco, the company that employed Scott, had \ncommitted four serious violations and was fined $4,950. Holly later \nfound out that Armco was given the opportunity to plead down the fine \nand ended up only paying $4,000 for Scott's death. It is truly shocking \nthat the company faced such minor consequences for its appallingly \ninadequate safety practices.\n  Unfortunately, stories like Jeff Davis's and Scott Shaw's are all too \ncommon. Although a willful or repeat violation of OSHA carries a \nmaximum penalty of $70,000 and willful violations a minimum of $5,000, \nmost penalties are far smaller. In both cases, current penalties \nweren't sufficient to force recalcitrant employers to take workplace \nsafety more seriously even when a worker is killed. To date, OSHA has \ncited Motiva for nearly two dozen other violations since Jeff Davis' \ndeath. In 2009, workers went on strike against the same company that \nleased its barge to Armco, protesting unsafe workplace practices, after \na deckhand was crushed to death between two barges. As Holly said to \nme, ``another family suffers because of the same negligence.''\n  This has to change. We need to increase penalties for irresponsible \nemployers who ignore the law, and give our federal agencies the \nenforcement tools they need to keep workers away from imminent danger. \nThis week we held a hearing in the HELP Committee to explore these \nchallenging issues. And, in the weeks ahead, I intend to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle on legislation to make our mines \nand all our dangerous workplaces safer.\n  Workplace safety is an issue that is very personal to me. My father \nwas a coal miner, and I saw firsthand the devastating effects of the \nlung problems created by his work in the mines. We still have a long \nway to go to ensure that our sons and daughters, moms and dads, \nbrothers and sisters all come home safe from a hard day's work, and we \nshould not rest until workplace tragedies are a chapter in the history \nbooks, and we no longer have any need to observe a day of mourning for \nAmerican workers killed on the job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2755-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO FATHER RAY DOHERTY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on May 4, the Saint Michael's College \ncommunity will celebrate the 80th birthday of a fellow Michaelman and \nlongtime friend of many, Reverend Raymond Doherty. Father Ray, as he is \nknown to many, graduated from Saint Michael's College in 1951, and \nbegan what has become a lifetime of service to the Saint Michael's \ncommunity. A devoted member of the Society of Saint Edmund, whose \nmembers founded Saint Michael's over 100 years ago, Father Ray embodies \nthe deep commitment to social justice that has become the hallmark of a \nSaint Michael's College education. It is among the many reasons I am \nproud to join Saint Michael's alumni everywhere in celebrating this \nmilestone.\n  For the past seven decades, Father Ray has advised, counseled, and \nsupported countless Saint Michael's students, faculty, alumni, and \nVermonters. His contributions have not gone unnoticed. In 2005, a \nfellow classmate established the Reverend Raymond Doherty SSE '51 \nScholarship to honor Father Ray's significant contributions as a \ncollege administrator, friend, and religious leader. Saint Michael's \nstudents continue to learn and grow from Father Ray's contributions to \nthe Saint Michael's community. Countless students, and in many cases \ngenerations of families, are lucky to know him.\n  As a student at Saint Michael's in the late 1940s and early 1950s, \nFather Ray graced the George ``Doc'' Jacobs baseball program as a \nstarting and relief pitcher for the college. Later in his career, \nFather Ray would serve as a key member of the college's 1987 and 1996 \nathletic tasks forces. Last year, the Saint Michael's community honored \nthat legacy by inducting him in to the Saint Michael's College Athletic \nHall of Fame.\n  Saint Michael's widely recognized reputation for encouraging its \nstudents and alumni to foster peace and justice has been bolstered by \nFather Ray's commitment to community service and helping those in need. \nHis frequent involvement in Saint Michael's signature service \norganization, the Mobilization of Volunteer efforts, MOVE, has been an \nexample to all.\n  Two years ago, in 2008, Father Ray and the Edmundite community \ncelebrated the 50th anniversary of his ordination. As Father Ray marks \nanother milestone this year, I join with countless of fellow Michaelmen \nin wishing him the happiest of birthdays. We all look forward to his \ncontinued support of the Saint Michael's mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2755-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2755-S2756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING ERNEST BRAUN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of a remarkable \nman, Ernest Braun of Marin County, CA. Ernest was a passionate \nphotographer and avid environmentalist who loved sharing the gifts of \nphotography and nature with his family and community. He passed away on \nMarch 23, 2010.\n  Ernest Braun was born on September 13, 1921, in St. Louis, MO, to \nMaurice and Hazel Braun. At their home in San Diego, the Braun family \ncelebrated the out of doors during Ernest's early years. Maurice Braun, \nan impressionist painter inspired by California's landscape, shared his \ndeep appreciation of nature with his children. While still very young, \nErnest was given his first camera as a Christmas gift, and his world \nwould never be the same. The camera became Ernest's tool for sharing \nhis perspective of the world with those around him.\n  During World War II, Ernest served in the U.S. Army as a combat \nphotographer, capturing images of the atrocities of war in Europe. \nErnest's photos of concentration camps and numerous battles brought the \nconflict home to American shores. He served his country greatly with \nhis portrayals of the human cost of war. Following the end of the war, \nhe lived briefly in New York before he and his new wife, Sally Long, \nsettled in San Anselmo, CA. Inspired by the beautiful vistas of Marin \nCounty, in the 1960s Ernest discovered his true love: nature \nphotography. He believed strongly in the importance of\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\nhumanity's relationship to the natural world, and he created images to \nhelp people see and maintain that connection.\n  Ernest became an award-winning photographer serving architectural, \nindustrial, and commercial clients while nurturing his dedication to \nshowcasing the beauty of Mother Nature. Ernest was deeply committed to \nhis craft and worked to ensure others had the opportunity to explore \nphotography. Ernest taught photography at several schools including the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, \nSan Diego. In addition, he traveled around the world teaching \nenvironmental photography workshops in Peru, Kenya, New Zealand, \nAlaska, Ecuador, China, New Zealand, the Galapagos Islands, and \nelsewhere. Ernest was a revered and sought-after photographer whose \ngift for the art form was admired by many.\n  Ernest's photography has been exhibited in prestigious institutions \nall over the country, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art \nand the Time-Life Gallery in New York City. In 1968, Ernest was voted \nthe Nation's top architectural photographer by the American Institute \nof Architects, and in 1970 he won first prize in the landscape division \nof Life magazine's photo contest. Many of his images have also been \npublished in books celebrating our environment.\n  Ernest was a kind and decent man with whom I had the great pleasure \nof being personally acquainted. He will certainly be remembered for his \nskillful photographic representations of the world around him and for \nhis love and dedication to nature. Although he will be dearly missed, \nwe take comfort in knowing that future generations will continue to \nbenefit from the timeless gifts of the photographs he left behind.\n  Ernest is survived by his daughter Jennifer; his sons Jeff, \nChristopher, and Jonathan; and his four grandchildren. Our hearts go \nout to Ernest's family and friends during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2756-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING KEELER CONDON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Keeler \nBud Condon, former councilman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in \nSouth Dakota. Keeler passed away on March 30, 2010. The community of \nCherry Creek, SD, and all of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation lost \na great leader and friend.\n  Keeler's Lakota name, Iktomi Kuwapi, is translated as ``Cannot Be \nFooled.'' He was born on May 5, 1941, in Porcupine, SD, on the Pine \nRidge Reservation, and he spent his childhood years there. Keeler \nattended a number of tribal schools before graduating from Cheyenne-\nEagle Butte High School in 1961.\n  One of Keeler's greatest joys was sports. He was an avid sports fan \nand athlete; in 1959, his basketball team won the South Dakota State \n``B'' Championship. After high school, he played with the All American \nIndian Semi-Pro team. Illustrating his enduring commitment to \ncommunity, he maintained contact throughout his life with his high \nschool basketball coach, Gus Kolb. Keeler worked for many years as a \ncertified building and trades professional and also served as a bus \ndriver for the Takini School before he was elected to the Cheyenne \nRiver Tribal Council in 2002. He served a 4-year term.\n  In 2003, I met Keeler when he hosted me and former Indian Health \nService Director Dr. Charles Grim in Cherry Creek. We joined him for a \ntour and pow-wow. I remember well his constant advocacy for better \nhealth care and an improved quality of life for tribal communities. \nAfter Keeler retired from the Tribal Council, he continued to be a \nconsistent presence at Tribal Headquarters in Eagle Butte. He would \ntake the time to visit with many tribal members and provide guidance to \nthe elected leaders.\n  I am sure that Keeler's entire family, including his wife Frieda, \nfour children, and two stepchildren are very proud of his \naccomplishments, as they ought to be. Strong leaders are central to the \nwell-being of tribal communities, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe \ncertainly benefited from Keeler's contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2756-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PAULETTE MONTILEAUX\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to Ms. \nPaulette Montileaux of Rapid City, SD, on an outstanding 42 years of \nservice to the Federal Government as an employee of the U.S. Department \nof Interior's Indian Arts and Crafts Board. An enrolled member of the \nRosebud Sioux Tribe, Ms. Montileaux began her service in Rapid City as \na clerk and typist for the Indian Arts and Crafts Board in 1967. In \n1978, she was promoted to Museum Assistant, and in 1983 she was named \nCurator for the Sioux Indian Museum.\n  The Sioux Indian Museum in Rapid City was founded in 1939 and is home \nto the historic Anderson Collection from the Rosebud Reservation, which \nwas gathered in the 1880s and 1890s. This museum is one of three such \nunique and important Museums nationwide under the care of the Indian \nArts and Crafts Board. Over the years, this Museum's collections have \ngrown into one of the most extensive collections of Lakota/Dakota/\nNakota artifacts. Ms. Montileaux and her staff have worked tirelessly \nto preserve these possessions. Housed within the Journey Museum for the \npast 13 years, items from the Sioux Indian Museum are viewed by the \npublic in a realistic travel through time.\n  For 42 years, Ms. Montileaux worked to preserve the history of the \nLakota/Dakota/Nakota people by maintaining existing collections, as \nwell acquiring new pieces of art. According to Authur Amiotte, during \nher long career she assisted in and witnessed the beginning careers of \nmany traditional tribal artisan and contemporary painters, sculptors, \nand jewelers. Among her varied responsibilities, she coordinated a \nnumber of special exhibits each year to highlight the work of emerging \nartists. The integrity of the collections within the museum and their \nexistence for future generations is in no small part thanks to Ms. \nMontileaux.\n  Ms. Montileaux went about her important work each day quietly and \nwithout any self interest; all of her attention was always focused on \nthe collections and their importance to the tribes and all residents of \nSouth Dakota. Again, I congratulate her on her retirement and wish her \nand her husband Don Montileaux all the best on their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2756-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2756-S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CHRISTOPHER W. WHITE\n\n Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, in the past couple of years, the \neconomy took a turn for the worse, and the Community Legal Aid Society, \nInc.--CLASI, for short--in my home State of Delaware, was hit with a \ntriple whammy. More people needed help while there were fewer private \nand government contributions to go around.\n  CLASI's executive director, Christopher W. White, faced these new, \nincreasing, and difficult challenges bravely and with an amazing sense \nof determination. Some would say Chris did his best work when the going \ngot particularly tough.\n  Today, the Legal Aid Society is a wonderful and esteemed nonprofit \nlaw firm dedicated to providing advice to people with low incomes or \ndisabilities as well as those who are elderly. The success of CLASI is \nin large part due to Chris's almost two decades of hard work, \ndirection, and excellent fundraising abilities. His devotion to CLASI \nwas clear during the recent recession, when he lowered his own salary \nso that others could keep their jobs.\n  However, the Delaware and legal communities faced a tragic blow last \nweek when Chris's life was tragically cut short on Wednesday, April 21. \nHe was 48.\n  You can't go far in Wilmington without hearing that Chris was a \nbrilliant advocate and overall great person. When you talked with \nChris, his passion and drive would rub off on you. He had the effect of \nmaking everyone who knew him want to become a better person.\n  Much of this was owed to Chris's charisma. He was one-of-a-kind, and \nhis intelligence never came off as pretentious. Everything that Chris \ndid was driven by his heart--not politics or career-climbing--and a \nstrong desire to make things better in his community.\n  Chris was a preacher's son and a graduate of Boston College and \nSuffolk University Law School. During law\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\nschool, Chris had a summer internship at Harvard Legal Aid, which \nchanged his life. He could have been a private attorney with a high \nsalary and a fraction of the workload of a public interest attorney. \nHowever, Chris devoted his entire professional career to Delaware's \nCommunity Legal Aid Society. Some of the highlights of his very bright \ncareer were when he argued before the Delaware Supreme Court.\n  One of his passions was the issue of safe, affordable, and adequate \nhousing. The original Legal Aid Society dates back to 1946, but just \nrecently CLASI added the Fair Housing Program to enforce fair housing \nrights for all people regardless of race, color, religion, sex, \nnational origin, age, disability, and familial status. This is in large \npart due to Chris's commitment to this issue. He was involved with many \ncommunity development and housing organizations and took up the cause \nbefore the State general assembly. He wrote a new State law to settle \nconflicts between manufactured-home owners and landlords. He also \nreworked New Castle County's landlord-tenant code so tenants could \nbetter understand their rights.\n  Chris's hard work was widely recognized by his peers. He received the \nNew Lawyers Distinguished Service Award from the Delaware State Bar \nAssociation in 1999 and the Kind Policy Award from the Delaware Housing \nCoalition in 1997.\n  Only days after his passing, one of his many projects was opened in \ndowntown Wilmington. He had led the renovation of an abandoned \ncommercial space into ``Shipley Lofts,'' a 23-unit artist community. \nThe 1,500-square-foot gallery has been named the Christopher W. White \nGallery in his memory, and the nonprofit organization that oversees the \nproject has been renamed the Christopher W. White Community Development \nCorporation.\n  Chris gave everything he had--mind, body, time, resources--to those \nwithout a voice. Tragically, he was hit by a car in front of the \nbuilding he worked so hard to develop as a place of vitality and \ncreativity.\n  The loss of Christopher W. White is a great loss to Delaware. He will \nbe truly missed. My sympathies go out to his family, friends, and \ncolleagues, especially his wife Leandria and their children, Josh and \nKayla, and his mother, Donna.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2757-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING CHRISTOPHER C.

Bolkcom, Congressional \nResearch Service Specialist, on the occasion of the first anniversary \nof his passing away, on May 1, 2009.\n  Christopher Bolkcom served Congress with distinction for 9 years at \nthe Library of Congress as a specialist in military aviation for the \nCongressional Research Service. He held a bachelor's degree in \ninternational relations from the University of Minnesota, a master's \ndegree in international affairs from American University in Washington, \nDC, and a master's degree in national security strategy from the \nNational War College in Washington, DC.\n  Christopher was born on June 13, 1962, in Minneapolis, MN, raised \nthere and then spent his adult life and career in the National Capitol \nRegion until his untimely death on May 1, 2009.\n  Christopher was recognized throughout Congress, the military \nServices, the defense community, and the aeronautical industry as an \nexpert on the management, operational use and procurement of military \naircraft. In that capacity, he assisted Congress in its legislative and \noversight activities, including testifying before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee; the House Armed Services Committee; the Senate \nCommerce, Science and Transportation Committee; and the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. Christopher published many influential \nCRS reports on such subjects as Air Force aerial refueling; the role of \nairpower in counterinsurgency operations; tactical aviation and bomber \nforce modernization; military aviation safety; suppression of enemy air \ndefenses; and protecting commercial aircraft from shoulder-fired \nmissiles. He provided objective, expert analysis on a number of issues, \nincluding the Joint Strike Fighter and the KC-X Tanker, to Congress, \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, and to me and my staff \npersonally--analysis for which I am very grateful.\n  Christopher displayed generous enthusiasm for meeting the \nprofessional needs of colleagues and clients, enlivened by persistent \nhumor and wit in his interpersonal relations. He worked hard at his \npublic duties. He also played hard with friends, whether skiing or \nkick-boxing, and found time to serve others, at for example the Falls \nChurch Presbyterian Church in Falls Church, VA.\n  On this occasion--the first anniversary of Christopher's passing \naway--I want to honor the life and achievements of Congressional \nResearch Service Specialist Christopher Bolkcom, who is survived by his \nloving family, including his children Jessica and Maxwell Bolkcom; \ntheir mother Mary Anne Alexander; his parents Gene and Ann Bolkcom; his \nsister Elizabeth Matteson; his brother Bill Bolkcom; and his nephew \nTristin Matteson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/28/senate-section/article/S2757-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2757-S2758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL MIKE LOOSE\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto recognize the extraordinary contributions of VADM Mike Loose, Civil \nEngineer Corps, U.S. Navy to our Nation. Vice Admiral Loose has served \nwith exceptional distinction as the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, \nCNO, for Fleet Readiness and Logistics, a position of great \nresponsibility, from January 2007 to April 2010.\n  Vice Admiral Loose brought a unique and remarkable perspective to the \nCNO's leadership team, resulting in profound innovations to Navy \npolicy, programs, and resourcing. His professional reach extended to \nthe Joint Staff, the other Services, our international defense \npartners, and the industry to achieve alignment and collaboration \nresulting in great benefits to everyone involved. He was the visionary \nleader and driving force behind the Navy's transition from a level-of-\neffort based budget to a model-based approach that links Afloat \nReadiness to output metrics and resources. This transformational leap \nprovided senior Navy leadership the intellectual basis and the tools to \nenhance core Warfighting capabilities in a restrained fiscal \nenvironment and to clearly define the relationship between baseline and \noverseas contingency operations funding.\n  Vice Admiral Loose was also the vanguard who recognized the strategic \nimperative of energy to the employment of Navy combat forces and \nspearheaded the establishment of Task Force Energy and the Navy Energy \nCoordination Office 2 years ago. He fully established the mindset that \nenergy is a tactical advantage and strategic enabler for military \nforces. In short order, his Energy organization was recognized as the \npremier model for the other Services and as the foundation for the \nDON's Energy program. In addition, he profoundly reshaped and expertly \nguided the Navy's Environmental Program at a time when the importance \nof the program was paramount. His foresight and energetic leadership \nensured the Navy achieved regulatory milestones and uninterrupted, \ncritical operational training in support of national command authority \nobjectives.\n  In recognition of the enormous challenges inherently facing the \nfunding of future ownership costs of existing and new systems Vice \nAdmiral Loose directed the development of a ``2030 and Beyond'' \nassessment that demonstrated that the growth in future ownership costs \nof existing and new systems would far exceed the expected growth in the \nNavy's topline budget over the next 20 years.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to prohibit \nindividuals who have worked on motor vehicle safety issues at NHTSA \nfrom assisting motor vehicles manufacturers with\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\nNHTSA compliance matters for a period of 3 years after terminating \nemployment at NHTSA, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last August, California Highway Patrol \nOfficer Mark Saylor, his wife, 13 year old daughter, and brother-in-law \nwere killed in a tragic car accident that shocked the community of San \nDiego and the nation.\n  Their vehicle, a rental Lexus ES350, reached speeds of 120 mph as the \nfamily desperately called 911 in vain for help. This tragedy should not \nhave occurred, and sadly, it is just one of many examples across \nCalifornia and the country of accidents involving Toyota and Lexus \nvehicles.\n  These accidents raise serious questions about the effectiveness of \nthe recalls and whether Toyota and federal regulators at the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, took appropriate and \ntimely action to protect the public.\n  At the Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the Toyota recalls this \npast March, I called attention to reports that former NHTSA employees \nnow employed by Toyota worked to limit Toyota's recall. In fact, \nToyota's own internal documents stated that the company had achieved a \n``win'' by ``negotiating an equipment recall'' on the Camry and Lexus \nES vehicles that saved Toyota $100 million. It is a shocking example of \na company counting profit wins at the expense of the public's health \nand safety.\n  The revolving door that exists between government regulators at NHTSA \nand the auto industry is unacceptable, and it puts consumers at risk. \nIn fact, the Washington Post reported that as many as 33 former NHTSA \nand Department of Transportation, DOT, employees continue to work on \nvehicle recalls and safety compliance, capacities that deal directly \nwith NHTSA's oversight authority over the industry.\n  That is why I am introducing the Motor Vehicle Safety Integrity \nEmployment Act, to end the revolving door that exists between our \nvehicle safety regulatory agency--NHTSA--and the auto industry.\n  My bill prohibits NHTSA employees from working for auto manufacturers \nfor three years in any job that involves written or oral communication \nwith NHTSA, representing or advising a manufacturer with respect to \nmotor vehicle safety, or assisting a manufacturer with responding to a \nrequest for information from NHTSA.\n  This restriction applies to high ranking NHTSA officials, as well as \nany individual whose responsibilities during the last 12 months at \nNHTSA included administrative, managerial, legal, supervisory, or \nsenior technical responsibility for any motor vehicle safety-related \nprogram.\n  My legislation provides penalties for individuals and manufacturers \nwho violate the law. Manufacturers are subject to fines not less than \n$100,000 and the amount equal to 90 percent annual compensation paid to \nthat employee.\n  Finally, our bill requires the Inspector General to conduct a \ncomprehensive study of DOT's policies related to post-employment \nrestrictions for employees who handle motor vehicle safety related work \nbeyond NHTSA at DOT, and DOT employees who handle all safety related \nwork across all transportation modes. My legislation gives DOT the \nauthority to take appropriate action as warranted.\n  We need to ensure that consumer safety is not compromised by cozy \nrelationships between government regulators and industry. I am proud to \nintroduce this bill to protect the public and look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to enact this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 27, 2010.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer; We are writing to strongly endorse the \n     Motor Vehicle Safety Integrity Employment Act you are \n     sponsoring that will close a legal loophole concerning post-\n     government employment in the auto industry by former \n     government personnel of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration (NHTSA). Congressional hearings and media \n     investigations into high speed crashes and deaths caused by \n     unintended acceleration, the premature closure of agency \n     defect investigations and the subsequent recall of ten \n     million vehicles by Toyota Motor Corporation exposed a \n     revolving door of former NHTSA regulators representing the \n     automaker in safety matters before the agency.\n       Activities by former NHTSA employees who are subsequently \n     hired by automakers have the potential to jeopardize the \n     agency's investigations, rulemakings, and oversight \n     functions. These ethics issues need to be corrected and \n     addressed in legislation. It is essential and expected that \n     NHTSA conducts impartial analyses of all vehicle safety \n     issues. It is critical to protect the integrity of the \n     agency's investigatory and enforcement role, as well as to \n     ensure public safety when the agency sets safety standards. \n     Your legislation is needed in order to restore the trust of \n     the American public in our government regulators and ensure \n     the safety of millions of vehicles that families depend on to \n     travel to work, transport children to school and to bring us \n     home safely.\n       Your legislation, when enacted, will prevent undue industry \n     influence in the agency's enforcement and regulatory \n     decision-making and address an unacceptable defect in current \n     ethics restrictions for former NHTSA employees. Thank you for \n     your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n         Joan Claybrook, President Emeritus, Public Citizen; \n           Clarence Ditlow, Executive Director, Center for Auto \n           Safety; Janette Fennell, Founder & President, KIDS AND \n           CARS; Rosemary Shahan, President, Consumers for Auto \n           Reliability and Safety; Ami Gadhia, Policy Counsel, \n           Consumers Union; Jacqueline S. Gillan, Vice President, \n           Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety; Jack Gillis, \n           Director of Public Affairs, Consumer Federation of \n           America; Andrew McGuire, Executive Director, Trauma \n           Foundation; Ellen Bloom, Director, Federal Policy and \n           Washington Office, Consumers Union.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 3270. A bill to include the county of Mohave, in the State of \nArizona, as an affected area for purposes of making claims under the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act based on exposure to atmospheric \nnuclear testing; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, RECA, by adding \nMohave County, AZ, to the list of counties eligible for downwinder \ncompensation. A similar proposal was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Trent Franks. I'm hopeful this bill will \nhelp close a painful chapter for those Arizonans who were arguably the \nmost affected by nuclear weapons testing during the Cold War.\n  In 1990, Congress enacted the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to \ncompensate victims or their survivors who suffered certain illnesses \ncaused by fallout exposure ``down wind'' of atmospheric nuclear weapons \ntesting in the 1940's and lasting into the 1960's. Among various \nrequirements, compensation eligibility is limited to certain affected \ncounties which are specifically listed in the law. Astonishingly, \ndespite its close proximity to the Nevada Test Site, the original RECA \nlaw and its subsequent amendments never listed Mohave County proper as \nan affected area. I believe the people of Mohave County deserve to see \nrighted this unjust policy which has obstructed their ability to \nqualify for compensation.\n  I understand that several of my colleagues have proposed similar RECA \namendments based on data suggesting that their home states were also \n``down wind'' of nuclear weapons testing. In addition, my colleague, \nSenator Tom Udall, has introduced a far reaching legislative proposal \nto vastly expand the RECA program. I would hope that as these various \nRECA proposals advance through the legislative process, Congress gives \nthorough consideration to an April 2005 report by the National Academy \nof Sciences, NAS, that assessed, among other things, whether additional \ngeographic areas should be added to the RECA program. The NAS study \nrevealed a much wider area of radioactive fallout then originally \nidentified when the RECA law was first written. The report also \nrecommended replacing the geographic area criteria with a new science-\nbased process for determining compensation eligibility, a method \nsimilar to what's used in the Radiation Exposed-Veterans Compensation \nAct and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program \nAct. I believe it is worthwhile\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nfor policy makers to consider the recommendations of the NAS report.\n  In the meantime and until a comprehensive overhaul of RECA is \ndeveloped, I will work within the parameters of the existing RECA law \nin my efforts to ensure that the people of Mohave County are treated \nfairly in this matter. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico:\n  S. 3271. A bill to amend section 30166 of title 49, United States \nCode, to require the installation of event data recorders in all motor \nvehicles manufactured for sale in the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that I believe will help improve the safety of automobile \ndrivers and passengers. The legislation, the Vehicle Safety \nImprovements Act, would, among other things, require all automobiles \nsold in the United States be equipped with an event data recorder, an \nEDR.\n  Event data recorders provide a report of a vehicle's operating \nstatistics--things like the throttle position and speed of the \nvehicle--during the last seconds before and immediately after a crash.\n  They serve a similar function as the black boxes that are in each \nairplane by documenting critical information leading up to an incident. \nUnlike black boxes, an EDR doesn't record the voices of the vehicle \noccupants. It simply preserves the vehicle's internal operating data.\n  The information stored by an EDR can be crucial in determining what \nhappened in the last few seconds prior to a crash and the moments \nimmediately after. If a vehicle doesn't have a recorder, or if the data \nis not easily accessible, this information can be lost. That leaves \nlocal and Federal investigators little to work with as they try to \ndetermine whether a vehicle malfunction was to blame. Unfortunately, \nwhile the majority of vehicles in the United States are currently \nequipped with these recorders, many still do not have them.\n  In 2006, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, \ncreated a framework for the type of information to be recorded by event \ndata recorders in light-duty vehicles, but it stopped short of \nrequiring the recorders. If the vehicle manufacturer installs an event \ndata recorder in a car, it must comply with the rule. But there is no \nrequirement that the manufacturer install the recorder in the first \nplace.\n  NHTSA's 2006 rule further requires the manufacturers to ensure that a \ntool to read the recorder is commercially available. Today, while there \nare tools commercially available, there is no one universal tool--\ncreating a challenge for investigators who must carry a suitcase of \nreaders with them on investigations. This is an unnecessary burden that \ncan be easily addressed.\n  This particular burden came to light recently in the context of the \ntragic Toyota crashes. During hearings held by Chairman Rockefeller in \nthe Commerce Committee, we learned that although Toyotas were equipped \nwith EDRs, until recently they were only able to be read by one \ncomputer in the entire United States. That is why, in addition to \nrequiring recorders in all vehicles for sale in the United States, the \nVehicle Safety Improvements Act will also require that recorders be \neasily read by a universal tool regardless of make or model of the \nvehicle.\n  In addition, NHTSA's rule also fails to address medium- and heavy-\nduty vehicles. My legislation would require NHTSA to issue a rule \naddressing those vehicles as well. While they comprise a small \npercentage of the vehicle miles traveled on an annual basis, medium- \nand heavy-duty vehicles are overrepresented in crashes resulting in \nfatalities. In these crashes, an event data recorder would be a useful \ntool during the crash investigation in determining the cause of the \ncrash.\n  Finally, my bill protects privacy by ensuring that the data can only \nbe accessed with the vehicle owner's permission when authorized by a \ncourt or a legal proceeding or by a government motor vehicle safety \nagency.\n  Adding these recorders would not cost much. In their rulemaking, \nNHTSA estimated the cost for the manufacturer to install an event data \nrecorder at just over $2 per vehicle. That is a small price to pay for \nthe critical information that can ultimately be used to save lives in \nthe future.\n  Vehicle crashes are horrible and oftentimes tragic. They result in \ndamage, injuries, and too often fatalities. They create congestion and \ncost our economy billions of dollars each year. Event data recorders \nwill not prevent crashes, but they will help to determine what caused \nthe crash and, in the case of a vehicle malfunction, help to identify \nsolutions to improve vehicle performance. In the end, the data they \nprovide will serve to ensure a safer travel environment for all.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in this important effort to \nimprove vehicle safety. I look forward to working with them and my \nchairman, Chairman Rockefeller, who has been a champion on issues of \ntransportation safety, to pass the Vehicle Safety Improvements Act this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. GRASSLEY):\n  S. 3275. A bill to extend the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, \nto provide customs support services to Haiti, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, one of Aesop's Fables teaches us, ``In \nunion there is strength.''\n  In 2009, Haiti's future was beginning to strengthen. A U.S. trade \npreference program, known as the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity \nthrough Partnership Encouragement Act, or HOPE II, created incentives \nto increase textile and apparel production in Haiti. As a result, \nHaiti's textile and apparel sector was growing, creating new jobs and a \nviable economic future.\n  But on January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by a 7.0 magnitude \nearthquake that took hundreds of thousands of lives, left a million \npeople homeless, and shattered Haiti's burgeoning economy. As Haiti \nrecovers from this devastation, we must unite with our neighbor to help \nprovide the strength that it needs to recover and rebuild.\n  Today, Senator Grassley and I introduce the Haiti Economic Lift \nProgram Act of 2010--the HELP Act--to strengthen Haiti's path to \neconomic recovery. Congressmen Levin, Camp, and Rangel are also \nintroducing a companion bill in the House.\n  The HELP Act would build on the success of the HOPE Act by expanding \naccess to the U.S. market for textile and apparel products from Haiti. \nAs a result, it would create incentives for immediate and long-term \nprivate investment in Haiti, which would in turn create sustainable \njobs and a stable economy. The HELP Act would also extend all of our \ntrade preference programs for Haiti to 2020, ensuring that Haiti could \nrely on these tariff benefits as it plans its own economic future.\n  As we considered the needs of Haiti, we were also watchful of the \nneeds of our domestic textile industry. We worked closely with the \ndomestic industry for months to craft a bill that would not hurt our \nown workers, even as we help others.\n  The HELP Act represents a landmark union among the Senate, the House, \nDemocrats, Republicans, and the domestic textile industry to help Haiti \nrecover from its devastation. This union resulted in an unprecedented \nbill that will help Haiti emerge from the earthquake stronger than \never.\n  I urge my colleagues to join this union and quickly approve this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \na bill that Senator Baucus and I have introduced today. It's called the \nHaiti Economic Lift Program Act of 2010.\n  The purpose of our bill is to help Haiti recover from the devastation \nit suffered in the massive earthquake that struck the country in \nJanuary.\n  How we respond to natural disasters says a lot about ourselves, \nwhether it's flooding in Iowa or an earthquake in Haiti.\n  The idea behind the bill is simple. First, we extend current trade \npreferences for Haiti through fiscal year 2020, to provide more \ncertainty for companies doing business either in Haiti or with Haitian \npartners.\n  Second, we grant additional duty-free access to the U.S. market for \ntargeted\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\ncategories of textile and apparel products. That will help to draw more \ninvestment into Haiti's economy and thereby promote long-term job \ncreation, economic development, and political stability.\n  Our bill is a bipartisan, bicameral compromise. It is the product of \n3 months of collaborative negotiations among the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees and \nwith representatives of the U.S. textile industry and the Haitians \nthemselves.\n  We also reached out to members of Congress who have constituent \ntextile and apparel interests, to ensure that their concerns were \naddressed.\n  Our ability to reach agreement on the bill is a testament to the good \nwill and good faith of all those involved in our negotiations.\n  The result reflects a careful balancing of interests, including \nHaiti's interest in spurring more investment in its economy, the \ninterests of our trading partners in Central America in maintaining \nexisting trade relationships, and our own domestic textile interests.\n  We took special care to address the sensitivities of our domestic \nproducers.\n  In fact, I have a letter here from the two leading U.S. textile \nindustry organizations. Their letter expresses support for our bill and \nencourages the Senate to pass the bill in an expeditious manner by \nunanimous consent.\n  Finally, I want to make special mention of my colleagues from states \nwith textile interests, and to thank them for their constructive input \nin developing this legislation.\n  Without their engagement and support, we would not have arrived at \nthe compromise bill that is being introduced today in both the Senate \nand the House of Representatives.\n  This is a balanced bill that addresses an urgent priority in the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  I ask my colleagues to give the bill their unanimous support when it \ncomes before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   April 26, 2010.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: As \n     representatives of the United States textile industry, we are \n     writing in regard to the Haiti Economic Lift Program Act of \n     2010, a bill to provide enhanced market access for apparel \n     products manufactured in Haiti.\n       After lengthy negotiations with your staffs, we are pleased \n     that we were able to reach an acceptable compromise on this \n     important legislation. While the bill provides Haiti with a \n     path forward for long-term economic recovery in the wake of \n     its devastating earthquake, it also takes into account \n     various sensitivities from the perspective of the U.S. \n     textile industry.\n       For example, the bill grants significant increases in duty \n     free treatment through a system of Tariff Preference Levels \n     (TPLs) but also institutes sub-limits on highly sensitive \n     products that can be exported under the TPLs. The sub-limits \n     were a key priority for the domestic industry and will \n     prevent over concentration of exports in one or two key areas \n     that could be particularly damaging to U.S. producers. In \n     addition, the bill extends the current Caribbean Basin Trade \n     Partnership Act (CBTPA) through 2020. This extension will \n     help to provide long-term certainty for a program that is of \n     significant value for U.S. and Western Hemispheric trading \n     partners.\n       Obviously, we take very seriously the impact that \n     additional duty free imports may have on U.S. producers and \n     workers as well as our Western Hemispheric customers. Noting \n     those concerns, we also recognize that the devastating \n     circumstances in Haiti produced an exceptional case that \n     motivated Congress to develop a quick response and have \n     worked with the Committee to develop a package that strikes \n     an acceptable balance. We must stress, however, that this \n     package does not set a precedent for Any future trade \n     preference legislation.\n       For all these reasons, we are encouraging our Congressional \n     members that represent the nearly 500,000 U.S. textile and \n     apparel workers to approve this legislation in an expeditious \n     manner under suspension of the rules in the House and by \n     unanimous consent in the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Augustine D. Tantillo,\n       Executive Director, American Manufacturing Trade Action \n     Coalition (AMTAC).\n     Cass M. Johnson,\n       President, National Council of Textile Organizations \n     (NCTO).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 3276. A bill to provide an election to terminate certain capital \nconstruction funds without penalties; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to reform the \nCapital Construction Fund to address major changes in the Nation's \nfisheries and to allow the Nation's fishers to have access to needed \nfunds, to prevent over-fishing and to help create jobs.\n  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, program was originally developed \nat a time when American fishes were having a hard time competing with \nhighly efficient foreign fishing vessels--modern boats that often \nharvested US fishery resources within sight of our own shores. The \ninitial idea behind the CCF Program was to enable US fishers to \naccumulate the funds necessary to develop a modern fishing fleet by \nallowing them to deposit a portion of their fishing-related earnings \ninto a CCF savings account on a tax-deferred basis. Under the CCF \nprogram, monies subsequently withdrawn from the CCF accounts would \nremain tax free as long as they were invested in new or rebuilt fishing \nvessels. At the same time, any unauthorized withdrawals from CCF \naccounts were subject to severe interest and other penalties.\n  The program was a success--the CCF program helped the U.S. industry \nbuild a modern state-of-the-art fishing fleet. Unfortunately, that \nfleet has now become overcapitalized--a problem that has been \nexacerbated as managers have become more and more concerned about \npotential overfishing and have begun to reduce the amount of fish that \nthey allow fishers to catch each year. As a result, the U.S. commercial \nfishing fleet now has more harvesting capacity than the U.S. fishery \nresource can sustainably support. The problem now is that the monies \nthat remain on deposit in CCF accounts represent a potential for \nfurther overcapitalization at a time when less capitalization is \nneeded. Yet the CCF regulations currently penalize withdrawals made for \nanything other than a bigger or better boat.\n  The issue now is what to do about the money that remains ``stranded'' \nin existing CCF accounts. Ironically, just as the current generation of \nfishers is getting ready to retire, the program puts heavy penalties on \nthem if they take money out of their CCF accounts without using it for \nanything other than to further capitalize an already overcapitalized \nfleet.\n  The resulting situation is problematic for the fishers, the industry \nand the resource. That's why I am introducing legislation today along \nwith my colleague Senator Murkowski--to address the problem of stranded \ncapital still on deposit in various CCF accounts and to relieve the \npressure to increase further capitalization of the fishing fleet. My \nlegislation will enable CCF fund-holders to make a one-time withdrawal \nfrom their CCF accounts without requiring them to re-invest it in the \nfishing industry. Instead, they will be required to pay the taxes due \non the monies withdrawn, but without having to pay interest or other \npenalties on such withdrawals. Those funds would be freed up for other \npurposes, including starting a new business and finding other ways to \nsupport and create jobs. An income-averaging formula would be applied \nto the withdrawals so as to avoid an excessive tax rate on the one-time \nwithdrawal. The fishers taking advantage of such an opportunity to take \nmoney out of their CCF accounts penalty free would then be required to \nclose their CCF accounts and would be prohibited from further \nparticipation in the program. This is a win-win-win situation. The \nfisher gets to take the money out of his CCF without having to pay \npenalties and interest, but still pays the taxes when due; the \nGovernment gets taxes on the withdrawals; and the resource and the \nfishers who remain in the fishery avoid further capitalization of an \nalready over-capitalized industry.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Murkowski, the fishing \ncommunity and the bill's other supporters to\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nadvance this legislation to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
