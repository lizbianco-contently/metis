Madam President, later today, the Senate will vote to \nextend Federal unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who are \nout of work and struggling to make ends meet in a terrible recession.\n  Ordinarily, this is not a controversial piece of legislation. \nEveryone agrees we should help people who are struggling to get back on \ntheir feet and keep food on the table. Unfortunately, the President has \ndecided to turn this debate into a political exercise.\n  In his weekly radio address over the weekend and again yesterday at \nthe White House, the President accused Republicans of doing something \nwe have not done. In doing so, he cheapens political discourse and does \na disservice to the people this bill is meant to help.\n  As a former Senator, the President is well aware of how the Senate \nworks. He knew today's vote to extend these benefits had already been \nscheduled days before he told the Nation, in two national broadcasts, \nthat Republicans were holding it up. He also knew it would pass. But he \nintentionally implied otherwise, leaving the public without all the \nfacts.\n  So here are the facts: Republicans support extending benefits to the \nunemployed. As the President himself said yesterday, we have repeatedly \nvoted for similar bills in the past, and we are ready to support one \nnow. What we do not support--and we make no apologies for this--is \nborrowing tens of billions of dollars to pass this bill at a time when \nthe national debt is spinning completely out of control.\n  That is why Republicans have proposed an alternative bill five times \nthat would enable us to extend these benefits without adding a nickel \nto the debt--a bill Democrats have repeatedly rejected.\n  There should be no doubt as to what constitutes fiscal responsibility \nin this debate. Last November, the President himself described a bill \nto extend unemployment benefits as fiscally responsible because it did \nnot add to the debt. So according to the President's own logic, \nDemocrats who vote to pass this bill and add nearly $34 billion more\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\nto the national debt will be doing so in a fiscally irresponsible way, \nand Republicans who insist on passing it without adding to the debt are \nbeing responsible.\n  The fact is, this debate is not about unemployment insurance. There \nis no debate in the Senate about whether we should pass a bill. \nEveryone agrees we should. This debate is about whether, in extending \nthose benefits, we should add to the debt.\n  If Democrats were as concerned about passing this bill as they say \nthey are, they would find a way to do it without adding to the debt. \nAfter all, there is no law that says we are required to exacerbate one \ncrisis in an effort to alleviate another. Most Americans I talk to \nthink a $13 trillion debt is one crisis we cannot afford to put off any \nlonger.\n  If Republicans have done anything wrong in this debate, it was to \nunderestimate how committed Democrats are to spending money we do not \nhave. Given the choice to extend these benefits without adding to the \ndebt or allowing them to expire, Democrats chose the latter on five \nseparate occasions. They do not seem to appreciate the fact that by \nadding to the national debt, they are increasing the long-term burden \non everyone--the unemployed, the employed and our children and \ngrandchildren who will have to pay for it.\n  The President likes to point out that Congress has added to the debt \nin years past. What he does not mention is we were not in the middle of \na debt crisis then. We were not being lectured by the French about the \nneed to cut back on our spending. People were not rioting in Greece. We \ndid not have a President who came into office with a list of \nlegislative priorities that would double the national debt in 5 years \nand triple it in 10.\n  The President also says Republicans are playing politics in this \ndebate. But by pointing the finger at Republicans, he is attempting to \ndeflect attention not only from his own party's unwillingness to take \nthe debt seriously, he is attempting to deflect attention from \nDemocrats' own fiscal recklessness and its potential consequences for \nour future.\n  None of us likes to see good people struggling to find work. We all \nempathize with the people the President highlighted yesterday at the \nWhite House. But let's not forget the role this administration's own \npolicies have played in all this.\n  If ever there was an indictment of this administration's economic \nagenda, it was yesterday's press conference. The administration asked \ntaxpayers to foot the bill on a $1 trillion stimulus that he claimed \nwould create 4 million jobs. A year and a half later, the President is \nstanding with three chronically unemployed Americans, some of \nthe victims of a 9.5-percent unemployment rate, asking taxpayers for \nanother $34 billion in deficit spending to continue paying their \nunemployment benefits. I think most Americans see the connection here.\n\n  The President also tried to score political points yesterday by \nmischaracterizing the debate over the small business bill. Here is \nanother bill that both parties support. Yet the President would have \nthe American people believe that somehow we are trying to hold it up \njust because the majority leader would rather move on to some of his \nother legislative priorities than have a vote on a couple of amendments \nto this bill that would help to create more jobs.\n  So either the President is misinformed about what has been going on \nover here or he is deliberately mischaracterizing the situation. The \nfact is, the Senate is already on this bill and both sides have offered \nimprovements. If the President wants to criticize someone for slowing \nit down, he should point the finger at his own party for repeatedly \ntaking it off the floor, which brings me to the supplemental war \nspending bill.\n  I will remind my colleagues the Secretary of Defense has indicated \nthat failure to pass this bill before the August recess could actually \nkeep our soldiers and marines from getting paid, a point he reiterated \nin a letter to the majority leader, sent yesterday.\n  So what is the holdup?\n  Some Democrats in the House do not want to pass this funding for our \ntroops unless the Senate agrees to tack on billions in unrelated \ndomestic spending. It is time for House Democrats to get serious and \nstop holding our troops hostage. Let's strip this unrelated funding and \npass this war funding bill.\n  Yesterday, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services \nCommittee made it clear that he recognizes the need for the Senate to \npass the troop funding bill quickly and get it to the President's desk.\n  Every Member of this Chamber should unite behind this goal. The \nDefense Department finds itself in the last weeks of the fiscal year \nwith little flexibility to meeting funding shortfalls of the operations \nand pay for our forces in the field. That leaves it to us to act, and I \nsuggest we do so this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6002-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this afternoon is a historic moment in \nthe history of this great Chamber. Our beloved and now departed Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd, will be succeeded in office with a \ntemporary appointment from West Virginia, and we will swear in his \nsuccessor at 2:15 this afternoon. A few minutes later, the Senate will \ntake up a historic measure. It is a question of whether we should \nprovide unemployment benefits to the millions of Americans who have \nlost their job, through no fault of their own, and are victims of this \nrecession.\n  In my home State, 115,000 people have fallen off the unemployment \nrolls while we have debated whether to extend unemployment benefits. \nAcross America, 1.2 million Americans have lost basic unemployment \nbenefits.\n  What do these benefits mean to these families out of work? Literally, \nbread on the table; literally, whether the lights go on when you flick \nthe switch; literally, whether they have a roof over their heads.\n  This did not use to be a political issue. We did not get involved in \na partisan debate about unemployment benefits when it came to other \nPresidents. But under this President, Barack Obama, the Republicans \nhave decided to take a stand and the stand says this: When it comes to \npeople who are victims of this recession, we will not help them unless \nwe find some way to add a new tax or cut some spending in other areas.\n  That was never the standard before. We viewed this as an economic \nemergency, which we responded to, to get America back on its feet.\n  Those who are involved in watching our budget and our deficit and our \neconomy, such as Bob Bixby, the president of the Concord Coalition, \nputs it very clearly. Mr. Bixby says:\n\n       As a deficit hawk, I wouldn't worry about extending \n     unemployment benefits. It is not going to add to the long-\n     term structural deficit, and it does address a serious need. \n     I just feel like unemployment benefits wandered onto the \n     wrong street corner at the wrong time, and now they are \n     getting mugged.\n\n  That is Bob Bixby of the Concord Coalition.\n  What about David Brooks? I respect David Brooks, a conservative \nRepublican writer but a thinker. Here is what he says, in writing in \nthe New York Times last week about unemployment benefits:\n\n       Well, there's a few short-term things you can do [about \n     this economy]. First, extend unemployment insurance; that's a \n     foolish place to begin budget-balancing.\n\n  David Brooks knows what we all know: a dollar handed to an unemployed \nperson is spent almost immediately, recirculates through the economy, \nand creates $1.60 in economic activity. It is the best way to create\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nmore consumer demand--more demand for goods and services and greater \nopportunities for jobs, while it provides the basic necessities of life \nfor those who are out of work.\n  But when it comes to this issue, the Republicans have said: No, we \nare going to take a stand on the deficit and we are going to take a \nstand when it comes to unemployed people because the deficit is a \nserious issue.\n  I agree with them; it is a serious issue. But last week, the \nRepublican minority whip, Jon Kyl of Arizona, was asked: Well, let me \nask you about tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America. If you cut \ntaxes, doesn't that add to the deficit? It is hard to argue that it \ndoesn't.\n  They said to Jon Kyl of Arizona: So you don't want to add to the \ndeficit; you don't want to make it worse, so we would have to pay for \nor find some new revenue or some cut for tax cuts; correct? Senator Kyl \nsaid: No; tax cuts don't count when it comes to the deficit.\n  So here is the double standard. The double standard says when we are \nhelping unemployed people in America, it is a deficit problem, but if \nwe are giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America, it is not \na deficit problem. That kind of double standard is fundamentally \nunfair. When it comes to unemployed Americans who lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own, Americans literally faced with living in \ntheir cars, the Republicans tell us: Sorry, we can't help; the deficit \njust requires us to say no to unemployed Americans. But when it comes \nto wealthy Americans who are living comfortably, Americans who can take \na tax cut and buy a new car, the Republicans say that is all right; we \ncan give those tax cuts to the wealthy; it doesn't hurt the deficit. It \nmakes no sense.\n  Why are we in this situation today? We are here because of the worst \neconomic recession since the Great Depression. This President inherited \nit from Republican Bush economic policies that failed America, and in \nthat failure the victims can be found in every community across our \ngreat Nation. I met with three of them in Chicago on Sunday. We sat \ndown and talked about what life is like when you are out of work for \nmore than a year--more than a year.\n  One was a veteran, a man who had served in our Coast Guard and worked \nfor years and years in the advertising business in Chicago. He has MS \nand now he has no paycheck and now he has no health insurance. If the \nVA will not cover some of his needs, he is on his own.\n  Another was a young woman. She was a woman who worked hard and had a \ngood job and lost it a year ago but has been looking ever since. Every \nday, she is on the Internet, answering the ads, doing everything she \ncan.\n  She said: I am almost afraid to come to this press conference. I \ndon't want my landlord to see me and realize my unemployment is over. I \nam 2 months away from living in my car.\n  The third was a man who had been out of work for over a year; a \nproductive, good man who was clearly broken by this experience but \ndetermined to keep trying. He was cut off from unemployment benefits by \na Republican Party which will not join us in what has been a bipartisan \neffort under Presidents, both Republican and Democrat.\n  This afternoon we have a chance to stand for those people in \nIllinois, in New Hampshire, in Maryland, and in Kentucky. We have a \nchance to say we as an American family stand together, we care for our \nown, we help our own. We are going to help them get back to a life of \nproductive activity, paying taxes, and retiring our deficit.\n  We remember on the Republican side not that long ago under President \nBush when the national debt of America doubled under President Bush, \nfrom $5 trillion worth of accumulated debt in the history of the United \nStates of America to the day when President Bush left office and the \nnational debt was $12 trillion. It more than doubled with the budgets \noffered by President Bush under his administration. In those days, Vice \nPresident Cheney used to say: Deficits don't count.\n  Well, they count.\n  We are going to bring ourselves out of this deficit crisis, but first \nwe are going to get this economy moving, create the jobs and put people \nback to work. Until we do that, the deficit just gets worse.\n  This afternoon we have a chance to give a helping hand to people who \nhave lost their jobs through no fault of their own and need just a \nlittle assistance from us as a nation so they can move forward and help \nthis Nation move forward again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Illinois for his remarks and his \nleadership on this topic because I feel the same way.\n  Finally, finally, finally, we are going to vote and have enough votes \nto pass the extension of unemployment insurance--unemployment \ninsurance. It is insurance against being unemployed. That is what it \nis. It is not some grant. It is not some giveaway. It is not an \nearmark. It is insurance. It is social insurance, created by the United \nStates of America in partnership with the private sector and the people \nwho work every day so that when they hit a speed bump and have to be \nlaid off through no fault of their own, there will be a safety net so \nthey do not fall. It is insurance. It is social insurance. It is a \nsocial contract, and it is a social compact.\n  In my mind, it is like having a treaty with the American people. We \ndon't violate treaties, and we shouldn't violate this social contract. \nBut oh, no, not our Senate. We had to dilly-dally around for month \nafter month with the obstructionist tactics of the other side, using \nout-of-date procedures of this institution that belong in another \ncentury and another economy.\n  My constituents are frustrated. They are frustrated about their \nlives, they are frustrated about the direction of the country, and they \nare sure frustrated with the Senate--and put me in that corner. It is \ntime we not only get the country moving, it is time we get the Senate \nmoving. We have to first look at reform for ourselves, and I want \neveryone here to know I am on the side and definitely part of the \nreform movement in this institution to get rid of out-of-date \nprocedures that belong to another century whose only job is not to slow \nus down so that we do due diligence but that we don't do anything at \nall.\n  Right now, we have a compelling need in our country. People who have \nbeen laid off through no fault of their own do need that safety net. \nOur failure to act has brought untold harm to people. When we left for \nthe Fourth of July, I couldn't believe we walked out to carry the flag \nand say: Let's hear it for the red, white, and blue, and we were going \nto leave America without income insurance that they themselves had paid \ninto to be able to get. We forget that for part of the insurance, \nprivate sector employers pay into it and so do the workers. It is \ninsurance.\n  When I went around Maryland during the break, whether it was the \nworkers themselves--people who had jobs--and even those who were well \noff said: Why can't you pass unemployment insurance. If you can't do \nthat, you can't do anything. And they were absolutely right.\n  When I talked to the workers, I saw in their eyes the loss of energy, \nthe loss of hope, and the loss of hope about a way of life, such as in \nmanufacturing where in some areas it is being challenged. It is \nterrible to lose a job and then to lose unemployment insurance--no job, \nno income, no hope. Wow. What a bitter pill.\n  The Baltimore Sun in an editorial pointed out how unemployment \nbenefits are helping the U.S. economy. This isn't Barb Mikulski, a \nmoderate liberal talking about it. This is hard-nosed analysis saying, \nin Maryland, why it is good for the Maryland economy. Unemployment \ncompensation would help put $819 million into our economy for the \nfiscal year ending June 30.\n  Over 17,000 Marylanders have lost their unemployment insurance. In \nour State, unemployment insurance certainly isn't lavish. The average \nis $312 a week. The maximum is $410 a week. In our State, it is only \nenough to pay electricity or rent or for food, but it is certainly not \nsome big lavish program. This is what the insurance is meant to do. It \nis meant to be a safety net.\n  In our country people believe if they work hard and they play by the \nrules,\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\nthe rules should be on their side. Well, hello. We make the rules. We \nrule. So let's rule out this endless delay.\n  Today, I want us to pass this extension, and I want us to remember \nthis is social insurance. I have sat here and listened to the debate \nminimizing and trivializing workers: Oh, unemployment is a way to \ndiscourage people to look for work. I don't know who these people talk \nto. Maybe they are too busy fundraising to talk to people. Maybe they \nare too busy trying to extend those Bush tax credits that added very \nlittle to our economy but added a lot to our debt. Maybe they are too \nbusy. I am not too busy. I enjoy being out there with the people, \nlistening to the stories of their lives. What does it mean to public \npolicy?\n  What they want us to do is get off of our filibuster, pass this \nextension, and at least let people have a safety net. Then let's \ncontinue to concentrate on helping create jobs in the private sector in \nthe United States of America by passing the Landrieu-Snowe small \nbusiness bill and actually do something of which we can be proud.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I join with Senator Mikulski from \nMaryland and her comments about extending unemployment benefits.\n  We all know these numbers. In my State, 47,000 Ohioans lost their \nunemployment benefits. At the end of June, that number increased \ndramatically to more than 90,000. If we don't pass the extension today, \nor this week, at the end of July more than 80,000 additional Ohioans \nwill lose their benefits. These numbers are incredible. I think it is \nimportant to put a human face on these numbers, in large part because \n41 Members of the Senate, overwhelmingly Republicans and one Democrat, \nhave consistently voted to filibuster, to block extending unemployment \ninsurance.\n  I guess the reason for that is they think of these as numbers. They \ndon't think of these as people because I cannot imagine, when they call \ntheir names out in the well and they respond and say no over and over \nand over, as has happened over the last 7 weeks--it is just an amazing \nthing to me. I think my colleagues who vote no, the 39 or 40 \nRepublicans who vote no, must see this unemployment insurance as \nwelfare. I know some of them think that. But it is insurance. We don't \ncall it unemployment welfare, we call it unemployment insurance.\n  That means they pay in when they are working, and they get help when \nthey are not. That is done to help individual people, of course. It \nmatters to the community because the dollars they get in their pockets, \nthe $300, $320, roughly, that people get a week on average in \nunemployment insurance are spending it at the local drugstore. They are \nspending it at a local grocery store. They are buying clothes for their \nkids. They are paying rent, paying utilities. They serve as an economic \nstimulus. It is not just helping those individuals, it is an economic \nstimulus, as Senator McCain's top aide and his top economic adviser in \nhis Presidential campaign said. This is the best kind of stimulus for \nthe economy. Put a dollar in somebody's pocket for unemployment \ninsurance and they spend it, and it is spent over and over in the \ncommunity.\n  President Obama said yesterday that there has been a tradition under \nboth Democratic and Republican Presidents to offer emergency relief to \nthe unemployed. When the economy is bad, that is when we need to do \nthis. For the Republicans to say we need to cut other programs to pay \nfor this--they never said that when we were spending hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They didn't \nsay pay for that; they said charge that to our grandchildren.\n  They didn't say pay for it when it was a bailout to the drug and \ninsurance companies in the name of Medicare privatization; they said \njust bill that to our grandchildren.\n  When it was tax cuts for the rich--and some of our Republican Senate \ncolleagues said it again this last week--we don't pay for tax cuts for \nthe rich; we just add it to our children's and our grandchildren's \ncredit cards and their tax burden in the future. But when it comes to \nworkers, they look at it differently. Tax cuts for the rich, a bailout \nfor the drug and insurance companies, spending it on the war in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, it is OK. But it is not OK to spend it on unemployed \nworkers.\n  So I just am not sure my colleagues ever put a human face on this. \nThey just see these as numbers. I don't know how many of my colleagues \nsit down and listen to unemployed workers who have lost their jobs--a \nworker who lost her job, then she lost her health insurance and had to \nexplain to her children that: We are going to have to move because we \nare going to have our house foreclosed on; we cannot afford the \nmortgage. They are going to switch school districts, with all of the \nuncertainties. Can you imagine that--sitting down with your children \nand doing that? It is happening all too often that people are \nexplaining to their children that they are going to have to move, they \nare not going to have their own room anymore and they will not go to \nthe same school, and they will not be able to buy the tennis shoes they \nthought they would get. All those kinds of discussions are happening \nall over America, in part because people are losing their unemployment \ninsurance.\n  I will share four brief letters with my colleagues. This is trying to \nhelp people understand that real people are losing their unemployment \nbenefits. It is a real hardship.\n  First is Jillian from Holmes County in Millersburg, OH, one of the \nsmallest, least populous counties. She wrote:\n\n       My husband is one of the 83,000 Ohioans who lost \n     unemployment benefits in June. He was working in the same job \n     for 14 years until he was recently laid off. Our family has \n     struggled to keep the bills paid. Our mortgage has been \n     consistently one month behind. And each month, more late fees \n     are tacked on. Now that his unemployment benefits have \n     expired, our utility bills are now one month behind. Please \n     help to get this extension passed.\n\n  This is exactly what I hear from constituent after constituent in \nOhio. They work hard. Many have worked the same jobs for years, and \nmany have been in the same line of work for 10 to 20 years. These are \nnot lazy people who don't want to work. They lost their jobs through no \ndoing of their own. They have nowhere to turn, and their unemployment \nbenefits have run out.\n  I ask my colleagues--today we have another chance to vote to join us \nin helping Jillian and others.\n  Larry is from Shelby County, another rural county close to the \nIndiana border, a town called Sidney, the county seat. He wrote:\n\n       The lack of movement on extending unemployment benefits is \n     causing major system devastation to workers unable to find \n     employment. Loss of these benefits has become devastating to \n     me and my family. The extreme added emotional and financial \n     stress has exacerbated an otherwise manageable physical \n     condition into a borderline disability. I do not want to lose \n     my capacity to search for and secure employment due to \n     physical stress brought on by economic hardship. Please fight \n     to extend these critical benefits.\n\n  So often, what my Republican colleagues seem to think is that people \ndon't have to go out and look for work, but they are out looking for \nwork. These people are not staying home not trying to find a job. To \nreceive unemployment benefits, you have to demonstrate to the local \nemployment office that you are looking for a job.\n  With all of the economic hardships and the troubles and potential \nloss of car, house, job, and potentially insurance, there is also an \nemotional toll taken on people. Larry illustrates that.\n  Richard is from Summit County, the Akron area. He wrote:\n\n       I am a 67-year-old American who has worked for more than 50 \n     years of my life. I got laid off last year and had been \n     receiving unemployment benefits since then. I was thankful \n     for it because it helped me make my house payments. But when \n     I got cut off last month, I went into panic mode. My blood \n     pressure shot up and I ended up in the ER. I have never felt \n     so scared and uncertain of the future as I am now. I didn't \n     plan to stop working. It just happened. I am headed to the \n     welfare office today.\n       I just hate what this country has become where Senators \n     can't relate to us common folk. Is there any hope for us?\n\n  The answer is yes. With the appointment of a new Senator from West \nVirginia, we will likely have the 60th vote. We have 39 Republicans and \n1 Democrat who have voted consistently to allow us to filibuster. A \nmajority of us, 59, have voted--the Presiding Officer and I and 57 \nothers have consistently\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nvoted to extend unemployment benefits. Yet, because of a minority of \n41, they have been able to stop the debate and this bill from moving \nforward. Look at the stress it has caused Richard and the anguish it \nhas caused Larry from Shelby County. Look at what Jillian and her \nhusband are facing.\n  Here is the last letter. This is from Joan from Montgomery County, \nwhich is Dayton:\n\n       I am an unemployment accountant with a college degree. I \n     was laid off last year when my small law firm merged with a \n     larger one. There was no position for me in the new firm. I \n     decided to go back to school, using up much of my retirement \n     and my husband's savings. I reduced my hours at school and \n     went part-time. I was able to collect unemployment benefits, \n     but since it has run out, my savings are dwindling rapidly.\n\n  Given the high level of unemployment in Ohio, extending federal \nunemployment benefits is imperative. We can't afford further delay. Two \nweeks is a long time for someone whose only means of support is \nunemployment benefits. I hope the Senate passes an extension in the \nnext few days.\n  As I said to her, we hope we will do that today, and the President \nwill sign it quickly and the benefits will go out. I hope more than a \ncouple of Republicans will join us so we can pass this with a \nsignificant vote. Some of these are people who have gone back to \ncollege, and they work hard. They are people who have been in the \nworkplace for 10, 20, 30 years. They have a good work ethic.\n  Again, Joan is from Montgomery County--a county that has been hit \nespecially hard, as DHL shut down there and the GM plant shut down, and \nNational Cash Register up and moved to Atlanta. There have been some \ngood things happening but not enough. That is why we need to extend \nthese benefits today, get this done so we can focus on job creation and \nhelp people get back to work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. BROWN of Ohio assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased, though frustrated, like my \ncolleagues, to be here this morning on the floor to talk about the \ncritical need to extend unemployment insurance.\n  Across the Nation, there are almost 15 million Americans who are out \nof work, and although we are making progress on our unemployment rate, \nit is still too high at 9.5 percent. We need to extend unemployment \ninsurance, and we need to do it now, today, before one more family is \nput on the street and before one more child goes to bed hungry.\n  This legislation is every bit as important to our economy as it is to \nthose who are struggling to get by. Nearly 7 million people, or half of \nall Americans collecting unemployment insurance, have been out of work \nfor 6 months or longer. They have run out of the insurance that is \nprovided by their State. These are the workers who will collect this \nFederal unemployment extension, which they are using, as my colleagues \nhave said--the Senator from Ohio, with his letters, was eloquent as he \nreported on the people from Ohio who are talking about why they need \nthis to pay their rent, to make mortgage payments, to buy groceries, \nand to put gas in their cars to go out and look for their next job.\n\n  As the Senator said so eloquently, sometimes the real people whom \nthis legislation affects are forgotten during this debate. While \nMembers of this body stand and give economic lessons and talk about the \nmacro situation, there are honest hard-working people out there who are \nsuffering because of our failure to act.\n  I recently heard from a woman in Canterbury, NH, named Jo Ellen. She \nis a professional psychiatric nurse with a graduate degree. She had a \ngood job until she was laid off because of cutbacks to our mental \nhealth system. She is in her sixties and has been working since she was \n11 years old. Since being laid off, she has applied for dozens of jobs, \nfrom part time to retail positions. She has cut back on her \nprofessional experience on her resume so that she is not ruled out for \nbeing overqualified. She always mentions that she is willing to accept \nany salary, but nonetheless she has not yet been called for an \ninterview--not once.\n  Jo Ellen wrote to me not just because her unemployment was going to \nrun out but because she is so troubled by what she keeps hearing from \npeople who voted against the extension of unemployment benefits, who \nsay that people who are collecting unemployment are irresponsible or \nthat they are not looking for a job, they are looking for a handout. Jo \nEllen is not looking for a handout; she is looking for a job.\n  While we still face one of the most difficult job markets in history, \nwith five applicants for every one job, we need to make sure people \nsuch as Jo Ellen stay afloat. There are millions of people across this \ncountry who are just like Jo Ellen, who are working hard, who want to \nfind a new job, who are one step away from disaster if they don't get \nan extension of unemployment benefits.\n  In New Hampshire, 20,000 people could see their unemployment \ninsurance expire within the next 4 months if we don't act. By \nsupporting the legislation today, we can make sure New Hampshire's \nunemployed workers receive $75 million in essential Federal assistance. \nThis money, as has been pointed out, won't sit quietly in savings \naccounts; it will go to grocery stores, pharmacies, and small \nbusinesses in the communities where the unemployed are living. In fact, \nconservative economist Mark Zandi, a former adviser to Senator McCain, \nhas cited unemployment insurance as one of the three most effective \nuses of Federal funding. According to his analysis, every dollar we \ninvest today will create $1.61 in economic growth.\n  When I was Governor, after the September 11 attacks, when this \ncountry went into a recession, one of the first things we did in New \nHampshire was to increase unemployment benefits because we knew what \nMark Zandi said was correct--that people would put that money back into \nthe economy, help stimulate the economy, and help create economic \ngrowth. We did that with bipartisan support from a Republican \nlegislature. I don't know what has changed in the last 9 years since \nSeptember 11 that we have our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho, by and large, say we can't support unemployment benefits and \nextending those benefits but we can have tax cuts for the wealthy \nwithout funding those. There is something wrong with that kind of \nlogic.\n  These benefits that, hopefully, we are going to pass today will help \npeople all across America invest in their community. At a time like \nthis, with our economy poised to turn the corner, this funding is \ncritical to our future. Quite simply, these are investments we can't \nafford not to make.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues, and I hope we will get those 60 \nvotes and extend the unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6005-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6005-S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CLEAN ENERGY\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, 2 years ago for the first time global \ninvestments in clean energy technology exceeded those for fossil fuels. \nThis is clearly a trend that will continue, and a good trend. \nUnfortunately, America is not keeping up with the clean energy \nrevolution. Today, 90 percent of the market for production of clean \nenergy is outside the United States. We are losing the race to develop \nthose technologies in nearly every market.\n  Of the top 10 solar panel companies in the world, only 1 is American. \nSimilarly, of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers, only 1 is \nAmerican. And of\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\nthe top 10 advanced battery manufacturers, only 2 are American.\n  For decades we have talked about the need to reform our Nation's \nenergy policy. Every President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has \nincluded energy reform in their policy agenda, and in virtually every \nCongress we passed an energy bill. But these efforts have not been \nsuccessful in revolutionizing our Nation's energy system because they \ndid not go far enough. Our oil imports have tripled since 1974. Today \nwe rely on fossil fuels to meet 86 percent of our energy needs and we \nare one of the largest contributors to global carbon pollution.\n  The truth is simple and unmistakable. If we want to move away from \ndirty fossil fuels, we need to put a price on carbon pollution and we \nneed to do it now. Putting a price on carbon will reflect the true \ncosts of our energy sources and enable market forces to drive American \ningenuity to develop clean energy technologies that will create jobs, \nenhance U.S. competitiveness, strengthen national security, and cut \ncarbon pollution.\n  We are in the worst economic recession our country has seen since the \nGreat Depression. We need to invest in sectors of the economy that can \ncreate jobs today and then long into the future. Studies have shown \nthat investments in clean energy jobs create more jobs per dollar than \nfossil fuel-based energy products. These clean energy jobs use American \ningenuity to turn Sun and wind into electricity, waste into fuel, and \nreduce the energy we use to power our homes, businesses, cars, and \ntrucks. These are the sectors that will provide the long-term economic \nsecurity and job creation we desperately need.\n  Studies by numerous academic institutions show that by putting a \nprice on carbon, we could create up to 1.7 million net new jobs over \nthe next 10 years. That is 170,000 jobs per year and includes any jobs \nthat may be lost in the transition away from fossil fuels. Many clean \nenergy jobs cannot be shipped overseas. From installing insulation to \nbuilding offshore wind turbines, these are jobs that can exist only on \nAmerican soil. The creation of these new clean energy jobs will \nthemselves create a multiplier effect, allow Americans to do more with \ntheir income--such as eat out at a restaurant, take a vacation, or buy \na home. These activities could add an additional $39 billion to $111 \nbillion boost to the economy. It is clear that investing in clean \nenergy will give us the best bang for the buck by creating more jobs \ntoday and for generations to come, paving a long-term sustainable path \nto economic recovery.\n  The good news is that we do not have to wait for these clean energy \ntechnologies to be developed. We can get started today. Over the last \nfew decades we made great strides in improving green energy \ntechnologies. For example, advances in wind energy technology have \nreduced the cost from 30 cents per kilowatt hour in the early 1980s to \nless than 5 cents per kilowatt hour today. The Obama administration as \nwell as cities and States across the country have recognized the \npotential for these technologies. In fact, the energy provisions of the \nRecovery Act represent the largest single investment in clean energy in \nAmerican history.\n  The truth is, as much as that is, it is still not nearly enough. The \nrest of the world also faces an economic recession, energy insecurity, \nand carbon pollution, and many countries have also begun to take \nsignificant steps to transition to a new clean energy economy, \nincluding China.\n  We have some things in common with China. We each contribute roughly \n20 percent of the world's carbon pollution, and we both rely heavily on \nforeign oil to meet our energy needs. However, China is outpacing the \nU.S. investments in clean energy. From 2005 to 2009, China's investment \nin clean energy increased by 148 percent. This surge of financing led \nChina to surpass the United States for the first time last year, \nspending nearly twice as much on renewable energy technology.\n  China is now the largest manufacturer of wind turbines and the \nlargest manufacturer of solar panels, 95 percent of which they export \nto other countries.\n  My home State of Delaware is a leader in renewable energy \ndevelopment. In fact, we are on the verge of constructing one of the \nfirst offshore wind farms in the United States. The project leaders are \nworking hard to make sure that the turbines off the Delaware coast will \nproudly wear the label ``Made in the U.S.A.''\n  Today, the average wind tower has 50 percent American-made \ncomponents. If we want to ensure that 100 percent of future wind and \nother renewable energy projects are made in America, then we must make \nit a national priority. Only then will we have the capacity to meet our \nown rising demands for clean energy.\n  We must also recognize the fact that our reliance on foreign oil is a \nserious threat to our national security. The United States imports \nnearly 60 percent of the oil we use, and 70 percent of the imports come \nfrom outside North America. All told, we send $1 billion overseas every \nday for foreign oil. Some of the nations we buy oil from do not share \nour interests and may be hostile to the United States or their own \npeople, and some of these nations are unstable, corrupt, and dangerous. \nBecause of this, we send our troops overseas to ensure the secure flow \nof oil around the world. This stretches our military thin, and puts our \ntroops in harm's way.\n  Even during times of peace, we have spent $50 billion a year to \npatrol shipping lanes and secure Middle Eastern oilfields and transport \nroutes. Our dependence on foreign oil also forces us to deal with \nundemocratic nations in order to protect our interests in oil. It \nreduces our leverage and forces us to make oil security part of our \ninternational diplomatic and military strategies.\n  Furthermore, because we consume 25 percent of the world's oil, our \nhigh demand drives up prices worldwide. So no matter from whom we \nchoose to buy oil, oil-rich nations, some of which are unstable and \nhostile to the United States, will reap the benefits.\n  This dependence on oil also leaves us vulnerable to price \nmanipulation by entities such as OPEC, which can influence global oil \nprices at any time, as they have done so many times in the past. We \nhave the opportunity now to make this right. We can eliminate the \nthreat of foreign oil to our national security by transitioning to a \nclean energy economy. We can harness American ingenuity and regain our \ncompetitive edge in the global markets. We can create hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs in America for generations to come.\n  By putting a price on carbon, we will send a signal to investors, \nindustries, manufacturers, and global competitors that the future of \nthe American economy lies in clean energy.\n  Pricing carbon is the most cost-effective policy tool available to \ntransition the United States away from dirty fossil fuels. It will \ncreate incentives for businesses and industry to find low-cost \nsolutions to reduce carbon pollution, and it will send a clear signal \nthat offers predictability in the marketplace. It will allow businesses \nand investors to finance long-term projects in renewable energy knowing \nthat they are standing on the same common ground as their competitors.\n  Many of the new clean energy technologies require decades of lead \ntime before they are ready for commercial-scale development. Therefore, \nit is imperative that we start investing in them immediately. \nFurthermore, because market barriers exist, we must also provide \nadditional investments such as loan guarantees, grants, tax incentives, \nand other assistance to encourage early and significant action toward \nclean energy technology development and deployment.\n  We can no longer afford to pay for the high cost of a fossil-based \neconomy. Putting a price on carbon will reflect the true costs of our \nenergy sources and enable market forces to drive American ingenuity to \ndevelop clean energy technologies. We have the most creative and \ntalented workforce in the world. We can transform our energy system to \none that creates jobs and enhances U.S. competitiveness, strengthens \nnational security, and cuts carbon pollution. But we have to take the \nbull by the horns. Now is the time to chart a new course for the \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and seize this moment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6007-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6007-S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ESTATE TAX\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, each and every day it gets harder and \nharder to listen to my Republican friends who race to the Senate floor \nbreathlessly telling the American people how concerned they are about \nthe $13 trillion national debt and how we have got to get our financial \nhouse in order. They are just very, very upset about that.\n  But, as you know, under the leadership of President George W. Bush, \nthese same Republicans turned a record-breaking Federal surplus left by \nthe Clinton administration into record-breaking deficits.\n  Back then, their rallying cry was ``deficits don't matter,'' \narticulated by then-Vice President Dick Cheney. This ``deficits don't \nmatter'' philosophy gave us two wars that were not paid for. There are \nestimates that the war in Iraq alone will end up costing some $3 \ntrillion, unpaid for. They gave us some $700 billion in tax breaks that \nwent to the wealthiest 1 percent. They gave us a $400 billion unpaid \nfor prescription drug program written by the insurance and drug \ncompanies. They gave us a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street.\n\n  But under President Obama, Republicans have seemingly taken a 180-\ndegree turn. Apparently, deficits do matter. Now they say we can't \nafford to extend unemployment insurance to 2 million Americans who lost \ntheir jobs during the worst recession in modern history, and they say \nwe just don't have the money to create millions of new jobs by \ninvesting in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and transforming \nour energy system. We just don't have the money to do that.\n  The Republican hypocrisy is now about to advance to a whole new \nlevel. In the name of fiscal responsibility, they are opposing \nvirtually every effort to help the middle-class and working families. \nWe just can't afford to do it. But when it comes to the needs of \nmillionaire and billionaire families, our Republican friends have no \nproblem reducing revenue by hundreds and hundreds of billions of \ndollars. In other words, they are deficit hawks when it comes to the \nneeds of ordinary people, but they are very big spenders when it comes \nto the needs of the rich.\n  Four years ago, every Republican but two voted to completely \neliminate the estate tax, a tax that has been in existence since 1916, \nand impacts only the very wealthiest families, the top three-tenths of \n1 percent. Under the estate tax, 99.7 percent of American families do \nnot pay one nickel. This huge tax break for the wealthy, repealing the \nestate tax, which Republicans are fighting to do, would increase the \nnational debt by more than $1 trillion over a 10-year period. These \ndeficit hawks, who are so concerned about the national debt and record-\nbreaking deficits, want to increase the national debt by over $1 \ntrillion in a 10-year period.\n  Let me tell my colleagues who the major beneficiaries of this tax \nbreak would be. Would it be the average middle-class worker who during \nthe Bush years saw a $2,200 decline in his income? We have a collapsing \nmiddle class, working people desperately in need. Would Republican \nrepeal of the estate tax help those workers? Not a chance. Nobody in \nthe middle class would get one nickel of a tax break.\n  Would Republican repeal of the estate tax help a single mother \nstruggling to send her daughter to college, maybe for the first time \never in that family's history? College costs are going up. Working \npeople can't afford college. Would it help that single mom? No, I am \nafraid not. That single mom would not get one penny.\n  Would it help one of the millions of senior citizens struggling to \nmaintain their dignity on Social Security benefits? This year there is \nno COLA for senior citizens. I tried to get some help there. \nRepublicans voted against it. Couldn't do it. Would it help senior \ncitizens struggling with the high cost of medicine? No. Those senior \ncitizens would not get one penny of help by Republican repeal of the \nestate tax.\n  I must be honest. Sadly, there are also a few Democrats who are \nsupporting this giveaway, all Republicans and a few Democrats.\n  Who are the major beneficiaries of the repeal of the estate tax or, \nas Republican pollsters like to call it, ``the death tax''? If we \ncompletely eliminated the estate tax, it would provide an estimated $32 \nbillion tax break for the Walton family, the founders of Walmart. We \nhave a family whose fortune today is worth an estimated $86.8 billion. \nIf, as the Republicans want, we eliminate the estate tax completely, \nthis family--obviously of desperate need, obviously struggling hard to \nkeep their family above water economically, struggling hard to stay off \nwelfare--would receive an estimated $32.7 billion in tax breaks, if the \nestate tax is completely eliminated.\n  Let's be clear. This policy being pursued by Republicans is designed \nto help the very richest people in our society.\n  Interestingly enough, our Republican friends today in all likelihood \nare going to vote against providing a $35 billion emergency extension \nof unemployment benefits that will help 2 million Americans who have \nlost their jobs through no fault of their own. We can't afford to do \nit. We just don't have the money. But apparently we do have the money \nto provide almost $33 billion to a family worth $86 billion, one of the \nrichest families in the world.\n  It is not only the Walton family our Republican friends and a few \nDemocrats want to help. Permanently repealing the estate tax will also \nprovide an $11 billion tax break to the Mars candy bar family. We all \neat Mars candy bars. They are going to get an $11 billion tax break.\n  It would provide a $9 billion tax break to the Cox Cable family and a \n$2.5 billion tax break to the family who founded Campbell Soup. No one \nin the bottom 99.7 percent of the population, nobody in the working \nclass, nobody in the middle class, no low-income person, nobody even in \nthe upper middle class will gain one cent of benefit from these tax \nbreaks.\n  Today, while Republicans may not have the votes to permanently \neliminate the estate tax, they are working feverishly to push \nlegislation to substantially lower that tax. In fact, they have already \nsucceeded in eliminating the estate tax this year, and this year alone, \nas result of President Bush's $1.35 trillion 2001 tax cut legislation. \nWiping out this tax in 2010, when billionaires are dying, for the first \ntime in 95 years their families will not pay one cent in taxes. That \nhas already cost our Treasury, in the midst of a $13 trillion national \ndebt, billions and billions of dollars in needed revenue.\n  It seems to me that at a time when this country has a $13 trillion \nnational debt, at a time when 22 percent of our children are living in \npoverty--the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized \nworld--at a time when our infrastructure is crumbling, at a time when \nwe have a desperate need to transform our energy system and by doing \nthat we can put millions of people to work rebuilding America, \ntransportation infrastructure, energy, it is beyond comprehension, \nliterally beyond comprehension that anyone can come down to the floor \nof this Senate and argue with a straight face that we should provide \nhundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  I should add all of this takes place within the context of the United \nStates already having by far the most unequal distribution of wealth of \nany major country on Earth. The top 1 percent own more wealth than the \nbottom 90 percent. When we give away billions more in tax breaks to the \nvery rich, we are only exacerbating that. We are making that wealth gap \neven greater.\n  That is why I have introduced the Responsible Estate Tax Act, S. \n3533, along with Senators Harkin, Whitehouse, Sherrod Brown, and \nSenator Franken. This legislation would raise $318 billion over the \nnext decade by establishing a graduated inheritance tax on estates of \nover $3.5 million. I actually cannot take credit for this legislation. \nI would like to, but I cannot. It would be dishonest. This is an idea \ndeveloped 100 years ago by a good Republican President named Teddy \nRoosevelt.\n  In 1910 he pushed this idea which eventually became adopted in 1916. \nThis is what Teddy Roosevelt, as this chart indicates, said 100 years \nago. I\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nthink my Republican friends probably will not be quoting Teddy \nRoosevelt, though he is one of our great Presidents. This is what Teddy \nRoosevelt said:\n\n       The absence of effective State, and, especially, national, \n     restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a \n     small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful \n     men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power.\n\n  That sounds pretty familiar. A small group of incredibly wealthy \npeople whose sole objective is to hold and increase their power.\n\n       Therefore, I, [Teddy Roosevelt] believe in . . . a \n     graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes, properly \n     safeguarded against evasion, and increasing rapidly in amount \n     with the size of the estate.\n\n  What he was talking about was not from a financial point of view of \nbringing in revenue. He was expressing fear about America becoming an \noligarchic aristocracy in which a few people had incredible wealth and \nused that wealth to perpetuate their position in society. If that is \nnot what is happening today, then I don't know what is happening.\n  When we look at Wall Street spending $300 million trying to stop any \nreal reform of Wall Street at a time when these guys are making all \nkinds of money, having been bailed out by taxpayers, if we look at the \noil companies and all of their lobbyists around here, that is precisely \nwhat is going on. A small number of incredibly wealthy people are \nperpetuating their power through their wealth.\n  In order to gain support for the permanent repeal of the estate tax \nor a major reduction in estate tax rates, Republicans and lobbyists \nrepresenting the super rich are doing what they do best, and that is \ndistorting reality. We will not hear any of my Republican friends who \ntalk about repealing the estate tax tell us that the richest families \nin America are going to be receiving $10, $20, $30 billion in tax \nbreaks. What they have done, both as politicians and through their \nlobbyists, has created a mythology that a responsible and a fair estate \ntax--or as their pollsters have framed it, ``a death tax''--will \nsomehow destroy family farms and small businesses.\n  In other words, what they are doing is what they very often do. They \nsay: It is not the very rich, the billionaires we are interested in \nprotecting. It is not the Walmart people. We are interested in family \nfarmers and small businesses. Those are the people we are trying to \nprotect. But nothing could be further from the truth.\n  As usual, they are using their old tactic of pretending to worry \nabout the needs of ordinary people as a smokescreen to serve extremely \nwealthy special interests.\n  Let's talk a little bit about what they are saying. In terms of the \npreservation of the family farm, something I happen to believe in \npassionately--we have a lot of family farms in Vermont--the American \nFarm Bureau was asked some years ago to come up with a single example \nof one family farm being lost as a result of the estate tax. They could \nnot find one farm, not one farm that had to be sold as a result of the \nestate tax, not one.\n  I should tell you, the legislation I have authored provides even more \nprotections to family farms than previous law. So they are not \nprotecting the family farmers; they are protecting the Walton family \nand other billionaire families.\n  In terms of small businesses--something that is obviously vital to \nour economy; small business is the engine of job creation; we have to \nprotect small businesses--this is what the nonpartisan Tax Policy \nCenter has estimated: that only 80 small businesses and farm estates \nthroughout the country paid an estate tax in 2009--80; 8-0--\nrepresenting, as this chart shows, 0.003 percent of all estates. In \nother words, virtually every single small business and family farm in \nthis country would not pay one penny in estate taxes under my bill, and \nbecause of protections in the Tax Code, their effective, real tax rate \nwould only be 14 percent. And the relatively few people who inherit \nsmall businesses who pay an estate tax are given 14 years to pay it \noff. They do not have to pay it off in 1 year.\n  So when our Republican friends come down here and tell us they are \nfighting to protect the family farm or small businesses, that just is \nnot the case. What they are coming down here to do is to protect the \nWalton family and the Steinbrenner family and the other billionaire \nfamilies who are spending a whole lot of money in a major lobbying \neffort to make sure the richest people in this country become even \nricher.\n  So I think what this debate is really all about is what the old Woody \nGuthrie song framed and described as ``which side are you on?''--which \nside are you on?--and the Republicans have answered very loudly and \nclearly, when it comes to the needs of the unemployed and the \nuninsured, when it comes to protecting the interests of the struggling \nmiddle class, they are just not there. When it comes to ordinary \npeople, the Republicans are deficit hawks. But if you are a millionaire \nor a billionaire family and if you need a huge tax break that will cost \nour government hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, you can \ncount on Republicans for your support. That is what this issue is \nabout.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at 2:30 this afternoon, the Senate will \nvote again on unemployment insurance. This bill is about jobs. This \nbill is about compassion. This bill would extend unemployment insurance \nfor people who have lost their jobs.\n  This bill is about jobs because unemployment insurance goes to people \nwho spend it immediately. That would increase economic demand, and that \nwould help support our fragile economic recovery. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office says that additional unemployment benefits \nwould have one of the largest effects on economic output and employment \nper dollar spent compared with any other policy. A fancy term is the \n``multiplier effect.'' Dollars spent on unemployment benefits have a \nmuch greater effect on the economy, a bigger bang for the buck than \nalmost any other dollar expended by the Federal Government. It \nstimulates the economy. Unemployment benefits stimulate the economy, \nand clearly it helps the people who have lost their jobs. Of the 11 \npolicies CBO analyzed, the Congressional Budget Office ranked \nincreasing aid to the unemployed first. It is No. 1. CBO says it will \ncreate the most jobs per dollar of budgetary cost.\n  As I mentioned, this vote is really about compassion. As of this \nweek, more than 2.5 million out-of-work Americans have stopped \nreceiving unemployment insurance benefits because Congress has failed \nto enact this bill. That is more than 2.5 million people who are not \ngetting a paycheck to pay the bills. That is more than 2.5 million \nAmericans who are not getting any help from unemployment insurance to \ntide them over. These 2.5 million Americans are trying to get work. But \nthere are still five people looking for work for every job opening--\nfive looking for every job available. They need to get help until they \ncan find that job.\n  A woman from Helena, MT--the town I was born in--called my office and \ntold us that unemployment benefits are keeping her family afloat. She \nwas laid off when she was 8 months pregnant. She wants the Senate to \nknow she has worked since she was a teenager. She wants to work. And \nshe will work again.\n  For these 2.5 million Americans, this bill is about the roof over \ntheir heads. For these 2.5 million Americans, this bill is about \nkeeping the electricity on. For these 2.5 million Americans, this bill \nis about food on the table. It is that simple. It is that important.\n  A Montana father with three small children was laid off after 18 \nyears of service because the company could no longer pay his wages. Now \nhe has no income. But he continues to look for work. His home is going \ninto foreclosure. Unemployment insurance has been his only income. It \nis what puts food on the table for his family.\n  This is America. When there is an emergency, we in America do not \nleave people behind. Let's not leave the unemployed behind. We have \nstripped this measure down to the bare essentials. We simply must pass \nthis bill. This afternoon, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and \nmove this important bill.\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6009-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    SMALL BUSINESS LENDING FUND ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this week the Senate also returns to the \nsmall business jobs bill. Small businesses are central to our efforts \nto create jobs. Unemployment insurance helps people who are out of \nwork. We want to help create the jobs so people can get the work.\n  Small businesses employ half of America's private sector workforce. \nIn my home State of Montana, small businesses employ more than 90 \npercent of all private sector employees. Over the past 15 years, small \nbusinesses have created two-thirds of Americans' new jobs. That is \nabout 12 million new jobs.\n  Historically, during recessions, small businesses bear the brunt of \nemployment losses. The great recession has been no exception. Over the \ncourse of the great recession, small firms have accounted for between \n64 percent and 80 percent of net job losses. Plainly, to create jobs, \nwe need to find ways to help small businesses.\n  Small businesses continue to face significant obstacles to expanding \nand hiring. One of the biggest obstacles is getting capital. A recent \nstudy by the National Federation of Independent Business found that \nonly half of small businesses trying to borrow are able to get the \ncapital they need. Nearly a quarter are not able to get any credit at \nall. Compare that to 2005. Five years ago, 90 percent of small \nbusinesses were able to get the capital they needed, and only 8 percent \nwere not able to get any credit at all--a big change.\n  Small business lending has dropped. From the second quarter of 2008 \nto the third quarter of 2009, small business borrowing fell by more \nthan $20 billion. A number of factors have contributed to this decline. \nBanks have tightened lending standards and terms for new credit. Banks \nhave reduced risky assets to improve their capital positions. Falling \nreal estate values have limited the ability of small business owners to \nuse their own assets to guarantee or collateralize loans. And credit \ncard terms have also worsened.\n  Over the course of the great recession, small businesses in my home \nState of Montana have faced many of these obstacles. For example, \nGrains of Montana--that is a restaurant and bakery based in Billings--\nhad trouble finalizing the terms of its SBA loan. This delayed the \nexpansion of their bakery. And when a potential franchisee in Arizona \nwas unable to secure funding, the deal fell through. Companies such as \nGrains of Montana need to get capital to grow and to hire new \nemployees. We must act to get credit flowing. We must increase access \nto capital so small employers can begin hiring again. That is exactly \nwhat the small business jobs bill would do.\n  The small business jobs bill includes a provision that would \ncompletely eliminate the tax on the sale of certain small business \nstock purchased from the date of this bill's enactment through to the \nend of 2010 and held for 5 years. This proposal would provide a \npowerful incentive to invest in small entrepreneurial firms right now.\n  The bill also includes a provision for certain small businesses that \nexpands the carryback period for general business credits determined \nthis year from 1 year to 5 years, and our bill allows these general \nbusiness credits against the alternative minimum tax.\n  Another provision would temporarily shorten the holding period \nrequired after a C corporation converts to an S corporation in order to \navoid triggering a gain on assets. This provision would allow small \nbusinesses to increase their liquidity by selling assets that would \notherwise be subject to an additional layer of tax.\n  All of these provisions free up business capital for expansion and \njob growth. In past recessions, small firms were the first to begin \nhiring again. We must ensure that this trend continues as we recover \nfrom the great recession. We can achieve this by helping small \nbusinesses get the capital they need.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the small business jobs bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6009-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6009-S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue we are going \nto be voting on today, thank goodness. We are going to be voting on an \nextension of unemployment insurance, which is something many of us in \nthe Senate have tried to pass for many weeks now. We have been blocked \nby the Republican side of the aisle.\n  We are finally at a point now where we think we can get the votes \ntoday to extend unemployment insurance. It is badly needed. You don't \nhave to be a Senator or a Member of Congress to have heard from people \nall across this country about what this means to them. Those of us who \nare serving in the Senate have received letters, e-mails, phone calls, \nand other communications from people within our States.\n  In Pennsylvania, the people have made it abundantly clear to me and \nmy office over many weeks now about how urgent a problem this is in \ntheir lives. This isn't about some complicated, remote issue; this is \nan issue of life and death, in some instances. But for most, it is an \nissue of getting by every week, making ends meet, paying bills, \nproviding health care for their children, those who have lost their \njobs, through no fault of their own, being able to have the dignity \nthat comes from providing for your family. We know we have more than 14 \nmillion Americans out of work. In Pennsylvania, we have over 591,000 \npeople out of work. If that is not a record, it is very close to one. I \nknow it is a high for the last quarter century in Pennsylvania.\n  The last unemployment extension expired 5 weeks ago, on June 4. \nWithout an extension, just about 1.2 million people have lost their \nbenefits in the month of June, just last month. If this continues to be \nblocked in the Senate, we know another 2 million will be without \nbenefits by the end of this month, July. In the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, over 200,000 will have exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits by the end of this month. That means one-third of \nPennsylvania's jobless will be without benefits by the end of this \nmonth.\n  To say this is anything but an emergency is an understatement. To \ncontinue to block an unemployment insurance extension is irresponsible, \nin a word, and I think callously irresponsible. Also, I think it is an \naction that is harmful to our economy. We know, for example, that if \nyou spend a buck in unemployment insurance, you will get a lot more \nthan a buck in return for the economic impact. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has an estimate to the effect that for the GDP, gross domestic \nproduct, it may be as high as $1.90 for every $1 you spend on \nunemployment insurance. So you spend a buck and get a $1.90 back. That \nis an even higher number than a lot of us have pointed to prior to \nthis.\n  Mark Zandi, one of our leading economists, said years ago, I think, \nthat if you spend a buck on unemployment insurance, you get about $1.60 \nback. Such as when you spend $1 on food stamps, you get more than \nthat--maybe $1.70--in return. Now we have the CBO saying the return \nmight be as high as $1.90 for every $1 you spend on unemployment \ninsurance.\n  There are those in Washington and around the country who are trying \nto make political arguments against extending this and using a lot of \nhot air in the process to oppose the extension, block the extension, \nslow down the effort to provide this bridge that unemployment insurance \nis, for people who paid into this program for years, in many instances, \nfor just this purpose--when the economy is in the ditch, when they lose \njobs and they are trying to get this help.\n  We have had weeks and weeks of efforts to block this. We should be at \nthe end--we hope. In the end, this isn't simply about a program or \nabout an extension or about what the Federal Government is doing; this \nis about real people and their lives and the challenges in their lives.\n  I have received lots of correspondence--whether they are letters, e-\nmails or phone calls--and I will highlight a few examples. We had a \nletter from Frank--I will just use the first name so we don't disclose \npeople's names. He\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\nhas been seeking employment for a long time. He said:\n\n       I have gone through a lot of health situations since being \n     home--\n\n  Meaning since being home after losing his job.\n\n     constantly worrying will I get a job, is there going to be \n     enough money, or when are my benefits going to be cutoff. . . \n     . The worries are overpowering and devastating.\n\n  A lot of these letters we are getting speak in those terms. This \nisn't a mechanical thing or a question about a program or whether the \nSenate will do this or that; this is about whether Frank, in this \ninstance, who lives in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is going to be \nable to have enough money to provide for his family. So this is about \nworry and emotion and about real anxiety that people feel in the midst \nof the most horrific recession since the 1930s. This isn't some far off \nremote problem; this is real life for someone such as Frank. Then he \ngoes on from there to say:\n\n       My ex-wife came home from work to advise me and our \n     children that she will be losing her job on August 6, 2010, \n     due to her company outsourcing [the work of that company] to \n     India. She was employed there for 21 years. She carries our \n     medical insurance and 80 percent of our income. We have a 12-\n     year-old [child] with Cystic Fibrosis, which is a fatal \n     disease, and this precious child will be without [health] \n     insurance that pays for the very medicine that keeps her \n     alive.\n\n  He goes on from there in his letter. I will end the quote with that \nline about his daughter with cystic fibrosis. So this isn't just about \npaying the light bill or paying the mortgage or making ends meet in a \ngeneral way; this is about whether this family can provide health \ninsurance for a 12-year-old with cystic fibrosis. That is what we are \ntalking about, in many instances. We are talking about health care. \nWhen you lose your job, unfortunately, the direct impact isn't just on \nincome; it is about whether you have health insurance. That is Frank's \nstory in Pennsylvania.\n  I will give one more example because we are short on time.\n  Rachel, from Pennsylvania, writes to us in an e-mail. She says this:\n\n       I am writing for my husband.\n\n  Sometimes a person who loses a job is too embarrassed to write or \ndoesn't want to express the feelings that are tearing them apart \ninside. They don't want to write down on paper the anxiety they are \nliving with--the horror of not having enough to provide for your \nfamily. She is writing for her husband, saying he was laid off from his \njob as a GPS operator. She said the best way to take care of his \nfamily, he thought at that point, was to become an airman in the \nNational Guard. He enlisted this year, and he entered the program for \nthe Air National Guard. He excelled in the program, but he couldn't \nproceed to basic training because he needs dental work. Rachel and her \nhusband, similar to so many others, have no health and dental \ninsurance.\n  She says--and this is direct quotation from the letter:\n\n       I am doing everything I can, including working 2 jobs, to \n     keep us above water, and we are drowning at a speed I never \n     imagined. I bring home $700 a month, which doesn't cover our \n     rent, let alone car insurance, groceries, the electric bill, \n     et cetera. We do not want to live extravagantly. We just want \n     to live.\n\n  That is what Rachel says about her situation because of the loss of a \njob that her husband had to experience. He is becoming an airman in the \nNational Guard to try to make ends meet. I could go on, but I will not \nbecause we don't have the time.\n  That is what this is about. This isn't a theoretical issue or some \ngovernment program over here that none of us fully understands. This is \nabout real lives, providing health insurance for families, making ends \nmeet, and basic dignity that people feel robbed of because they lost \ntheir job, and some people in Washington don't want to lift a finger to \nhelp them. It doesn't take much to say aye when your name is called to \nvote for an extension of unemployment insurance. That is what the \nprogram is for. It is for emergencies, when people's lives are at \nrisk--at least the life of their family to be able to make ends meet. \nThat is what we are talking about. That is why I urge every Member of \nthe Senate not to vote for your own political priorities but to vote \nfor Frank and Rachel in Pennsylvania, who have written to us, and \npeople similar to them all across this country. I think we are going to \nfinally get an affirmative vote, but it is long overdue.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6010-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see the Republican leadership and the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee on the floor. I would note that I \nam hopeful the Senate Republican leadership would take the opportunity \nto enter into a time agreement on 1 of the more than 20 judicial \nnominees who have been stalled from Senate consideration. I am \nreferring to the nomination of Jane Stranch of Tennessee. Her \nnomination was reported by a bipartisan majority of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee last November, 8 months ago.\n  A native of Nashville, Mississippi, Ms. Stranch has practiced law in \nthat community for 32 years, and has often appealed before the Sixth \nCircuit--the court to which she is now nominated. She has decades of \nexperience in labor and employment law, an expertise she put to good \nuse when she taught a class on labor law at Nashville's Belmont \nUniversity. Ms. Stranch also has an active appellate practice, as well \nas significant experience with alternative forms of dispute resolution, \nsuch as mediation and arbitration. She is a leader in her community who \ndedicates significant time to pro bono work, civic matters, and her \nchurch. She also has impressive academic credentials, having earned \nboth her J.D., Order of the Coif, and her B.A., summa cum laude and Phi \nBeta Kappa, from Vanderbilt University.\n  Since this nomination was reported last November, all Democratic \nSenators have been prepared to debate and vote on her nomination. I had \ngiven my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Tennessee, my \nassurance about that. I, myself, have spoken about this nomination a \nnumber of times because it is one of the oldest on the calendar.\n  I know the senior Senator from Tennessee has expressed his \nfrustration to me about the fact that this nomination has not been \nvoted on in the last 8 months. So I went to him last week and said I \nwas going to make a unanimous consent request for a time agreement to \nconsider her nomination. The Senator asked me if I would wait until \ntoday, which I was glad to do. We have waited 8 months already.\n  I, in no way, fault the senior Senator from Tennessee. He has been \nvery clear to me he is ready to vote whenever this nomination comes \nforward. So seeing the Republican leader on the floor, I will now \npropound a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent, as if in \nexecutive session, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, \nfollowing consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed \nto executive session and consider Calendar No. 552, the nomination of \nJane B. Stranch, of Tennessee, to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit; there be 3 hours of debate with respect \nto the nomination, with the time equally divided and controlled between \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, myself and \nSenator Sessions, or our designees; that upon the use or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; any statements related to the \nnomination be printed in the Record; the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action; the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank \nthe Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for \nhis request. Jane Stranch is a well-qualified nominee.\n  It has long been my position, without going into the history in this \nbody, that a President's judicial nominees deserve an up-or-down vote. \nShe is President Obama's longest pending circuit court nominee yet to \nbe confirmed. She was nominated last August. The committee reported her \nin November. She has my support, that of Senator Corker.\n  I know it is difficult, with the amount of matters we have on the \nSenate floor, to schedule anything, including a circuit judge.\n  But it would be my hope that the Republican leader and the majority \nleader could, before long, set a time certain for an up-or-down vote on \nJane Stranch, the President's nominee for the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his request. I will not \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I know my good friend \nfrom Tennessee is interested in this nomination. There were, however, \nsome no-votes on the nominee in committee. We will be running the traps \non our side and seeing if we can work out\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\nboth the debate time and a time to take up this nominee in the not too \ndistant future. But for the short term, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am terribly disappointed. With this \nobjection, Senate Republicans have further ratcheted up the obstruction \nand partisanship that has become commonplace this Congress with regard \nto judicial nominees. I had honestly hoped that working with the \nrespected senior Senator from Tennessee, we would be able to obtain a \nstandard time agreement. I am not asking any Republican Senator to vote \nfor the nominee, but simply to vote. I am not asking Republican \nSenators to vote before they have had a chance to debate the \nnomination, only to agree to a reasonable time for debate. If they do \nnot think 3 hours reasonable, I wish they would indicate what time they \nthink they need for such a debate. During the past 2 years, their \ndemands for time have gone unused in debates on the nominations. Often, \nhours will be demanded in opposition without any of it being used for \nthat purpose. If it were just a matter of the number, I would hope we \ncould have worked that out and reached an agreement. Instead, this \nobjection is like the Republican leader's objection last week to the \nrequest from the Senator from North Carolina to consider two nominees \nfrom that State to the Fourth Circuit. They were both reported by the \nJudiciary Committee last January, more than 6 months ago. One was \nreported by a vote of 18 to 1 and the other by a vote of 19 to 0; they \nare supported by both home State Senators, one a Republican and one a \nDemocrat. Still the Republican leadership refuses to allow the Senate \nto consider them.\n  I was disappointed to see my friend from Kentucky object last week. \nHe did not speak about the nominees, or to their unquestioned \nqualifications, including their backgrounds in military service. It \nseemed as if his justification was along the lines of tit-for-tat. That \nis most unfortunate. I note that when I became chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee midway through President Bush's first tumultuous \nyear in office, I worked very hard to make sure Senate Democrats did \nnot perpetuate the judge wars as tit-for-tat. In fact, we did not. \nDespite that fact that Senate Republicans pocket filibustered more than \n60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations and refused to proceed \non them, including one of the nominees from North Carolina now pending \nbefore us, again, during the 17 months I chaired the committee during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 100 of his judicial nominees. By contrast, during these first 2 \nyears of President Obama's term, Senate Republicans have allowed only \n36 Federal circuit and district court nominees to be considered by the \nSenate, 100 to 36.\n  Ironically, the history of the Sixth Circuit and our efforts to turn \naway from the destructive practices that Republicans had followed \nduring the Clinton years is detailed in my July 29, 2002, Senate \nstatement in support of another Tennessee nominee, Judge Julia Gibbons. \nAs chairman, I proceeded to a confirmation hearing for Judge Gibbons in \nApril 2002; it was the first hearing for a Sixth Circuit nominee in 5 \nyears. Despite the well-qualified nominees of President Clinton, the \nRepublican majority did not consider them. Republicans refused to \nconsider the nominations of Judge Helene White, an experienced State \ncourt judge; Kathleen McCree Lewis, an accomplished attorney and the \ndaughter of former Solicitor General of the United States and former \nSixth Circuit Judge Wade McCree; and Kent Markus, a law professor and \nformer Justice Department official who had the support of his \nRepublican home State Senator. This was the partisan record Senate \nDemocrats overcame when in the Senate majority. Republicans' pocket \nfilibusters of President Clinton's nominees resulted in numerous Sixth \nCircuit vacancies. By proceeding with President Bush's nominations of \nJudge Julia Gibbons of Tennessee and then his nomination of Judge John \nRogers of Kentucky, to the Sixth Circuit in 2002, the Democratic Senate \nmajority did not engage in a tit-for-tat but acted to break the logjam \nthe Republican obstruction had created.\n  When I resumed the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee in 2008, \nwe were able to fill the last remaining vacancies on the Sixth Circuit \nwhen we confirmed President Bush's nominations of Judge Helene White \nand Judge Ray Kethledge of Michigan to the Sixth Circuit. Judge White \nhad been one of President Clinton's nominations in 1997 who was pocket \nfilibustered after having waited in vain for a hearing for more than \n1,450 days. During the Bush years the Sixth Circuit went from half \nvacant to full.\n  With respect to Senate Republican leadership's current practice of \nholding, delaying and obstructing Senate consideration of judicial \nnominees reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, this is a \ntactic they reserve for nominees of Democratic Presidents. Indeed, when \nPresident Bush was in the White House, Senate Republicans took the \nposition that it was unconstitutional and wholly inappropriate not to \nvote on nominees approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. With a \nDemocratic President, they have reverted to their secret holds that \nresulted in pocket filibusters during the Clinton years. Last year, \nSenate Republicans successfully stalled all but a dozen Federal circuit \nand district court nominees. That was the lowest total for judges \nconfirmed in more than 50 years. They have continued that practice \ndespite the fact that judicial vacancies continue to hover around 100, \nwith more than 40 declared judicial emergencies.\n  No one should be confused: The current obstruction and stalling by \nSenate Republicans is unprecedented. There is no systematic counterpart \nby Senate Democrats. In fact, during the first 2 years of the Bush \nadministration, the 100 judges confirmed were considered by the Senate \nan average of 25 days from being reported by the Judiciary Committee. \nThe average time for confirmed circuit court nominees was 26 days. The \naverage time for the 36 Federal circuit and district and circuit court \njudges confirmed since President Obama took office is 82 days and the \naverage time for circuit nominees is 126 days.\n  Overall judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from \nalmost 10 percent to less than 4 percent. Federal judicial vacancies \nare now over 10 percent. During the Bush years, the Federal circuit \ncourt vacancies were reduced from a high of 32 down to single digits. \nThat progress has not continued with President Obama. Instead, \nRepublican obstruction is putting that progress at risk. During the \nBush years, we reduced vacancies on nine circuits. Since then, \nvacancies on six circuits have risen. I note that during the Clinton \nyears, Republican obstruction succeeded in virtually doubling Federal \ncircuit vacancies.\n  I trust that the Republican leader remembers how I treated and Senate \nDemocrats treated judicial nominees from Kentucky. During the 17 months \nI chaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first 2 \nyears, we proceeded to consider and confirm Judge John Rogers of \nKentucky to the Sixth Circuit by voice vote before the end of the \nsession in 2002, having already confirmed Judge Danny Reeves and Judge \nKaren Caldwell to the Eastern District of Kentucky, and of course, \nJudge David Bunning to the Eastern District of Kentucky by voice vote, \nas well. During the more than 4 years that Republicans were in the \nmajority during the Bush Presidency, one other judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Kentucky was confirmed, Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove, a \nformer aide to the senior Senator from Kentucky. The year I resumed the \nJudiciary Committee chairmanship, we proceeded to confirm Judge Amul \nThapar to the Eastern District of Kentucky. Nominees the Republican \nleader supported for his home State's vacancies were very well treated.\n  I am confident the senior Senator from Tennessee remembers how fairly \nwe treated judicial nominees from his State. I was chair when we broke \na longstanding logjam on the Sixth Circuit by confirming Judge Julia \nGibbons of Tennessee in July 2002. During the first 2 years of the Bush \nadministration we worked to see the Senate also confirm Samuel Mays, \nJr., as a judge for the Western District of Tennessee and Judge Thomas \nPhillips as a judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee. When I \nresumed the chairmanship in 2008, we also facilitated the Senate \nconfirmation of Judge Stanley Anderson\n\n[[Page S6013]]\n\nto be a judge for the Western District of Tennessee. During the \nintervening years three other nominees were considered and confirmed to \nbe Eastern District of Tennessee judges, Judge Thomas Vartan, Judge \nRonnie Greet and Judge Harry Mattice, Jr. In addition Judge J. Daniel \nBreen was confirmed to be a judge in the Western District of Tennessee.\n  There did come a time in the 108th Congress when President Bush and \nSenate Republicans were intent on packing the courts with ideologues \nand the Republican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee violated the \nrules and practices of the committee in support of this effort. They \nforced filibusters of 10 nominees, 6 of which were ultimately \nconfirmed.\n  I have not done what the Republican chairman did. I have respected \nand protected the rights of the minority. President Obama has not made \nnominations opposed by home State Senators but has instead reached out \nand worked with home State Senators from both parties. He has by and \nlarge nominated well-qualified moderates.\n  I have tried to ratchet up the cooperation between parties and \nbranches in my role as chairman. It is disappointing to see the Senate \nRepublican leadership take the opposite approach. They are holding up \nconsideration of nominees reported unanimously from the Judiciary \nCommittee for weeks and months for no reason. Just last week, after a \nneedless 3-month delay, the Senate confirmed a judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois unanimously. That is more evidence of the pattern \nof stall and obstruct. Earlier this year the majority leader had to \nfile cloture to get to a vote on the nomination of Judge Barbara Keenan \nof Virginia to the Fourth Circuit. When the vote was held, she was \nconfirmed unanimously.\n  Republicans' sense of injury is misplaced in my view. Moreover, the \ndisproportionateness of their response disserves the American people \nand our Federal justice system.\n  Jane Stranch of Tennessee is just one example of the harm they are \ncausing. Judge James Wynn of North Carolina is another example, as is \nJudge Albert Diaz, also of North Carolina. The list includes the 21 \njudicial nominees currently stalled by Republican objection from final \nSenate consideration but also many of the 36 who were needlessly \ndelayed. What is being perpetuated is a shame.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Tennessee for his \nefforts in moving this forward. I am obviously disappointed, but I am \nnot disappointed in the actions of the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee. He did work very hard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader\n\n\n                   Tribute to Senator Paul Coverdell\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, about 10 years ago, one of our dear \nfriends, the Senator from Georgia, Paul Coverdell, was unexpectedly \ntaken from us. He became ill and passed away. Here we are 10 years \nlater, and we wish to commemorate his life and service. His good \nfriends, the Senators from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss and Mr. Isakson, are \nboth here. We all want to say a few words about our departed friend \nPaul Coverdell.\n  Paul was a patriot. I admired him a great deal. Nobody worked harder \nthan Paul Coverdell, and nobody wanted less credit for it. We were \ntalking on the floor a few moments ago. Senator Lott, who was the \nRepublican leader at the time, used to call him Mikey. What he meant by \nthat was some character we believe was in a commercial named Mikey who \nalways got the job done and didn't care where the credit ended up. That \nis exactly how Paul was. No matter how tough the task, no matter how \nthankless the job, Paul was ready to pitch in with good humor and \ncredible persistence and see it through to completion.\n  He had a distinguished career in the private sector before he entered \npublic life. He spent a long time toiling in the Georgia State Senate \nbefore he came here. In fact, he used to joke that he knew all too well \nwhat it was like to be an underdog because he spent 15 years \nrepresenting all five Republicans in the Georgia State Senate against \n51 Democrats. That gives one a certain humility, shall I say.\n  Paul's deep understanding of the power of freedom is well known, and \nhis efforts to promote and spread freedom are a big part of his legacy. \nAs Director of the Peace Corps in the late 1980s, Paul sent the first \nPeace Corps volunteers into Eastern Europe to work with nations about \nto experience freedom for the very first time.\n  In a speech he delivered shortly before his death, Paul said:\n\n       I believe that in the 20th century, America has helped \n     plant the seeds of democracy and freedom around the world. I \n     hope that when the stories are written at the end of this new \n     century, it is said of this nation that we tended to liberty, \n     nurtured it around the world, and sustained freedom and \n     prosperity here in this Hemisphere.\n\n  That was Paul shortly before his death.\n  He served in this Chamber for nearly a decade, and those of us who \nserved alongside him know he never, ever sought the spotlight. He was a \ndecent hard-working guy who was dedicated to his wife Nancy, the people \nof Georgia, the American people, and to promoting what he called the \nthree pillars of freedom: economic liberty, security for persons and \nproperty, and a well-educated citizenry. Paul often said that an \nuneducated mind can never truly be free. It is an idea he shared with \nthe men who founded our Nation. As Washington put it in his first \nannual address to Congress:\n\n       Knowledge is, in every country, the surest basis of public \n     happiness.\n\n  As with all the lessons Paul liked to share, he delivered it with a \nsmile.\n  Paul is deeply missed by all of us in this room, but his \ncontributions are lasting. Ten years after his sudden passing, we \ncontinue to learn from the life and example of Paul Coverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise, like my leader from Kentucky, \nto celebrate the life of Paul Douglas Coverdell. I thank the leader for \nhis kind comments about a very personal friend to both Senator Isakson \nand me as well as to the leader.\n  Paul Coverdell served in this body from 1993 until his untimely death \non July 18, 2000. Paul was a longtime politician in our State, having \nfirst run for office in 1968. He lost the first election and then was \nelected to the State senate in 1970. He rose to the rank of minority \nleader in the Georgia State Senate and had a successful career there. \nHe then decided to run for Congress and lost his first race for the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Paul did something that is so Coverdell-like in the summer of 1978. \nHe was then the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. He was on \nvacation in Maine. He knew, obviously, of the soon-to-be Vice \nPresident, George H.W. Bush, but he didn't know him and he wanted to \nget to know him. So he walked up to his house in Kennebunkport--didn't \nhave to worry about the Secret Service back then--and knocked on his \nfront door. President Bush came to the front door. He introduced \nhimself. They became fast friends after that.\n  When President Bush was elected, Paul Coverdell was very involved in \nhis campaign. He wrote him a simple note. He said: If I can help you, I \nwould like to. Well, the President took that to heart and appointed \nPaul to be the Director of the Peace Corps. Anything Paul undertook, he \nput his whole heart and soul into. When he became Director of the Peace \nCorps, he did exactly that. He also was a very good thinker. He created \nwhat was called World Wise Schools within the Peace Corps. Those \nschools all of a sudden cropped up all around the world under the \nsponsorship of Peace Corps volunteers and all under Paul's leadership. \nPaul led the first Peace Corps volunteers into Eastern Europe after the \nfall of the wall.\n  I will never forget going to the Peace Corps building as a Member of \nthe House after Paul's death when the Peace Corps building was named \nafter Paul. To hear the many tributes of volunteers who had served for \nso long under Paul and the personal stories they had about the \ninvolvement of their leader and their affection for their leader was \ntruly humbling and moving.\n  When Paul was elected to the Senate in 1992, he actually had to be \nelected four times that year. He was in a primary which he won after a \nrunoff. He then came in second in the general election in November, but \nbecause of the rules being what they are in Georgia, as I experienced \nmyself in 2008,\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\nPaul was in a runoff with the incumbent because an independent third-\nparty candidate got enough votes so that the incumbent did not get 50 \npercent plus one. Paul then won, after coming in second, the runoff \nelection and, thus, his fourth election in 1992.\n  In 1998, he became the first Georgia Republican to ever be reelected \nto the Senate. He was such a class guy here that he was respected and \nadmired by folks on both sides of the aisle. I went back and looked at \nsome of the comments Republicans and Democrats made on the floor of the \nSenate after Paul's death. It truly was, again, a very moving \nexperience to read those comments.\n  He created what is called the Coverdell ESA, or the Coverdell \neducation savings accounts--they are really education IRAs--to allow \nfamilies to set aside money on a tax-free basis to educate their \nchildren. Paul loved education. It was very near and dear to him. He \nwas very proud of being able to establish those IRAs for future leaders \nof the country.\n  A quick story about Paul. He was a very unique individual. He never \nwore anything but a dark suit, never wore anything but a long-sleeve \nwhite shirt. I remember one day I had an event down in the very \nsouthern part of my congressional district, down at the Okefenokee \nSwamp. It was in July or August, I don't remember which, but I do \nremember it was extremely hot. The humidity in south Georgia on a June \nor July or August day is extremely high. We were all there, and some \nother Members of Congress who were there were in shorts and golf \nshirts. Whatever we could put on to stay cool or somewhat cool, that is \nwhat we had on. Paul showed up. As always, Paul had on a dark suit and \na white shirt. We finally did get him to take his tie and coat off \nbecause we were going to ride out into the swamp. I used to kid Paul \nabout that really until the time of his death.\n  The leader is right, Senator Lott had a term for Paul Coverdell. He \ncalled him Mikey because anytime Trent needed to get something done, he \nwould go to Mikey. Paul just had a way of making sure that whatever the \nchallenge was, it got done and got done in a very efficient way.\n  The photograph I cherish most of all my political photographs is a \nblack-and-white photo. It is a picture of Paul and myself sitting in \nhis office at one of our weekly meetings that took place while I was in \nthe House and he was in the Senate, the two of us just sitting there \ntalking. The expression on Paul's face is so classic Coverdell. It \nalways makes me feel good and is a great reminder of Paul.\n  Paul's wife Nancy has always been a dear friend. She was such a great \nasset to him. She has chaired my military academy appointment committee \nin all of my years in the Senate. She is a wonderful lady. Again, we \nhave some very fond conversations together about Paul from time to \ntime.\n  Paul Coverdell was not just a great Georgian; he was a great \nAmerican. He certainly loved our State and our country as much as \nanybody who has ever served in this body. It is a sad day but yet a \nvery good day from the standpoint of having the opportunity to remember \nthe strong and positive leadership of Senator Paul Coverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I am honored and privileged to join \nLeader McConnell and Senator Chambliss to take a few minutes to talk \nabout one of my great friends, Paul Coverdell, and his lovely wife \nNancy. Mitch McConnell has done some great recollections of Paul's \nservice in the Senate. Senator Chambliss told some great stories of his \nrelationship with Senator Coverdell. I wish to share some of mine to \ncertify and document that everything they have said is absolutely \ncorrect.\n  I met Paul Coverdell in 1972, 2 years after he was elected to the \nGeorgia State Senate as the fifth Republican to serve there. I was \nrunning for the Georgia House of Representatives. Although I lost in \n1974, I won in 1976. A few years later, I became the leader of the \nRepublicans in the Georgia House of Representatives, and Paul was the \nsenate leader. The senate had their caucus elections every January \nafter elections. I always loved the senate election. They had five \ncaucus officers and five Republican Senators. So instead of having an \nelection, they drew straws. They drew straws and they drew Paul \nCoverdell, to which he was forever reelected as leader of Republicans \nin the Georgia State Senate.\n  Paul was the most organized guy I have ever known and was the most \ngoal-oriented guy I have ever known.\n  His goal--when we were outnumbered 10 to 1 in the senate, Democrat to \nRepublican, and 8 to 1, Democrat to Republican, in the house--he \ndreamed of the day when we were in the majority. As the Republican \nleader of the house, he would summon me, by kind invitation, on every \nMonday morning, to the Buckhead Waffle House or the Buckhead IHOP where \nwe would have coffee and talk about how one day we were going to be the \nmajority party in Georgia.\n  Now, I am an optimist. I was a salesman all my life. I believed we \ncould get there too. But Paul had a step-by-step plan--a plan that in \n1976 seemed tantamount to impossible but a plan that was realized with \nhis election to the Senate in 1992, a congressional majority for \nRepublicans in Georgia in 1994 and, ultimately, the first Republican \nGovernor in the history of our State Post-Reconstruction, in 2002.\n  Paul meticulously was a partisan, but he was, above that, an \nAmerican. Paul Coverdell was also a man of ideas. Folks have talked \nabout the Coverdell education savings accounts, which he authored in \nthe Senate and are now law. But I remember, in Georgia, in the 1970s \nand 1980s, when he championed the mandatory seatbelt law. Believe me, \nin a State such as Georgia where you have a lot of pickup trucks and a \nlot of rural communities, wearing a seatbelt was not the most popular \nthing in the world. But Paul knew it was good for saving lives. He knew \nit was good for lowering insurance rates because he was an insurance \nman. He fought against a majority that did not want it, but he \nprevailed and he won, and today many lives have been saved because of \nthe efforts of Paul Coverdell in the Georgia Legislature.\n  Senator Chambliss told his story of Paul in his dark suit and his red \ntie and his white shirt. I want to tell mine.\n  Back in 1982, I was on the beach at Jekyll Island, GA, following a \njoint house Republican-senate Republican conference. The late Haskew \nBrantley--then a Georgia State senator--and I were on the beach under \nan umbrella enjoying the beautiful coast of Georgia on our great \nisland, Jekyll Island. In the distance we could see this figure coming \ntoward us that looked from a distance as having on a suit, walking on \nthe beach with his shoes in his hand and his pant legs rolled up. The \ncloser he got, the more Haskew and I realized: That is Paul Coverdell.\n  Paul came in his red tie, his buttoned-down white shirt, his dark \npin-striped suit but with his shoes in his hand. He sat in the sand \nwith us, talked, got up, walked back to the parking lot, and drove to \nAtlanta. In fact, I am not sure I ever saw Paul when he did not have on \nthe dark suit, the red tie, and the white shirt.\n  He was always dressed to the nines, and he was always ready for \nwhatever challenge came. His wife Nancy, who is a beautiful lady I saw \njust a few weeks ago on the coast of Georgia, actually had her real \nestate license in my company. So not only did I know Paul, but I knew \nNancy, and for 35 years they were as close of friends as I have ever \nhad. But for 35 years they served Georgia day in and day out in \nwhatever capacity they could to make it a better State.\n  I think it is a great tribute to tell this story: When Paul was \nelected to the Georgia State Senate as the fifth Republican in history \nin 1970, for somebody to think a Republican majority could ever have \ntaken place, they would have laughed. But shortly after Paul's death, \nthe legislative office building where every member of the Georgia House \nand Senate in downtown Atlanta has an office was named the Paul D. \nCoverdell Legislative Office Building. He went from the bottom in terms \nof numbers, and he went to the top, but he climbed it one step at a \ntime; he climbed it one commitment at a time, and he never lost sight \nof the fact that he was an American first and a Republican second but \nalways committed to the values of Georgia and the values and the \nconservative principles we shared.\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\n  So on this day, just 10 years after his passing, we rise to pay \ntribute to a great American, a great Member of the Senate, and a leader \nwho made it possible for people such as Senator Chambliss and myself to \nfollow in his footsteps and one day, ultimately, serve in the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, the U.S. Senate.\n  I pay tribute to Paul Coverdell and his legacy and his beautiful wife \nNancy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                            Oil Independence\n\n  Madam President, today I come to this Chamber to speak about oil \nindependence for a stronger America. Many folks across America are \ncontinuously talking about the downside of our addiction to overseas \noil. Today I am going to be presenting a plan embodying a bill with \nthat name: Oil Independence for a Stronger America.\n  One of the big issues of our dependence on foreign oil is national \nsecurity. We send $1 billion a day overseas to governments that often \ndon't share our core American values; governments in the Middle East, \nin Nigeria, in Venezuela. Sometimes those dollars end up directly in \nthe hands of terrorists. As some national security analysts have noted, \nin our current wars we are sometimes funding both sides of the battle, \nand that is not a good place to be.\n  In addition, to maintain our access to that overseas oil, we have to \nmaintain a significant national security military force. Some analysts \nhave estimated the cost of that additional security, that additional \naccess to guarantee oil for America, has a value or a cost of up to $5 \nper gallon. So those aren't dollars we pay at the pump, but we \ncertainly pay them in terms of our national security overhead.\n  In addition to national security, our addiction to overseas oil is \nterrible for our economy. We are sending $1 billion a day overseas. Two \nyears ago, when the cost of a barrel of oil surged upwards, we were \nsending $2 billion a day overseas. It will be that again. It will go \nhigher, because the world's demand for oil is only increasing. As the \neconomies of Asia, and particularly the economy of China, are growing, \nthe demand for oil is growing as well, and with it we will be paying \nmore.\n  Take that $1 billion a day. That is $3 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America. I have a family of four: $12 a day for my family. A \nsignificant sum, hundreds of dollars a month for my family, goes \noverseas. When those dollars go overseas, they create jobs overseas \ninstead of creating jobs here in America. Try to picture the difference \nbetween spending $1 billion a day overseas and spending $1 billion a \nday on red, white, and blue American-made energy. That is the \ndifference between families who have jobs, a stronger economy, or a \nweaker economy.\n  Oil addiction makes us weaker as a nation. Oil independence makes us \nstronger as a nation. Isn't it time to choose strength over weakness?\n  I wish to take a look at the numbers demonstrating the challenge \nbefore us. The estimate for the amount of oil we will be importing as a \nnation 20 years from now is between 6 million to 7 million barrels per \nday, as indicated by this column. If we were to put together a plan \nthat would reduce our consumption of oil by more than 6 million to 7 \nmillion barrels per day, then we would have a plan that equates to \nindependence from oil so that we would be able to eliminate the \nrequirement, the need to import oil from overseas.\n  The good news is that the tools are at hand to have such a strategy. \nWhat we have lacked is the will, the political will to move forward; \nthe will to say, yes, we are going to have a plan and we are going to \nstay on that plan over the course of time, the two decades necessary to \nimplement it.\n  So what are the major strategies through which we can end our \naddiction to overseas oil? The first strategy I wish to talk about is \nchanging the consumption of gasoline in passenger vehicles. Right now \nwe have a number of hybrid cars that consume a lot less oil. We have \ncoming on the market next year the Nissan LEAF, the Chevrolet Volt. We \nhave the Tesla sedan. We are going to have numerous options for \ncustomers in America to be able to satisfy their domestic \ntransportation needs in ways that consume vastly less gasoline, and \nthat means less overseas oil. So the question is whether we promote \nadoption of these strategies. There is a tremendous amount to gain by \npromoting adoption of these strategies.\n  I wish to thank Senator Byron Dorgan and Senator Lamar Alexander who \npartnered with me, the three of us together, on the Electric Vehicle \nDeployment Act. This is an act that will take a half dozen or so \ncommunities across this country and create deployment communities to \ntest drive, if you will; building the infrastructure necessary for \nelectric vehicles in partnership with the deployment of electric \nvehicles, because the two have to work together. From what we learn \nfrom those deployment communities, we can develop an accelerated \nstrategy to shift to electricity from gasoline across this Nation. The \npotential savings are 3.2 million barrels per day.\n  The second strategy is to have more efficient freight transportation. \nThere is a lot to be gained in this area as well--up to 2 million \nbarrels of oil per day. We have a group out in Oregon, a nonprofit \ncalled Cascade Sierra. Cascade Sierra works in partnership with the \ntrucking community to make sure there is a one-stop shop to acquire \ndifferent technologies designed to increase the efficiency of trucks. \nThey deploy airfoils to make the trucks go down the highway more \nefficiently. They provide the technology for automatic tire inflation \nwhich makes a huge difference in mileage over time. Cascade Sierra \nmakes available different types of generators so that a truck, instead \nof running its large diesel engine to provide electricity when it is \nstopped, can instead run a small generator. Now they are working to \nhelp develop charging stations where the trucks can actually plug in to \npower up their electric infrastructure on the truck rather than running \ntheir diesel engine.\n  There are many ways to increase efficiency on trucks as well as \nincreasing efficiency by shifting a percentage of our freight \ntransportation from trucks to barges and rail. Rail and barges are \nincredibly efficient. I am constantly amazed at the statistic of how \nfar you can take a ton of freight with one gallon of diesel. For all of \nmy colleagues who may be wondering: Well, how far can you go? Can you \ngo 50 miles? Can you take a ton of freight 50 miles with one gallon? \nWell, no, it is higher than that. Is it 100 miles? No, it is over 400 \nmiles, a ton of freight, with one gallon on rail or by barge. \nSignificant savings are available in that area.\n  The third section is smart metropolitan transportation options. \nPortland, OR, is a city that is working very hard to provide options to \nits citizens on how they commute back and forth to work. We have light \nrail not too dissimilar from what we have here in Washington, DC. Back \nhome in Oregon, we also are building streetcars, and streetcars create \na whole infrastructure around efficient electric transportation for \nneighborhoods. Then we are working on other strategies, including bike \nlanes, and so forth, that create a network of options for effective \nnoncar transportation. Those types of strategies can do an enormous \namount in reducing the amount of fuel we consume, not to mention \nreducing the congestion and, therefore, improving the quality of life \nfor Americans throughout metropolitan areas. Potential savings: 1.7 \nmillion barrels of oil per day.\n  The fourth area is in alternative fuels. There have been natural gas \nforklifts since I was a little kid. Compressed natural gas is an \neffective fuel. Through recent developments in drilling technology, we \nhave discovered we can produce a lot more natural gas in our Nation, \nwhich means a lot more potential to power up trucks with natural gas \nrather than diesel. So that is a technology that will have a big \nimpact.\n  A second area is advanced biofuels. Certainly I wish to see the \nforests of\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\nOregon generating some advanced cellulosic ethanol for our truck fleet \nand to do so in a fashion which is environmentally sustainable so the \npower of plants, if you will, can be a significant factor in \nstrengthening our domestic energy economy and creating more jobs here \nin America and reducing our oil imports from overseas.\n  The fifth area is energy-efficient homes and buildings. In this case, \nthe savings are more modest: 200,000 barrels of oil per day. They are \nmore modest because most buildings are not heated by heating oil. But \nwe should pay attention to those buildings that are heated by heating \noil, because the savings, when you increase the energy characteristics \nof a building, are substantial. So that merits attention.\n  If one combines these strategies, we are looking at savings of well \nover 8 million barrels per day, as compared to the estimate for imports \n20 years from now of 6 million to 7 million barrels per day. So it is \nunquestionable that we can end our oil addiction if we have the \npolitical will, if we have the determination to sustain a plan through \nevery 4-year cycle over 20 years.\n  Here in America, we tend to oscillate back and forth as Presidencies \nchange, and that is why this bill, the Oil Independence for Stronger \nAmerica Act, calls for a National Energy Security Council that will \nsustain the attention to the national plan as Presidents come and go, \nas Members of Congress come and go.\n  There should be little question in any of our minds that America will \nbe stronger as an oil-independent nation rather than an oil-addicted \nnation. There should be little question that creating jobs here, buying \nAmerican-made energy at $1 billion a day is far preferable to sending \nbillions of dollars a day overseas, where they are no longer in our \nretail stores and are no longer creating jobs.\n  Certainly, many of these strategies will have a very positive \ninfluence on creating cleaner air and having American leadership and \nstewardship of our planet. So numerous positive factors go together. I \nwant to be sure to thank my original cosponsors of the bill. Senator \nTom Carper has done terrific work on CAFE and CLEAN TEA, which involves \nmetropolitan transportation options. Tom Udall brought insights on \nfreight, rail, natural gas, and biofuels. Senator Michael Bennet has a \ncomprehensive understanding of energy issues that is of real value in \nthe Senate Chamber.\n  I will conclude with this: Let's choose a stronger oil-independent \nAmerica over a weaker oil-addicted America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Hugo Boss\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, last April a German clothing \ncompany, Hugo Boss, announced it was planning to close down its only \nNorth American manufacturing plant located in Brooklyn, OH, outside of \nCleveland. Hugo Boss told us they were going to expand their American \nsales force but shut down all U.S. production. Despite the Cleveland \nplant being profitable--a plant that had been in existence for decades \nand decades prior to Hugo Boss purchasing it--Hugo Boss planned to move \nits Cleveland production to the country of Turkey.\n  I recognize Hugo Boss's desire to expand their sales force by \neliminating production in the United States and shipping it to Turkey--\na sad but all too common story in our Nation today--but it was a \ndevastating announcement for the workers and for the community in \nBrooklyn, OH. Cleveland has a long and storied history of manufacturing \nclothes and apparel, in addition to chemicals and steel and autos and \nso much else. In Brooklyn, a suburb of Cleveland, a factory is a source \nof pride and economic prosperity. Yet despite the shock and \ndisappointment of the announcement, the community rallied behind the \nworkers.\n  In the ensuing months, Governor Strickland and I met Hugo Boss \nexecutives and workers. I talked to the Hugo Boss people in Germany by \nphone. I went to the plant and talked to workers, heard their stories--\noften workers who had been there 10, 20, 30 years, husbands and wives \nworking together at the plant making no more than $15 an hour. So these \nwere not jobs that paid a lot of money or made a lot of people rich, \nbut they were jobs that gave particularly immigrant workers a real \nopportunity in this country to work. They had decent health benefits, \nand they made a wage that they could at least make a go of it.\n  Earlier this year, in February, when I traveled to meet with some of \nthose 400 workers, I began to hear these stories. As I said, the \nworkers make no more than $15 an hour, and many make less than that. \nThey are paid decent benefits but barely enough to keep these working \nfamilies in the middle class. These workers did everything they could \nto keep this plant profitable. Their work meant everything to the \ncommunity.\n  When the decision to close the factory was made, Joe Costigan, Sue \nBrown, Mark Milko, and Dallas Sells--all of Workers United--fought \ntirelessly on behalf of these workers. Mayor Richard Balbier rallied \nthe community to help keep the plant open, recognizing a healthy \nmanufacturing sector means a healthy and prosperous community. In the \nmeantime, management, workers, elected officials, and community leaders \nall continued to work together to find a way to keep the factory open.\n  Exactly a year later, in April 2010, an agreement was made that would \nkeep workers in their jobs and would sustain that community's economy. \nThese workers agreed to absorb wage cuts. Many of them went from $12 or \n$13 an hour down to $10 or $11 an hour.\n  Yesterday, we celebrated what happens when we work together to save a \nplant and a community. Yesterday, Governor Strickland and I joined 200 \nworkers and Hugo Boss executives to celebrate the first suit off the \nline of this restarted manufacturing plant. Wanda Navarro and Sheila \nMcVay were among those who spoke. Sheila McVay introduced the Governor, \nand Ms. Navarro introduced me. But before they did so, they spoke \neloquently of what being back to work means. I am proud to have stood \nby Wanda and Sheila and those who fought for the classic American \nsuccess story.\n  I wear a suit. The suit I have on today was union made in Cleveland, \nOH, by these workers. One of these workers came up to me as I was \nstanding there and she pointed to the vest pocket of the suit, saying: \nI make those vest pockets; I probably sewed that one. It makes me proud \nto have worked with Workers United and Hugo Boss to ensure that a \npremier global company continues to invest in this town, in this State, \nin American manufacturing.\n  Yesterday marked a new chapter for this company's global \ncompetitiveness and for our community's economic prosperity. But that \ncelebration yesterday must be viewed in the context of what is \nhappening all too often in our country. The closing of a plant too \noften means moving it offshore. It looks like a good deal for the \ncompany's quarterly financial statement. That is initially what Hugo \nBoss thought when they were going to close this plant--a profitable \nplant--and move to it Turkey: manufacture more clothes, sell more \nclothes in Turkey, increase their U.S. sales force, and sell more of \nthem back into the United States. We know that story can be told again \nand again, when U.S. trade law, U.S. tax laws, and companies think \nabout the next quarter more than they do the next year or the next \ndecade and outsource those jobs, then sell the products back into the \nUnited States.\n  As an example, I was meeting with someone today who is working to \npush the Commerce Department to simply enforce U.S. trade law and \nenforce or stop some of the currency manipulation by the People's \nRepublic of China. He told me that only 10 years ago we had 19 million \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States. Today, we are down to about 11 \nmillion. Yet China has some 100 million people working in \nmanufacturing.\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\n  For the last two decades, manufacturing has steadily declined, as \nfinancial services expanded. The Presiding Officer from Delaware has \nworked on and has talked about this. He understands this in terms of \nwhat has happened with manufacturing versus what has happened with \nfinancial services. Only 30 years ago, manufacturing made up more than \na quarter of our Nation's GDP, our Nation's gross domestic product. \nFinancial services was only 11 percent of our gross domestic product. \nToday, those numbers are almost reversed, where manufacturing is only \nabout half of what it was as a percentage of GDP and financial services \nis double what it was. Look where that brought us as a nation. Look \nwhat happened to our jobs. Look what happened to the middle class.\n  People at Hugo Boss and these other companies make things. People in \nthis country who make things can provide a middle-class lifestyle for \ntheir loved ones and their families. If we stop relying on \nmanufacturing as something that is important to us as a nation--not \neverything but something important to us as a nation--we will see the \nmiddle class continue to atrophy and decline.\n  We need a national manufacturing strategy that ensures that trade \nagreements and tax laws come down on the side of workers and \ncommunities, not encourages investors to go overseas, make things in \nChina and then send them back to the United States. We need a national \nmanufacturing strategy that once again invests in American workers and \nincentivizes companies to promote manufacturing innovation. We need a \nnational manufacturing strategy that recognizes manufacturing has been \nand always will be a ticket to the middle class for millions of \nAmericans. That is what manufacturing means to workers at the Hugo Boss \nplant in Brooklyn, OH, a suburb of Cleveland. That is what it means to \nworkers in communities in Toledo and Dayton and Cincinnati and Lima and \nMansfield, OH, and that is what it means to the middle class all over \nthis great country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, what is our parliamentary \nposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in a period postcloture.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           NASA Authorization\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to compliment a lot of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle for the extraordinary \nbipartisanship--no, the extraordinary nonpartisanship that occurred in \ncoming together unanimously to pass the NASA authorization bill out of \nthe full Commerce Committee last week.\n  The budget for NASA was about to be blown apart by centrifugal \nforce--having different elements, different interests all going off in \ndifferent directions. Everybody seemed to have their own agenda. \nGeographical circumstances came into it as to whose States were being \naffected. The companies were at war with each other. There was a lack \nof cooperation that was going on between the legislative branch and the \nexecutive branch. All I can say is hallelujah, it all came together, \nand we passed the NASA bill out of the Commerce Committee last week \nunanimously, with all the Senators who spoke singing its praises.\n\n  I am going to outline it in just a minute, but let me make note of \nanother fact. We had unprecedented cooperation between the authorizers; \nthat is, the authorizing committee, and the appropriators. As we speak, \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, State, Justice, which \nincludes the NASA appropriations--are preparing the markup. We will \nfind out the result tomorrow afternoon. But I can tell you the \ncooperation was extensive and so was the communication, the likes of \nwhich we have not seen around here this year, particularly in this year \nwhen there is so much gridlock and we have so much difficulty getting \nanything done. That has not been the case with the NASA bill.\n  There are a host of Senators, they all know who they are, to whom \nthis Senator wants to express his appreciation for their coming \ntogether. As the Good Book says: ``Come, let us reason together,'' and \nit happened. As I said at the time we passed it, I think it was a near \nmiracle, but I believe in miracles. Indeed, it happened.\n  Let me tell you what is in the bill. A good part of what the \nPresident requested is there. That is why we had the verbal and the \nwritten support of the President of this consensus that developed, \nwhich we passed. We had the President's recommendations on the top line \nof the spending for NASA, about $19 billion for this next fiscal year \nstarting in October.\n  The President recommended the extension of the International Space \nStation to 2020, which was originally supposed to expire in 2015, which \nwas absolutely ridiculous. We are just now getting it built and it is \nabout a $100 billion investment. The President wants to start a \ncommercial rocket industry, already under contract with NASA--two \ncompanies, SpaceX and Orbital Sciences--to deliver cargo to the \nInternational Space Station. Those contracts are already underway and \nthe testing is beginning. We put in the President's recommendation on \nthat commercial cargo in this bill, which was a recommendation for $300 \nmillion.\n  We agreed with the President to start the process of human-rating \ncommercial rockets for the purpose of being, in effect, a taxi service \nto and from the International Space Station. Human rating of a rocket \nis no small measure, because when you strap in to a rocket, there has \nto be all kinds of redundancies in order to protect human life. Safety \nis one of our major watchwords. That was authorized as well--at a \ndifferent level from what the President had originally recommended and \nover 6 years as opposed to 5 years that the President had recommended, \nbut nevertheless it gets the project started.\n  The main thing we did differently from the President's recommendation \nis this. When the President came to the Kennedy Space Center a few \nmonths ago and said he wanted to develop a new heavy-lift rocket that \nwill ultimately take us out into the cosmos, the President set the \ngoal--and I gave him great credit for this because you have to have a \ngoal when you are developing cutting-edge technology--he set that goal \nof going to Mars by a flexible path. The first way station he pointed \nto, with a date 2025, is an asteroid. He said he wanted that heavy-lift \nrocket to start to be developed by 2015. That is a 5-year wait. Our \ncommittee did not want to wait that long. We want to get started now. \nIn the authorization bill, in a congressional committee, we cannot \ndesign a rocket. But we can set policy guidelines to the executive \nbranch of government and to the agency, in this case NASA, as to using \nshuttle-derived technology and building on that, making it, in the \nparlance of the space community, evolvable, and that is what we did in \nthe authorization bill. We want to start it now instead of waiting \nuntil 2011.\n  We also did another thing differently. Although the White House was \ncontemplating this, by them embracing the consensus that we built, now \nthey have supported it; that is, to fly an extra flight of the space \nshuttle. This is not a space shuttle that we have to go out and build \nthe parts for. It is a space shuttle, a stack with the external tank \nand the two solid boosters as well as the orbiter we already have and \nready to be on the pad as a rescue shuttle for the remaining two \nflights, one of which will come this November, the other next February. \nWe wish to fly that third flight. It is likely to be the orbiter \nAtlantis. That would come a year from now, probably next June.\n  There is a lot more stuff to take up to the space station. There is a \nlot more equipment, supplies, and, interestingly and importantly, there \nis a lot of stuff up there that you need the big volume of that cargo \nbay of the orbiter to be able to bring back to Earth. That third flight \nwill supply that.\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\n  We continue the President's recommendations on all the other parts of \nNASA--on the science part, on the aeronautics part, and on the \nacceleration of research and development for new technologies. We \ncontinue that. We focus some of that development of technologies in our \nauthorization bill toward the building, the designing, and ultimately \nthe flying of this heavy-lift vehicle, complete with a crew \ncompartment, which more than likely will be in the form of what we \nthought of in the old days as the capsule.\n  Therefore, at the beginning of the new fiscal year, which comes this \nOctober, assuming that we have the authorization in place--if that is \nthe decision of the Appropriations Committee as well, and we can get \nthat appropriation passed and signed into law by the President--then, \ncome October 1, they will start on the development of that new heavy-\nlift vehicle.\n  This has been met with wide consensus. The research and development \non new technologies will continue. They will be more focused and \ndirected. They will be more immediate. The capability of having the \ncommercial rockets be human rated, to be the trip to and from the space \nstation, will be there, and it will start immediately.\n  All this dissonance and argument and criticism, it all came together \nand it passed unanimously. I await very expectantly and very hopefully \nfor the Appropriations Committee--they are acting as we speak--on \nseeing the results of their work.\n  Let me say in conclusion, I could name a dozen Senators. They all \nknow who they are. I have said it in press conferences, and so forth, \nsinging their high praises. Somewhere down the line, if this Chamber is \nstill in gridlock on so many other issues that we have and if we get to \nthe point we are not able to pass appropriations bills and if we, in \nfact, have to go back in order to fund the government starting October \n1 on what is called a continuing resolution, which usually is a \ncontinuance of the previous year's funding--hopefully, we will have \npassed by the Senate Appropriations Committee their bill that is very \nsimilar to the authorization bill I have just described. In that case, \nif we are in gridlock, it would be my hope, it would be the hope of \nsome dozen of us Senators that we would be able, then, to take that \nAppropriations Committee bill, passed by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, if we have to go to a continuing resolution, and put that \nNASA appropriations bill in the continuing resolution.\n  The alternative would be disaster. It would be appropriating on the \nbasis of last year's bill that would completely blow apart the \nconsensus I have just described. It would have the manned space program \ndead in its tracks by the funding at last year's levels without the \npolicy direction.\n  But, despite gridlock, I am an optimist. I believe what I have laid \nout is the mere expression of support of so many of our Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle so that when it comes to this little $19 \nbillion agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the \nagency that carries the hopes and dreams of a lot of Americans, it is \nmy hope that under those circumstances, as we get on into the fall, \nthat that is how we can fund NASA with an appropriations bill, if we \ncannot pass the overall CJS appropriations bill in its entirety.\n  I come as someone who 2 weeks ago didn't know where in the world we \nwere going or how we were going to get the votes. But Senators came \ntogether, and I, for one, this Senator, hope for the sake of all those \nyoung people out there whose hearts beat a little bit faster when they \nsee that rocket as it climbs into the heavens, who had the dreams of \nunderstanding what is out there in that universe that we are \nexploring--for the sake of all those young people, for the sake of this \ncountry and its technological prowess, for the sake of this country and \nits people, for the technological spin-offs that come out of the \nresearch and development of the space program that absolutely pervades \nour everyday life to make our quality of life better, for the sake of \nthe future of this country, that we stay on the cutting edge, inspiring \nour young people into math and science and technology and engineering \nso we can stay as the leader in this global marketplace, because we \nhave the ingenuity, the creativity, the inventiveness.\n\n  A lot of that inspiration comes out of our space program, both manned \nand unmanned. It is our destiny as a people to explore. It is our \nheritage as a people that we have explored. We have always had a \nfrontier. When we developed this country, we expanded westward on the \nfrontier. Now that frontier is upward. We can do no less than to \ncontinue the quest.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, after months of obstruction, we have \novercome a shameful effort by the Republican minority to block the \nextension of emergency unemployment benefits.\n  Because of the obstructionism of those on the other side of the \naisle, more than 2 and a half million unemployed Americans have seen \ntheir benefits terminated in recent weeks--49 days ago, to be exact. \nThey are among the nearly 6.8 million Americans who have been out of \nwork for more than half a year. That is the highest number of long-term \nunemployed we have had since we started keeping track in 1948. Again, \nthis is the highest number of long-term unemployment we have had since \n1948.\n  In recent weeks, I have come to the Senate floor several times to \nshare the heartbreaking letters and e-mails I have received from long-\nterm unemployed workers in Iowa. These families are struggling to \nsurvive. These Iowans are trying their hardest, doing everything they \ncan to find any kind of work. But the jobs just aren't there.\n  Officially, there are five job seekers for every new job opening. \nUnofficially, and more accurately, there are more than eight job \nseekers for every opening. Here on the chart, it says that when you \ninclude the discouraged workers who aren't counted in the official \nnumbers, unemployment has gone up to 26 million. Yet there are 3.2 \nmillion job openings. So there is between five and eight unemployed \nworkers for every job opening.\n  I say to those desperate families in Iowa and across America that we \nhave listened to you, we have heard you, and we have been fighting \ndesperately over the last 49 days here to get an extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits. Every time we have tried it, we have \nbeen obstructed by the minority, the Republicans. So thanks, today, to \nthe first vote cast by the new Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Carte \nGoodwin--by the way, I might say to Senator Goodwin, who was just sworn \nin at about 2 p.m. and then cast his first vote, he can be rightfully \nproud of the first vote he cast in the Senate--to help lift up people \nwho, in many cases, have lost all hope, to make sure families get the \nnecessary wherewithal to put food on the table and keep their families \ntogether. Thanks to the first vote of the new Senator from West \nVirginia, today we were able to get cloture and stop the filibuster.\n  I also thank the two Republicans--Senator Snowe and Senator Collins--\nwho also voted with us today to make sure we were able to get this \nextension into law.\n  Just remember, on three occasions this summer Republican Senators \npulled out the stops to filibuster and kill efforts to extend \nunemployment benefits. During that time, we heard a rising chorus on \ntalk radio and even from some Senators. They said that extending \nunemployment benefits would be a bad idea because, in so many words, \npeople are lazy, and they are just relying on their benefits instead of \nlooking for work.\n  As the distinguished minority whip, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nKyl, put it:\n\n       . . . continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is \n     a disincentive for them to seek new work.\n\n  I believe that is woefully out of touch with the reality of trying to \nsurvive on unemployment benefits. Let's look at the facts. While the \nnumbers vary from State to State, the average weekly unemployment \nbenefit nationwide is only about $300 a week. As this chart shows, $300 \na week in UI benefits adds up to\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nabout $15,000 a year. That is the average. The poverty line for a \nfamily of four is $22,000 a year. So is the Senator from Arizona saying \nsomeone who is getting $15,000 a year--a family of four--would rather \nget that than find a job and make well over $22,000 a year, which would \nbe the poverty line? Would they rather exist on $15,000 a year than, \nsay, $45,000 a year or $55,000 or $60,000 a year?\n  It is incredible to think that someone would say that when there is \none job for five to eight people out there looking. To say that somehow \nby giving them $15,000 a year--$300 a week--that will keep them from \ngoing to work is preposterous.\n  This line of argument is not just absurd and factually wrong, it is \nshameful. It is shameful to say that about hard-working Americans, who, \nthrough no fault of their own, are out of a job. I keep saying every \ntime I come to the Senate floor that we all have jobs here. Every time \nI come here and look around, I see fellow Senators and staff--we all \nhave jobs. We are not worried about tomorrow. Think about your own \nfamily. What if you were out of work and have been out of work for a \nyear and you are out there looking for work, and for every job there \nare eight other people out there looking for that job? You have to put \nyourself in the shoes of those kinds of families.\n  It is shameful to say somehow that by giving people unemployment \nbenefits, they are not going to go back to work because of that--I have \nmore faith in the American people. The American people want to work. In \nfact, the figures show that we are still the most productive Nation on \nEarth. Does that somehow point to lazy Americans? No. Given the \nopportunity, Americans can outwork anybody anywhere in the world--if \nthere is only a job.\n  To say that somehow giving unemployment benefits encourages people to \nbe lazy flies in the face of the facts about hard-working Americans--\nhow hard they work and how productive American workers are. Well, there \nis little question that the long-term unemployed would like nothing \nmore than to pull themselves up by the bootstraps. But this economy \nright now is very short on bootstraps.\n  Our Republican colleagues have trotted out another justification for \nstopping extending unemployment benefits. They say that extending the \nbenefits will add to the deficit. They argue that we should cut off \nsome of the most desperate people in our economy. We should take away \ntheir last meager lifeline out of a concern for the deficit.\n  Yet these very same Senators today are demanding that the 2001 and \n2003 tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans be extended \nfor another 10 years. Let me repeat that. These same Senators on the \nRepublican side who are arguing that we can't extend the unemployment \nbenefits because it would add to the deficit are some of the same \nSenators who are saying these tax breaks President George Bush and a \nRepublican Congress gave to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans in \n2001 and 2003 should be extended for another 10 years. And they are \nsaying the cost of those tax breaks should not be offset, they should \nsimply be added to the deficit.\n  So let's be clear about what our Republican friends are saying. They \nare saying the roughly $33 billion cost of extending unemployment \nbenefits for some of the most desperate workers in our society is \nunacceptable if it adds to the deficit, but extending tax breaks for \nthe most fortunate and privileged Americans, which would cost a \nwhopping $670 billion over the next decade, well, we can just add that \nto the deficit. So, again, $33 billion to help people who are out of \nwork, who are desperate, to help them feed their children, stay in \ntheir homes, pay their mortgages, keep their families together, that \n$33 billion we can't spend because it adds to the deficit; however, we \ncan extend these tax breaks that cost $670 billion for another 10 \nyears. Oh, yes, we can add that to the deficit. That is what my \nRepublican friends are saying. Well, this is breathtaking. It is \nbreathtaking to hear this line of argument. It is nothing more than a \nreturn to the Bush years when the President, with a Republican majority \nhere, dragged us into trillion dollar wars and turned major surpluses \ninto historic deficits--historic deficits. Well, today, finally, the \nSenate said: No, we are not going to go any further on this. We drew \nthe line. We had our vote. Shortly, we will vote on passage of the \nbill--49 days too late.\n  Imagine, if you will, that you are one of those persons and you have \na family. Maybe you have an illness in the family. Maybe you have a \nchild who is sick or a child with a disability or maybe some other \nunfortunate things have happened to you. Maybe you have been out of \nwork and you lost your unemployment benefits 49 days ago. What have you \ndone for those 49 days? Think about it. Think about what you would do. \nWell, I am sorry. I apologize to all those Americans, on behalf of the \nSenate, that we didn't pass this 49 days ago. But the Republican \nminority would not let us do it because of a filibuster--because of a \nfilibuster--which requires 60 votes. We didn't have 60 votes until \ntoday. So I am sorry people had to wait 49 days, but the unemployment \nextension we will pass today will be retroactive, so it will fill in \nthose last 49 days. I hope and trust that many of the bills that piled \nup on those kitchen tables--maybe the mortgage payment that wasn't made \nor maybe the mortgage company is calling all the time and hounding you \nabout it, maybe you have had to go out and get one of those awful \npayday loans with high interest rates to tide you over--I hope that \nwill soon get taken care of, that you will get your unemployment \nbenefits and be able to pay those off. These will be extended until the \nend of November. So we can now say to the people who are unemployed: \nYou will get your unemployment benefits until the end of November. And \nI hope the programs we are working on will turn this economy around.\n  Tomorrow, the President will sign into law the financial reform bill \nwe passed here last week. This is going to go a long way toward \nreassuring the markets that we are going to have openness and \ntransparency and that we are going to now deal openly and forthrightly \nwith our financial institutions and demand of them that they deal \nopenly and forthrightly with the American people. I am hopeful the \neconomy will turn around, but the economists say things are still kind \nof dicey. Well, if that is the case, our obligation is to make sure we \nhave a safety net, and the biggest safety net of all is unemployment \ninsurance benefits.\n  I am sorry we had to wait 49 days because of Republican intransigence \nand their raising the filibuster on this, but we finally got it done \ntoday, and pretty soon those checks will be going out to our American \nfamilies. I just hope we don't have to keep extending it. I hope the \neconomy turns around. But if it doesn't--if it doesn't--I say to my \nRepublican friends right now, as we go into next year, these tax breaks \nthey want to extend for the wealthiest 1 percent, I am sorry, that is \ngoing to have to take a backseat to the people who are unemployed in \nthis country. We need to make sure we do everything possible to get \nthem jobs, to get them back to work, and to make sure they get the \nunemployment benefits they need until such time as those jobs do \nreturn.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nbill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  iran\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concerns \nover Iran's nuclear ambitions and to applaud new and tougher U.S. \nsanctions recently passed by Congress.\n  With both of the sanctions imposed in U.N. Resolution 1929, and the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act \nbecoming law, we are finally poised to inflict real damage to Iran's \nnuclear program. But only a strong, unified, and forceful \nimplementation of a sanctions regime will stop Iran from continuing on \nits current dangerous path.\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\n  While Iran still clings to the myth that its recent Turkish-Brazilian \ncompromise proposal is an antidote to the global and U.S. sanctions, we \nmust not waste time pretending this is a sign they are halting their \nnuclear program. Under this proposal, Iran would ship only half of its \nlow enriched uranium out of the country for further enrichment while \ncontinuing to violate a multitude of U.N. Security Council resolutions. \nThe international community cannot afford to be fooled by Tehran into \nslowing the implementation of the sanctions and this is precisely why \nwe should step up pressure on the regime.\n  Make no mistake: Iran wants to become a world nuclear power, with the \nability to threaten Israel, the United States, and the global \ncommunity.\n  Containing a nuclear Iran would be virtually impossible and this \ngrowing threat looms large in all international diplomacy. If they \nacquired this capability, it would be an unequivocal ``game changer'' \nin the Middle East and, indeed, throughout the world. An undeniable \nthreat to Israel and the United States, a nuclear Iran cannot become a \nreality. We therefore must do all in our power to prevent Iran from \nacquiring nuclear capabilities.\n  I am heartened to see the administration embrace both tough global, \nbut more importantly, stringent Congressional sanctions. The enactment \nof powerful and effective economic sanctions against Iran--and the \nforeign companies that do business with Tehran--will go a long way in \nfurther isolating this rogue nation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, millions of Americans all across the \ncountry, and hundreds of thousands in my State, have lost their jobs. \nTo soften the blow of those job losses, we seek to extend the emergency \nunemployment insurance benefits that many of these Americans receive. \nSince the beginning of this crisis, we have extended these benefits \nseveral times, but more recently, a Republican filibuster has kept us \nfrom doing so.\n  I hope we will finally clear the way to extend these benefits today, \nbecause the failure to do so has been deeply wrong. It has done great \nharm to millions of American families. Already coping with an economy \nthat is not yet creating the jobs they need, these families must also \ncope with the fact that because of a Republican filibuster, Congress \nhas failed to provide the help they need.\n  The arguments offered in opposition to this extension aren't just a \nmatter of differing opinions. They are fictions. And based on these \nfictions, the opponents seek not just to block an extension of \nunemployment benefits for millions of jobless Americans, but to stop us \nfrom even holding a vote.\n  Some opponents tell us they oppose this extension because jobless \nbenefits encourage workers to stay on unemployment instead of seeking \nwork. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported just last week \nthat in May of this year, there were about 3.2 million job openings in \nthe United States. There were at the same time roughly 15 million \nunemployed Americans. With nearly five jobless workers for every job \nopening, desire to work on the part of the American people is \ndefinitely not the problem. Instead of disparaging the work ethic of \nAmericans, these members should help us get desperately needed aid to \nworkers who lack not the desire to work, but the opportunity.\n  These opponents also tell us they oppose this extension because it \nwill add to the deficit. This is an odd position to take after having \nsupported proposals, such as the Bush tax cuts, that added far more to \nthe deficit than this legislation would add. To account for this clear \ncontradiction, they say that they do not believe those tax cuts added \nto the deficit. The Republican leader was quoted last week as saying, \n``There's no evidence whatsoever that the Bush tax cuts actually \ndiminished revenue.'' He went on to say that this is ``the view of \nvirtually every Republican.''\n  Tax cuts decrease tax revenue. This is not debatable. The entire \neconomic team from President Bush's White House will tell you so. Alan \nViard, former chief economist of President' Bush's Council of Economic \nAdvisers, has said, ``Federal revenue is lower today than it would have \nbeen without the tax cuts. There's really no dispute among economists \nabout that.'' And according to the Congressional Budget Office, roughly \nhalf the increase in our deficits since 2001 is due to those tax cuts. \nBy contrast, the unemployment extension would barely move the needle on \nour debt.\n  And what is the consequence of making these inaccurate arguments? It \nis millions of Americans dealing with tragedy on top of tragedy. Not \nonly have they lost the jobs that provided a decent living for \nthemselves and their families, but the benefits that could help them \nkeep food on the table and help clothe their children are held up by \npoliticians who fail to see that their justifications are fictional.\n  It is deeply frustrating and sad that so many of our colleagues do \nnot see the need to help these families. It is disappointing that they \njustify their obstruction with clearly false arguments. And it is \noutrageous that they would oppose even our ability vote on this \nmeasure.\n  Michigan families who need us to act should not have to wait 1 more \nday for the help they need. Voting to approve this cloture motion is \nthe only justifiable course.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \nvoting to extend the emergency unemployment compensation program \nthrough November 30, 2010. This vote is long overdue. While we have \nbeen debating the issue, families across the country dealing with long-\nterm unemployment have been suffering. While we have been arguing about \nthis extension, they have been struggling to survive. I am pleased that \nthis body has finally taken action to ease the burden they face.\n  Extension of the emergency unemployment compensation program provides \nadditional weeks of unemployment benefits to out-of-work Americans once \nregular State unemployment benefits have been exhausted. The number of \nweeks of benefit is determined by a State's unemployment rate.\n  The legislation also extends full Federal funding of the extended \nbenefits program. This program provides 13 to 20 weeks of benefits to \nunemployed workers who have exhausted regular and emergency \nunemployment compensation benefits in States with threshold \nunemployment rates.\n  Thanks in part to some of the actions of this Congress, including the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we are beginning to see some \nupturn in what is considered the most severe economic recession this \nNation has experienced since the Great Depression. The recovery, \nthough, is not a quick and easy process.\n  Even though job loss has slowed, unemployment remains high at 9.5 \npercent. This translates into 14.6 million unemployed Americans. \nFurther, an unprecedented number of Americans have been without jobs \nfor more than 6 months. The average length of unemployment is now \nstretching to 35 weeks. To put it simply, there are more job seekers \nthan jobs available. For every job, there are five applicants.\n  Americans want to work and are willing to work but until the job \nmarket improves, many rely on unemployment compensation to support \nthemselves and their families. That is why the passage of the extension \nof emergency unemployment insurance benefits is so crucial; many \nunemployed Americans quite literally can't survive without this \nsupport.\n  More than 19,000 Marylanders have lost their benefits due to the \ndelay in passing the legislation. The average benefit in Maryland is \n$312 a week. This isn't ``money in the bank.'' It is food on the table. \nIt is gas in the car. It is medicine and other necessities.\n  Unemployment checks contribute to the local economy as they are spent \nalmost immediately on basic goods. For Maryland, the delay in passing \nthe legislation dealt a 6 million dollar blow to the State's economy \neach week. Nationally, 2.5 million Americans have lost their benefits, \ncosting the economy approximately $775 million a week.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for standing up for American workers and \nfamilies. Workers like 57-year-old Cynthia Allen of Baltimore County, \nMD. Cynthia was laid off from her data management position in January \n2009. Outsourcing has made it difficult to find another job in that \nfield. So, here she is, 19 months later, savings expended, credit cards \nmaxed, and unemployment benefits exhausted. Until\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\nthis point, throughout her work history she had never drawn \nunemployment. Still, Cynthia perseveres. She continues her job search \nand she hopes something will open up for her soon. Our thoughts go out \nto Cynthia and to the millions of Americans who are struggling to \nsurvive in these difficult times.\n  It is time to finish the job of extending these desperately needed \nbenefits to people like Cynthia Allen.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our dear \ndeparted friend and colleague, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. I \nhave been deeply moved by the words of remembrance we have heard here \nin the Senate this week and I am honored to have been here today as \nSenator Byrd has lied in repose on the Senate floor. It is a fitting \ntribute to the man who, over the course of an astounding tenure of 52 \nyears, came to embody the Senate, its traditions, and its rules.\n  Robert Byrd was born in North Wilkesboro, NC, in 1917. He was \nvaledictorian of Mark Twain High School and, through the course of his \nlife, attended four separate colleges in West Virginia as well as the \nAmerican University College of Law. In the early days of his career, he \nwas, at one time or another, a grocery clerk, a butcher, and a shipyard \nwelder before beginning his political career in 1946, when he was \nelected to the West Virginia House of Delegates. After 5 years in the \nWest Virginia Legislature, he was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1952, beginning what would be the longest tenure in \nthe history of the U.S. Congress.\n  Senator Byrd came to the Senate in 1959. He served right up until his \ndeath on June 28 of this year. During his time on the Senate, he was \nknown for his skills as a parliamentarian and his knowledge of Senate \nrules and procedure. He put these abilities to great use, serving in \nthe Democratic leadership--as either the whip or the leader--for nearly \ntwo decades. Senator Byrd's ability to use the parliamentary rules to \nhis advantage is legendary. Indeed, I can think of few others who had \nsuch a great understanding of what can be an arduous and difficult set \nof rules and procedures.\n  His knowledge of the traditions and history of the Senate were also \nquite noteworthy. In 1989, the bicentennial anniversary of our \ncherished Constitution, Senator Byrd published a four-volume series on \nSenate history, which is a definitive work in describing and outlining \nthe storied traditions of this great Chamber. Senator Byrd's love of \nthis body was known to all. He expressed his love for the Senate at \nevery opportunity and much of his time was spent trying to preserve \nthose rules and traditions he held dear.\n  Mr. President, this Chamber has suffered a great loss. But, my \nsadness is tempered by the thought that Senator Byrd is now reunited \nwith his wife Erma, to whom he was married for nearly 70 years. I want \nto express my sincerest condolences to Senator Byrd's family.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I want to speak on the loss of the \ngreat statesman, orator, and author, Senator Robert Byrd. Senator Byrd \nserved the State of West Virginia and this great Nation in the Senate \nfor over 50 years. It has been an honor to serve and craft legislation \nwith Senator Byrd to protect and promote the values of our two States, \nwhich share a common border and economy. He represented his State well.\n  Following my election to the Senate, Senator Byrd offered me valuable \nadvice and direction on the operations and rules of the U.S. Senate. \nUpon learning of his passing, my wife Mary and I were deeply saddened \nby the news.\n  Starting from humble beginnings, Senator Byrd was a great example of \nthe virtue of hard work and determination. After losing his mother \nduring the influenza epidemic of 1918, Senator Byrd was sent to live \nwith his aunt and uncle in the coal-mining region of southern West \nVirginia. With a combination of his strong work ethic and quest for \nknowledge, Senator Byrd graduated as valedictorian of his high school \nclass. Despite his stellar academic achievements, Senator Byrd was \nunable to attend college following his high school commencement due to \nfinancial constraints.\n  At the age of 19, Senator Byrd married his high school sweetheart and \nlifetime soulmate Erma Ora James. In an effort to support his growing \nfamily, Senator Byrd took jobs, which included working as a gas station \nattendant and butcher, to put his family first.\n  After serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates and Senate, \nSenator Byrd was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and \nbegan serving in 1953. Unable to stop his quest for knowledge, Senator \nByrd began attending night classes at the American University's \nWashington College of Law where he received his degree a decade later.\n  Senator Byrd's love for this country and the Senate itself could be \nseen in many ways such as the copy of the U.S. Constitution tucked away \nin his jacket pocket and his vast knowledge of the rules of the Senate. \nAs he said to many of us, ``he who knows the rules will rule.''\n  He believed, as I do, in the power of the Senate. He understood that \nthe Senate should not be beholden to the executive branch, but must \nremain separate and equal to provide the necessary checks. As he \nstated, ``We must never, ever, tear down the only wall--the necessary \nfence--this Nation has against the excesses of the Executive Branch and \nthe resultant haste and tyranny of the majority.''\n  Even in his frustration of the current political climate and through \nhis remaining days, Senator Byrd continued to fight for the protection \nof the rules of the Senate and the rights of the minority, because as \nhe wrote, ``I know what it is to be Majority Leader, and wake up on a \nWednesday morning in November, and find yourself a Minority Leader.''\n  I extend my thoughts and prayers to his surviving children, \ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren. During this time of difficulty, \nthere is strength in knowing Senator Byrd has once again been reunited \nwith his sweetheart and the son he missed dearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6021-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6021-S6022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CYPRUS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the attention of my \ncolleagues to the legacy of the July 20, 1974, invasion of Cyprus by \nTurkey and its ongoing occupation of that island nation. Thirty-six \nyears later, the human dimension of the conflict and the artificial \ndivision of the country is evident in many areas. As Chairman of the \nHelsinki Commission, I am particularly mindful of the violations of \nhuman rights stemming from the occupation. I have walked along the \nU.N.-monitored buffer zone that cuts through the capital city of \nNicosia. A visitor to Cyprus need not look far to discover the scars \nleft by the artificial division of a capital and a country.\n  A year ago this week, the Helsinki Commission held a public briefing, \n``Cyprus' Religious Cultural Heritage in Peril,'' to draw attention to \nthis aspect of the legacy of the events of 1974. Experts at that \nbriefing documented the scope of the destruction of sites in the north, \nincluding Orthodox churches, chapels and monasteries as well as those \nof other Christian communities. According to Archbishop Chrysostomos \nII, leader of the Church of Cyprus, over 500 religious sites in the \narea have been seriously damaged or destroyed. Subsequent to the \nbriefing that Church of Cyprus filed a formal case with the European \nCourt of Human Rights regarding its religious sites and other property \nin the north. A report prepared by\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\nthe Law Library of Congress, ``Destruction of Cultural Property in the \nNorthern Part of Cyprus and Violations of International Law'' was \nreleased at the briefing.\n  Helsinki Commission staff traveled throughout the region, visiting \nnumerous churches, each in various stages of deterioration, all \nplundered, stripped of religious objects, including altars, iconostasis \nand icons. Other sites have been turned into tourist resorts, storage \nwarehouses or other purposes, including stables, shops, and night \nclubs. Among photos on display at the briefing were those showing the \ndesecrated ruins of graves with all of the crosses broken off of their \nbases and smashed. A nearby shed was stacked with broken headstones. A \nnumber of Jewish cemeteries in the region, according to reports, have \nlikewise been vandalized and left in shambles. Finally, even the rare \noccasions when Orthodox services that are allowed to be conducted in \nthe north such exceptional events are occasionally marred by security \nforces preventing worshipers from crossing into the area or the \ndisruption of religious services.\n  The Commission recently received an update from Dr. Charalampos \nChotzakoglou, one of the experts who testified at our 2009 briefing. He \nreports a number of disturbing developments over the past year, \nincluding road construction through a church yard; transport of grave \nmarkers robbed from desecrated cemeteries, reportedly to be recycled as \nscrap metal; the further looting of artifacts from churches; and the \nknown conversion of another church building into a night club. Dr. \nChotzakoglou also reports on the continued difficulties in securing \npermission to conduct religious services at some of the sites in the \nnorth.\n  The events of 1974 have taken a tremendous toll in so many areas, \nincluding Cyprus' rich religious cultural heritage. As we mark this \n36th anniversary, let us join in the hope that a resolution of the \nCyprus question hammered out, by the Cypriots and for the Cypriots, \nwill be found.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in remembrance of a deeply tragic \nanniversary for the Cypriot-American community, their friends and \nrelatives in Cyprus, and for people everywhere who believe in timeless \nvalues such as liberty and human dignity. Thirty-six years ago today, \nthe armed forces of Turkey invaded Cyprus in flagrant violation of \ninternational law, occupied the north of the island state, and put in \nplace a heavily armed force that continues to occupy nearly 37 percent \nof Cyprus' territory.\n  There are more than 43,000 Turkish troops on Cyprus--that is \napproximately one Turkish soldier for every two Turkish Cypriots. \nMeanwhile, the occupation, expropriation, and destruction of Greek \nCypriot-owned property in the north of the island continues unabated. \nIndeed, thousands of U.S. citizens of Cypriot descent have claims to \nsuch properties. So too continues the egregious desecration of Greek \nOrthodox churches and sacred religious artifacts that are not only \nsacred to hundreds of millions of faithful believers but beautiful and \nhistoric sites and objects of inherent cultural value to all of \nhumanity.\n  The international community, speaking through resolution after \nresolution by the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly, \nhas since 1974 called for an end to the division of Cyprus and the \nreturn of refugees to their homes. After 36 frustrating years of \ndiplomatic stops and starts, a cavalcade of U.N. special \nrepresentatives and envoys, and untold hours of negotiations, the time \nhas come for Turkey to concede that the Cyprus question is one that can \nonly be resolved through mutual agreement on a solution, not the \nimposition of one. It is essential for Turkey to contribute practically \nand substantively to the negotiating effort and embrace in concrete \nterms a reunified and prosperous Cyprus where Greek Cypriots and \nTurkish Cypriots can live together in peace.\n  Unfortunately, in a world that has witnessed the collapse of the \nBerlin Wall and the fall of communism, Cyprus remains as the last \ndivided country in Europe. Yet despite a generation of suffering such \ninjustices, the Greek Cypriot community continues to demonstrate \nremarkable magnanimity in seeking a fair solution to the division of \nthe island. Cyprus and the U.S. share a deep and abiding commitment to \nupholding the ideals of freedom, democracy, justice, human rights, and \nthe international rule of law. We must, in our solemn role as a nation \nthat champions human rights and adherence to the rule of law, stand \nwith the Cypriots to bring peace and stability to their island.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to join me today in bearing witness to \nthe 36 years of injustice wrongfully brought upon the people of the \nRepublic of Cyprus, and in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of \nfairly and finally reuniting the island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6022-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6022-S6023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter dated July 20, 2010, to Senator McConnell.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                    July 20, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding S. 3466, the \n     Environmental Crimes Enforcement Act. My concerns with this \n     bill include, but are not limited to, those outlined in this \n     letter.\n       Individuals and corporate entities who commit environmental \n     crimes must be held accountable for their actions. However, \n     while this bill is well-intentioned, I believe current law \n     provides sufficient penalties for environmental wrongdoers, \n     and I am concerned this bill goes too far in increasing \n     enforcement provisions by mandating restitution to victims of \n     environmental crimes.\n       This bill expands the list of crimes which require \n     mandatory restitution by adding environmental crimes covered \n     by the criminal enforcement provisions of the Clean Water \n     Act. Currently, the list of crimes subject to mandatory \n     restitution is limited to violent crimes, certain offenses \n     against property under the Controlled Substances Act, and \n     crimes relating to tampering with consumer products. No \n     environmental law is listed under the mandatory restitution \n     statute.\n       It is clear this bill is intended as a response to the \n     current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. However, it should \n     be noted there is already a basis for holding BP liable for \n     the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, if it is found to be \n     negligently or willfully responsible--the Oil Pollution Act \n     of 1990. The Oil Pollution Act allows for liability up to all \n     removal costs plus $75 million, and would eliminate any cap \n     whatsoever if the spill was a result of ``gross negligence or \n     willful misconduct'' or a ``violation of an applicable \n     Federal safety, construction, or operation regulation.''\n       There are also criminal penalties for violations of the \n     Clean Water Act. These penalties, which may be enforced for \n     negligent, knowing, and ``knowing endangerment'' violations, \n     include up to 3 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines \n     for each violation. Finally, according to Attorney General \n     Holder, BP may also face civil and criminal action under the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act.\n       If Congress feels these civil and criminal penalties are \n     insufficient, we should consider increasing them by amending \n     the relevant penalty provisions. Similarly, if Congress \n     believes mandatory restitution should be expanded into areas \n     beyond the limited crimes to which it currently applies, we \n     should address restitution as a whole, rather than singling \n     out certain issues or individual crimes. Legislation \n     expanding victim restitution has been introduced in the past, \n     and if Congress now believes expansion is appropriate it \n     should take the time to consider broad legislation on the \n     topic, rather than a specific, targeted response to a current \n     event.\n       Furthermore, I believe this bill is overly broad, as it \n     will criminalize ordinary Clean Water Act violations. For \n     example, this bill would create mandatory restitution as a \n     response to: a property owner who constructed feeder ditches \n     and discharged fill without a permit; a mining company that \n     discharged drainage into navigable creeks without a federal \n     permit; and coastal landowners who discharged sand and dirt \n     in their ditching activities without a permit. While these \n     actions are all violations of the Clean Water Act, I do not \n     believe they are intended to be brought under the mandatory \n     restitution statute. Nevertheless, as currently constructed, \n     this bill would indeed expose the violators to mandatory \n     restitution.\n       I am concerned the changes specified in this legislation \n     may be unnecessary, overly broad, and may contribute to the \n     over-criminalization of federal law. In addition, adding the \n     Clean Water Act to the mandatory restitution statute will \n     create increased liability, additional private rights of \n     action, and increased litigation. Finally, it does not appear \n     this bill is needed in order to prosecute legitimately liable \n     companies for violations of the Clean Water Act. \n     Nevertheless, this bill has been expedited through the \n     legislative process, with no hearings scheduled to explore \n     its need and little time allowed to properly evaluate the \n     consequences of the mandatory restitution provision.\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\n       In the end, I believe there are more appropriate responses \n     Congress should pursue if current penalties for environmental \n     wrongdoers are insufficient, and I believe expedited, \n     targeted legislation of this nature is likely to create \n     unintended consequences which outweigh any positive value it \n     may add to our environmental law matrix.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, NACWA, \non the occasion of its 40th anniversary. NACWA is a dynamic national \norganization, involved in all facets of water quality protection. As a \nkey stakeholder in the legislative, regulatory, and legal arenas, NACWA \nhas built credible collaborative relationships with Members of \nCongress, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal courts and \nother governmental bodies.\n  The emergence of NACWA as a nationally recognized leader in \nenvironmental policy and a sought-after technical resource on water \nquality and ecosystem protection issues has paralleled the maturation \nof one of the Nation's most successful environmental laws--the Clean \nWater Act. NACWA was established in 1970 by a group of individuals \nrepresenting 22 large municipal sewerage agencies to secure Federal \nfunding for municipal wastewater treatment and serve as a forum to \ndiscuss the emerging national interest in improving the quality of the \nNation's waters. Based upon the shared goal of effectively representing \nthe interests and priorities of public clean water agencies and the \ncommunities they serve, they formed NACWA.\n  Over the past 40 years, NACWA has expanded its member base and issue \nplatform. It has changed its name, replacing the word ``sewerage'' with \n``clean water'' to better reflect the end-product of its members' \ntreatment services--clean water. The organization also partners with \ndiverse stakeholders while always advocating for sound science in \nadvancing water quality protection. Today, as the leading clean water \nassociation, NACWA represents nearly 300 member organizations.\n  Recent years have reflected heightened involvement for the \nassociation in a broadening array of complex 21st century water quality \nissues, including green infrastructure, climate change, watershed-based \napproaches, and clean water funding and financing. As chairman of the \nSenate's Water and Wildlife Subcommittee, under the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, I am in a good position to observe that NACWA \nhas met the goal that its founders established 40 years ago. NACWA \ncontinues to pursue every opportunity to develop and implement sound \nwater quality policies that advance clean water and a healthy \nenvironment.\n  It is my sincere pleasure to congratulate NACWA on the occasion of \nits 40th anniversary. This committee has relied on NACWA's strategic \ninput for decades and will undoubtedly continue to do so as we shape \nthe course of environmental protection for our Nation's waters in the \ndecades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6023-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING SYL METZGER\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week I received notice from a \nNorth Dakota constituent about a funeral that was held on Friday. The \nfuneral was for Syl Metzger from Langdon, ND. Reading about the life of \nthis extraordinary man reminded me again about how much we owe to \npeople we seldom thank.\n  Syl Metzger was not a politician or a business executive or \ncelebrity. But he was a hero. He was one of what Tom Brokaw called the \n``greatest generation.'' He was one of those young Americans who seven \ndecades ago was called on by his country to put on a uniform, pick up a \nrifle, and wage the fight for freedom half way around the world.\n  Syl Metzger landed on the beaches of Normandy during the D-day \ninvasion. He fought in the campaign in northern Europe, including the \nBattle of the Bulge. The fights that he and his fellow soldiers waged \nhave become legendary.\n  Following the Second World War, all across our country those young \nsoldiers returned home and lived down the street, up the block, or out \non the farm, and seldom spoke of their experiences in World War II. \nThey became the members of the community who you could count on to do \nthings. They built homes, schools, and communities and became the glue \nthat made America work. Because they knew the horrors of war and the \npain of losing fellow soldiers in the battlefield, they perhaps more \nthan any other Americans treasured the freedoms that they had risked \ntheir lives to save.\n  Now with the passage of time those young soldiers have become older \nAmericans, in many cases reaching their ninth decade of life. Every day \nacross this country, friends and neighbors gather in the sanctuary of a \nlocal church to say goodbye to a relative or an old friend. In many \ncases, only then do they remember and celebrate the heroic commitment \nof service to our country by those American patriots.\n  It was Syl Metzger's son who informed me of his father's death. I had \nmet Syl Metzger only once last fall when he and a group of World War II \nveterans came to Washington, DC, on an Honor Flight to see the World \nWar II Memorial. So our lives touched only briefly. But when his son \nsent me the e-mail about his funeral, it reminded me again that he and \nhis fellow soldiers did things for our country that touched all of our \nlives. Yet we seldom understand the magnitude of their sacrifice and \nthe benefit of their courage that was a gift to all Americans.\n  God bless the memory of Syl Metzger and the rest of the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' America says thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6023-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6023-S6024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING FIRST SERGEANT NICK BACON\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life, \nservice, and memory of 1SG Nick Bacon, U.S. Army (Ret.). First Sergeant \nBacon, the last living Medal of Honor recipient from Arkansas, passed \naway July 17, 2010, at the age of 64. His life will be remembered not \njust for his heroic military service, which earned him the prestigious \nMedal of Honor, but also for his work on behalf of veterans in Arkansas \nand across this Nation.\n  Narrowly surviving a helicopter crash in his first tour of duty, then \nStaff Sergeant Bacon volunteered for a second tour of duty in Vietnam; \nthis time he was leading a squad with the 1st Platoon of B Company of \nthe 4th Battalion, 21st Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade, Americal \nDivision. On August 26, 1968, in an operation west of Tam Ky, Staff \nSergeant Bacon and Company B drew heavy resistance from enemy forces. \nIn the ensuing action, Bacon led two platoons in stifling the enemy \nassault, singlehandedly killing multiple enemy soldiers, destroying an \nantitank weapon, and directing fire on enemy positions as Company B \nrescued multiple soldiers trapped to the front.\n  Due to these brave actions, President Nixon awarded Bacon the Medal \nof Honor on November 24, 1969. The Medal of Honor is the highest \nmilitary decoration awarded by the U.S. Government. It is reserved for \nthose members of the United States Armed Forces who distinguish \nthemselves ``conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of \nhis or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an \naction against an enemy of the United States.'' That definition most \ncertainly fits the heroism that Nick Bacon, then a staff sergeant, took \nthe night of August 26, 1968.\n  Nicky Daniel Bacon was born November 25, 1945, in Caraway, AR. \nFollowing his family's move to Arizona, he joined the army to escape \nthe difficulties of farm labor. He forged his mother's signature so \nthat he could join the army at age 17. He served in the U.S. Army from \n1963 to 1984, retiring at the rank of first sergeant.\n  First Sergeant Bacon returned home to Arkansas in 1990, where he \ncontinued to seek opportunities to serve his community, particularly \nthe men and women of the U.S. military. He was appointed director of \nthe Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs in 1993 and was essential \nto the development of the Arkansas State Veterans Cemetery, the \nArkansas State Veterans Cemetery Beautification Foundation and the \nfounding of the Arkansas Veterans' Coalition.\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\n  In addition to his work on behalf of Arkansas veterans, First \nSergeant Bacon was a former president of the Congressional Medal of \nHonor Society. In 2004, he was appointed to serve on the Veterans' \nDisability Benefits Commission, which made more than 100 \nrecommendations to Congress on ways to improve veteran benefits.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the life and service \nof 1SG Nick Bacon. I join all Americans in lifting up his wife Tamera, \nhis children, and all his loved ones. First Sergeant Bacon was not only \na great Arkansan, but a great American, and I am humbled to express my \ngratitude for his life and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6024-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 4861.

Res. 586\n\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Egypt have \n     long shared a strong bilateral working relationship;\n       Whereas the people and the Government of Egypt play an \n     important role in global and regional politics, including \n     with respect to the Middle East peace process, as well as in \n     North and East Africa;\n       Whereas Egypt has been and continues to be an intellectual \n     and cultural center of the Arab world;\n       Whereas respect for democracy, human rights, and civil \n     liberties are fundamental principles of the United States and \n     critical to our national security objectives;\n       Whereas, in his June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, \n     President Barack Obama noted, ``[G]overnments that protect \n     [human] rights are ultimately more stable, successful and \n     secure. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go \n     away'';\n       Whereas the United States National Security Strategy, \n     released in May 2010, states, ``And we reject the notion that \n     lasting security and prosperity can be found by turning away \n     from universal rights--democracy does not merely represent \n     our better angels, it stands in opposition to aggression and \n     injustice, and our support for universal rights is both \n     fundamental to American leadership and a source of our \n     strength in the world.'';\n       Whereas the authorities in Egypt continue to harass, \n     intimidate, arbitrarily detain, and engage in violence \n     against peaceful demonstrators, journalists, human rights \n     activists, and bloggers;\n       Whereas, despite President Hosni Mubarak's pledge in 2005 \n     that Egypt's controversial emergency law would only be used \n     to fight terrorism and that he planned to abolish the state \n     of emergency and adopt new antiterrorism legislation as an \n     alternative, in May 2010 the Government of Egypt again \n     extended the emergency law, which has been in place \n     continuously since 1981, for another two years, giving police \n     broad powers of arrest and allowing indefinite detention \n     without charge;\n       Whereas in renewing the emergency law, the Government of \n     Egypt asserted that the law would be used only in drug and \n     terrorism cases and it would release all emergency law \n     detainees in other cases, a pledge it has made in the past \n     but failed to fulfill;\n       Whereas, in response to the emergency law extension, \n     Secretary Hillary Clinton released a statement noting, ``This \n     extension is regrettable given the pledge made by the \n     government to the Egyptian people in 2005. We are confident \n     that Egypt can draft and adopt effective counterterrorism \n     legislation that conforms to international standards for \n     civil liberties and due process. And the United States urges \n     Egypt to complete this legislation on an urgent basis and to \n     rescind the State of Emergency within the coming months.'';\n       Whereas opposition lawmakers and human rights and democracy \n     activists have protested the extended emergency law because \n     of concerns that it would continue to be used to silence \n     critics and stifle dissent;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2009 Human Rights Report \n     notes with respect to Egypt, ``The government's respect for \n     human rights remained poor, and serious abuses continued in \n     many areas. The government limited citizens' right to change \n     their government and continued a state of emergency that has \n     been in place almost continuously since 1967.'';\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch reports that ``[h]uman rights \n     violations in Egypt are widespread and routine, including \n     arbitrary detention, torture, and unfair trials before state \n     security and military courts . . . State Security \n     Intelligence (SSI), a bureau of the Ministry of Interior, \n     polices the political sphere and considers any exercise of \n     freedom of assembly a security threat, frequently beating and \n     arresting peaceful demonstrators'';\n       Whereas the independence of the judiciary in Egypt \n     continues to be undermined through exceptional parallel court \n     systems, executive administrative orders overriding judicial \n     decisions, and politically motivated lawsuits;\n       Whereas past elections in Egypt, including the June 2010 \n     elections to the Shura Council (the lower house of \n     parliament), have seen irregularities at polling and counting \n     stations, security force intimidation and coercion of voters, \n     and obstruction of peaceful political rallies and \n     demonstrations;\n       Whereas excessive use of force by security forces in Egypt \n     is occurring in violation of Egypt's obligations to protect \n     fundamental human rights and may undermine the country's \n     long-term stability;\n       Whereas political reform in Cairo would significantly \n     enhance the leadership of Egypt throughout the Middle East \n     and Africa and could help ensure constructive political \n     engagement in these regions for years to come; and\n       Whereas, in April 2010, a bipartisan ``Working Group on \n     Egypt'' wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Clinton, \n     ``[W]ith three sets of elections coming up over the next \n     eighteen months, Egypt now has the opportunity to energize a \n     process of political, economic, and social reform. If the \n     government responds to demands for responsible political \n     change, Egypt can face the future as a more democratic nation \n     with greater domestic and international support. If, on the \n     other hand, the opportunity for reform is missed, prospects \n     for stability and prosperity in Egypt will be in doubt.'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That, the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms that respect for basic human rights is a \n     fundamental value of the United States and that providing \n     unconditional support for governments that do not respect \n     those basic human rights undermines the credibility of the \n     United States and creates tensions, including in the Muslim \n     world, that can be exploited;\n       (2) recognizes that, while the Government of Egypt faces \n     legitimate security threats, genuine political reform in that \n     country will help to counter extremism while also solidifying \n     prospects for stability and prosperity;\n       (3) encourages the Government of Egypt to promptly honor \n     its commitment to permanently repeal the state of emergency, \n     which is a significant obstacle to consolidation of the rule \n     of law in Egypt;\n       (4) calls on the Government of Egypt--\n       (A) to take all steps necessary to ensure that upcoming \n     elections are free, fair, transparent, and credible, \n     including granting independent international and domestic \n     electoral observers unrestricted access to polling and \n     counting stations and instructing its security forces not to \n     engage in violence;\n       (B) to end all arbitrary detention, torture, and other \n     forms of harassment against media professionals, human rights \n     defenders and activists, and opposition figures, fully \n     respect freedom of expression and association, and release \n     all individuals detained for peaceful expression as well as \n     those detained under the emergency law for issues unrelated \n     to drug or terrorism allegations; and\n       (C) to lift legislative restrictions on freedoms of \n     assembly, association, and expression in advance of the 2010 \n     elections;\n       (5) urges the President and the Secretary of State--\n       (A) to make respect for basic human rights and democratic \n     freedoms a priority in the ongoing relationship and dialogue \n     between the Governments of the United States and Egypt, and \n     to focus on the importance of these issues, including free \n     and fair elections, during all bilateral meetings; and\n       (B) to broaden the engagement of the United States \n     Government with the people of Egypt and support efforts in \n     the country to help promote human rights and democratic \n     reform, including by providing appropriate funding to \n     international and domestic election observers, as well as to \n     civil society organizations for democracy and governance \n     activities;\n       (6) emphasizes the importance of ensuring and strengthening \n     the independence of the judiciary in Egypt; and\n       (7) recalls that pursuant to the laws of the United States, \n     organizations implementing United States assistance for \n     democracy and governance activities, and the specific nature \n     of that assistance, shall not be subject\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\n     to the prior approval of the Government of Egypt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6027-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 587--DESIGNATING AUGUST 26, 2010, AS ``MONTFORD POINT \n                             MARINES DAY''\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mr. Burris) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 587\n\n       Whereas on June 25, 1941, President Franklin D.

Mr. DODD (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 5297, to \ncreate the Small Business Lending Fund Program to direct the Secretary \nof the Treasury to make capital investments in eligible institutions in \norder to increase the availability of credit for small businesses, to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax incentives for \nsmall business job creation, and for other purposes; which was ordered \nto lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                      TITLE __--PAYCHECK FAIRNESS\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Paycheck Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Women have entered the workforce in record numbers over \n     the past 50 years.\n       (2) Despite the enactment of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, \n     many women continue to earn significantly lower pay than men \n     for equal work. These pay disparities exist in both the \n     private and governmental sectors. In many instances, the pay \n     disparities can only be due to continued intentional \n     discrimination or the lingering effects of past \n     discrimination.\n       (3) The existence of such pay disparities--\n       (A) depresses the wages of working families who rely on the \n     wages of all members of the family to make ends meet;\n       (B) undermines women's retirement security, which is often \n     based on earnings while in the workforce;\n       (C) prevents the optimum utilization of available labor \n     resources;\n       (D) has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and \n     the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the \n     workers of the several States;\n       (E) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce;\n       (F) constitutes an unfair method of competition in \n     commerce;\n       (G) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing \n     commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce;\n       (H) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods \n     in commerce; and\n       (I) in many instances, may deprive workers of equal \n     protection on the basis of sex in violation of the 5th and \n     14th amendments.\n       (4)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n     discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex \n     continue to exist decades after the enactment of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).\n       (B) These barriers have resulted, in significant part, \n     because the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not worked as Congress \n     originally intended.

If \nthat gives these people over here some feeling that 2.5 million people \ndeserve this, then let them do it. I hope we come in, in the morning, \nand get this thing done so this bill can go on to the House--the House \nhas to pass it--and then to the President. Every hour that is delayed \nis more misery for 2.5 million people.\n  The debate over whether it is paid for is over. It is clear; all \nexperts say this money that is spent will return to us--CBO says \ntwofold. John McCain's chief economic adviser says $1.61 will come back \nfor every $1 we spend. So if they think they are getting even--with \nwhom, 2.5 million people--because it passed?\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\n  So I hope we reach an agreement to yield back some of the postcloture \ntime so we can complete action on this bill at a reasonable time \ntomorrow.\n  Upon disposition of unemployment insurance legislation, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the small business jobs bill, which is \nalso a job-creating bill we would like to get to.\n  I want everyone to understand. The Republicans better be ready \ntomorrow to defend their position because we are going to have people \ncome during this 30 hours and show how ridiculous it is that we are \nhaving to wait for 30 hours. No amendments can be offered. Nothing can \nbe done during that 30 hours except speeches. So I alert my friends: \nCome and explain to the American people how this 30 hours has helped \nthe American people.\n  There will be rollcall votes possibly throughout the day tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/20/senate-section/article/S6038-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. REID.
