Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          New Health Care Law\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, ever since they passed their new \nhealth\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\ncare bill, Democrats promised to help small businesses offset some of \nthe costs of the new taxes and mandates it will impose.\n  Yet, according to an AP story this morning, that is looking like yet \nanother empty promise.\n  According to the story, a furniture supply store owner in \nSpringfield, IL, Zach Hoffman, was confident he qualified for the new \nsmall business tax credit. Yet buried in the new law's fine print was \nlanguage disqualifying his 24 employees from this needed help.\n  According to the law, Mr. Hoffman created too many jobs to get help, \nand he paid them too much, even though his average employees only made \n$35,000 a year.\n  Mr. Hoffman called this a bait and switch and noted that in order to \nget the most out of the new credit, he would have to cut his workforce \nto 10 employees and slash their wages.\n  ``That seems like a strange outcome,'' he said, ``given we've got 10 \npercent unemployment.''\n  Speaker Pelosi told Americans we had to pass the health care bill so \nwe could know what was in it. Now that Americans are learning what was \nburied in the fine print, they are rightly upset.\n  They see that small businesses are denied the help they were \npromised, while facing new job-killing taxes and government mandates. \nThey have learned that health care costs will go up, not down, as the \nadministration and Democrats in Congress promised.\n  Americans want this bill repealed and replaced with something that \nwill work for people such as Zach Hoffman and all the Nation's job \ncreators and small businesses.\n  Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Merkley second-degree amendment \nto the Brownback amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: What is before \nthe Senate at the present time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Merkley second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have been, for some time, trying to \nbring up an amendment that has been filed which deals with a kind of, \nsome might say, a little-known part of the insurance industry, called \nindexed annuities.\n  A little bit of background. Indexed annuities have been sold for some \ntime. They are an annuity that people would buy, and there is an upside \nlimit. In other words, if the S index goes up by, let's say, 500 \npercent, the holder of the annuity does not get all of that 500 \npercent; the insurance company gets a big portion of that. But in \nexchange for that, there is no downside risk. The holder of that \nannuity, if the S goes down 500 percent, doesn't lose anything if \nheld to its term. It has been a very valuable instrument for a lot of \npeople to have these indexed annuities.\n  During the recent recession of 2008 and 2009, no one lost any capital \nin any of their indexed annuities based on the stock market going down. \nThey lost nothing because they had that downside protection. That was \nnot true of other instruments, obviously. If you had a security, \nobviously, you lost a lot of money in the downturn of the stock market. \nOwners of the indexed annuities didn't lose any principal whatsoever \nwhen they held it to term. That is the value of these indexed \nannuities.\n  Two years ago in the waning days of the last administration, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission decided they wanted to have \njurisdiction over these. There had been some abuses by sellers of \nindexed annuities sold to individuals--mostly elderly individuals--when \nit was not the best investment for them. They were sold an annuity \ninstrument that was not in their best interest.\n  The SEC, under Chairman Cox, decided they were going to take \njurisdiction of this. They were going to have this within their \njurisdiction. It was a divided vote at the SEC as to whether they would \ndo this, but the vote was in favor, so the SEC pulled this under their \numbrella. The SEC was taken to court by certain companies. It went to \nthe district court and then it was appealed to the circuit court of \nappeals in the District of Columbia.\n  The circuit court of appeals decided this on July 21, 2009, not even \n1 year ago.\n  The circuit court said:\n\n       We hold that the Commission's consideration--\n\n  That is the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC--\n\n       We hold that the Commission's consideration of the effect \n     of Rule 151A--\n\n  That was the rule that would govern the indexed annuities over which \nthe SEC now wants to have jurisdiction, which they never had before.\n\n       We hold that the Commission's consideration of the effect \n     of Rule 151A on efficiency, competition, and capital \n     formation was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n  ``Arbitrary and capricious,'' held by the circuit court.\n  What did the circuit court say? They said: We remand this. Having \ndetermined that their analysis is lacking, ``we conclude that this \nmatter should be remanded to the SEC to address the deficiencies with \nits 2(b) analysis.''\n  It is back at the SEC. The SEC could at some point jiggle things \naround and decide, yes, now they have a better analysis and now they \nhave jurisdiction. They will be taken to court again, and this will go \non and on. In the meantime, the status of the companies selling indexed \nannuities, are in limbo.\n  Again, if someone says: We had some problems with this in the past, I \nunderstand that. But the insurance commissioners who have jurisdiction \nover insurance fix the problems. In fact, the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners, in a letter to Senator Dodd, the chairman of \nthe committee, dated April 30, basically points out what they have done \nto fix this problem.\n  The insurance commissioners said: Yes, there is a problem. Let's get \ntogether. Let's change the rules and regulations under which these are \nsold. And they did.\n  Some might say: Why shouldn't we give this to the SEC? Is the SEC the \nfinal and best word and the best protector of consumers, I ask you? Is \nthe SEC the best protector of consumers in this country when it comes \nto financial instruments? Ask Bernie Madoff's customers.\n  Did we say because of Bernie Madoff and all the money he cheated and \nstole from people--and he was under the jurisdiction of the SEC--we \nhave to take that jurisdiction away from the SEC now and give it to \nsomebody else? No. We said: SEC, change your policies and change your \nregulations so a Bernie Madoff cannot happen again. That is what we are \ndoing.\n  These indexed annuities have always been insurance products, governed \nby the insurance commissioners in each State and the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners. If there was a problem, it went \nto them. They addressed the problem. They fixed it. We have a new \nregulatory regime in which indexed annuities can be sold so the \nproblems that occurred in the past will not happen again. Will there be \nviolations? Yes, but now there are strong enforced regulatory rules in \nplace.\n  The SEC wants the oversight shared. But, two regulators in conflict \ncreate problems and considerable costs.\n  I am not one who says to protect the consumer against everything we \nhave to give it to the SEC. The SEC did a lousy job--a lousy job--in \nprotecting consumers who held securities. I mean stocks, securities. \nNot one person who had an indexed annuity lost one single dime in the \ndownturn in 2008, 2009. We cannot say that about Bernie Madoff's \naccounts, can we?\n  I have been trying to get my amendment up to basically say: Look, the \nSEC does not have jurisdiction right now over these insurance \ninstruments--that is what they principally are, insurance instruments. \nWe left insurance to the States. If the SEC is able to grab hold of \nthis kind of an instrument, what is to keep them from whole life? Now \nwe are going to take over whole life insurance policies, too, because \nwe have had problems in whole life policies, too and the value of their \ncash value can change with the markets, I say to my colleagues. \nInsurance\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\ncommissioners keep track of this, they strengthened their regulation. \nThey change their rules and regulations to cover these kinds of \nhappenings.\n  Unless we are to the point where we are saying we are going to have \nfederal regulation of insurance in America, if we are there, OK. I \nwould like to see that vote happen. This is one more overreaching by a \nFederal department to gain jurisdiction over an area of State \nregulation over which they have never had jurisdiction. SEC has never \nhad jurisdiction, and the circuit court said the analysis on which they \nreached their basis to grab this was ``arbitrary and capricious.''\n  I have an amendment, amendment No. 3920, at the desk. It has broad \ncosponsorship on both sides of the aisle--Democrats, Republicans, \nconservatives, liberals, up and down--to say, no, this ought to stay \nwith the insurance commissioners because it is, in its essence, an \ninsurance product.\n  The new rules that have been promulgated by the insurance \ncommissioners basically cover the problems that happened in the past. \nThe rules require certain amounts of liquidity and take into account \nthe age of the consumer. That was the problem in the past. They were \nselling these to people who were way too old who would not live long \nenough to get their annuities. They look at the tax status, the \nfinancial objectives of the consumer, and whether this is some kind of \nchurning policies. These are all new regulations instituted by the \ninsurance commissioners to answer a problem that came up because of, \nlet's face it, some agents out there who were taking advantage of \nelderly people.\n  There are always going to be some bad actors. I do not care if it is \nunder SEC or the insurance commissioners, there is always going to be \nsomeone trying to game the system. This has always been under the \ninsurance commissioners' jurisdictions. They have taken these steps.\n  We have a letter from the AARP saying they were opposed to my \namendment. I have a great deal of respect for the AARP. I do a lot of \nwork with them. More often than not, they do good things. But here is \nan article from the April 10, 2007, New York Times, titled ``Income for \nLife? Sounds Good, But Do Your Homework.''\n  It points out that AARP has teamed up with New York Life Insurance \nto--guess what--to sell annuities. I detect, I smell a little bit of a \nflavor of a conflict of interest.\n  Oh, the AARP does not want the indexed annuities sold out there. They \nwant the elderly to buy their annuities. I don't care. Fine. If they \nwant to be in the business of selling annuities, I don't care if AARP \ndoes that. But to send out a letter dated May 19 to the chairman of the \nBanking Committee talking about how bad my amendment is--did they say \nin their letter to the chairman of the committee, in all due candor, \nthe AARP has joined with New York Life Insurance to sell annuities? No, \nthey did not say that at all. So there is a little hint of a conflict \nof interest.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord two items: a letter from AARP dated May 19 to the Honorable \nChristopher Dodd; and immediately following that, an article from the \nNew York Times dated April 10, 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: AARP writes to strongly oppose Harkin \n     Amendment #3920, which would deprive investors in equity-\n     indexed annuities of needed protections provided by state and \n     federal securities laws.\n       These hybrid products combine elements of insurance and \n     securities, but they are sold primarily as investments, not \n     insurance, especially to people who are investing for their \n     own retirement. Growth in equity-indexed annuity value is \n     tied to one of several securities indexes (e.g. the S 500 \n     or the Dow Jones Industrial Average), and comparing and \n     choosing suitable products can be difficult for investors. \n     These products also come with high fees and have long \n     surrender periods, which may make them unsuitable as \n     investments for most seniors.\n       In the fall of 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     adopted a rule to regulate equity-indexed annuities as \n     securities (Rule 151A). The rule was later challenged, and \n     the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     upheld the legal foundation for the SEC's action.\n       Because seniors are a target audience for these products, \n     AARP submitted comments to the SEC supporting the rule, \n     stating it was important that Rule 151A supplement, not \n     supplant, state insurance law. In fact, the rule applies \n     specifically to annuities regulated under state insurance \n     law. AARP also submitted a joint amicus brief, along with the \n     North American Securities Administrators Association and \n     MetLife, supporting Rule 151A.\n       The Harkin amendment would overturn the SEC rule, which is \n     designed to provide disclosure, suitability, and sales \n     practice protections afforded by state and federal securities \n     laws. The amendment would preempt any further ability of the \n     SEC to regulate in this area. This not only deprives \n     investors of needed protections against widespread abusive \n     sales practices associated with these complex financial \n     products, it also sets a dangerous precedent. If this \n     amendment is adopted, the industry will be encouraged to \n     develop hybrid products in the future specifically designed \n     to evade a regulatory regime designed to protect consumers.\n       Regulating indexed annuities as securities is long overdue \n     and vitally important for our nation's investors saving for a \n     secure retirement.\n       The SEC's rule on indexed annuities accomplishes this goal \n     in a thoughtful and reasonable fashion, and it should be \n     allowed to take effect. AARP therefore opposes the Harkin \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 David Sloane,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Relations and Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 10, 2007]\n\n           Income for Life? Sounds Good, but Do Your Homework\n\n                           (By Jan M. Rosen)\n\n       What if I outlive my money? The fear of such a thing \n     happening haunts many older Americans. So when a reputable \n     company, New York Life Insurance, teams up with AARP to offer \n     an investment with the absolute promise of lifetime income, \n     it can sound like an answered prayer.\n       Indeed, the investment, an immediate annuity, may be ideal \n     for some retirees, but financial advisers say it is not for \n     everyone. Prospective buyers need to do some homework--\n     studying both their own finances and the annuities available \n     in comparison with other investments.\n       After all, an immediate annuity is an investment for the \n     rest of a person's life or a couple's lives, and it is not \n     easily liquidated if either personal circumstances or \n     financial markets change.\n       ``If you live beyond your life expectancy, you win,'' said \n     Avery E. Neumark, a partner in the New York accounting firm \n     Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company, who specializes in \n     retirement planning. ``If you die early, you lose and your \n     heirs lose.'' The reason is that annuities, like life \n     insurance, are based on pooling of risks and average life \n     expectancies. Three trends have converged to make immediate \n     annuities especially attractive to retirees: Americans' \n     increased longevity, the decline of traditional defined \n     benefit pension plans that make secure monthly payments, and \n     early--thus longer--retirements.\n       Larry C. Renfro, the president of AARP Financial, a \n     subsidiary of AARP Services, said, ``Mindful that they run \n     the risk of outliving their assets without ongoing income, \n     many AARP members have expressed interest in the potential of \n     annuities to help fill their income gap.''\n       According to the National Center for Health Statistics, an \n     American's life expectancy at birth is 77.8 years, up from \n     69.7 years in 1960. Those who live until age 65 will on \n     average live until age 83.7, up from 79.3 in 1960. As people \n     age, their life expectancies increase, so a 75-year-old today \n     can expect to live until age 86.9. Depending on their health, \n     family history and genetics, some people can expect to live \n     far longer than average.\n       In its basic form, an immediate annuity is bought with a \n     single upfront payment; for the AARP Lifetime Income Program, \n     that can be as little as $5,000. Then the annuity holder \n     receives monthly payments for life. The size of the payment \n     depends on how much money is invested, the investors' age and \n     sex and whether the annuity is for an individual or a couple.\n       Buyers may also choose optional features, including \n     inflation protection and a withdrawal benefit in an \n     emergency. There are also various payment choices; under one, \n     if the annuitant dies before receiving an amount equal to the \n     initial premium, a beneficiary receives the difference. When \n     optional features are added, the monthly payout is reduced.\n       A 65-year-old man who buys a $100,000 AARP-New York Life \n     annuity can expect payments of 6.5 to 8 percent a year, or \n     $542 to $667 a month, depending on the features chosen. At \n     age 75, the payout rate would be 7 to 10 percent.\n       ``Returns are very conservative, but you can sleep at night \n     knowing this much is coming in,'' Mr. Neumark said. ``It's \n     reliable income and provides an opportunity for flexibility \n     with your other investments. You can be in stocks with less \n     worry when you have that secure monthly income stream.''\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\n       Martha Priddy Patterson, a retirement expert and director \n     of Deloitte Consulting in Washington, said, ``In retirement \n     we would feel more secure and happy if we knew that every \n     month, X number of dollars will be rolling through the \n     door.'' But, she said, ``you wouldn't want to make that your \n     only investment,'' for several reasons.\n       It is always good to diversify investments, she said, \n     adding, ``Inflation is my No. 1 fear, so I would want some \n     TIPS,'' or Treasury inflation-protected securities. And, she \n     said, annuities are relatively illiquid; surrender or unwind \n     charges may be steep.\n       Among the other highly rated life insurance companies that \n     offer immediate annuities are AIG, Genworth, Hartford, \n     Integrity, John Hancock, Metropolitan, Mutual of Omaha, \n     Principal and Prudential.\n       Comparison shopping can be difficult ``because so many \n     bells and whistles are available,'' Ms. Patterson said, and \n     they are costly. ``Decide what you want and what your goals \n     are, and when you talk to sellers be firm about what you want \n     and resist the others,'' she added.\n       Kim Holland, the Oklahoma insurance commissioner, said, \n     ``There are certain benefits that you just can't get from \n     other products,'' notably the assurance of lifetime income \n     and a greater payout rate than would be available from \n     certificates of deposit or bonds at present. And income is \n     not taxed until it is paid out.\n       Still, Ms. Holland, who has waged an aggressive campaign to \n     root out and prosecute insurance fraud, said that ``seniors \n     are vulnerable--they are often targeted by scam artists.'' \n     She stressed the need to check the rating of the insurance \n     company issuing an annuity, the reputation of the individual \n     agent selling it and whether the annuity is appropriate for \n     the prospective buyer.\n       Two years ago, she enlisted AARP in a consumer education \n     campaign on annuities, warning of ``predatory sales practices \n     and the solicitation of unsuitable annuity products.'' In one \n     case, an agent sold a lifetime annuity to a 104-year-old man, \n     Ms. Holland said. and, in another, an agent brought cookies \n     to a woman and planted flowers in her garden to win her \n     confidence.\n       When approached by an agent, do not provide any \n     information, Ms. Holland said. Instead, if you are \n     interested, get the person's card and ``do your homework.'' \n     She added: ``Check with peers, friends, relatives, bankers, \n     your accountant. Don't respond to telephone solicitations or \n     ads for free seminars or dinners.''\n       ``New York Life is a very fine company, and AARP and New \n     York Life have very fine products,'' Ms. Holland said, ``but \n     that doesn't mean they are appropriate for every \n     individual.''\n       An immediate annuity can be right for people who need a \n     monthly income, just as they had when they were working, and \n     as their parents' generation had with payments from defined \n     benefit pensions, which only a fifth of Americans have today. \n     They also appeal to people who fear they lack the financial \n     expertise to make their savings last a lifetime.\n       On the other hand, the very rich do not need immediate \n     annuities, said Paul Pasteris, New York Life's senior vice \n     president in charge of retirement income. They could put \n     their capital into Treasury bonds and live on the income. \n     Studies have shown that it is safe to take about 4 percent a \n     year from a retirement portfolio, he said. But relatively few \n     people are in that position.\n       ``For the last 20 or 30 years, the financial services \n     sector has been telling people to save for retirement,'' Mr. \n     Pasteris said, but once people retire they ``face a new \n     discipline called retirement income planning.''\n       Immediate annuities can provide income and help people cope \n     financially with several risks.\n       ``The first risk is longevity,'' he said, ``the risk that \n     you could be in a pickle if you live too long.\n       ``The next is market risk. With a portfolio of stocks, \n     bonds and cash, what are the returns going to be? More than \n     just returns--the timing is critical.'' Suppose the market \n     tumbles just when a person retires. ``Losses early can have a \n     devastating effect,'' he said, because a shrunken portfolio \n     will not produce enough income. ``If a poor return period is \n     later, everything can be fine.''\n       Inflation is the third risk, and on annuities, inflation \n     protection is available as an option. ``Even if it is only 2 \n     or 3 percent, if you retire at 65 and live till 85, 90 or 95, \n     inflation could have a huge impact,'' Mr. Pasteris said.\n       Health problems are another risk. A comfortable monthly \n     income stream can ease those costs not covered by Medicare \n     and secondary insurance.\n       Overspending is a risk for some retirees who have been \n     looking forward to travel and the good life. ``Can you resist \n     the urge to dip into your nest egg and withdraw too much too \n     early?'' he asked. If not, putting the principal into an \n     immediate annuity and living on the cash flow will require \n     some financial discipline.\n       The median policy size is around $60,000, Mr. Pasteris \n     said, and about half the policies are bought through I.R.A.'s \n     or retirement plan rollovers, continuing the tax-deferment on \n     those plans until income is paid out. If an annuity is bought \n     with after-tax money, part of the payout is considered a \n     return of principal and is not taxed.\n       Mr. Pasteris said, ``We work with customers to figure their \n     basic income expenses--food, clothing, rent, medical.'' The \n     next step is to calculate how much will be met by pensions \n     and Social Security. If the amount is not enough, a lifetime \n     annuity can be purchased to make up the difference. ``With \n     the remainder of their savings, people can get more \n     aggressive if they want,'' he said.\n       His colleague, Michael Gallo, who is also a senior vice \n     president, said: ``We don't encourage people to be more \n     aggressive. In general it's better to be more conservative.''\n       Mr. Gallo added, ``We don't want people putting all their \n     money into this.'' The general recommendation is 25 to 50 \n     percent of assets available for investment, although more \n     could sometimes be appropriate. People should hold some cash \n     in more liquid investments for emergencies, he said, and they \n     may want to try a laddering approach, buying more annuities \n     as they age and costs rise.\n       Tim Kochis, the president of Kochis Fitz, a San Francisco \n     wealth management firm, would put far less into it. ``I would \n     devote no more than 10 percent at the outside,'' he said. \n     ``It is a function of risk tolerance, risk management--it can \n     be for someone who is very risk averse and would otherwise be \n     paralyzed.''\n       ``It's much better than a money market fund,'' Mr. Kochis \n     added, but he advises putting the bulk of a portfolio into \n     stocks. ``There's so much opportunity for long-term growth if \n     you can withstand the short-term volatility. That's the price \n     you pay for long-term performance, the price of entry. Most \n     people need to make a portfolio grow.''\n       Of course, they also need to sleep at night.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter dated April 30 from the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Association of Insurance Commissioners, The \n           Center for Insurance Policy and Research,\n                                    Washington, DC, Apr. 30, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: We are writing to convey the support of \n     the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) \n     for efforts to preserve state regulatory authority over \n     indexed annuities inherent in S. 1389, the Fixed Indexed \n     Annuities and Insurance Products Classification Act of 2009. \n     This legislation, which would nullify the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission's (SEC) Rule 151A and clarify the scope \n     of the exemption for annuities and insurance contracts from \n     federal regulation, will help ensure that consumers continue \n     to benefit from the vital consumer protections provided by \n     state insurance regulators.\n       The NAIC represents the chief insurance regulators from the \n     50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. \n     territories, whose primary objectives are to protect \n     consumers and promote healthy insurance markets. As \n     regulators vigilantly working towards these goals, we \n     strongly believe that this SEC rule is unnecessary and \n     distracts from important ongoing efforts at the NAIC and in \n     the states to address emerging issues concerning indexed \n     annuities.\n       Rule 151A ignores the fact that, at their core, indexed \n     annuities are insurance products that guarantee purchasers' \n     principal and a minimum rate of return. Though index \n     performance may reduce payments above the minimum rate of \n     return, the consumer still has a guaranteed benefit and the \n     fundamental risk lies with the company, not the consumer. For \n     this reason, indexed annuities are fundamentally insurance \n     products and should be regulated by state insurance \n     regulators who can approve annuities contracts before they \n     can be introduced to the market, monitor individuals involved \n     with the sales and marketing of the annuities, and regulate \n     the investments and financial strength of the issuing \n     company. We believe that the uncertainties and ambiguities \n     created by the new SEC regulatory scheme could greatly hinder \n     these rigorous consumer protections.\n       Additionally, Rule 151A will greatly constrain the product \n     distribution channel. Indexed annuities can be sold through \n     several distribution channels by companies, but under Rule \n     151 A indexed annuities would only be sold through one \n     distribution system--the broker dealer channel. Since fewer \n     people have a broker dealer connection, especially in the \n     less populated areas, whereas almost all have an insurance \n     representative, this product will become less available to \n     consumers.\n       Thank you for your efforts to ensure that states can \n     continue to protect consumers of annuities. We look forward \n     to working with you to enact this important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jane L. Cline,\n       West Virginia Insurance Commissioner, NAIC President.\n     Susan E. Voss,\n       Iowa Insurance Commissioner, NAIC President-Elect.\n     Kevin McCarty,\n       Florida Insurance Commissioner, NAIC Vice President.\n     Kim Holland,\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\n       Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner, NAIC Secretary-Treasurer.\n     Therese M. Vaughan, PhD,\n       NAIC Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, AARP does not come to this in a neutral \nposition, not a neutral position at all. They have their own annuities, \nbut they are not indexed annuities. With their product. When the \ndownturn comes, people can lose. People can lose money in annuities but \nnot in indexed annuities if held to term. They do not get the upside; \nthe insurance companies get that. But they are protected. If the market \ngoes down, they lose none of their annuity. That is exactly what \nhappened in the last downturn.\n  I would like to call up my amendment, but I guess I am precluded from \ndoing so. I was waiting for the ranking member to come back before I \nmade a request. I was waiting for the ranking member to come back \nbecause I had been discussing this with him. I know we are going out at \n10:30; is that right, Madam President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. At 10:40.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What time does the Senate reconvene?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. At 12 noon.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Has there been a consent agreement entered as to a \ncertain time for a vote on cloture?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, 2:30.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am going to ask unanimous consent to \ncall up my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and to \ncall up my amendment No. 3920.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. AKAKA. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent then to call up \nmy amendment No. 3920, with 20 minutes evenly divided, with a vote on \nthe amendment prior to the cloture vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. AKAKA. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the Senator from Hawaii objects to even \nhaving a vote on this amendment. I can see the Senator wanting to \nobject to the unanimous-consent request. I just asked unanimous consent \nto have a vote on the amendment, and the Senator from Hawaii objects to \neven having an up-or-down vote. I wish the Senator would explain why he \nis afraid to have an up-or-down vote. That is just what I asked for. \nIsn't that what the Senate is for, to try to vote on issues?\n  I want the record to show that only one person objected to having a \nvote on this amendment, and that is my friend from Hawaii--and he is my \nfriend--to say we cannot even have a vote. I did not hear any objection \nfrom the Republican side or anybody else. All I ask for is an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  Why does the Senator from Hawaii not even want an up-or-down vote on \nthis amendment?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, will my colleague and friend yield for 1 \nminute so I may make a couple of unanimous-consent requests?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4003, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the adoption of the Vitter-Pryor amendment No. 4003, as \nmodified, it be further modified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent--I am \nlooking at my friend from Arizona--that after the remarks of the \nSenator from Hawaii, the Senator from Arizona be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3920\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, amendment No. 3920 would prevent indexed \nannuities investors from benefiting from the strong protections \nprovided by Federal securities laws. That is the reason I am objecting.\n  Some consumers have been hurt, including some in Hawaii. Deceptive \nsales practices have been found to be used in these products. An \nindividual in Hawaii pushed equity indexed annuities to collect high \ncommissions at the expense of senior investors. Those investors least \nable to effectively evaluate financial products need these Federal \nprotections, without question, and they have been suffering.\n  I am not alone in my opposition to the amendment. As my friend from \nIowa mentioned, AARP is opposed. The Consumer Federation of America and \nthe North American Securities Administrators Association also oppose \nit.\n  This matter is under litigation and under review within the SEC \nrulemaking process.\n  Equity indexed annuities are financial products that combine aspects \nof insurance and securities but which are sold primarily as \ninvestments. These products must have the strong disclosure, \nsuitability, and sales practice standards provided within the context \nof our Nation's securities laws. The amendment would preclude State and \nFederal securities regulators from protecting investors from \ninappropriate and harmful products.\n\n  I am willing to work with my friend from Iowa to look into this \nmatter further. We need to have hearings to know more about the \nsituation before taking such a potentially precedent-setting action as \nthis amendment would. If this were to prevent securities regulation of \na product that clearly has characteristics of a security, we would \nencourage the development of financial products created to avoid the \nstronger protection standards.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, in the final hours of debate on this bill, \nI think we should be asking ourselves why we started the whole exercise \nin the first place. What is the purpose of financial regulatory reform? \nI wish to address that for a moment this morning.\n  Presumably, we all agree the purpose should have been to tackle the \nproblems that led to the financial crisis in the first place. That \nmeans serious reform must address root causes: most prominently, too \nbig to fail--ending that and reining in the two government-sponsored \nenterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that had a lot to do with \ncausing the problem in the first place. Amazingly, despite its size--\nand this is the legislation--and all of the hype that has attended it, \nthe bill before us fails to address these root causes.\n  Moreover, even though Main Street didn't cause the problem, the bill \nis so extensive in its regulatory reach, it creates new burdens on Main \nStreet while continuing the recent pattern--and one, by the way, \nAmericans are very fed up with--of using every crisis as an excuse to \ninvolve government in almost every sector and every aspect of American \nlife.\n  Republicans had hoped that once the bill came to the Senate, \nimprovements would be made and the final product would be less \npartisan. We offered amendments to improve the bill, but almost all of \nthese have been defeated. Along the way, Democratic amendments have \nbeen adopted that actually make the bill worse.\n  I hoped the bill would be amended to actually end taxpayer-financed \nbailouts and the concept that companies can be too big to fail and that \nit would protect small businesses from the regulatory burdens imposed \nby the bill and protect the rights of privacy for people's financial \ninformation. But that didn't happen, so we are left with a bill that \nenshrines into law failed policies of the past, imposes a massive new \nbureaucracy on small businesses that had nothing to do with creating \nthe financial crisis, and threatens jobs and our economic growth.\n  Today, let me address these three problems in a bit more detail--\nfirst, too big to fail. The very first amendment offered by the \nmajority purported to end too big to fail. While that sounds good, the \namendment that passed won't accomplish the goal. The amendment has the \neffect only of declaring the intent of Congress. It does not actually \nprohibit taxpayer funds from being used to assist banks, and that is \nwhy I voted against it. It expresses a sentiment, but it is not \nactually operative.\n  As I will discuss, provisions remain in this bill that enshrine \ntaxpayer bailouts forever, even after the removal of the $50 billion \nbailout fund. For instance, section 113 establishes a Financial \nStability Oversight Council. This section would give the Federal \nReserve the authority to prop up any nonbank financial company the \ncouncil deems to be a potential threat to systemic stability.\n  The council would designate certain firms as ``systematically \nsignificant.'' Market participants would obviously interpret this to \nmean too big to fail. Therefore, the designations would increase moral \nhazard and perpetuate the very problem we are trying to fix. So a new \ngovernment board based in Washington would decide which institutions \nget special treatment, giving unaccountable government officials \ntremendous authority to pick winners and losers, resulting in a \ncompetitive advantage for the winners.\n  What determines whether a nonbank financial institution is a threat \nto stability? Among other possible considerations, ``any other factors \nthat the Council deems appropriate,'' according to the bill. Such broad \nauthority would allow the council to protect and promote or to hamper \nfirms based on whatever it deems appropriate--``any other factors.''\n  Section 1155 of the bill, entitled ``Emergency Financial \nStabilization,'' also guarantees bailouts. Here, the FDIC would be \nallowed to create a new program of unlimited size to guarantee the \nobligations of depositories and holding companies with depositories. \nSince there is no requirement that a company that receives the \nguarantees and defaults on its obligations be taken into bankruptcy, \nthe FDIC and Treasury could prop up whatever company they choose.\n  So this bill does not end too big to fail. If we had truly wanted to \ndo that, we would have passed the Sessions amendment. This amendment \nwould have struck the entire liquidation authority section from the \nbill and replaced it with a bankruptcy process for nonbank financial \ninstitutions. It also would have prohibited bailout authority and made \nneeded adjustments so that a few provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \nto provide necessary flexibility to deal with the failure of large \nfinancial firms, such as Lehman Brothers, would work. In other words, \nit would have ended too big to fail.\n  The second area I mentioned was the government-sponsored enterprises. \nNo debate on too big to fail would be complete without a discussion of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are the two government-sponsored \nenterprises given the authority to acquire mortgages. It seems to me \nalmost unconscionable that this bill does not even attempt any reform \nof these two institutions given the fact they were a large part of the \ncreation of the problem. And it is not because Republicans haven't \ntried. We have. The reckless behavior of these two institutions--by the \nway, institutions that have come to epitomize too big to fail--has \nsurged through the entire commercial banking sector and our economy as \na whole.\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\n  Let's recall how central these two government-sponsored enterprises \nwere to the housing bubble and the ensuing collapse of that bubble. For \nyears, Fannie and Freddie backed mortgages that were issued to too many \npeople who could not really afford them. The two GSEs reaped enormous \nprofits, while recklessly taking advantage of the government's \nintrinsic guarantee of purchasing trillions of dollars' worth of these \nbad mortgages, including all those made to risky subprime borrowers. \nThis is the model that allowed Fannie and Freddie to inflate the \nsubprime mortgage bubble. But when the housing market collapsed, the \ntwo GSEs were left with billions of dollars of bad debt. And guess who \nis on the hook for those billions. The American taxpayers.\n  These two institutions had their own dedicated regulator--the Office \nof Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or OFHEO. Republicans tried to \ngive OFHEO more authority, Democrats objected, and so they allowed the \nsituation to spiral out of control. The easy credit fueled \nrapidly rising homes prices. As prices rose, so, too, did the demand \nfor even larger mortgages. So Fannie and Freddie looked for ways to \nmake even more mortgage credit available to borrowers with a \nquestionable ability to repay.\n\n  By 2008, the two GSEs had nearly $5 trillion in mortgages and \nmortgage-backed securities. They were overleveraged and too big to \nfail. It was a textbook example of moral hazard on a massive scale. I \nwarned about it repeatedly.\n  Today, they hold a combined $8.1 trillion of total outstanding debt. \nBecause the Federal Government has decided to cover this debt--by the \nway, even though there has never been a vote in the Congress to \nauthorize this--both of these entities have recently asked taxpayers \nfor billions more to cover their rapidly mounting losses. Recently, \nFreddie Mac announced it will need an additional taxpayer bailout of \n$10.6 billion, and that is after it lost $6.7 billion during the first \nquarter of this year. In 10 of the last 11 quarters, Freddie Mac has \nlost a total of $82 billion, which is twice the amount it earned over \nthe previous 30 years. Fannie, too, just recently asked taxpayers for \nmore money--$8.4 billion--to cover its soaring losses.\n  Since the Federal takeover of Fannie and Freddie, taxpayers have lost \n$145 billion propping them up--just two companies. And since the \nTreasury Secretary recently lifted the bailout cap, taxpayers are \nresponsible for unlimited losses at these institutions.\n  The Associated Press summed up the situation succinctly. It wrote \nlast week:\n\n       The rescue of Fannie Mae and sister company Freddie Mac is \n     turning out to be one of the most expensive after effects of \n     the financial meltdown.\n\n  So why not embrace real reform and relieve the taxpayers? We know \nsome of our friends on the other side believe we have an obligation to \ntrim Fannie's and Freddie's sails. Republicans offered three \namendments, all of which attracted bipartisan support--one each from \nSenators McCain, Crapo and Ensign--that would have done exactly that. \nBut they were all rejected by the majority.\n  The alternative side-by-side amendment that was adopted instead is \nmeaningless. Rather than rein in Fannie and Freddie, this amendment \nreally established that Congress will commission a study on \nconservatorship of the two GSEs from Treasury Secretary Timothy \nGeithner. As the Wall Street Journal asked in an editorial, if a study \nis so key to dealing with the GSEs, what has Mr. Geithner been doing in \nthe last 17 months since the crisis? Let's also remember that it was \nMr. Geithner's Treasury Department that lifted the $400 billion GSA \nbailout cap last Christmas Eve.\n  Let's be absolutely clear: Every day Fannie and Freddie remain in \ntheir current form is a day U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing their \nactivities. This bill does nothing to change the status quo, and I \nthink taxpayers deserve better.\n  The third area I wanted to mention is the so-called consumer \nprotection and its effect on small businesses--this Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection. Well, small businesses across my home State of \nArizona and, indeed, across the country are very worried about the \nintrusive new bureaucracy here intended for consumer protection. Of \ncourse, all of us support consumer protection. I don't know of anybody \nwho doesn't. The question is how you do it and to whom it applies.\n  We create a lot more cost to consumers if we make the regulation so \nexpensive and inefficient that consumers actually wind up paying more \nmoney than they would have otherwise. That is what has happened with \nthe credit card legislation we previously passed, and it could happen \nwith this legislation as well, thanks to a newly created Bureau of \nConsumer Financial Protection.\n  The bill establishes new restrictions on credit through so-called \nconsumer protection provisions by limiting or reconfiguring credit \noptions that are currently available to us. The bill gives the new \nbureau a budget of up to $650 million--an amount that is more than \ndouble what the FTC has requested for its economy-wide consumer \nprotection activities. This money is to be spent as the director of the \nBCFP wishes, with no oversight or veto authority by Congress or the \nadministration.\n  Moving regulatory authority for consumer protection to a new bureau \nwith broad powers would add to an already complex layer of regulation \nthese businesses are forced to navigate, creating uncertainty that \nwould likely make it more difficult to comply with existing \nregulations.\n  My staff and I regularly hear from constituents who are trying to \nfind ways to pay off their outstanding debts. I am concerned that \nduplicative regulation has the potential to have the unintended \nconsequence of making it more difficult for individuals and families to \nmanage their debts.\n  Moreover, the proposed consumer protections reach beyond credit \ncards, restricting the availability of all forms of credit. These \nreductions in credit also mean declines in job creation since many \nsmall business startups use things such as home equity debt and \nsometimes credit cards as their sources of funding. Obviously, this \nposes a serious threat to our economy.\n  A recent New York Post op-ed by Mark Calabria stated:\n\n       New restrictions on credit are likely to cost our economy \n     tens of thousands of jobs a year.\n\n  Of course, no one intends this result. No one wants to raise costs on \nsmall businesses. But that is the inevitable result of a policy that is \nwritten too broadly. That is one reason the Chamber of Commerce, for \nexample, opposes this bill.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that the Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection would be significantly different from the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Agency that was written into the House bill that \npassed last year. Well, I respectfully disagree. While the new bureau \nwould not be officially independent, it would effectively function as \nan independent, stand-alone agency with rule-writing powers and \nenforcement authority; whereas, the Consumer Financial Protection \nAgency would be responsible for its own financing, this Bureau of \nConsumer Financial Protection would enjoy an automatic funding stream \nfrom the Federal Reserve. Given the close similarities between the two \nproposed consumer units, it is constructive to consult a study released \nlast year by economists David Evans and Joshua Wright. After analyzing \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act, they concluded it would \n``most likely result in a significant reduction in the availability of \ncredit to consumers.''\n\n  ``A significant reduction in the availability of credit.'' Of course, \nthat is not what the authors intend, but that would be the probable \nresult.\n  In my view, the potentially serious costs of this Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau do not justify its purported benefits. We all want to \nshield consumers from real abuses and exploitation, but this is not the \nright way to do it.\n  As the National Review recently editorialized, ``To the extent that \nexisting consumer safeguards need strengthening, the task can be \naccomplished without launching a massive new bureaucracy that would \nnegatively affect credit access and economic growth.''\n  In conclusion, I hope my colleagues will ask themselves this \nquestion: Why is it that the CEOs of large companies such as Goldman \nSachs and Citigroup\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nfavor this bill? The reason is simple: The legislation would entrench \ntheir privileged status. It would institutionalize the idea that \ncertain big financial firms deserve preferential treatment by Federal \nregulators. These firms would be insulated from the negative effects of \nthe new consumer protection bureaucracy. However, that bureaucracy \nwould severely diminish credit access for small businesses and middle-\nclass Americans.\n  What we have before us is a bill that is supported by Wall Street but \nopposed by the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and many \nothers on Main Street.\n  For all these reasons that I have discussed and others, despite my \nstrong desire to enact prudent financial reform, I cannot support this \nlegislation. It does not effectively take on the fundamental problems \nthat we all agree needed to be addressed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I just left the address of President \nCalderon to the joint session of Congress in the House of \nRepresentatives. I think President Calderon's speech to Congress and to \nthe American people was important and timely and really touched some \nissues of controversy which we cannot ignore.\n  He acknowledged the fact that his country is being torn apart by drug \ngangs and drug cartels. He acknowledged the obvious: the object of \ntheir commerce is to sell drugs in the United States of America. Our \ninsatiable appetite for narcotics is creating a situation where people \nare engaged in lawlessness and violence and murder and mayhem in his \ncountry. We have to acknowledge that as the reality of the relationship \nbetween our two countries. It is not enough for us to lament the \nviolence in Mexico without equally being prepared to say we have to do \nsomething on our side of the border to deal with drugs moving into the \nUnited States and the market for those drugs in our cities and States.\n  He also raised the important issue about the firearms that are \nflowing from the United States of America into Mexico, into the hands \nof these lawless members of these drug cartels. In the last several \nyears, he told us, some 75,000 firearms have been confiscated. They \nbelieve 80 percent of them came from the United States, and many of \nthem were military-type weapons, assault weapons and the like. He \nsaid--and I am sure it was not welcome to all corners on Capitol Hill--\nthat we have to accept our responsibility when it comes to sensible gun \nsafety and sensible gun laws.\n  The Supreme Court has said that under the second amendment, \nindividuals are entitled to possess firearms for self-defense and for \nlegitimate and legal purposes. The President of Mexico doesn't question \nthat. I don't either. But the people who are buying and shipping guns \ninto Mexico from the United States are not engaged in the type of \nprotected constitutional activity the Supreme Court has noted. They \nhave gone way beyond that. They are using, unfortunately, an open \nsystem in the United States to feed a drug war in a country south of \nus. So what are the results of this drug war? Thousands of innocent \npeople are being killed. It is true that the gang violence back and \nforth results in the death of criminals on both sides, but innocent \npeople are being caught in this crossfire in Mexico as well.\n  I might also add that the lawless nature of the situation in the \nnorthern part of the border is forcing more people into migration into \nthe United States. It is not just the economics that drives people \nacross the border; it is also the fear that they have to continue to \nlive within communities and cities that are rife with violence.\n  I am glad the President of Mexico came forward to speak to these \nissues. We addressed them earlier this week in my Subcommittee on Human \nRights and the Law in the Senate Judiciary Committee. We had testimony \nfrom experts in the administration and outside the administration. It \nis obvious we need to do more to support Mexico, to try to do what we \ncan to end this violence and the root causes of it on both sides of the \nborder.\n  But there was one other issue the President of Mexico raised which \nneeds to be discussed honestly. Yesterday, the First Lady of the United \nStates visited an elementary school in a suburb of Washington with the \nFirst Lady of Mexico. Their purpose was to salute this school because \nof the physical activities that were available to the students and \ntheir commitment to a healthy lifestyle, which has been one of the real \ncauses the First Lady has espoused in her role.\n  Then she had a little meeting there. You probably saw it on \ntelevision. There were some small children around who asked questions, \nand one little girl said to the First Lady--she wanted to know why \nObama, the President, was taking everybody away who does not have \npapers. This first-grader asked that question, sitting in with about a \ndozen other schoolchildren. And, of course, the First Lady of Mexico \nwas sitting alongside our First Lady.\n  The First Lady, Michelle Obama, said: That is something we have to \nwork on, right, to make sure people can be here with the right kind of \npapers.\n  Then this first-grader, this six- or seven-year-old girl, said: But \nmy mom does not have any papers.\n  She blurted that out. I would say that was a telling moment for us in \nthe United States to pause and reflect on what we are engaged in and \nwhat we are refusing to do in Congress. Had this young girl, this \nfirst-grader, made that statement in the State of Arizona today, it is \nmy understanding their new law would have compelled an investigation of \nher family. What she said could create reasonable suspicion that \nsomeone in her family was here illegally. That innocent statement by \nthat first-grader could have launched an investigation and an arrest \nand deportation. Is that where we are in America today? Is that what we \nhave come to? I hope not.\n  I hope we accept our responsibility here in Congress. The President \nof Mexico invited us, challenged us--and he should--to do our job here \nto deal with comprehensive immigration reform. It is long overdue. We \nhave to deal with our border situation, with the workplace situation, \nand with the fact that there are millions of people here today \nundocumented. We have to decide what is a just outcome for their fate.\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\n  I listened to many of my colleagues say: Well, I will not talk about \nany comprehensive immigration reform until we seal the border. Seal the \nborder.\n  We should reflect on the obvious. The border between the United \nStates and Mexico is the longest international border in the world \nbetween two countries, almost 2,000 miles long. And across that border \nevery day, tens of thousands of people travel legally between the two \ncountries--in commerce, on vacation, moving from one place to another, \ntens of thousands each day. We estimate that 250 million people legally \ncross the border between the United States and Mexico every single \nyear. We also estimate that during the course of a year, 500,000 people \ncross that border illegally--250 million legally, 500,000 illegally.\n  I hope those who stand and say we have to seal the border are not \nsuggesting we end all commerce and all travel between the United States \nand Mexico. That would work a great hardship on both nations as we try \nto ship our goods and services to them for purchase, and they do the \nsame. The trade between the two countries is an important part of both \nof our economies.\n  But we do have to do what is reasonable and as complete as possible \nto deal with those borders, to make certain we reduce the flow of those \nwho are coming in illegally. To say we are going to seal them off to \nthe point where no one crosses illegally is perhaps to set a standard \nno one would ever be able to meet. I analogize it to saying that on I-\n95 near Washington, DC, we want to guarantee that no car or truck will \npass along that interstate today illegally carrying narcotics or \nfirearms. How would you enforce it? Could you stop all of the traffic? \nI assume that is one way to do it. But could you guarantee that each \ncar and truck is coming through legally should you do it?\n  So let's start with the premise that we need to have better \nenforcement at the borders. We need more people there even though we \nhave dramatically increased the agents who are working there. We need \nthe very best technology to stop the illegal flow of people or other \ngoods across that border. We need to have obstacles where they work but \nacknowledge that they are not the complete answer to the challenge. But \nlet's not stop the conversation by requiring that we have a perfect \nborder. There is not a perfect border in the world today. People get \nacross borders. Things cross borders. They may not do it legally.\n  Secondly, we need to move forward with enforcement in the workplace. \nI salute Senator Schumer from New York, who has been working on this \nissue for quite a long time now.\n  He has come up with the notion that there would be an identification \ncard associated with Social Security numbers so we would be able to \nestablish when a person goes for a job that that, in fact, is a valid \nSocial Security number belonging to a person with a certain name whom \nwe can identify perhaps by biometric identification as the person \nstanding before you. That would give employers peace of mind to know \nthey are not hiring someone who is here in undocumented or illegal \nstatus. It is an important step forward so we can make sure the \nworkplace is not an opportunity for those who come here illegally.\n  Finally, we have to deal with people who are here and do it in an \nhonest and humane way, making certain we don't allow anyone who is a \ndanger to America to remain but also say to those who have obeyed the \nlaws and are willing to pay taxes and fines that they will be given a \nchance--a chance.\n  The last point I wish to make goes to this particular instance that \nwas in the paper this morning involving the First Lady. Ten years ago I \ngot a call in my office in Chicago from a Korean American, a woman who \nwas a single mom who owned a dry cleaners. She had four children. Her \noldest daughter had come to the United States with her from Korea when \nshe was 1 or 2 years old. She was now 18 or 19 years of age and had \nbeen accepted to college. Her mom called because when she was filling \nout the application, there was a question about her daughter's \ncitizenship and nationality. She said she was not certain because they \nhad never filed any papers for her daughter, and they wanted to know \nwhat to do. They called Senator Durbin's office. So we checked into it \nwith the immigration service and were advised that the girl, 18 or 19 \nyears old, in the United States for 16 or 17 years, since she was a \nbaby was, in fact, here illegally. The immigration service said there \nwas only one recourse. She had to leave the United States and return to \nKorea for 10 years before she could be considered for legal status, 10 \nyears to a country she has never known. It was because of that \nsituation that I introduced the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act says if you were brought here to America as a child, if \nyou have lived in this country without a criminal record that would \ndisqualify you, if you graduate from high school, if you have no moral \nflaws that might disqualify you otherwise, you have an opportunity to \nreach legalization one of two ways: You may volunteer to serve in our \nmilitary or you may complete 2 years of college. I introduced that 10 \nyears ago because I thought it was reasonable. We are not a nation that \npenalizes children for the crimes of their parents. The tens of \nthousands of young people who have never known another country but the \nUnited States and only want to be part of our future deserve a chance. \nWe cannot, we should not, deport them.\n  When I think about what happened to the First Lady yesterday with the \n6-year-old girl, I wonder, 10 or 11 years from now, if she is still \nhere in the only country she has ever known, if she came here perhaps \nin undocumented status, what will happen to her? I have met many like \nher, many who have completed high school, college, graduate school, and \nbeyond. They have nowhere to go. They have no country. Their talents \ncannot be used to make this a better nation in and of itself. They \ncould be our next nurse, teacher, doctor, engineer, business leader. \nThey don't have a chance.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider cosponsoring the DREAM Act. We can \nsave the big debate for comprehensive immigration reform. I support it. \nBut I hope they will believe and join me in this one part of it to say \nthat we won't penalize the children for this contentious, divisive \npolitical debate on immigration. Before the end of the year, I want us \nto take up comprehensive immigration reform. I thank Senator Schumer \nand others who have included the DREAM Act in the bill. I hope we can \nmove forward. I think the experience of the First Lady yesterday is an \nindication that immigration is an issue whose time has come.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4064\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to speak about an amendment I \nhope is noncontroversial and one that creates jobs. When one of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle is present, I will make a \nunanimous consent request, but I will start off by speaking on the \namendment.\n  Amendment No. 4064 would create more than 40,000 new jobs. It would \nhelp revitalize Main Street in some of the economically hardest hit \ncommunities all around the country and at no cost to the taxpayer. We \nhave been talking a lot about the financial crisis and how to prevent \nthe next one. That is obviously important. It is essential work. But \nwhat we cannot lose sight of is the devastating impact this crisis has \nhad on small businesses and economic development in local neighborhoods \nand communities.\n  I, like many in this Chamber, watched in frustration as the ranks of \nthe unemployed rose to 15 million people and the unemployment rate \nincreased to nearly 10 percent. I, like many of you, have watched in \nfrustration as small businesses shut their doors, unable to get the \ncredit they needed to keep the lights on.\n  The problem is the big banks--the same banks that took billions upon \nbillions of dollars in TARP funds--are not making loans to small \nbusinesses. According to a just-released report by the Congressional \nOversight Panel, Wall Street's largest banks reduced their small \nbusiness loan portfolios between\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\n2008 and 2009 by more than double the overall drop in lending.\n  Let me read you the conclusion of that report. It says:\n\n       Small business credit remains severely constricted. Unable \n     to find credit, many small businesses have had to shut their \n     doors, and some of the survivors are still struggling to find \n     adequate financing.\n\n  So despite all of our efforts to restore liquidity in banks, they \nrefuse to hold up their end of the bargain and are not lending to small \nbusinesses.\n  We know small businesses are the engines of growth. More than 99 \npercent of American businesses employ 500 or fewer employees, and \ntogether these companies employ half of the private workforce and \ncreate 2 of every 3 new jobs. So the question throughout the recession \nhas always been, How can small businesses get the credit they need not \nonly to keep the lights on but to grow and create jobs, to get the \neconomy humming again?\n  Today, we are showing signs of improvement. We have stopped job \nlosses, from three-quarters of a million jobs, to over 260,000 jobs \ncreated last month. The economy is recovering, but there are still \nmillions of people who do not have work--people who expect us to do \nsomething to help them.\n  I believe this bill we are passing is essential to an economic \nrecovery. In making our banking system more secure and stable, we are \ndirecting banks to focus on the core business of lending and extending \ncredit, rather than the reckless casino speculation that brought us to \nthis recession.\n  But we can also do something that is more direct and more immediate \nto help jump-start more job growth. We can invest directly in small \nbusinesses and local communities by supporting community development \nfinancial institutions or, as they are called, CDFIs. Based on what we \nknow about this community from its historic performance, the amendment \nI am proposing will create approximately 40,000 new jobs by authorizing \nthe government to guarantee bonds issued by qualified CDFIs for \ncommunity and economic development loans. And best of all, there are no \npay-go implications.\n  As their name implies, the primary mission of community development \nfinancial institutions is to foster economic and community development \nin underserved areas. They have a proven track record of job creation \nand are arguably the most effective way to infuse capital in \nunderserved areas for community and economic development.\n  CDFIs leverage public and private dollars to support economic \ndevelopment projects, such as job-training clinics and startup loans \nfor small businesses in areas full of potential but desperate for \ndevelopment. CDFIs have been hit hard by the recession because they \nhave had to rely on big banks for capital. As we have seen, that \ncapital is neither affordable nor accessible.\n  I am proud to have bipartisan support on this amendment. Senator \nSnowe is a cosponsor, as are Senators Johnson, Leahy, and Schumer, and \nI want to say to all of our cosponsors, we thank you for your support.\n  The idea is simple: If big banks do not care about lending to small \nbusinesses and communities in need of capital, then we should empower \nthe very organizations that do care, that make it their mission every \nday to rebuild Main Streets across this country, and that are ready and \nwilling to do even more if they only had the resources and tools to \nmeet the growing demand.\n  So I ask all of us in this Chamber, do we want to go home to our \nStates and tell the folks on Main Street that, no, we did not think \nthey deserved the loan guarantees--that would not cost taxpayers a \ndollar but would create more than 40,000 new jobs? I certainly do not \nthink so.\n  We have talked a lot about protecting Main Street from Wall Street \nhere in the last few weeks, but we have not talked about doing anything \ndirectly to benefit Main Street. Here is our chance. Again, we know the \nbig banks have dried up their lending to small businesses. We know \nsmall businesses are the engine of economic growth.\n  I am proposing an amendment that would not wait around for the big \nbanks to start lending again while Main Street businesses continue to \nstruggle to meet payroll. I am proposing an amendment that would give \nour communities the guarantees they need to get lending started again \nto put money into our engines of job growth--and all without any pay-go \nimplications, without any cost to the Federal taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \namendment and to help small businesses create jobs on Main Street. I \nappreciate that Senator Snowe, Senator Johnson, and others--Senator \nSchumer--have joined us on this effort.\n  Madam President, seeing the distinguished ranking member of the \nBanking Committee is now on the floor, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 4064, which is \nthe CDFI amendment, and ask unanimous consent for a vote on this \namendment prior to the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I regret that my dear friend and \ncolleague from Alabama has the need to object. This is an opportunity, \nwith a bipartisan amendment, to help Main Street and small businesses; \nan opportunity to create 40,000 jobs; an opportunity to do it without \ncost to the taxpayers; an opportunity to do it with organizations, \nCDFIs, that have a proven track record; an opportunity to lend to Main \nStreet because big banks are not doing it.\n  We all lament the lack of job growth. We all lament the lack of \naccess to capital. This would be a tremendous opportunity to do that. \nSo I do hope I can work with Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby to get \nthis in order prior to the cloture vote or hopefully, if we do not \nachieve that, to be able to get this in any managers' amendment. It is \nbipartisan. It creates jobs. It does not cost the taxpayers any money. \nI do not know how much more you can come to the floor and offer an \namendment that should have bipartisan support than an effort like that.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to offer amendment No. 3902, my amendment with Senator Snowe, to \ncreate an Office of the Homeowner Advocate to help prevent mistaken \nhome foreclosures, and that it be voted upon at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I am truly disappointed that my \ncolleague would object to an amendment such as this one. This amendment \ndoes not contain any new appropriations or authorization of \nappropriations. But, more importantly, it is about helping people who \nhave worked their whole lives to own homes but now are at risk of \nlosing them, often through absolutely no fault of their own.\n  When I last spoke about this on the Senate floor, I told my \ncolleagues about a woman named Tecora, a homeowner from south \nMinneapolis. Tecora now owes $317,000 on a $288,000 loan due to an \nexotic mortgage called an option ARM--or option adjustable rate \nmortgage--that made her monthly payments double.\n  Tecora has not missed a mortgage payment, but unless something \nchanges, she is going to lose her home. She had been looking forward to \nretirement, but now she looks at her future with a sense of dread. \n``I'm squeaking by,'' she told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, ``by the \nplaque on my teeth.''\n  It shouldn't have to be this way. President Obama created a program \nknown as HAMP to encourage mortgage servicers to modify people's loans \nand help keep homeowners in their homes. But this program, while a good \nstart, has been plagued by mistakes. Tecora's mortgage servicer told \nher\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\nthat her file is closed because she voluntarily left HAMP, but she \nnever did. In other words, the servicer made a mistake. Now she is \nfighting to get her mortgage modified so she can afford to keep her \nhouse.\n  The amendment Senator Snowe and I are proposing would set up a \ntemporary--temporary--homeowner advocate within the Treasury Department \nto fix problems with HAMP. This amendment is supported by the Treasury \nDepartment. The White House declared it 1 of the top 10 amendments that \nwould improve the Wall Street reform bill. Also, it is supported by \nconsumer groups from around the country, ranging from Americans for \nFinancial Reform to Consumers Unions, SEIU, and the National Council of \nLa Raza. It is also supported by the superintendent of the New York \nState banking system who called it a ``big step forward for \nhomeowners.''\n  When you boil it down, this amendment is about one thing: making sure \nhomeowners know someone has their backs. The amendment would establish \na temporary office that homeowners can call when they are having \nproblems with HAMP. Homeowners need to know someone is looking out for \nthem, someone with the authority to actually fix the problems. People \nshould not be losing their homes just because the mortgage servicers \nlose their paperwork or misunderstand eligibility for HAMP.\n  When homeowners call in with a concern, this new office has two \nimportant powers. First, it could make sure servicers obey the rules of \nthe program or suffer the consequences. But at least as important, it \nmakes sure people's homes don't get sold right away, giving the \nhomeowner advocate time to resolve the problem. People's homes are \nbeing lost to mistakes--let me repeat that. People's homes are being \nlost to mistakes every day in Minnesota, in Nevada, in South Carolina, \nin Georgia. We need a homeowner advocate to stop these mistakes before \nit is too late for these homeowners.\n  The homeowner advocate is modeled after the Office of the Taxpayer \nAdvocate. That office has been extremely successful, looking out for \ntaxpayers when the system fails them. The Homeowner Advocate's Office, \nwhile temporary, would do exactly the same.\n  As I mentioned before, this amendment does not authorize any \nadditional appropriations. It would be funded by existing HAMP \nadministrative funds.\n  I am glad this amendment is a bipartisan effort, and I am sorry to \nhear the objection from my colleague. I hope we can work together to \nfigure something out. I think we have been doing a lot of that during \nthis whole process, and I certainly respect the ranking member for the \nwork he has been doing in that regard.\n  I wish to end with this: Protecting homeowners isn't left or right. \nIt isn't liberal or conservative. It is just the right thing to do. It \nis the smart thing to do.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I wanted to discuss very briefly an \namendment that I have filed with respect to the independence of \ncompensation consultants.\n  As we all know, executive compensation has been a significant issue \nin this country. Much of executive compensation is set on the advice of \ncompensation consultants. I had an interesting meeting earlier this \nyear with the Obama administration's ``pay czar,'' he is called, and he \nsaid when he was in the process of trying to work out how he should try \nto restructure executive compensation, he tried to find an independent \ncompensation consultant to advise him. He found he could not find a \nsingle compensation consultant in the country who met his standards for \nindependence.\n  This amendment would ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nset standards for independence for compensation consultants, so that \nwhen, consistent with this legislation, the compensation committee of a \nboard has to evaluate which compensation consultant to hire, they get \nan independent seal of approval from the SEC, and they can know they \nare doing the right thing; and, of course, we can assure that we have \nindependent compensation consultants and not people who get paid in \norder to encourage higher salaries for CEOs in our country.\n  I had a brief discussion about this with the chairman. He expressed \nsome interest in it. I understand we will be continuing to work \ntogether to try to get this language incorporated into the final bill. \nI expressed my appreciation to him for his consideration. I believe it \nmatches the language on the House side, so maybe it is something we can \ndo in conference. But, clearly, this question of compensation is an \narea where the chairman has been a leader, and I look forward to \nworking with him.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, in response to my colleague, I thank him. \nHe was been very active in the debate on this bill. I am grateful for \nhis thoughts and ideas. This is a very important proposal--one that we \nhave not adopted. It is in the House bill. I told my friend I would be \nanxious to pursue the idea he has incorporated because, obviously, this \nis subject matter that has probably evoked more public interest almost \nmore than any other aspect of the crisis over the last 2 years. \nObviously, people have lost homes and jobs and retirement income and \nthe economic damage done to the country; but people seemed to \nunderstand this issue from the very beginning more than almost anything \nelse, particularly in light of the fact that taxpayers were writing the \ncheck of $700 billion to stabilize, we are told, and preserve many of \nthese institutions.\n  What was degrading to many people is, in the midst of all that, we \nwatched some executives take excessive bonuses who could only receive \nthem because the American taxpayer stabilized and preserved those \ncompanies as a result of that legislation.\n  What also bothered me beyond that, I might have thought at some \nparticular point the executives might have expressed their appreciation \nto the American taxpayers for stabilizing and saving some of these \ninstitutions. They not only didn't do that, in most instances they went \nout and took significant bonuses that were only available because the \ncompanies had been saved by the American taxpayer. So this issue is one \nthat I think had more to do with inflaming public passions about what \nhappened almost more than anything else I can think of.\n  Our colleague from Rhode Island has crafted a proposal that would go \nto deal with this issue. I applaud him for that. I hope we can work \nsomething out that will meet his concerns.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the American people have accused \nWashington and this Chamber of being far too partisan, and they have \nbeen right. But I would venture to guess that we can reach a bipartisan \nagreement on the fact that our economy has taken a major hit over the \nlast few years--a hit that I would argue we have yet to recover from. \nSo here we are, debating another massive bill that is supposed to stave \noff another economic disaster. But does it do that?\n  I am sure that most here are familiar with the children's tale of the \nboy who cried wolf far too often. The problem faced by this character \nwas that when there was an emergency--such as the wolf verging on \nattack--there wasn't anyone around to take that alarm seriously. This \nis the path we are heading down.\n  The Senate is passing a massive bill, after many other massive bills \nthat we have passed, and expanding the Federal Government to an \nunsustainable level, all in the name of avoiding another economic \ndownturn. But what we are doing here is setting our country up on a \ncourse that we cannot correct and creating unintended consequences that \nmay ultimately rain more economic damage down on the American people.\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\n  I think it is important to remind the American people why the \ngovernment felt it necessary to use taxpayer dollars to bail out the \nGSEs--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They did this because they claimed \nthe two companies were too big to fail. The idea that the failure of \ntwo mortgage companies could bring down the whole U.S. economy was \nfrightening to many, but confusing to many more. Make no mistake about \nit, this was a problem the Congress created.\n  Beginning in the 1990s, Congress decided to expand the goals of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act by writing laws designed to encourage the \nGSEs--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--to meet certain affordable housing \ngoals, giving Fannie and Freddie government permission to buy subprime \nhome loans. This of course created an incentive for lenders to make \nmore and more bad loans since the GSEs would stand ready to buy them \nand take on the risk.\n  We now know, however, that it is the American taxpayer who actually \nwas taking on this risk. Before September 2008, few Americans realized \nthat Fannie and Freddie had taken over the subprime markets and were \nsinglehandedly making the dream of home ownership a reality for \nthousands of Americans. However, those Americans were realistically \nunable to afford the mortgages Fannie and Freddie guaranteed. As home \nafter home and neighborhood after neighborhood fell victim to the home \nforeclosure plague, Fannie and Freddie's losses started to greatly \nimpact the U.S. economy--hence the notion of being too big to fail.\n  I have spent the last 2 years arguing that the government's \ninterference in the situation with a taxpayer bailout was not the right \nmove to make. By stepping in, blank taxpayer check in hand, the \ngovernment set the American people up for bailout after bailout of \nFannie and Freddie, with no plan in place to reform these government-\nsponsored companies so that taxpayer support would eventually end.\n  Last Christmas, the Obama administration lifted its $400 billion--\n$400 billion--limit to aid Fannie and Freddie. They took the cap off. \nThey pledged unlimited support through 2012. This is unlimited support \nfor Fannie and Freddie. Imagine what that means. We don't have the \nfunds to provide that kind of support, and the American people should \nnot be on the hook for an indefinite blank check.\n  In this last month, while we were debating this bill on the floor, \nFannie Mae asked for another $8.4 billion from the taxpayer and Freddie \nhas asked for an additional $10.6 billion from the taxpayer. Is the \nAmerican taxpayer to assume we will continue to fund the demands for \nmore and more money every single time they ask? What if this happens to \nbe a monthly request for the next 2 years? The American taxpayer right \nnow has no choice but to pay up. Simply put, I believe this is \nridiculous.\n  Fannie and Freddie are referred to as government-sponsored entities \nbecause the wallets of the American people go straight into the bank \naccounts of these companies. The purpose of this financial reform bill \nbefore us should be to protect taxpayers against this concept known as \ntoo big to fail, but unfortunately it does little to address this \nissue.\n  I offered an amendment to address the too-big-to-fail issue with \nFannie and Freddie. However, it was defeated, mostly along party lines. \nMy amendment would have protected the taxpayers from future bailouts of \nFannie and Freddie by restricting their size so they do not continue to \nbe too big to fail. Fannie and Freddie remain large enough to threaten \nthe stability of our economy in another economic downturn. My amendment \nwould have limited their size to less than 3 percent of our GDP. Again, \nthe amendment was defeated, mostly along party lines.\n  If the government is arguing we have to continue bailouts of Fannie \nand Freddie because they are too big to fail, shouldn't we be doing \nsomething to fix the internal problems of Fannie and Freddie? Senator \nMcCain and Senator Shelby introduced an amendment to protect the \ntaxpayers from Fannie and Freddie and their too-big-to-fail state, but \nonce again their amendment was also defeated along party lines.\n  Their amendment, of which I was a cosponsor, would have meaningfully \nreformed these government-sponsored entities in an orderly fashion. It \nwould have ended the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie within 3 \nyears, would have provided more oversight to the companies, and would \nhave eventually eliminated all government subsidies to Fannie and \nFreddie. This amendment was a thoughtful, clear-eyed approach to \ndealing with the two companies that drove my State of Nevada and our \ncountry into the housing foreclosure crisis. But again, this amendment \nwas defeated along party lines.\n  Instead of seeking meaningful reform of Fannie and Freddie through \nthe financial reform bill, those on the other side of the aisle have \ndecided they will study the issue of Fannie and Freddie. They have \nasked the Treasury Department to make recommendations on these \ncompanies in 2011. In simple terms, this means we have punted dealing \nwith the risk of Fannie and Freddie, the risk they pose to our economy \nfor another year and, undoubtedly, more blank checks are on the way to \nFannie and Freddie.\n  By the time the Democrats and the Treasury Department have further \nevaluated their risk, 30 months--2\\1/2\\ years--will have come and gone, \nwith taxpayers holding up these two companies with their hard-earned \nmoney. I believe that is unacceptable and, frankly, it is \nunconscionable to ask the hard-working taxpayers of this country to \nfoot the bill for hundreds of billions of dollars of bailouts when \nCongress and the administration cannot even come up with a plan for \nFannie and Freddie within 2\\1/2\\ years of taking them over.\n  Additionally, the bill before us creates this new Financial Stability \nOversight Council that will have the authority to vote on which \ncompanies are, in their opinion, too big to fail. As we saw during the \nheight of the financial crisis, the government, given the opportunity, \nis willing to arbitrarily select which companies can get government \nsupport and sponsorship. I believe this sets a dangerous precedent that \nwill encourage large companies to take more unnecessary risk, since \nthey will ultimately pass any losses associated with that risk on to \nthe taxpayers in the form of a bailout.\n  Under the bill before us, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, \nunder the guise of monitoring systemic risk to the financial system, \nwill have the unintended consequences of encouraging more taxpayer \nbailouts. This is because the council has the authority to identify \nfirms that would ``pose a threat to the financial stability of the \nUnited States,'' and would place those firms under the Federal \nReserve's supervision.\n  The benefit of being placed on this exclusive list is that it comes \nwith a market understanding that the U.S. Government stands ready to \nkeep the company afloat when it gets in trouble. It means that company \nwill have certain advantages over its competitors, including access to \ncheaper funds from the Fed. This will consolidate the market and enable \nthe company to use the savings to take bigger and unnecessary risks. A \nregulatory structure that facilitates this kind of moral hazard does \nnot work.\n\n  Remember the boy who cried wolf I was rehashing earlier? Well, the \nwolf came when confronted with the collapse of Fannie and Freddie and \nthe government rushed in, no plan in hand, to bail out these companies. \nNow we are sitting around debating legislation that does not even \naddress the risks they will pose in another economic downturn. We have \nto ask the question: Do we honestly think we are protecting ourselves \nfrom another too-big-to-fail bailout of Fannie and Freddie?\n  This bill should have been our chance to protect the taxpayer and \nreform Fannie and Freddie, but we are ignoring this issue altogether \nand the systemic risk that follows with it.\n  More simply put: We are ignoring the American people. The next time \nthe government cries wolf and steps in to bail out Fannie and Freddie \nagain, the American people are going to be up in arms, as they should \nbe.\n  We are ignoring the American people at a time when they have joined \ntogether across this country to shout from every rooftop, mountaintop, \nand platform they can find that they are done with bailouts. \nUnfortunately, Washington isn't listening. People in this body believe \nwe know better than\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nthe American people; and if the American people would just sit back and \nlet us do our jobs, we will figure all this out. Is that the reality? \nWhen Washington is in charge of something, we undoubtedly make a larger \nmess than what there was to begin with.\n  Some of us just don't get it. Some don't get that the taxpayer should \nnot be on the hook for bailing out the financial industry when there is \na proper course of action for companies that are struggling to pay \ntheir debts--it is called bankruptcy. Wouldn't you agree that if the \nbankruptcy process is good enough for Main Street it should be good \nenough for Wall Street?\n  When the automakers were struggling with an economic downturn, I \nargued they should utilize the orderly bankruptcy process to \nreorganize. But the government thought it knew better and decided to \nbail them out. The government then decided who the winners and losers \nwould be in that process instead of following the rule of law.\n  The same has happened with the financial industry. Instead of \ndeclaring bankruptcy, the financial giants waited for the government to \nstep in and lend them an American taxpayer hand. The executives who \ndrove these companies into the ground when the bailout came are those \nsame executives who later received huge bonuses. Does this make sense \nto anybody? Moving forward, this needs to end. But this bill does not \ndo that.\n  Under this bill, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--the \nFDIC--would have expanded authority to take over, manage, and liquidate \ntroubled financial companies. The FDIC would take over the assets and \noperate the financial company with all of the powers of management, \nshareholders. In that way, the government acting through the FDIC, will \ncontinue to determine financial companies continue and which do not.\n\n  This bill would essentially institutionalize the kinds of bailouts \nthat have occurred in the recent crisis. Rather than providing an \nalternative to policy of bailouts, it would permanently establish such \na policy. Second, the expanded resolution authority would be operated \nwith a considerable degree of discretion about when to start the \nintervention and about the priority to give different creditors.\n  People talk about the impact of Lehman Brothers' sudden collapse on \nsparking a market panic, and the authors of this bill seem to think \nthat the answer is to create a system to prop up future banks. It was \nnot the collapse, but rather the surprise involvement and then \nabandonment by the government, that created market turmoil.\n  Do you understand why one bank might be bailed, but another would be \nleft to collapse?\n  It was all done behind closed doors. The better lesson learned from \nthe crisis is that we need a predictable, rule-based bankruptcy process \nrather than an expanded discretionary resolution authority.\n  These bailouts do not incentivize these institutions to minimize \ntheir risk, instead they go as far as to privatize their profits while \nsocializing their losses. In other words, putting that risk onto the \ntaxpayer.\n  Senator Sessions introduced an amendment, that I cosponsored, to \noffer hard-working American families a reprieve from footing another \nfinancial sector bailout, while also discouraging these companies from \ncontinuing the irresponsible practices that got them into trouble in \nthe first place. Again, this amendment was defeated along party lines.\n  The amendment would have made these companies utilize an enhanced \nbankruptcy process to ensure that the costs are covered by the \nfinancial institutions and their creditors, not the taxpayer.\n  Additionally it would have created a new chapter 14 in the Bankruptcy \nCode that would utilize many of the tenets of chapter 11 bankruptcy, \nbut would be for the specific use of these financial institutions. This \naddition to the Bankruptcy Code would have created a new pathway to \nlimit the cascading spread of risk and panic through the financial \nsystem and assured the more orderly winddown of financial \ninstitutions--insulated from bailouts and political influence.\n  The Sessions amendment would have delivered much-needed transparency, \naccountability, stability, and due process through the use of \nbankruptcy courts. Further, to protect taxpayers, it specifically \ndenied the Federal Government the authority to take over firms, dictate \nthe terms of their reorganization or liquidation and support them with \nFederal bailouts. It protected the taxpayer.\n  The amendment guaranteed real reform that would have resulted in real \nstability. Unfortunately, the Democrats decided to go in a different \ndirection, one that moves away from protecting the taxpayers, and \nswiftly defeated this bankruptcy amendment. So, what does this mean for \nthe average American?\n  It means that this financial reform bill does not end ``too big to \nfail'' and ensures more taxpayer bailouts with the next financial \ncrisis.\n  In fact, this legislation goes as far as to create unnecessary and \nburdensome regulatory requirements that will ultimately hurt small \nbusinesses. Nowhere is this clearer than the creation of the new \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  This new government bureaucracy will have the authority to write and \nenforce rules that could ultimately tighten the availability of credit \nand discourage business investment at a time when we can least afford \nit. I am deeply concerned about the jurisdictional reach of this new \nagency.\n  I was pleased that the Senate adopted my amendment last night that \nwould exempt from the new agency all sellers of nonfinancial goods that \ngive customers the option of making installment payments.\n  At a time when the economy has taken its toll on many American \nfamilies, it is vital that businesses are not discouraged from offering \ntheir customers flexible payment options. This is classic overreach by \nWashington, and I am glad that my colleagues narrowed the scope of the \nagency so that we don't further stunt our country's economic growth.\n  However, my amendment fixes but one problem with the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. This new bureau has no oversight and has \naccess to billions of dollars. We have seen too often bureaucracies \ngrow and grow normally; that's simply what bureaucracies do.\n  Can you imagine what this monstrosity with no size restriction and no \noversight can become?\n  So, I ask you, do you feel like we are really reforming this \nfinancial industry with this legislation?\n  The purpose of my speech today was to highlight all that is wrong \nwith this bill for the American people, but I ran into a problem when \ndoing this because what's wrong with the bill is literally every single \nline in the bill. I point out the issues of Fannie and Freddie, \nbailouts versus bankruptcy, because had those amendments been offered \nto this legislation, they would have been the sole examples of what is \nright with this financial reform bill; but they were not adopted and \nwere defeated along party lines.\n  The American people are tired and frankly, so am I. I am tired of \nstanding up to speak about real reform, all the while, watching as my \ncolleagues pass massive pieces of legislation through this body as \nsolutions looking for a problem, while continuing to ignore that we \nhave real problems that need real solutions.\n  This financial reform bill does nothing to address real reform of the \nfinancial industry, but it does ensure that the taxpayers guarantee the \nbad debt of Fannie and Freddie and Wall Street, just as these companies \nguaranteed bad debt that eventually brought them to their knees.\n  At the rate we are going, this will become our reality. The economic \nissues plaguing Greece aren't just a scary thing to watch unfold on TV, \nit is the future of our country, the great United States of America, if \nwe don't start shaping up.\n  Rushing legislation through Congress and into law doesn't mean that \nwe are addressing pressing issues, it means that we are passing time \nand passing unintended consequences on the taxpayers' dime. We are \npassing time that we do not have, using money that we do not have, and \ndoing so in a country that can not afford another bailout or another \ncollapse of another ``too big to fail'' company.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       In Praise of Stuart Levey\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I rise today to speak once more about our Nation's great \nFederal employees.\n  The United States and our allies are engaged in an ongoing effort to \ndisrupt and dismantle terrorist groups overseas. Every day, our troops \nact with great courage and commitment to take the fight to al-Qaida and \nits allies. Complementing their efforts are public servants who target \nindividuals providing financial backing and other forms of support to \nterrorists overseas.\n  One of the key government officials leading that effort here in \nWashington is a great Federal employee at the Treasury Department.\n  Stuart Levey has served as the Under Secretary of the Treasury for \nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence since 2004. Appointed to the \nposition by President Bush, he was asked to continue after President \nObama took office as a testament to his effectiveness and unique \nabilities. Stuart has done an outstanding job cutting off the flow of \nmoney to terror groups and their sponsors, and support for his efforts \ncrosses political divides.\n  Today, one of the leading state-sponsors of terrorism is Iran. While \nan array of unilateral and multilateral sanctions remain in place with \nregard to Iran, many foreign businesses, banks, and other entities do \nbusiness with Iran, which helps the Iranian government finance its \nnuclear program and terrorist activities.\n  In 2006, Stuart adopted a new tactic to deal with this problem. \nInstead of focusing solely on government action, he began exploring \nopportunities for cooperation with the private sector and urging \nprivate sector institutions to take action.\n  In this regard, Stuart led an effort to convince foreign banks to \ncease conducting business with Iran until that country agreed to comply \nwith international banking standards. By showing companies and banks \nthat doing business in Iran has financial and diplomatic repercussions, \nhe has convinced corporations to cut off business with Iran. All of \nthis was done in addition to the more traditional strategies of adding \nIranian banks to the U.S. terrorist list and imposing more stringent \nregulations on American financial institutions.\n  As Stuart's efforts took off, banks throughout the world--including \nin China and Muslim-majority countries--began cutting financial ties \nwith Iran. Energy companies have been persuaded to avoid initiating \ndeals to extract Iranian oil and gas, and such action has had far-\nreaching financial implications.\n  Our multilateral efforts against terrorism and nuclear \nnonproliferation have also been strengthened by Stuart's work.\n  At the Treasury Department, Stuart oversees the Office of Terrorist \nFinance and Financial Crime, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, \nthe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl, and the Treasury Executive Office of Asset Forfeiture. In his \nleadership of these offices, Stuart has shaped a new role for the \nTreasury Department as a key player in national security matters and \ndecisions, ranging from Iran to North Korea.\n  Before coming to the Treasury Department, Stuart served as Principal \nAssociate Deputy Attorney General at the Justice Department. There, he \ncoordinated a number of the department's counterterrorism activities. \nHe worked for several years in private practice before entering public \nservice in 2001, and he holds undergraduate and law degrees from \nHarvard University.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Stuart Levy for his \nachievements and wish him continued success in his efforts, which are \nongoing. He and his colleagues working at the Treasury Department on \ncounterterrorism and financial intelligence are deserving of both \npraise and recognition for all they do to keep Americans safe and to \nsecure American interests, both domestically and abroad.\n  They are all truly great Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Reverse Mortgages\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, there are many issues that are pending \non this bill that we are currently considering; unfortunately, many of \nthem that we will not get to. But I did want to take a minute to sound \nthe alarm about a very important topic that is, in all likelihood, not \ngoing to get addressed but something that everyone needs to be aware of \nbecause it is a subprime mess in the making. That is the area of \nreverse mortgages.\n  You cannot turn on TV these days without seeing an advertisement from \nsomeone about an important government benefit that you should take \nadvantage of, get cash out of your home now and participate in a \nreverse mortgage.\n  Senator Kohl has been great to work with on the Committee on Aging. \nWe had an oversight hearing on reverse mortgages. In fact, we conducted \none of them in St. Louis. These are tricky financial vehicles.\n  Keep in mind to whom these are being marketed. They are being \nmarketed to seniors. So seniors are being told: Enter into a reverse \nmortgage and you can get all of the money out of your house, and you \nnever have to worry about paying it back and everything is great.\n  The problem is, they are very expensive and not everyone is well \nsuited for a reverse mortgage. In some instances, a reverse mortgage \nmight be appropriate. But, frankly, they are certainly not appropriate \nif someone is selling you a reserve mortgage when you are 80 years old \nand turns around and sells you an annuity in the same sales pitch.\n  Believe it or not, we had testimony from families saying that is \nexactly what had happened to them. There is not enough consumer \nprotection in the area of reverse mortgages.\n  Here is the other shoe that is going to drop. Unlike the subprime \nmess which occurred because people were selling mortgages to people who \nwere not suited for them, and they were trying to sell them because \nthey had no skin in the game, they did not care if they were ever paid \nback, they were making money by selling the mortgages and had no risk \nif the loans were not paid back. Guess what. Same thing. The people \nselling these mortgages have no risk. Now, in the subprime mess, the \nrisk was transferred to all of these financial institutions that sliced \nand diced these mortgages and securitized them and sold them short, \nsold them long.\n  Guess who takes the risk in a reverse mortgage, every stinking dime. \nThe Federal Government, which is shorthand for the taxpayers of this \ngreat country. So if someone does a phony appraisal on a reverse \nmortgage and says the property is worth more than it is, and they get \nthe money out of there or if property values were to drop again in 15 \nor 20 years when these mortgages came due, guess what happens. The \nFederal Government and the Federal taxpayers get left holding the bag \nfor every darn dime.\n  Clearly, this is a problem. The amendment I had was going to address \nsome of the deficiencies in this area as it relates to consumer \nprotection and would put in a suitability standard.\n  Here is the other scary part about this cautionary tale. They have \nstarted securitizing reverse mortgages. Securitizing is the process \nthat we saw in subprime where they gathered all of those subprime \nmortgages together and said: OK, let's slice them all up, and we will \ndo it at levels. This top level is not very risky, and we will slap a \nAAA on that. Then we will slap another AAA on the second tranche, and \nmaybe down here at the bottom we will get a AA.\n  Then the different tranches will pay different rates. Guess what is \nhappening now to reverse mortgages because that market has dried up \nbecause\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\nof the subprime mess. All of a sudden we are seeing an explosion in the \nsecuritization of reverse mortgages.\n  In the security market for these mortgages, in the past year, the \nsecurity market for reverse mortgages went--in 1 year--from $1.5 \nbillion to $13 billion--in the last 12 months. In 1 year. That gives \nyou some indication of what is happening.\n  I know we may not be the brightest lights in the marquis sometimes \naround here, and I know sometimes we may not get it. But, goodness \ngracious, that ought to set off some alarm bells somewhere. So I urge \nmy colleagues to take a look at the reverse mortgage problem.\n  I urge them to convey to their seniors in their States, through the \nsenior centers and other ways that you can communicate with your \nconstituents, to be careful of reverse mortgages. They are very \nexpensive.\n  I did not really make a true confession, and I probably ought to do \nthat. There is a reason this place likes reverse mortgages. We are busy \ntrying to find pay-fors in our budget. We are busy trying to find ways \nto pay for things. Well, guess who gets a cut of the initial fees on a \nreverse mortgage. The Federal Government.\n  So one part of this place loves the idea that more reverse mortgages \nare occurring. In fact, we took the cap off how many could occur for \nthis year because we can count that money and spend it in the \nappropriations process, just hoping that maybe we are not around when \nwe have to pay the piper at the end of the rainbow when perhaps the \nvalue of that home is not sufficient when sold to pay off the loan.\n  So I am disappointed it appears that we are not going to get to this \namendment. I will continue to work on this issue. I urge my colleagues \nto continue to work on this issue. I will say this: If this body tries \nto lift the cap--the cap will go back on in September--if this body \ntries to lift the cap and allow unlimited reverse mortgages out there \nthis year, under the guise of, oh, we need to be doing this because it \nhelps the economy, or it is going to help the--no. No. No. No. I say \nno.\n  We need to go back to a cap on reverse mortgages so we have a firm \nhandle on what potential liabilities down the road could be to the \ntaxpayers of the country for this program.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, British Petroleum has just \nannounced that it has conceded that the amount of oil gushing from the \nfloor of the Gulf of Mexico is much more than what they admitted \nseveral weeks ago. You will recall that they first said it was gushing \nabout 1,000 barrels a day. They then revised that up to 5,000 barrels a \nday.\n  All along they refused the entreaties of Senator Boxer and me to \nrelease the video that is being done by the little remote submersibles \nthat are down there in two places: at the wellhead where the broken \npipe is partially broken, at the wellhead 5,000 feet below the surface, \nand at the other end of that pipe that used to go up to the surface \nwith the rig that sank but is now lying on the floor of the ocean. At \nthe end of that pipe called the riser is where additional oil is coming \nout.\n  I am happy to tell you Senator Boxer and I just announced that we now \nhave gotten BP to release the live feed of those remote submersibles, \nand we should be able to go on any number of sites and see this live--\nthose two places: at the wellhead and at the end of the riser pipe.\n  When you look at it, what you should note is--and why BP has now \npublicly admitted, and AP just moved the story--that they concede the \namount gushing out is much more than 5,000 barrels a day. That is \nobvious when you see the live feed.\n  Now, in addition, they released to Senator Boxer and me--and I want \nto hear from her in just a second. What they released was 9 hours of \narchival value tape of this video.\n  What we found in there is the part where they are injecting the \ndispersant into the gushing oil. There is a picture of that we have put \non my Web site, and what is astounding is that dispersant in this \nphotograph is so much, is it any wonder, then, at midnight last night \nthe Environmental Protection Agency ordered the stoppage of the use of \nthis dispersant, as it is harmful to the environment?\n  What we have is a gusher that is out of control. Remember, this has \nbeen gushing now for a month. They say it is going to be at least \nanother 2 months before the relief well gets there with which they can \nstop it. If it does gush for another 2 months, it is going to cover up \nthe Gulf of Mexico. And we already know it is in the Loop Current on \nthe way to the Florida Keys.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Certainly. And I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, the chairman of the Environment Committee, for her \nleadership in getting the truth out.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Florida. He represents a State \nthat relies on a beautiful coastline, beautiful ocean, the ability for \nthe fishermen to earn their living, the ability of the tourism industry \nto thrive, the jobs that are related in both of our States.\n  I see Senator Cantwell and Senator Feinstein in the Chamber. The six \nSenators from the west coast came together in an unusual press \nconference, an unusual moment to say: We don't want to put our \ncoastlines at risk. We can't afford to do it, let alone our moral \nresponsibility to future generations.\n  What we are seeing here are the limits of the technology. I know the \nSenator saw the words BP wrote on the permit application when they \nwanted to move forward with this exploratory well. They said the \nchances of a spill were remote. But even if there would be a spill, \nthey said the technology was up to the task. After the spill, the first \nthing they said was: We have never had experience in cleaning up a \nspill in this deep water.\n  Doesn't this strike my friend as something the Justice Department \nought to look at, which several of us on the Environment Committee have \nasked for? Did they, in fact, tell the truth on their permit \napplication or did they not? I ask my friend to respond to that.\n  One more thing--and I thank the Senator from Florida so much. We are \na good, strong team. It is a good east coast-west coast team. When we \nlooked at that riser, the technique that is kind of a straw that they \nsay is siphoning off the oil, they claimed it was taking out 1,000 \nbarrels a day. Then they said 2,000 barrels a day. Now they say it is \n3,000 barrels a day. Remember, they told us it was 5,000 in total that \nwas being spilled. Now they are claiming 3,000. When we looked at \nthat--and now the American people can look at this--didn't you see what \nI saw? It is a fraction of the oil that is being siphoned off. In fact, \nmost of the oil is gushing like mad out there, with just a little bit \nbeing siphoned off, which tells us there is a much greater volume than \nBP said.\n  If I may ask my friend to answer the two questions. Does he believe \nthe Justice Department ought to take a look at these reassurances BP \ngave before they got the permit and then what they said after, and also \ncomment on this whole notion of siphoning off the oil that they said \nwas successful.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The answer to the first question is yes. I am \nnot sure we have had the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the \ntruth. That would suggest why BP was so reluctant to release the video. \nEach step, it was like pulling teeth to get the video released. Live \nvideo pictures don't lie. What they are showing at this moment, anyone \nwho looks at the live video, is exactly what Senator Boxer said. There \nis this huge gusher of oil at the wellhead that is spewing into the \ngulf. There is a little pipe that one can see in the video that is \ncoming in and is being inserted, and that was supposed to be sucking \nmost of the oil out. But, in fact, the pictures don't lie. The live \nvideo is showing the gusher spewing black oil 5,000 feet below the \nsurface of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\n  Again, I thank my colleague from California for her cooperation. As \nchairman of the Environment Committee, she has the access of snapping \nher fingers and making things happen.\n  I hope other Senators don't have to suffer what it looks as if those \nof us on the gulf coast and now in the Florida Keys and the east coast, \nthe Atlantic coast are going to have to suffer.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about why cloture \nshould not be invoked on this so-called financial reform bill. The \nevents that transpired in the fall of 2008 and into 2009 are times that \nno one wants to repeat. That time was marked with extreme market \nvolatility; credit all but drying up; a housing crisis we are still \nstruggling to overcome; and taxpayers bailing out Wall Street. History \nbooks will undoubtedly look at that period with a magnifying glass. \nHearings were held, testimony was heard--all in an attempt to identify \nwhat went wrong and what Congress could do to fix the broken parts of \nour system. I began this multiyear process with a resolve to the \nAmerican people to fix the system. It is our job to protect taxpayers \nfrom ever again being on the hook for reckless and risky Wall Street \nplayers.\n  Unfortunately, this final bill is anything but reform. Instead, this \nbill pays little regard to its massive government expansion or host of \nunintended consequences. In addition, it ignores some of the major \ncauses of the last crisis. Proponents simply say reforming Fannie and \nFreddie will have to wait for another day. And in a twist of irony, it \nturns out that supporters of this bill are the Wall Street giants \nthemselves such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Yet, proponents of the \nbill are attempting to paint those opposed to the bill as attempting to \nprotect Wall Street. The American people are not buying it. Those \nactually opposing the bill are Main Street businesses, those with \nlittle, if anything, to do with the last crisis. Groups like the \nChamber and the NFIB hardly represent Wall Street insiders. And when \nthe average American thinks of a Wall Street reform bill, they do not \nexpect it to regulate the local HyVee grocery or Tractor Supply Store.\n  Today, I would like to highlight some of my biggest concerns. If this \nbill becomes law, we are going to see a massive new government \nbureaucracy with unchecked powers and limitless authority. The new \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau's powers are so broad--it will be \nallowed to creep into every area of American business and monitor \nconsumer behavior. Have we not listened to anything the American people \nare telling us? They want less, not more government intrusion into \ntheir lives. We have now seen the U.S. Government become the majority \nowner of an American car company. We have seen government take over the \nstudent loan business. Most recently, a health care law added massive \nnew costs and a massive new government entitlement program. And now the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau adds the potential for the \ngovernment to creep into every avenue of our economy.\n  How can we claim we are addressing the root causes of the financial \ncrisis by creating new consumer rules that cause a restriction in \ncredit? How will regulating community banks, florists, dentists, and \nmanufacturers help prevent another Wall Street meltdown? What other \nagency in our system has this type of authority? It is telling that \nNFIB is against this new agency. They don't represent the big banks, \nbut instead the businesses and job creators of our country. They are \nworried they will be swept under these new rules and I don't blame \nthem.\n  I also have deep reservations with the legislation's derivatives \ntitle. What started out as a bipartisan Agriculture Committee agreement \nhas morphed into what almost everyone agrees is unworkable. The White \nHouse has concerns, Treasury Secretary Geithner has concerns, Obama \nadministration adviser Volcker has concerns, Federal Reserve Chairman \nBernanke has concerns, FDIC Chair Sheila Bair has concerns. Yet \nSenators just keep ignoring the warnings. This is legislative \nmalpractice.\n  The derivatives title seeks to address the largest dealers. Yet this \nderivatives title overreaches--impacting community banks, farmers, \nmanufacturers, and thousands of others who use these instruments to \nmanage their risks. A failure to provide an appropriate end user \nexemption will have the perverse effect of actually making businesses \nmore risky. As derivatives contracts become more expensive, legitimate \nbusinesses will be unable to adequately plan for unexpected events. \nFurthermore, by banning the large dealers from engaging in derivative \ntransactions, we won't really be banning them. We will only prevent \nthem from occurring in the United States. No one should kid themselves \ninto thinking our global competitors won't step in. A massive migration \nof derivative contracts into areas of the world that are unregulated, \nhelps no one. By pushing these contracts into the dark, we are only \nincreasing our global systemic risk. The problems at AIG have clouded \nour judgment regarding the usefulness of the rest of the derivatives \nmarket. Now are reforms needed? Without a doubt. However, the current \napproach unfortunately throws the baby out with the bathwater. It will \nonly harm our U.S. competitiveness and those that use derivatives to \nlegitimately protect their business from risks.\n  And finally, let me say what this legislation is missing. Shocking as \nit is, nothing in the bill addresses Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nAlready, the taxpayer has given these mortgage giants $130 billion and \nnow we find they want another $18 billion more. Unfortunately, once you \nhave turned on this faucet, it is hard to turn off. And the taxpayer \nwell is running dry. The government took over these mega firms in 2008 \nand we have done nothing to extricate ourselves from them. In fact, \nsince the United States guarantees Fannie and Freddie, taxpayers are on \nthe hook for roughly $5 trillion in mortgage liabilities. So if \neveryone knows we must do something, how can we ignore them in this \nmassive 1,400-page bill?\n  Furthermore, how could my colleagues reject an amendment that would \nhave--at the very least--provided transparent accounting of the \nliabilities of Fannie and Freddie? If the taxpayers are on the hook for \nthese liabilities, shouldn't this risk be on the Federal balance sheet? \nWasn't it President Obama himself who advocated for honest accounting \nin our budget? This elephant in the room will cause further destruction \nto our fragile economy if we don't take serious action. The root cause \nof the housing crisis was that people bought houses they couldn't \nafford. No one can claim that the mortgage market was not a major \nfactor in our financial meltdown. Yet we ignore underwriting standards. \nUnfortunately, the Senate rejected an amendment that would have \nmandated stricter underwriting standards including a 5-percent \ndownpayment requirement.\n  Instead, we kicked the problem to the financial protection bureau to \nput on their already long to-do list. It is with regret that I will not \nbe supporting the final regulatory bill. Government expansion, \noverreaching regulations, and impacting Main Street businesses that had \nnothing to do with the crisis are not the reforms the American people \nwant.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the motion to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider is agreed to, the motion to reconsider is agreed to.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to invoke cloture, upon \nreconsideration, on amendment No. 3739.\n  The Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which \nthe clerk will state.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Dodd substitute \n     amendment No. 3739 to S. 3217, the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n         Harry Reid, Christopher J.

Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, we are now \npostcloture 30 hours. I have been speaking off and on over the last \ncouple of days with the Republican leader. We are trying to work our \nway through this. There are a lot of procedural things we have to work \nthrough. There are only a couple of amendments that are germane \npostcloture, but they are ones we have to figure out a way to get \nresolved. I am in communication with the Republican leader. I am in \ncommunication regarding an amendment that is germane over here, a \ngermane amendment over here, and we are going to try to work through \nthis.\n  We could have some more votes this afternoon. In the best of all \nworlds we would finish this thing and move on to other issues. We are \ngoing to try to do that, but as everyone has heard over the last few \ndays, it is hard to get that extra little distance we need.\n  We have made great progress. I don't want to belabor the point, but \nit has been hard to get to this point. This has been a good debate. I \nwish we had more of my friends over here join us on the cloture vote. \nWe didn't, but I think it has been a good debate, and I think it is the \nway the Senate should operate more often than it has, and maybe this is \nsetting a good tone for the future.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I wish to talk for a few moments about \nthe pending legislation. My guess is we will have final passage, after \nreaching cloture a few minutes ago.\n  I would like to go back and say we began the process of looking at \nfinancial regulation after the crisis that occurred a couple years ago, \nwhere institutions all across this country made loans--very poor \nloans--to people who used that money to buy homes. That was the genesis \nof this crisis, the fact that institutions across this country made \nthose bad loans and made them to people who could not pay them back.\n  Certainly, that was exacerbated by the fact, with all the easy credit \nthat occurred, there was a housing bubble that no doubt was going to \nput housing back into its normal state at some point. The combination \nof those two factors created a tremendous crisis in our country.\n  When the banks involved in all these loans got into trouble, there \nwas not a good mechanism to deal with so many of them being in trouble \nat the same time. We ended up with a moral hazard with which this \nlegislation is trying to deal; that is, we had institutions around this \ncountry that had capital injected into them because many people at that \ntime felt the Bankruptcy Code or other mechanisms were not there to \ndeal with these institutions.\n  A process began where we in this body and people on the other side of \nthe Capitol tried to pass legislation to deal with this situation.\n  I know there has been a good attempt to deal with it. I have been \ninvolved in some of those negotiations. As my colleagues can tell by my \nvote, I am disappointed with the outcome of that involvement. Still, it \nis an issue that is important to this country.\n  In spite of my disappointment with the outcome, I will say, on the \nfront end, I think the process we have had on the floor has been a good \none. We have had a lot of amendments voted on, and that speaks well for \nthis body.\n  The one issue we did not deal with in this 1,400-page bill--that I am \nsure will be lengthened by a managers' amendment and other things--the \none issue we did not deal with is the fact that underwriting has been \nso terrible. This bill absolutely does not address loan underwriting.\n  I offered an amendment to try to deal with that issue, where when \nAmericans apply for a loan, there has to be a verification of their \nincome, people will look at their debt-to-equity ratio to make sure \nthey have the ability, with all their indebtedness, to pay back \neverything they have before they are able to take out a home mortgage \nand the fact they would have a 5-percent downpayment.\n  All of us know that in other countries--Canada just to the north of \nus did not have this crisis because most people there put 15 percent \ndown on their home mortgages. We did not want to deal with that.\n  There is no one in this body who would say the genesis of this crisis \nwas not the fact that a lot of loans were made to people who could not \npay them back. We did not deal with that in this bill. That, to me, is \na major oversight and one of the reasons I am disappointed with the \noutcome.\n  I do think, by the way, much of that has been dealt with \nappropriately. I appreciate the chairman allowing me to work on that \ntitle with the Senator from--I say ``allowing.'' We were working on it \nanyway--allowing us to be engaged in a way that I think helped improve \nthis bill on resolution.\n  One of the issues we did not deal with was trying to strengthen \nbankruptcy. Resolution, as we discussed over this last year, was to be \nthe last resource--orderly liquidation I guess we would call it. One of \nthe things we had hoped to do was, working with the Judiciary \nCommittee, to strengthen our bankruptcy laws so bankruptcy could work \nfor these large institutions that failed.\n  We did not do that. We not only did not do that, we did not deal with \nsome of the judicial checks that I thought were important as related to \nensuring that as we pay creditors off through this resolution \nmechanism, we do it in a way that is appropriate.\n  I am also disappointed we have not ended up with what I call orderly \nliquidation. We are now giving the FDIC 5 years to resolve a firm. That \nmeans, if a large firm fails in this country, we have the possibility \nof the FDIC running a large financial holding company for 5 years. I \nthink that is inappropriate. I do not think many Americans would view a \ngovernment taking over an entity and running it for 5 years as actually \nresolving it out of business.\n  Obviously, I am disappointed. I do think the chairman and others have \ntried to deal with resolution in a responsible manner. To me, it did \nnot get to where it needed to go.\n  On derivatives, I agree with the thrust of trying to make sure the \nderivatives activity that takes place in this country, that major \nparticipants actually have to clear and making sure that the plumbing \nof ensuring things\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nare margined and that people are money bad on that day occurs. I think \nthat is very appropriate.\n  I am very concerned, on the other hand, with the fact that end users \nstill feel--and I think there is still a lot of concern about end users \nbeing caught up in this legislation. I handed something to the \nchairman. I hope there are some clarifications that can occur before \nthis bill actually becomes law.\n  At present, here is what has happened. We have people on Wall Street, \nobviously, who deal with these on a daily basis. They need to clear. We \nhave, on the other hand, people across this country who are part of our \nheartland who manufacture products, process products, who use \nderivatives to make sure metal prices down the road, if they are trying \nto make heavy equipment, do not fluctuate in such a way that they end \nup losing money.\n  Maybe they are selling their goods to a company in another country, \nand they want to make sure the money they are being paid is in U.S. \ndollars. They might buy a currency swap.\n  The way this legislation is now crafted, there is great question as \nto whether these people who are spread across this country, who create \ngreat manufacturing and other kinds of jobs, are going to be without \ncapital. They are going to have to unnecessarily tie up capital which \ntakes away from their ability to create jobs.\n  For some reason, the Agriculture Committee sent over something called \n106 or 716, which basically moves the swap desk out of a commercial \nbank into an affiliate, which means a whole new round of capitalization \nhas to take place--again, money that is taken out of the markets at a \ntime when we would hope these institutions would be creating loans.\n  What happens when a company is trying to formulate capital? They go \nto an institution, a commercial bank. They may borrow or have a line of \ncredit to make payroll or maybe even out payments. Their accounts \nreceivable may be uneven. They go there and work out a line of credit. \nWhile they are doing that, they also deal with these other activities. \nThey deal with currency swaps. They deal with making sure metal prices \nare hedged or other commodity prices.\n  What this would do is alleviate the ability for an institution to use \ncapital they already have. I am talking about the actual financial \ninstitution. It also makes it far less convenient and far more \ndifficult, I might add, for those people across our country who create \nthese great jobs from being able to do so. There is absolutely no \nreason for it. People on both sides of the aisle understand this is a \nproblem. My sense is the chairman possibly believes this to be a \nproblem. Yet we still have not dealt with that issue.\n  If this bill passes, which it looks like it may in 3 or 4 hours, we \nhave ended up doing something that accomplishes nothing as relates to \nfinancial stability in our country and yet creates a situation where \nthere is less capital available for lending, and it is far more \ndifficult for those institutions that are trying to form that capital.\n  The one thing that is difficult for me to understand is why we did \nnot take the time to deal with Fannie and Freddie. There are people in \nthis body, on both sides of the aisle, who have concerns about these \ntwo GSEs against which we all know we have incredible liabilities.\n  We had an amendment that I thought was thoughtful. That was the \nMcCain amendment. It did not prescribe what we did with Fannie and \nFreddie, but it made sure we as a body dealt with them over the next \ncouple years.\n  We know they have been enablers because of their mixed messages with \ntwo divergent missions. They have created lots of problems for this \ncountry. They have enabled lots of bad things to happen in this country \nas relates to home mortgages. I also know they are a big part of the \nmarket and we have to deal with them over time.\n  The McCain amendment gave us the ability to do that. This body chose \nnot to deal with underwriting, the core issue, not to deal with \ncreating a Bankruptcy Code that would work, in most cases--I am one of \nthose who believes that even with that, we ought to have some ability \nto resolve, in the event there is a systemic risk--but we also did not \ndeal with Fannie and Freddie.\n  The credit rating amendment we added is a good step in the right \ndirection. I voted for it. Again, we did not take the time, within our \ncommittee, to even understand what we ought to do with credit rating \nagencies. So we had an amendment that was drafted a day before a vote, \nand we voted on it. It is pretty draconian, but what it does mean--and \nI thank my friend from Florida for offering it--is that we will \nactually deal with credit rating agencies down the road.\n\n  Right as this bill was in committee, something was sort of air-\ndropped out of the sky, and that was the Volcker language. Certainly, \nChairman Volcker, who used to be head of the Federal Reserve--somebody \nI respect--came up with some language out of the blue that is a part of \nthis bill. We had one hearing on it and the person who was the author \nof the Volcker language couldn't even describe to us exactly what he \nmeant. I mean, he said you know it when you see it. So we are going to \nhave this Volcker language, and we may need to do something on it, but \nI would hope we would have a neutral study first before we decide. In \nessence, we are doing something and sort of sending it off in a \ndirection.\n  I realize there is still a degree of study language, but we are \nsending it off in a direction when, in fact, prop trading--as much as \npeople like to talk negative about it--and private equity and hedge \nfunds had absolutely nothing to do with this last crisis. Nada, zero, \nnot a single institution in this country was negatively affected by \nthose activities--not one--as it relates to creating a systemic crisis. \nYet, again, it is a part of this bill. I think these types of things go \nunder the adage of what we have heard from the White House for the last \nyear and a half; that is, ``never let a good crisis go to waste.''\n  Another area of concern is proxy access. I know the Senator from New \nYork has been a proponent of proxy access. For those of you not paying \nmuch attention to this, what this means is, if you own a very small \nportion of a publicly traded company, you have access to their proxy \ndocuments and, therefore, you have the ability to call people to be \nvoting on up to 25 percent of the board. To me, all this does is put \nboard members of these companies in the same place we in the Senate and \nthose in the House are in, and that is subject to political whims.\n  You can imagine a special interest group, whether it be labor or an \nenvironmentalist group, basically targeting a company in order to make \na statement; basically taking those board members away from dealing \nwith the long-term interests of the company. By the way, proxy access \nhas absolutely nothing, zero to do with financial regulation. But this \nhas become a Christmas tree for those kinds of things because people \nrealize it is something that is going to pass.\n  I think the best example I can possibly imagine of using a piece of \nlegislation or using a crisis to create something through legislation \nthat is, in my opinion, way overreaching, is this consumer protection \nagency. I still am sort of shocked at where we have gone with this. I \nagree with people in this body that mortgage brokers in many cases took \nadvantage of people who were borrowing money. I agree with that, and I \nthink we ought to have a regulation to deal with that. But instead of \ndealing surgically with that particular issue, which is something that \nwas a part--a small part but a part--of this crisis, what we have done \nis create another czar--a czar that has no board.\n  This czar is appointed for 5 years and has absolutely no board, no \ngovernance, but does have the ability to create rules with no real veto \nauthority. The agency will have the ability to enforce those rules, and \nit has a very generous budget.\n  One of the worst issues regarding this agency is that it has the \nability to deal with underwriting loans. So we have a consumer \norganization--not a banking regulator but a consumer organization--that \nis going to be dealing with underwriting of loans. I know this may \nsound a little far-fetched, but you can have the wrong person in this \nposition--again, there is no board, no check and balance--and that \nperson could use this organization to create social justice, if you \nwill, in the financial system. On top of that, we have turned back from \nwhere we were in having a national banking system. Now\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\nwe are allowing 50 State AGs across this country to take the rules that \nare created by this consumer czar, without veto--these rules we now \nwill place on banks and other financial institutions across the \ncountry--and for the first time in a long time, these 50 AGs will have \nthe ability to sue those firms over the rules this consumer \norganization writes--without any check and balance from Congress; \ncertainly no real check and balance, in my opinion, from the prudential \nregulators that oversee the safety and soundness of these institutions.\n  So, Madam President, I am obviously disappointed. I think I have \nspent as much time as any Senator on this floor--maybe slightly less \nthan the chairman--on policy regarding our financial system and trying \nto make sure we create stability for the future. I think any bill--even \nthis bill--has good things in it. There is no question. And I \nappreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and \nI think not enough time was spent on some of the core issues that are \nimportant.\n  To add insult to injury, Madam President, this bill is not paid for. \nThis bill is going to add $17 billion to $23 billion in debt to our \ncountry, and we haven't even addressed that in this bill. So I know \nthere has been some discussion of bipartisanship, and I think certainly \nthe chairman put out some effort toward bipartisanship, but I must say \nit has begun to feel, in many ways--not necessarily as it relates to \nthis bill--that bipartisanship means everybody on the other side of the \naisle, with maybe one or two exceptions, being supportive of something, \nand a few people, less than a handful, on our side of the aisle being \nsupportive. That is not the kind of bipartisanship I thought we were \nall pushing for when this bill began.\n  So I think the process on this floor has been good--on the Senate \nfloor--but I do wish we had spent more time developing a bipartisan \ntemplate. I think there have been plenty of missed opportunities. I am \nproud of the role I was able to play on this bill and believe I have \nhad some input in its shaping, but I wish the policy was far different \nthan it is. It is my hope that in the next 6 months or so there will be \na little different balance in this body where we take each other a \nlittle more seriously than we now do, and we actually end up with \ncentrist, middle-of-the-road policies.\n  I know the President has to be very happy. It seems to me this bill, \nas it has turned out, is exactly the bill he talked about some time \nago. I know it has to be a major victory for him. In my opinion, it is \nan overreach. I believe we could have done better, and I am regretful \nof the fact that we did not do better in the process. I think some \nsteps were made, over the last month in particular, that I hope will \ncause this body to function better.\n  Obviously, Madam President, I don't support this legislation and wish \nit could have been better. I think we have had opportunities where we \ncould have made it better, but we didn't. I think over the course of \nthe next decade we are going to be unwinding much of what we have done. \nIt is my hope that in conference--and I think there is actually a \npossibility of this--many of the issues that are problematic will be \nunwound. As a matter of fact, I sense there is a desire to do that, and \nI hope that is the case.\n  Madam President, I came to this body because I wanted to see good \npolicies put in place for this country. I wanted to see us become a \nstronger country than we already are in the world--the greatest Nation \non Earth. I hope, as this piece of legislation moves through conference \nand comes back to this body, it is strengthened. I did support \namendments on this floor that made the bill better. I think some \nimprovements were made, but I think we also stepped backwards in a \nnumber of cases.\n  In spite of the outcome, Madam President, I want to thank the \nchairman and the ranking member for their efforts in trying to create a \npiece of legislation for this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenator from Iowa finishes his statement, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope we have a chance now, during the \nfinal hours of debate, to take into consideration some of the reasons \nwe got from where we have been over the last 3 or 4 years with the \nbubble, and that bubble bursting a couple of years ago, and the \nfinancial crisis and the recession that has come as a result of it.\n  I want to start out with something that is familiar to all my \ncolleagues, something that George Santayana said:\n\n       Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat \n     it.\n\n  As the Senate continues to debate the financial regulation bill, I \nthink it is important to consider how we got from where we are today.\n  Many people believe the housing and financial crisis was the result \nof too much greed on Wall Street. No doubt. No doubt whatsoever; there \nwas plenty of greed on Wall Street. But greed is like gravity--it is a \nconstant of nature. When planes crash we don't blame gravity. If you \nsearch the Internet for the term ``decade of greed,'' you will discover \nthat is what some people called the 1980s. There is no reason to \nbelieve people are greedier now than they were then. Greed has always \nexisted. The Ten Commandments admonish us not to covet our neighbor's \npossessions. Everyone is tempted by greed. Some are more successful \nthan others in resisting temptation. But greed alone does not explain \nour current crisis. We need to look further.\n  Many people blame the crisis on deregulation. According to this \nexplanation, Congress repealed all the rules and let Wall Street run \nwild. Greedy bankers tricked innocent consumers into taking out risky \nmortgages and sold them to unsuspecting investors. This explanation \nviews the crisis in terms of victims and villains. If it were only that \nsimple.\n  Obviously, anyone who has committed a crime should be prosecuted to \nthe fullest extent of the law. But this explanation overlooks several \nimportant facts: First, the United States is not alone in this crisis. \nHousing booms and busts are occurring all around the world resulting in \ngovernment bailouts. According to the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development--we refer to this as the OECD--nearly a \ndozen European countries are experiencing bigger housing bubbles than \nour own. These countries include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, \nIreland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United \nKingdom. The global nature of this crisis shows the problem is not ours \nalone.\n  Second, we do not have an unregulated free market. Let me underscore \nthat point. This crisis occurred with lots of government involvement. \nThe Federal Reserve controls the money supply. The Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation insures bank deposits. The Fannie, Freddie, \nGinnie, FHA, and the Federal Home Loan Bank boards insure subsidized or \nguaranteed mortgages. We have an entire alphabet soup of government \nagencies that regulate our financial institutions--CFTC, FDIC, FHFA, \nFTC, NCUA, OCC, OTS, SEC, plus all the State agencies and the Federal \nReserve. Finally, we have adopted a policy of too big to fail.\n  The essence of a free market is the opportunity to succeed and the \npotential to fail. As economist Milton Friedman observed: capitalism is \na profit-and-loss system. The loss part is just as important as the \nprofit part. Profits encourage risk taking and losses encourage what \nthey should--prudence.\n  Unfortunately, we have privatized the profits and socialized the \nrisks. In some cases, we have bailed out individual companies. In \nothers, we have bailed out the financial markets. In recent years, \nmarket participants even coined a phrase for such bailouts--``the \nGreenspan put.'' In other words, Wall Street was betting on former \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to protect them from their own \nmistakes.\n  Recent government bailouts, both industry-specific and market-wide, \ninclude Lockheed in 1971; Penn Central Railroad in 1974; Franklin \nNational Bank in 1974; New York City in 1975 and 1978; Chrysler in \n1980; Continental Illinois in 1984; the stock market crisis in 1987; \nLatin American debt crisis in the early-1980s; the Savings & Loan \ncrisis in the late-1980s; the Mexican peso crisis in 1994; Asian \nfinancial crisis in\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\n1997; Long-Term Capital Management in 1998; the stock market crisis in \n2000; the airline industry in 2001; AIG, Bank of America, Bear Stearns; \nCitigroup, Chrysler, GM, Fannie and Freddie in 2008.\n  Reducing the cost of failure encourages reckless behavior. When \npeople come to expect and accept government bailouts that's not \ncapitalism--it is cronyism. Until we eliminate the perverse incentives \ncreated by these bailouts, no one can honestly say we have an \nunregulated free market.\n  I do not mean to say regulation is unnecessary. Indeed, the exact \nopposite is true. Free markets are not possible without laws to protect \nproperty and enforce contracts. The problem is government regulation \noften has unintended consequences.\n  The desire to control human greed through regulation is \nunderstandable. But we forget regulators are human too. They are \nsubject to the same temptations as everyone else. History is replete \nwith examples of regulatory capture and government corruption. The \nrevolving door between Washington, Wall Street, and the Fed make these \nproblems even worse. Second, regulation can provide a false sense of \nsecurity. They encourage people to rely on the government instead of \ntheir own common sense. Third, regulation designed to solve one problem \noften create another problem. That can lead to more regulation and more \nproblems.\n  But most of all, regulation cannot succeed when it is undermined by \ngood intentions.\n  For most of the past century our government--under both Democrats and \nRepublicans--has pursued an ad hoc industrial policy. We have \nencouraged home building to stimulate the economy, and home ownership \nto promote a better society. Unfortunately, we pursued these policies \nby undermining the safety and soundness of our financial system, which \nwas already a house built upon sand. I will have more to say on that \nlater.\n  A review of U.S. housing policy during the 20th century illustrates \nthis point. Consider the government's first major campaign to boost \nhomeownership as described by Steven Malanga of the Manhattan \nInstitute.\n  As Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover declared that nothing was \nworse than increased tenancy and landlordism. In 1922, Hoover launched \nthe ``Own Your Own Home'' campaign, urging Americans to buy homes. \nAccording to Hoover, homeowners work harder, spend leisure time more \nprofitably, live finer lives, and enjoy more comforts of civilization. \nHe urged the lending institutions, the construction industry, and the \ngreat real estate men to counteract the growing menace of tenancy.\n  Hoover called for new rules that would allow nationally chartered \nbanks to devote a greater share of their lending to residential \nproperties. Until that time mortgage lending had primarily been \nconducted by savings and loans, or as they were originally known, \nbuilding and loans.\n  In 1927, Congress responded by passing the McFadden Act, which \nallowed national banks to expand their residential lending to encourage \nhomeownership. The act also prohibited interstate branching to protect \nsmaller local financial institutions.\n  Congress would later pass the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994, which repealed \nthe ban on interstate banking, subject to certain limits. This partial \nrepeal followed the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s. Many \nobservers suggest the lack of diversification and concentration of risk \namong smaller local institutions contributed to the S crisis.\n  The housing market boomed during the 1920s right along with the stock \nmarket. When stocks crashed in 1929, so did housing. According to one \nstudy, nearly 50 percent of the mortgages in America were in default by \n1934. As panicked depositors withdrew their money, banks were forced to \ncall in loans or stop rolling them over.\n  Before the Great Depression, home mortgages typically required a \nsubstantial down payment--as much as 50 percent. They usually had a \nvery short maturity--as few as 5 years. They often had a balloon \npayment at the end. Homeowners had to refinance their mortgage or give \nup their home if they could not afford to pay off the balance when \ntheir loan came due.\n  In response to the housing and financial crisis caused by the Great \nDepression, Congress enacted the Home Owners' Loan Corporation and the \nReconstruction Finance Corporation. These programs were designed to \nbailout insolvent financial institutions; buy up troubled mortgages; \nand refinance them on more affordable terms. A report by HUD on the \nhistory of the era, noted that many borrowers deliberately defaulted on \ntheir mortgages to take advantage of these bailouts.\n  One might think of these earlier programs as the original versions of \nthe current TARP and HAMP.\n  In 1934, Congress attempted to strengthen the housing and financial \nmarkets by creating the Federal Home Loan Banks--FHLB--to lend money to \nother banks; the Federal Housing Administration--FHA--to guarantee home \nloans; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--FDIC--to insure bank \ndeposits, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation--FSLIC--to \ninsure the deposits of S and the Federal National Mortgage \nAssociation--Fannie Mae--to create a secondary market for government \ninsured mortgages.\n  Congress would later abolish FSLIC by merging it with the FDIC \nfollowing the S crisis in the late 1980s.\n  In 1944, Congress passed the GI bill, which provided low interest, \nzero down payment home loans for servicemen. This enabled millions of \nAmerican families to move out of urban apartments and into suburban \nhomes.\n  In 1945, President Truman proposed the ``Fair Deal,'' which included \nseveral housing proposals, including temporary price controls. \nPresident Truman declared:\n\n       Such measures are necessary stopgaps-but only stopgaps. \n     This emergency action, taken alone, is good--but not enough. \n     The housing shortage did not start with the war or with \n     demobilization; it began years before that and has steadily \n     accumulated. The speed with which the Congress establishes \n     the foundation for a permanent, long-range housing program \n     will determine how effectively we grasp the immense \n     opportunity to achieve our goal of decent housing and to make \n     housing a major instrument of continuing prosperity and full \n     employment in the years ahead. It will determine whether we \n     move forward to a stable and healthy housing enterprise and \n     toward providing a decent home for every American family.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to include President Truman's full statement \non housing policy in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nExhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In 1949, Congress enacted the Federal Housing Act, \nwhich provided Federal funding for slum clearance, urban renewal, and \npublic housing. The act also expanded the FHA mortgage insurance \nprogram.\n  To understand the origins of our current housing and financial \ncrisis, it is critical to recognize the role played by the FHA--the \nFederal Housing Administration. The FHA was created in 1934. At the \ntime, State and Federal laws prevented lenders from reducing their down \npayments and lengthening the terms of their loans. As I noted earlier, \nthe typical mortgage required a 50-percent down payment and had a \nmaturity of 5 years. These features were considered essential to \nmaintaining the safety and soundness of the banking system.\n  Lower down payments increased the risk of foreclosure because buyers \nhad less equity in their houses. If home values declined, more \nborrowers might walk away from their homes instead of continuing to \nmake payments on their mortgage. Longer terms increased the risk of \ninsolvency among financial institutions because of an increase in \ninterest rates or a decline in the economy.\n  The FHA challenged conventional wisdom. It sought to waive all of the \nsafety and soundness regulations that applied to the mortgages it \ninsured. According to an article by Adam Gordon published in the Yale \nLaw Journal:\n\n       The FHA had a compelling economic case for requesting such \n     waivers: Treating insured loans differently from uninsured \n     loans made sense from a safety-and-soundness standpoint. From \n     the banks' perspective, insurance balanced out the risks of \n     lower-down-payment, longer-term loans by guaranteeing that, \n     even if the property value went down and the buyer quit \n     making payments, or if the buyer defaulted twenty years into \n     a 25-year loan, the bank would be made whole by the insurance \n     fund. These assurances and the political pressure for new \n     ways to support homeownership led Congress and every state \n     legislature to rapidly pass the requisite\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\n     exemptions from bank safety-and-soundness laws.\n\n  By 1937, all 50 States had enacted legislation giving the FHA free \nrein to write its own rules with respect to the mortgages that it \ninsured. The results were predictable. Delinquencies, defaults, and \nforeclosures increased dramatically.\n  The FHA lowered down payments from 20 percent, to 10 percent, and \nfinally to 3 percent by the mid-1960s. As a result, the foreclosure \nrate increased sixfold, from less than 2 for every 1,000 mortgages to \nmore than 12 per 1,000 mortgages.\n  Almost everyone seemed prepared to accept rising foreclosure rates as \nthe price to be paid for expanding homeownership. However, the FHA soon \nfaced a bigger scandal.\n  Today, we often forget just how much of the pre-civil rights era in \nAmerica was marked by racial discrimination. The FHA program was a \nprime example. During its first 30 years in existence, the FHA \nmaintained various policies to deny insurance to minorities. These \npolicies effectively prevented most African Americans from obtaining \nFHA insured mortgages.\n  Being denied an FHA loan usually meant being denied any opportunity \nto obtain lower down payments and longer terms because such provisions \nwere still illegal for conventional loans.\n  FHA's discriminatory policies did not end until Congress passed the \nFair Housing Act of 1968. Unfortunately, efforts to end racial \ndiscrimination marked the beginning of what we now call predatory \nlending. According to Beryl Satter of Rutgers University:\n\n       After decades of refusing to insure mortgages in areas with \n     black residents no matter what their economic status, in 1968 \n     the FHA went to the other extreme and told mortgage companies \n     that if they would loan in low-income minority neighborhoods, \n     the FHA would guarantee those loans 100%.\n       Speculators immediately exploited the new policy by buying \n     slum properties, and then bribing someone to appraise the \n     properties at, say, quadruple their real value. Speculators \n     might buy a house for $5000 but get a corrupt FHA appraiser \n     to say it was worth $20,000. Once they had that appraisal, \n     they could easily sell that property for $20,000. So what if \n     the price seemed high? The mortgage lender couldn't lose--\n     after all, $20,000 was the property's appraised value, and \n     more importantly, the FHA insured the loan 100%. \n     [Speculators] enticed buyers by emphasizing the low down \n     payment rather than the high final cost. People eager to buy \n     on such terms were easy to find. They were usually black or \n     Latino, and often low income. Given the desperate housing \n     shortage facing low income families during that decade of \n     massive inflation, an offer of a home of one's own for $200 \n     down was often irresistible.\n       The speculators made the procedure quick and easy. They did \n     all the paperwork, routinely falsifying the buyers' income to \n     make it look like they could carry the overpriced loan. The \n     lenders didn't ask any questions about these loan \n     applications because the mortgages were fully insured; the \n     creditworthiness of the borrower was therefore of no \n     relevance. Since mortgage companies also made profits through \n     the exorbitant service fees they charged for FHA loans, they \n     made money on every sale, with no risk whatsoever.\n       By 1972, similar abuses of FHA programs were being reported \n     in Boston, New York, Newark, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Miami, \n     Detroit, St. Louis, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Lubbock, Texas. \n     The New York Times noted that FHA-guaranteed loans were being \n     given on ``substandard'' buildings that lacked ``such \n     essentials as adequate heating and plumbing.'' The confluence \n     of inflated mortgage payments and high repair costs meant \n     that the low-income buyer never had a chance. The repossessed \n     buildings sometimes ended up back in the hands of the \n     speculators, who started the cycle anew.\n       While the scandal meant ruin for low and moderate-income \n     home buyers, it meant huge profits for those in the game. . . \n     .\n       The companies exploiting FHA policies were not marginal. In \n     New York top officials of three of the largest mortgage \n     lenders in the region were convicted of housing fraud in \n     1975. In Brooklyn alone, the U.S. Attorney's office produced \n     a five hundred-count indictment demonstrating that ``real \n     estate speculators, brokers, lawyers, appraisers and bribed \n     FHA employees conspired in the scheme'' to get FHA insurance \n     on slums sold at inflated prices.\n\n  The FHA planted many of the seeds that ultimately grew into the \ncurrent housing crisis.\n  The goal of making homes affordable was used to justify the weakening \nof traditional standards of safety and soundness. The goal of \neliminating discrimination was used to justify extending both FHA and \nconventional loans to borrowers with poor credit and low income. These \nchanges led to rising foreclosures. Lenders responded by charging \nhigher rates and fees to cover their losses. Higher rates and fees \nincreased the cost of buying a home and led to new charges of \ndiscrimination on the basis of predatory lending. That led to renewed \ncalls for innovative ways to reduce the cost of housing. That led to a \nfurther weakening of safety and soundness standards. All of that brings \nus to where we are today.\n  Before discussing our current crisis, however, let me conclude my \nbrief review of the history of U.S. housing policy.\n  In the midst of the FHA scandal, Congress created more programs to \npromote the American dream of home ownership.\n  In 1968, Congress enacted the Truth in Lending Act to require clear \ndisclosure of lending arrangements and costs associated with a loan.\n  Also in 1968, Congress split Fannie Mae into two parts creating the \nGovernment National Mortgage Association, Ginnie Mae, which now deals \nwith government guaranteed mortgages, primarily those insured by the \nDepartment of Veterans and the FHA.\n  In 1970, Congress created the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, \nFreddie Mac, to compete with Fannie Mae.\n  In 1974, Congress passed the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act to \nprohibit kickbacks between lenders and settlement agents and require a \ngood faith estimate of all closing costs.\n  In 1977, Congress enacted the Community Reinvestment Act, CRA, to \nencourage banks to meet the needs of their local communities in a \nmanner consistent with safe and sound lending practices. According to \nPeter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute, the CRA had a \nvague mandate to prevent banks from refusing to lend to qualified \nborrowers, which was enforced by denying mergers and acquisitions among \nbanks. Initially, enforcement actions were rare. But over time, \nCongress shifted its emphasis from ``encouraging'' to ``requiring'' and \nfrom ``safe and sound'' to ``innovative and flexible.'' Ultimately, the \nCRA helped undermine the banking system by encouraging more risky \nloans.\n  As Stan Liebowitz of the University of Texas at Dallas observed: \n``From the current hand-wringing, you'd think that the banks came up \nwith the idea of looser underwriting standards on their own, with \nregulators just asleep on the job. In fact, it was the regulators who \nrelaxed these standards--at the behest of community groups and \n`progressive' political forces . . .''\n  But before faulty underwriting helped create the current housing \ncrisis, there was the S crisis.\n  The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a dramatic rise in inflation due \nto the steady erosion of sound monetary policy in previous decades. \nRising inflation led to higher interest rates, which threatened to \ndestroy the Savings and Loan industry.\n  S relied on short-term deposits to fund long-term, fixed-rate \nmortgages. Rising inflation forced them to pay higher rates to attract \nnew deposits. But they continued to earn the same rate on their \nexisting mortgages. Rising costs relative to a fixed income undermined \nprofits and threatened insolvency.\n  The S were further hampered by Regulation Q, which limited the \ninterest rate they could pay to attract new deposits. The origin of \nRegulation Q dates back to the 1930s when Congress authorized the \nFederal Reserve to set interest rate ceilings.\n  According to proponents, the ceiling on interest rates would \nencourage smaller rural banks to lend in their own communities rather \nthan send their money to larger urban banks where they might earn more. \nThe ceiling was also seen as a way to increase bank profits by limiting \nthe competition for deposits; in other words, it would prevent banks \nfrom engaging in a bidding war for new customers. Regulation Q was \nextended to S in 1966.\n  State usury laws also placed limits on the interest rate paid to \ndepositors as well as the interest rate charged to borrowers further \nundermining the S' financial viability.\n  Congress took numerous steps throughout the 1980s to forestall the \nS crisis. These steps ultimately failed as more than 1,600 banks and \nS were either closed or bailed out\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\nby the government. The S crisis ultimately cost taxpayers more than \n$120 billion.\n  The S crisis shows the failure of many small banks can be just as \ncostly as the failure of a few large banks. That is a lesson we must \nnot forget as we consider ways to address the problem of too big to \nfail.\n  In 1980, Congress enacted the Depository Institutions Deregulation \nand Monetary Control Act to abolish caps on both the interest paid and \nthe interest received.\n  The Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act of 1982 preempted \nState laws to enable the nationwide use of adjustable rate mortgages, \nballoon payments, and negative amortization.\n  These flexible features proved useful during the inflationary 1970s \nand 1980s. But they also set the stage for the emergence of the housing \ncrisis of today.\n  The Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984 made it easier \nto issue mortgage backed securities and enabled financial institutions, \npension funds, and insurance companies to invest in the top rated \ntranches of these securities.\n  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the double taxation of \ndividends paid to those who invest in real estate mortgage investment \nconduits, REMICs. The act also eliminated the tax deduction for \ninterest paid on consumer loans, except for those secured by a home \nmortgage.\n  These two acts established the path toward the creation of \ncollateralize debt obligations, CDO, and the off-balance sheet entities \nknown as special investment vehicles, SIVs, which featured prominently \nin the latest crisis. The tax deduction for home equity loans \ncontributed to the overleveraging of housing.\n  The Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery and Enforcement Act of \n1989 abolished the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation; it \ntransferred the regulation of thrift institutions from the Federal Home \nLoan Bank board to the Office of Thrift Supervision; it allowed bank \nholding companies to acquire thrifts; it established new regulations \nfor real estate appraisals; it established new capital reserve \nrequirements; it required the publication of CRA evaluations.\n  This act also included reforms of the real estate appraisal system, \nwhich had broken down during the FHA scandal in the 1970s, and \ncontributed to the S crisis. Despite these reforms, faulty or \nfraudulent appraisals contributed to the most recent crisis as well.\n  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 allowed \nthe FDIC to borrow from the Treasury and created new capital \nrequirements and risk-based deposit insurance premiums. Moreover, it \ngranted the Federal Reserve authority to lend directly to nonbank firms \nduring times of emergency.\n  This authority increased the moral hazard problem by expanding the \nscope of potential Federal bailout recipients. This authority played a \ncritical role in bailing out AIG.\n  The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of \n1992 was enacted, in part, to encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to \nincrease their service to low- and moderate-income families and \nneighborhoods. These changes, along with others that followed, served \nto undermine standards of safety and soundness by allowing Fannie and \nFreddie to receive credit toward its affordable housing goals by \npurchasing subprime loans from other lenders. This increased the demand \nfor such loans as well as the amount of funds available to finance \nthem.\n  The 1992 act coincided with a Boston Federal Reserve Bank study on \ndiscrimination in mortgage lending. In theory, lenders evaluated the \ncollateral and creditworthiness of those seeking to borrow money. Those \napplicants who qualify get credit, and those who do not are denied. The \nBoston Fed study suggested qualified minority applicants were being \ndenied.\n  In response to growing concerns that traditional underwriting \nstandards had a discriminatory impact on low-income and minority \nfamilies, many housing advocates began to urge the widespread adoption \nof risk-based pricing. Unlike traditional underwriting, risk-based \npricing assumes everyone can qualify as long as they pay an interest \nrate, or other fee, that reflects their individual risk. Thus, risk-\nbased pricing was viewed as a way to safely implement the flexible \nunderwriting standards needed to eliminate discrimination and expand \nhomeownership.\n  In 1993, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston published a report \nentitled ``Closing the Gap.'' This report included recommendations on \n``best practice'' from lending institutions and consumer groups. It \noffered lenders a ``comprehensive program'' to ensure all loan \napplicants are treated fairly and to reach a more diverse customer \nbase.\n  The report stated:\n\n       While the banking industry is not expected to cure the \n     nation's social and racial ills, lenders do have a specific \n     legal responsibility to ensure that negative perceptions, \n     attitudes, and prejudices do not systematically affect the \n     fair and even-handed distribution of credit in our society. \n     Fair lending must be an integral part of a financial \n     institution's business plan . . . Even the most determined \n     lending institution will have difficulty cultivating business \n     from minority customers if its underwriting standards contain \n     arbitrary or unreasonable measures of creditworthiness. . . . \n     Institutions that sell loans to the secondary market should \n     be fully aware of the efforts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n     to modify their guidelines to address the needs of borrowers \n     who are lower-income, live in urban areas, or do not have \n     extensive credit histories.\n\n  In 1995, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a \nNational Homeownership Strategy which stated:\n\n       The inability (either real or perceived) of many younger \n     families to qualify for a mortgage is widely recognized as a \n     very serious barrier to homeownership. [The Strategy] commits \n     both government and the mortgage industry to a number of \n     initiatives designed to: (1) Cut transaction costs through \n     streamlined regulations and technological and procedural \n     efficiencies; (2) Reduce down-payment requirements and \n     interest costs by making terms more flexible, providing \n     subsidies to low- and moderate-income families, and creating \n     incentives to save for homeownership; (3) Increase the \n     availability of alternative financing products in housing \n     markets throughout the country.\n\n  Efforts to expand the use of flexible underwriting standards raised \nobvious concerns about the potential for increased defaults and \nforeclosures. To address these concerns, numerous groups, both inside \nand outside government, conducted studies, and proposed new laws and \nregulations.\n  In 1996, Freddie Mac issued a report to Congress based on its effort \nto develop an automated underwriting system. The report concluded that \nit was possible to replace ``subjective human judgment'' with computers \nthat could accurately assess ``multiple risk factors'' and ``identify \nwhich loans would wind up in foreclosure and which would not.'' By \nfairly and objectively accessing individual credit risk, an automated \nsystem could eliminate discrimination and strengthen the underwriting \nprocess.\n  This study was primarily focused on improving the prime mortgage \nmarket by identifying applicants who received prime loans, but \nshouldn't have, and applicants who did not receive prime loans, but \nshould have. However, the ability to identify risk within the prime \nmarket led to the conclusion that it was possible to do the same thing \nin the subprime market as well. In relatively short order, Fannie, \nFreddie, and almost every other participant in the home mortgage market \nadopted computerized systems to analyze and securitize home loans. \nThese new procedures were applied to subprime loans.\n  Of course, risk based pricing also raised concerns that lenders might \ncharge borrowers more than their risk profile would justify. Such \novercharges raised the specter of predatory lending.\n  In response, Congress enacted the Home Ownership and Equity \nProtection Act of 1994 which required disclosures and imposed \nrestrictions on high-cost loans. This act served to highlight once \nagain the difficulty of promoting flexible underwriting to expand \nhomeownership while at the same time trying to protect consumers from \ndiscriminatory lending.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 exempted from taxation profits on the \nsale of a personal residence of up to $500,000, couples, or $250,000, \nsingles. This change provided a boost to home prices by increasing the \nafter-tax rate of return on housing.\n  The Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 repealed \nrestrictions on interstate banking. This\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\nact was designed to address the lack of diversification and the \nconcentration of risk among smaller local financial institutions that \ncontributed to the S crisis.\n  The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999--also known as \nGramm-Leach-Bliley--repealed part of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. \nThe extent to which this repeal contributed to the current crisis is \nthe subject of much debate.\n  Glass-Steagall prohibited commercial banks from underwriting or \ndealing in securities. It also prohibited them from having affiliates \nthat were principally or primarily engaged in underwriting or dealing \nin securities. It is important to understand exactly what this means.\n  As Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute has explained:\n\n       Underwriting refers to the business of assuming the risk \n     that an issue of securities will be fully sold to investors, \n     while ``dealing'' refers to the business of holding an \n     inventory of securities for trading purposes. Nevertheless, \n     banks are in the business of making investments, and Glass-\n     Steagall did not attempt to interfere with that activity. \n     Thus, although Glass-Steagall prohibited underwriting and \n     dealing, it did not interfere with the ability of banks to \n     ``purchase and sell'' securities they acquired for \n     investment. The difference between ``purchasing and selling'' \n     and ``underwriting and dealing'' is crucially important. A \n     bank may purchase a security--say, a bond--and then decide to \n     sell it when the bank needs cash or believes that the bond is \n     no longer a good investment. This activity is different from \n     buying an inventory of bonds for the purpose of selling them, \n     which would be considered dealing.\n\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act did not repeal the restriction on \nunderwriting or dealing by commercial banks. It only repealed the \nrestriction on affiliates. There is no evidence the activities of any \naffiliates were large enough to cause the current crisis.\n  On the other hand, as Mr. Wallison noted, there was a critical \nexception to the Glass-Steagall prohibition on underwriting or dealing \nby commercial banks. It did not apply to securities issued by Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac.\n  The major commercial banks--such as Citibank, Wachovia, Bank of \nAmerica, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo--that got into trouble did so \nby engaging in activities that were never prohibited by Glass-Steagall. \nThese banks suffered heavy losses because they invested in poorly \nunderwritten, overvalued mortgage-backed securities, including those of \nFannie and Freddie.\n  Likewise, the major investment banks--such as Lehman Brothers, Bear \nStearns, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs--that got into \ntrouble have always been exempt from Glass-Steagall. As I will discuss \nlater, the demise of these investment banks was due to a new variation \non the classic bank run.\n  The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 authorized over-the-\ncounter financial derivatives. Although over-the-counter derivatives, \nlike credit default swaps, CDS, are exempt from most regulation, those \nwho buy and sell them are not. For example, the acting director of the \nOffice of Thrift Supervision, OTS, recently testified about the \nAmerican International Group, AIG, one of the major participants in the \nCDS market. According to his testimony, ``. . . in hindsight, OTS \nshould have directed the company to stop originating CDS products . . . \n[and] OTS should also have directed AIG try to divest a portion of this \nportfolio.''\n  Although AIG was comprised of more than 220 companies operating in \nmore than 130 countries, its primary line of business was insurance. \nAccording to a Government Accountability Office report:\n\n       State insurance regulators are responsible for monitoring \n     the solvency of insurance companies generally, as well as for \n     approving transactions regarding those companies, such as \n     changes in control or significant transactions with the \n     parent company or other subsidiaries . . .\n\n  In other words, Federal and State regulators had the authority to \nmonitor the financial institutions which were among the largest buyers \nand sellers of CDS contracts, and take appropriate action to protect \ntheir safety and soundness. Unfortunately, the regulators failed to \nrecognize the inherent dangers created by the bubble in the housing \nmarket.\n  The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 raised the limit on \ndeposit insurance; merged the various deposit insurance funds; provided \ncredits for banks for prior contributions; and required rebates when \nthe deposit fund goes above 1.5 percent of deposits.\n  The Credit Agency Reform Act of 2006 required rating agencies to \nregister with the SEC. Despite these requirements, the ratings agency \ncontributed to the most recent crisis as well.\n  Credit ratings agencies--such as Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & \nPoor's--have been given privileged status as Nationally Recognized \nStatistical Rating Organizations, NRSROs, since 1975.\n  These agencies played a significant role in the recent financial \ncrisis in two different ways. First, they placed their AAA seal of \napproval on subprime mortgages that were converted into traunches--or \ntiers--of securitized loans. Second, they contributed to excessive \nborrowing because of flawed capital standards. According to government \nregulations, banks needed $1 in capital for every $25 of single-family \nhome loans. But, if those mortgages were converted into AAA securities, \nthe banks could hold $60 in loans for every $1 in capital. Higher \nleverage entails greater risk to the financial system.\n  This brief legislative history produces an unmistakable feeling of \nDeja Vu as one considers where we are today. The current crisis has \nbeen summarized along the following lines:\n  In response to the high-tech, dot-com bust in 2000, the Federal \nReserve began a series of interest rate cuts reducing the Fed Funds \nrate from 6.5 percent to 1.0 percent. As cheap credit flooded the \nmarkets, financial institutions adopted reckless lending practices \nunder the political banner of increasing homeownership. These practices \nincluded liar loans, no verification of income or assets; no-money \ndown, including seller-financed and other third-party contributions, \nand wrap-around loans; interest-only loans; negative amortization, \nmissed payments are added to the principal; adjustable-rates; and \nballoon payments.\n  As these risky loans were extended to marginal borrowers who could \nnot afford their overpriced homes, the financial wizards on Wall Street \ndevised schemes to theoretically insure themselves against default. \nThese so called credit default swaps allowed investors who purchased \nmortgage-backed securities to pay fees to underwriters, like AIG, in \nexchange for a promise to cover any losses. Because regulators and \nother market participants did not seriously consider the possibility of \nfalling home prices and rising default rates, these CDS contracts were \nnot backed by adequate collateral to cover potential losses.\n  By allowing those who bought and sold mortgage-backed securities to \ntransfer risk to other market participants, it became more difficult to \ndetermine who would suffer the actual losses as home prices began to \nfall and default rates began to rise. The house of cards collapsed as \nfinancial institutions became less willing to lend to each other under \nthe growing cloud of uncertainty.\n  While there is plenty of blame to go around for getting us into this \nmess, and there were lots of contributing factors, ultimately this \ncrisis was triggered by a new variation on the classic bank run. Here's \nhow Gary Gordon of Yale University describes what happened:\n\n       In a banking panic, depositors rush en masse to their banks \n     and demand their money back. The banking system cannot \n     possibly honor these demands because they have lent the money \n     out or they are holding long-term bonds [which can only be \n     sold at fire sale prices] . . . the panic in 2007 was not \n     like the previous panics in American history . . . it was not \n     a mass run on banks by individual depositors, but instead was \n     a run by firms and institutional investors on financial \n     firms.\n\n  According to Mr. Gordon, this run was caused by the collapse of the \nrepurchase agreement--or repo--market. Before the crisis, trillions of \ndollars were traded in the repo market. No one knows the exact amount \nbecause there are no data on the total size of this market or the \nidentity of all its participants. Estimates suggest it could be as much \nas $10 trillion, which is roughly equal to the total assets of the \nentire U.S. banking system.\n  As tempting as it may be to blame our current crisis on Wall Street \ngreed\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\nand irresponsible deregulation, the truth is a bit more complicated, as \nI think I have tried to show. To understand how we got to where we are \ntoday, it is necessary to review some history and some economics.\n  There have been financial booms and busts throughout recorded \nhistory--from tulip mania, the South-Sea bubble, and the Mississippi \nscheme, to the Mexican peso crisis, the Asian crisis, and the dot-com \nboom.\n  Economist Hyman Minsky argued there are five stages of a financial \nbubble: stage 1, investors get excited about some asset or commodity; \nstage 2, prices rise as more investors enter the market; stage 3, \neuphoria occurs as financial markets devise new ways to inflate the \nbubble; stage 4, investors begin to cash-out of the market; and, stage \n5, panic sets in as the bubble pops and everyone tries to get out \nbefore it is too late.\n  There have been alternating cycles of financial fear and euphoria \nthroughout history. While greed and speculation played an important \nrole, there is another essential element that is all too often \noverlooked. That critical ingredient is money.\n  The nature of money, the source of its value, and the determination \nof its supply are topics of extreme importance. Historically, money is \nbelieved to have developed from the concept of barter or exchange. \nIndividuals wished to trade one good for another. The most desirable, \ndivisible, and nonperishable goods were designated as money. Cows, \nwheat, rice, rocks, sea shells, silver, and gold have all served as \nmoney throughout history.\n  The development of money soon led to the introduction of banking. \nBanks served not only as a place to store money, but also as a means to \nfacilitate commerce by granting various types of loans.\n  The deposit of money involves two different concepts. First, a \ndemand, or checking, deposit implies a custody arrangement. The bank \nmaintains 100 percent reserves. Thus, the funds are available at all \ntimes to meet the needs of the depositor. Second, a loan, or time, \ndeposit implies a temporary transfer of ownership. The bank is \nauthorized to make loans. Thus, the funds are transferred to someone \nelse who is obligated to repay them at some future date.\n  Initially, most banks recognized and accepted the distinction between \nthese two different kinds of deposits. Moreover, they confined their \nlending activities within the limits of their total deposits. But they \nquickly discovered that not everyone sought to withdraw their money at \nthe same time. Thus, they decided they could safely issue as much \ncredit as they desired, as long they retained enough money to meet \nexpected withdrawals. So began the practice of fractional reserve \nbanking.\n  According to economist Jesus Huerta de Soto, early European bankers \noften sought to conceal their use of fractional reserves while claiming \nto maintain 100 percent reserves. Only later upon receiving official \ngovernment sanction did they openly admit to and defend the practice of \nfractional reserves.\n  The most common defense of fractional reserve banking is that it is \nhighly unlikely that most depositors will seek to withdraw their funds \nsimultaneously. Thus, it is said the law of large numbers permits a \nbank to safely lend out most of its funds. But as Huerta de Soto \nobserves:\n\n     . . . in the field of human action the future is always \n     uncertain, . . . The open, permanent nature of the \n     uncertainty . . . differs radically from the notion of risk \n     applicable within the sphere of physics and natural science.\n\n  History shows beyond a doubt that we cannot predict when a bank run \nwill occur. The creation of deposit insurance and the establishment of \na central bank as a lender of last resort would not be necessary if we \ncould predict such events with any degree of certainty.\n  The dangers created by misguided efforts to treat uncertainty of \nhuman action as some form of statistical risk is evident in the current \ncrisis. The use of computer models to convert subprime loans into AAA \nsecurities ignored the human action of declining underwriting standards \nand the growing bubble in the housing market.\n  Some observers may be tempted to conclude this crisis is simply the \nlatest in the cycle of booms and busts that inevitably plague mankind. \nOthers may be tempted to conclude we need a brand new systemic risk \nregulator--in other words, we need someone to oversee the safety and \nsoundness of our entire financial system. The logic behind this \napproach is that our current hodgepodge of Federal and State regulatory \nagencies was too busy looking at the individual institutions within \ntheir jurisdiction. No one saw the big picture.\n  However, the problem is not that we lack a systemic risk regulator. \nThe problem is we already have a system risk creator, namely the \nFederal Reserve.\n  Mark Thornton of the Ludwig von Mises Institute describes central \nbanking as a confidence game:\n\n       The Federal Reserve plays a confidence game with us. A \n     confidence game . . . is described as an attempt to defraud a \n     person or group by gaining their confidence. . . . [The] \n     Fed's basic confidence game [is] trying to gain and maintain \n     our confidence in its system and getting us not to take \n     proper precaution against the negative effects of its \n     policies. . . . [The] Fed's mission [is] to instill \n     confidence in us about the economy while simultaneously \n     instilling confidence in us about the abilities of the Fed \n     itself. The first mission is easy to see because Fed \n     officials are almost always publicly bullish and hardly ever \n     publicly bearish about the economy. The economy always looks \n     good, if not great. If there are some problems, don't worry, \n     the Fed will come to the rescue with truckloads of money, \n     lower interest rates, and easy credit. If things were to get \n     worse, which they won't, the Fed would be able to respond \n     with monetary weapons of mass stimulation. All this is \n     consistent with the viewpoint of mainstream economists who \n     see the business cycle as caused by psychological problems \n     and random shocks. In their view, it is your fault for \n     becoming overly speculative and risky and then lapsing into \n     risk aversion and depression. It is your fault!\n\n  This may seem like an unfair characterization of the Fed, but \nconsider the following quotes from 2007. Remember, by early 2007 \nhousing prices were falling in many areas.\n  In January of 2007, Chairman Bernanke described the Fed's superhero-\nlike ability to access information, identify risk, anticipate crisis, \nand respond to any challenge.\n  Mr. Barnanke said:\n\n       Many large banking organizations are sophisticated \n     participants in financial markets, including the markets for \n     derivatives and securitized assets. In monitoring and \n     analyzing the activities of these banks, the Fed obtains \n     valuable information about trends and current developments in \n     these markets. Together with the knowledge obtained through \n     its monetary-policy and payments activities, information \n     gained through its supervisory activities gives the Fed an \n     exceptionally broad and deep understanding of developments in \n     financial markets and financial institutions. . . .\n       In its capacity as a bank supervisor, the Fed can obtain \n     detailed information from these institutions about their \n     operations and risk-management practices and can take action \n     as needed to address risks and deficiencies. The Fed is also \n     either the direct or umbrella supervisor of several large \n     commercial banks that are critical to the payments system \n     through their clearing and settlement activities. . . .\n       In my view, however, the greatest external benefits of the \n     Fed's supervisory activities are those related to the \n     institution's role in preventing and managing financial \n     crises.\n       Finally, the wide scope of the Fed's activities in \n     financial markets--including not only bank supervision and \n     its roles in the payments system but also the interaction \n     with primary dealers and the monitoring of capital markets \n     associated with the making of monetary policy--has given \n     the Fed a uniquely broad expertise in evaluating and \n     responding to emerging financial strains.\n\n  I could go on at length reading similar quotes from various Fed \nofficials. But to save on time and embarrassment, I will simply put Mr. \nThornton's article in the Record, and skip to his conclusion. Mr. \nThornton says:\n\n       We can see that the Fed is a confidence game. Their public \n     pronouncements, while heavily nuanced and hedged, uniformly \n     present the American people with a rosy scenario of the \n     economy, the future, and the ability of the Fed to manage the \n     market. Ben Bernanke told Congress [in March of 2010] that we \n     are in the early stages of an economic recovery. Of course, \n     he has been saying that since the spring of 2009 (if not \n     earlier). . . . These are the people who said that there was \n     no housing bubble, that there was no danger of financial \n     crisis, and then that a financial crisis would not impact the \n     real economy. These are the same people who said they needed \n     a multi-trillion dollar bailout of the financial industry, or \n     we would get severe trouble in the economy. They got their \n     bailout, and we got the severe trouble anyways. It is time to \n     bring this confidence game to an end.\n\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Thornton's article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The current financial reform bill will not end the \ncycle of financial booms and busts. This cycle is not the result of \ngreen, or capitalism, or animal spirits, or irrational exuberance. \nUltimately, it is caused by our failure to recognize and enforce \ntraditional legal principles, namely, the protection of private \nproperty.\n  According to Huerta de Soto: It is a remarkable fact that three of \nthe most noted monetary theorists of the eighteenth and early \nnineteenth centuries were bankers: John Law, Richard Cantillon, and \nHenry Thornton. Their banks all failed.\n  Law was involved in the infamous Mississippi scheme, and Cantillon \nwas involved in a fraudulent stock trading scheme. Only Thornton \nescaped controversy because his bank did not fail until after his \ndeath. All of these bankers were actively involved in convincing their \ncolleagues and customers of the safety, soundness, and wisdom of \nviolating traditional legal principles.\n  Once upon a time, common sense as well as the law recognized the \ndifference between a demand deposit and a loan deposit.\n  According to Huerta de Soto, ancient Roman law made it clear that \nbankers carried out two different types of operations. On one hand, \nthey accepted demand deposits, which involved no right to interest and \nobligated the bank to maintain the continuous availability of the \nmoney; and the depositor had absolute privilege in the case of \nbankruptcy. On the other hand, bankers also received loan deposits, \nwhich obligated the banker to pay interest on the money; and the \ndepositor lacked all privileges in the case of bankruptcy.\n  The clear distinction between these two types of deposits began to \nbreak down with the unfortunate choice of a penalty for the failure to \nreturn a demand deposit. A banker who accepted a demand deposit and \nlater failed to return the money upon demand was obligated to pay a \npenalty in the form of interest.\n  According to Huerta de Soto, the ban on usury by the three major \nmonotheistic religions--Judaism, Islam, and Christianity--did much to \ncomplicate and obscure medieval financial practices. Historically, \nusury meant charging any interest on a loan. Today, it means charging \nexcessive interest on a loan.\n\n       Since it was forbidden to pay interest on loans, it is easy \n     to understand how convenient it was in the Middle Ages to \n     disguise a loan as a deposit in order to make the payment of \n     interest legal, legitimate and socially acceptable. For this \n     reason, bankers started to systematically engage in \n     operations in which the parties openly declared they were \n     entering into a deposit contract and not a loan contract.\n       The method of concealment . . . was a simulated [demand] \n     deposit which . . . was not a true [demand] deposit at all, \n     but rather a loan [deposit]. At the end of the agreed-upon \n     term, the supposed depositor claimed his money. When the \n     [bank] failed to return [the money], [the bank] was forced to \n     pay a ``penalty'' in the [form] of interest on [its] presumed \n     ``delay.''\n       Disguising loans as deposits became an effective way to get \n     around the canonical ban on interest and escape severe \n     sanctions, both secular and spiritual.\n\n  It would appear the history of banking consists of a continuous \neffort to eliminate the distinction between these two types of \ndeposits. I do not mean to criticize modern day bankers. I suspect they \nare largely unaware of this history. They simply operate under the \nrules as they exist today. Anyone who studies money and banking in \ncollege is taught about fractional reserves, deposit insurance, and the \nneed for a central bank to serve as lender of last resort. This is \nstandard fare that passes for higher education around the world.\n  As economist John Maynard Keynes once observed, ``even the most \npractical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some \nlong-dead economist.''\n  Having said all this, the question remains: Where do we go from here?\n  To answer that question let me return to the topic of money. In a \nworld of paper currency--without the backing of any tangible \ncommodity--the supply of money is ultimately determined by the \ngovernment.\n  In most countries, the power to create money has been delegated by \nthe government to a central bank. The central bank in turn controls the \nmoney supply in a number of ways: buying and selling financial assets--\nso-called discount window or open-market operations--and requiring \nbanks to keep deposits at the central bank--so-called reserve \nrequirements.\n  As our Nation's central bank, it is often suggested that the Federal \nReserve controls both interest rates and the money supply. However, the \nonly interest rate the Fed controls is the discount rate. That is the \nrate the Fed charges other banks when they borrow money from the Fed. \nThe Fed generally prefers that banks borrow from each other. So, it \nusually sets the discount rate higher than the rate banks charge each \nother. That rate is called the Federal funds rate.\n  U.S. banks are required to hold reserves as a percentage of their \ndemand deposits, but not their loan deposits. These reserves are \ndesigned to cover daily withdrawals. On any given day, some banks may \nhave a reserve shortfall, while others may have excess reserves. Thus, \nbanks borrow from each other on an overnight basis. The Fed sets a \ntarget for the interest rate banks charge each other--the Federal funds \nrate--and then it attempts to achieve its target.\n\n  According to the textbook explanation, when the Fed wants to lower \nthe Federal funds rate, it buys financial assets, such as government \nbonds, from other banks and pays for them by creating additional \nreserves. This is sometimes referred to as creating money out of thin \nair. Since the banks now have more reserves, they are generally willing \nto lend at a lower rate. When the Fed wants to raise the Federal funds \nrate, it sells financial assets back to the banks and withdraws the \nadditional reserves. Since the banks now have fewer reserves, they will \nusually require borrowers to pay a higher interest rate.\n  The Fed can also change the supply of money by changing the reserve \nrequirement. By raising or lowering the reserve requirement, the Fed \ncan control how much money banks must hold in reserve. Higher reserves \nmean less money is available for banks to lend, and lower reserves mean \nmore money to lend.\n  Although central banks control the money supply in the long run, in \nthe short run individual banks are largely in control.\n  As the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago explained in its publication \nModern Money Mechanics:\n\n       In the real world, a bank's lending is not normally \n     constrained by the amount of reserves it has at any given \n     moment. Rather, loans are made, or not made, depending on the \n     bank's credit policies and its expectations about its ability \n     to obtain the funds necessary to pay its customers' checks \n     and maintain required reserves in a timely fashion.\n\n  In other words, when banks make loans, they create new deposits, \nthereby increasing the money supply. In the short run, banks are free \nto make as many loans as they want based solely on their expectation of \nfuture repayment and their ability to meet required reserves and \nexpected withdrawals, plus their capital requirements.\n  In the long run, central banks control reserve requirements and the \ncost of borrowing excess reserves. Thus, they can eventually prevent \nindividual banks from endlessly expanding the money supply.\n  Money can be defined as the thing that all other goods and services \nare traded for, or as the means to achieve final settlement of all \ntransactions. As the means of final payment, money is uniquely valued \nabove all other assets. It is considered to be the most liquid because \nit is accepted by everyone and it trades at face value. That is, $1 is \nalways equal to $1.\n  Because banks have the power to create money--within limits set by \nthe central bank--they are viewed with a high degree of suspicion. But \nbanks are ultimately at the mercy of their customers because they are \nobligated to convert deposits into cash. When banks lose the confidence \nof their customers, they are subject to bankruptcy if too many \ncustomers try to withdraw their money. Banking panics in the past led \nto the creation of central banking and deposit insurance. These \ngovernment safety nets were designed to prevent the collapse of the \nbanking system.\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\n  To further limit the risk of a banking failure, the government \nimposed various standards of safety and soundness. These standards \nrange from underwriting loans to maintaining adequate levels of capital \nand reserves. While these standards make banking safer, they also make \nit more expensive. It takes time and effort to evaluate the \ncreditworthiness of borrowers. Likewise, money that is set aside in \nreserves cannot be used to make a loan and earn a rate of return.\n  As I have outlined earlier, Congress undermined both underwriting \nstandards and capital requirements in an effort to expand home \nownership. However, these actions alone would not have likely caused \nthe crisis.\n  Another major contributing factor was the fact that all of the limits \nplaced on traditional deposit-based commercial banking led to the \nexpansion of the alternative securities-based investment banking \nsystem. This system is sometimes referred to as the ``shadow'' banking \nsystem. While both types of banks are arguably clouded by a fog of \nconfusion, the differences are very clear.\n  Investment banks do not accept or create deposits. Instead, they help \nbusinesses and governments raise money by selling their stocks and \nbonds to investors. To accomplish this goal, they also perform two \nother important functions. They transform stocks, bonds, or mortgages \ninto securities. This securitization process is designed to diversify \nthe investments and reduce market risk. Many investment banks also \nserve as market-makers.\n  Just as a commercial bank must meet a depositor's demand for cash, a \nmarket-maker must buy securities for cash. However, there are two \nimportant differences. Unlike deposits that must be redeemed $1-for-$1, \nsecurities are redeemable at the market-price, which could be more or \nless than the amount originally paid. The other important difference is \nthat investment banks do not have an established government safety net.\n  They do not have access to deposit insurance because they do not have \ndeposits. They do not typically have the ability to borrow from the \ncentral bank as the lender of last resort, again because they do not \nhave deposits. Nevertheless, when they lose the confidence of their \ncustomers, they are subject to the equivalent of a bank run.\n  That is basically what happened. Investment banks borrowed short \nterm, primarily through repos, and invested long term, primarily in \nmortgage-backed securities. When it finally became apparent to everyone \nthat mortgage default rates were going up and home prices were going \ndown, the short-term lending came to an end. Without the ability to \nborrow more short-term money or sell long-term securities at their \noriginal price, the investment banks faced insolvency.\n  This was not our first crisis, and it won't be our last. Increased \ntransparency and accountability are necessary, but they are not \nsufficient. A sound financial system requires a sound monetary policy. \nThat means a strong and stable dollar.\n  The history of U.S. monetary policy, indeed the history of monetary \npolicy around the world, reveals an ongoing effort to devalue money \nthrough endless inflation.\n  The reform we need most is to overcome the temptation to purchase \nprosperity with inflated dollars. Until that goal is achieved, I am \nafraid the current reform effort will amount to little more than \nrearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n President Harry S Truman Message to the Congress on the State of the \n                    Union and on the Budget for 1947\n\n                            January 21, 1946\n\n\n                        National housing program\n\n       Last September I stated in my message to the Congress that \n     housing was high on the list of matters calling for decisive \n     action.\n       Since then the housing shortage in countless communities, \n     affecting millions of families, has magnified this call to \n     action.\n       Today we face both an immediate emergency and a major \n     postwar problem. Since VJ-day the wartime housing shortage \n     has been growing steadily worse and pressure on real estate \n     values has increased. Returning veterans often cannot find a \n     satisfactory place for their families to live, and many who \n     buy have to pay exorbitant prices. Rapid demobilization \n     inevitably means further overcrowding.\n       A realistic and practical attack on the emergency will \n     require aggressive action by local governments, with Federal \n     aid, to exploit all opportunities and to give the veterans as \n     far as possible first chance at vacancies. It will require \n     continuation of rent control in shortage areas as well as \n     legislation to permit control of sales prices. It will \n     require maximum conversion of temporary war units for \n     veterans' housing and their transportation to communities \n     with the most pressing needs; the Congress has already \n     appropriated funds for this purpose.\n       The inflation in the price of housing is growing daily.\n       As a result of the housing shortage, it is inevitable that \n     the present dangers of inflation in home values will continue \n     unless the Congress takes action in the immediate future.\n       Legislation is now pending in the Congress which would \n     provide for ceiling prices for old and new houses. The \n     authority to fix such ceilings is essential. With such \n     authority, our veterans and other prospective home owners \n     would be protected against a skyrocketing of home prices. The \n     country would be protected from the extension of the present \n     inflation in home values which, if allowed to continue, will \n     threaten not only the stabilization program but our \n     opportunities for attaining a sustained high level of home \n     construction.\n       Such measures are necessary stopgaps--but only stopgaps. \n     This emergency action, taken alone, is good--but not enough. \n     The housing shortage did not start with the war or with \n     demobilization; it began years before that and has steadily \n     accumulated. The speed with which the Congress establishes \n     the foundation for a permanent, long-range housing program \n     will determine how effectively we grasp the immense \n     opportunity to achieve our goal of decent housing and to make \n     housing a major instrument of continuing prosperity and full \n     employment in the years ahead. It will determine whether we \n     move forward to a stable and healthy housing enterprise and \n     toward providing a decent home for every American family.\n       Production is the only fully effective answer. To get the \n     wheels turning, I have appointed an emergency housing \n     expediter. I have approved establishment of priorities \n     designed to assure an ample share of scarce materials to \n     builders of houses for which veterans will have preference. \n     Additional price and wage adjustments will be made where \n     necessary, and other steps will be taken to stimulate greater \n     production of bottleneck items. I recommend consideration of \n     every sound method for expansion in facilities for insurance \n     of privately financed housing by the Federal Housing \n     Administration and resumption of previously authorized low-\n     rent public housing projects suspended during the war.\n       In order to meet as many demands of the emergency situation \n     as possible, a program of emergency measures is now being \n     formulated for action. These will include steps in addition \n     to those already taken. As quickly as this program can be \n     formulated, announcement will be made. Last September I also \n     outlined to the Congress the basic principles for the kind of \n     decisive, permanent legislation necessary for a long-range \n     housing program.\n       These principles place paramount the fact that housing \n     construction and financing for the overwhelming majority of \n     our citizens should be done by private enterprise. They \n     contemplate also that we afford governmental encouragement to \n     privately financed house construction for families of \n     moderate income, through extension of the successful system \n     of insurance of housing investment; that research be \n     undertaken to develop better and cheaper methods of building \n     homes; that communities be assisted in appraising their \n     housing needs; that we commence a program of Federal aid, \n     with fair local participation, to stimulate and promote the \n     rebuilding and redevelopment of slums and blighted areas--\n     with maximum use of private capital. It is equally essential \n     that we use public funds to assist families of low income who \n     could not otherwise enjoy adequate housing, and that we \n     quicken our rate of progress in rural housing.\n       Legislation now under consideration by the Congress \n     provides for a comprehensive attack jointly by private \n     enterprise, State and local authorities, and the Federal \n     Government. This legislation would make permanent the \n     National Housing Agency and give it authority and funds for \n     much needed technical and economic research. It would provide \n     additional stimulus for privately financed housing \n     construction. This stimulus consists of establishing a new \n     system of yield insurance to encourage large-scale investment \n     in rental housing and broadening the insuring powers of the \n     Federal Housing Administration and the lending powers of the \n     Federal savings and loan associations.\n       Where private industry cannot build, the Government must \n     step in to do the job. The bill would encourage expansion in \n     housing available for the lowest income groups by continuing \n     to provide direct subsidies for low-rent housing and rural \n     housing. It would facilitate land assembly for urban \n     redevelopment by loans and contributions to local public \n     agencies where the localities do their share.\n       Prompt enactment of permanent housing legislation along \n     these lines will not interfere with the emergency action \n     already under way. On the contrary, it would lift us out of a \n     potentially perpetual state of housing emergency. It would \n     offer the best hope\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\n     and prospect to millions of veterans and other American \n     families that the American system can offer more to them than \n     temporary makeshifts.\n       I have said before that the people of the United States can \n     be the best housed people in the world. I repeat that \n     assertion, and I welcome the cooperation of the Congress in \n     achieving that goal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                   [From Mises Daily, Mar. 24, 2010]\n\nThe Federal Reserve as a Confidence Game: What They Were Saying in 2007\n\n                           (By Mark Thornton)\n\n       In February of 2004, I published an article entitled \n     ``Greenspam.'' The general lesson was not to listen to \n     Greenspan's deceptive testimony. Delete it from your mind \n     like spam email messages. Watch what he has done and what he \n     is doing, in order to protect your wealth and capital. \n     Discount anything you read about his testimony, except \n     Congressmen Paul's questions and commentary.\n       This talk will be a follow up to that article. I will \n     describe central banking as a confidence game. The Federal \n     Reserve plays a confidence game with us. A confidence game \n     (also known as a bunko, con, flimflam, hustle, scam, scheme, \n     or swindle) is defined as an attempt to defraud a person or \n     group by gaining their confidence. The victim is known as the \n     mark, the trickster is called a confidence man, con man, or \n     con artist, and any accomplices are known as shills. \n     Confidence men exploit human characteristics such as greed, \n     vanity, honesty, compassion, credulity, and naivete. The \n     common factor is that the mark relies on the good faith of \n     the con artist.\n       Here I will concentrate on the Fed's basic confidence game \n     of trying to gain and maintain our confidence in its system \n     and getting us to not take proper precautions against the \n     negative effects of its policies.\n       Inflation is surely a scam and part of the confidence \n     game--printing up money and lowering the value of all dollar-\n     denominated assets while simultaneously benefitting political \n     friends and accomplices is surely a fraud that could be \n     classified as a confidence game. This is even more true \n     because when the people finally lose confidence in the Fed \n     system and realize what the Fed has been doing, the game will \n     be up, the dollar will go down, and the Fed will come to an \n     end!\n       There are some more basic aspects of the fraudulent nature \n     of the Fed that I will not address here, Is the Fed a \n     ``conspiracy''? This is an aspect that is probably addressed \n     most fully by the G. Edward Griffin book, The Creature from \n     Jekyll Island. Or is the Federal Reserve just a cover for a \n     banking cartel? This question has been fully addressed in the \n     works of Murray Rothbard.\n       We will set aside some other fraudulent issues with the \n     Fed. Issues like, why hasn't the nation's gold supply been \n     audited in decades? Why hasn't the Fed itself been properly \n     audited? And has the Fed been manipulating the gold market or \n     surreptitiously leasing out the nation's gold supply? I \n     suppose all of these issues are related to the basic general \n     con game, but they are not necessary to make our general \n     point here today.\n       The basic focus here will be on the Fed's mission to \n     instill confidence in us about the economy while \n     simultaneously instilling confidence in us about the \n     abilities of the Fed itself. The first mission is easy to see \n     because Fed officials are almost always publically bullish \n     and hardly ever publically bearish about the economy. The \n     economy always looks good, if not great. If there are some \n     problems, don't worry, the Fed will come to the rescue with \n     truckloads of money, lower interest rates, and easy credit. \n     If things were to get worse, which they won't, the Fed would \n     be able to respond with monetary weapons of mass stimulation.\n       All this is consistent with the viewpoint of mainstream \n     economists who see the business cycle as caused by \n     psychological problems and random shocks. In their view, it \n     is your fault for becoming overly speculative and risky and \n     then lapsing into risk aversion and depression. It is your \n     fault!\n       I will also limit my analysis in terms of time. When the \n     subject of this talk was first constructed--so many months \n     ago--the only reason it was limited to 2007 was because that \n     was the period just prior to the onset of the current crisis. \n     The crisis finally revealed itself in 2007. With all the data \n     at their disposal, surely the Fed would have been alerting \n     the people to prepare for what was to come. In fact, we could \n     probably pick any time frame and find the consistently \n     bullish sentiment expressed by the establishment community. I \n     had no particular statements or testimony in mind when the \n     title of the talk was chosen, only the conviction that the \n     ``confidence game'' was a consistent and dependable part of \n     how the Fed operates.\n       I also limit my analysis to the leading officials of the \n     Federal Reserve. It is, after all, their game. However, we \n     could also extend the investigation and dependably find \n     similar statements and testimony from other government \n     officials from the Treasury Department and White House, as \n     well as the advocates and promoters of malinvestments from \n     Wall Street and the real-estate complex. What I will do here \n     is to cut and paste their words and present the relevant \n     highlights from their speeches. Predictably, their testimony \n     and speeches are highly nuanced and hedged.\n\n\n                                Bernanke\n\n       ``Central Banking and Bank Supervision in the United \n     States.''--Speech given at the Allied Social Science \n     Association Annual Meeting, Chicago, January 5, 2007.\n       Let us begin at the beginning of 2007 with the chairman of \n     the Fed, Ben Bernanke. The former economics professor from \n     Princeton gave an address to the annual meeting of the \n     American Economic Association. Bernanke is the first chairman \n     of the Fed from academia since Arthur Burns. It was Burns who \n     helped take us off the gold standard. God only knows where \n     Bernanke is leading us!\n       In addressing his fellow mainstream academic economists, \n     Bernanke was unusually bold in describing the Fed's access \n     and ability to use information and data concerning financial \n     markets. This knowledge and expertise includes the market for \n     derivatives and securitized assets. He describes the Fed as a \n     type of superhero for financial markets. In discussing the \n     Fed's role as chief regulator of financial markets he makes \n     powerful claims concerning the Fed's ability to identify \n     risks, anticipate financial crises, and effectively respond \n     to any financial challenge.\n       ``Many large banking organizations are sophisticated \n     participants in financial markets, including the markets for \n     derivatives and securitized assets. In monitoring and \n     analyzing the activities of these banks, the Fed obtains \n     valuable information about trends and current developments in \n     these markets. Together with the knowledge obtained through \n     its monetary-policy and payments activities, information \n     gained through its supervisory activities gives the Fed an \n     exceptionally broad and deep understanding of developments in \n     financial markets and financial institutions. . . .\n       In its capacity as a bank supervisor, the Fed can obtain \n     detailed information from these institutions about their \n     operations and risk-management practices and can take action \n     as needed to address risks and deficiencies. The Fed is also \n     either the direct or umbrella supervisor of several large \n     commercial banks that are critical to the payments system \n     through their clearing and settlement activities.''\n       In other words, the Fed knows everything about financial \n     markets. But it gets worse:\n       ``In my view, however, the greatest external benefits of \n     the Fed's supervisory activities are those related to the \n     institution's role in preventing and managing financial \n     crises.''\n       In other words, the Fed can prevent most crises and manage \n     the ones that do occur.\n       ``Finally, the wide scope of the Fed's activities in \n     financial markets--including not only bank supervision and \n     its roles in the payments system but also the interaction \n     with primary dealers and the monitoring of capital markets \n     associated with the making of monetary policy--has given the \n     Fed a uniquely broad expertise in evaluating and responding \n     to emerging financial strains.''\n       In other words, the Fed is an experienced, forward-looking \n     preventer of financial crises. This is a strong claim given \n     Bernanke's own abysmal record of forecasting near-term \n     events.\n       Chairman Bernanke is infamous on the internet because of \n     the YouTube video that chronicles his rosy view of the \n     developing crisis from 2005 to 2007. He denied there was a \n     housing bubble in 2005, he denied that housing prices could \n     decrease substantively in 2005 and that it would affect the \n     real economy and employment in 2006, and he tried to calm \n     fears about the subprime-mortgage market. He stated that he \n     expected reasonable growth and strength in the economy in \n     2007, and that the problem in the subprime market (which had \n     then become apparent) would not impact the overall mortgage \n     market or the market in general. In mid-2007 he declared the \n     global economy strong and predicted a quick return to normal \n     growth in the United States. Remember, Austrians were writing \n     about the housing bubble, its cause, and the probable \n     outcomes as early as 2003. Possibly the worst of Bernanke's \n     statements occurred in 2006, near the zenith of the housing \n     bubble and at a time when all the exotic mortgage \n     manipulations were in their ``prime.'' This was the era of \n     the subprime mortgage, the interest-only mortgage, the no-\n     documentation loan, and the heyday of mortgage-backed \n     securities. The new Fed chairman admitted the possibility of \n     ``slower growth in house prices,'' but confidently declared \n     that if this did happen he would just lower interest rates.\n       Bernanke also stated in 2006 that he believed that the \n     mortgage market was more stable than in the past. He noted in \n     particular that ``our examiners tell us that lending \n     standards are generally sound and are not comparable to the \n     standards that contributed to broad problems in the banking \n     industry two decades ago. In particular, real estate \n     appraisal practices have improved.''\n       This, my friends, is what the Fed is all about. Take a \n     $100-billion budget, thousands of economists and \n     statisticians, add in every piece of economic data, including \n     detailed information concerning every major financial firm, \n     and what do you come up with? They produced consistently \n     wrong answers, or answers that were designed to maintain the \n     ``confidence'' of the average citizen.\n\n\n                                Mishkin\n\n       ``Enterprise Risk Management and Mortgage Lending.''--\n     Speech given at the Forecaster's Club of New York on January \n     17, 2007.\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\n       Less than two weeks after Bernanke's address to the \n     American Economic Association, fellow academic Fred Mishkin, \n     a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, took the stage at \n     the Forecaster's Club of New York. A leading mainstream \n     economist and expert on money and banking, Mishkin addressed \n     the group on the topic of ``Enterprise Risk Management and \n     Mortgage Lending.''\n       He begins,\n       ``Over the past ten years, we have seen extraordinary run-\n     ups in house prices . . . but . . . it is extremely hard to \n     say whether they are above their fundamental value. . . . \n     Nevertheless, when asset prices increase explosively, concern \n     always arises that a bubble may be developing and that its \n     bursting might lead to a sharp fall in prices that could \n     severely damage the economy. . . .\n       The issue here is the same one that applies to how central \n     banks should respond to potential bubbles in asset prices in \n     general: Because subsequent collapses of these asset prices \n     might be highly damaging to the economy . . . should the \n     monetary authority try to prick, or at least slow the growth \n     of, developing bubbles? I view the answer as no.''\n       In others words, if the Fed is not worried, you shouldn't \n     be either.\n       ``There is no question that asset price bubbles have \n     potential negative effects on the economy. The departure of \n     asset prices from fundamentals can lead to inappropriate \n     investments that decrease the efficiency of the economy.''\n       In other words, there are some theoretical problems with \n     bubbles. But Mishkin has a theory that says there can be no \n     such things as bubbles.\n       ``If the central bank has no informational advantage, and \n     if it knows that a bubble has developed, the market will know \n     this too, and the bubble will burst. Thus, any bubble that \n     could be identified with certainty by the central bank would \n     be unlikely ever to develop much further.''\n       He then tells his listeners that in the unlikely event of a \n     bubble, it really would not be a problem:\n       ``Asset price crashes can sometimes lead to severe episodes \n     of financial instability. . . . Yet there are several reasons \n     to believe that this concern about burst bubbles may be \n     overstated.\n       To begin with, the bursting of asset price bubbles often \n     does not lead to financial instability. . . .\n       There are even stronger reasons to believe that a bursting \n     of a bubble in house prices is unlikely to produce financial \n     instability. House prices are far less volatile than stock \n     prices, outright declines after a run-up are not the norm, \n     and declines that do occur are typically relatively small. . \n     . . Hence, declines in home prices are far less likely to \n     cause losses to financial institutions, default rates on \n     residential mortgages typically are low, and recovery rates \n     on foreclosures are high. Not surprisingly, declines in home \n     prices generally have not led to financial instability. The \n     financial instability that many countries experienced in the \n     1990s, including Japan, was caused by bad loans that resulted \n     from declines in commercial property prices and not declines \n     in home prices.''\n       Boy, I bet he would like to take back his words today. \n     Everything he just said turned out to be untrue; and he \n     should have known that all of the assumptions he used to \n     quell fear and instill confidence were simply not true.\n       ``My discussion so far indicates that central banks should \n     not put a special emphasis on prices of houses or other \n     assets in the conduct of monetary policy. This does not mean \n     that central banks should stand by idly when such prices \n     climb steeply. . . .\n       Large run-ups in prices of assets such as houses present \n     serious challenges to central bankers. I have argued that \n     central banks should not give a special role to house prices \n     in the conduct of monetary policy but should respond to them \n     only to the extent that they have foreseeable effects on \n     inflation and employment. Nevertheless, central banks can \n     take measures to prepare for possible sharp reversals in the \n     prices of homes or other assets to ensure that they will not \n     do serious harm to the economy.''\n       In other words, the Fed likes bubbles. Mishkin says the Fed \n     is prepared to protect us from the bursting of the bubble, \n     but obviously he was wrong on that point too. Of course the \n     issue of the Fed causing bubbles is never broached, and if it \n     is, Fed officials will chime in to squash any such notion.\n\n\n                                  kohn\n\n       ``Financial Stability: Preventing and Managing Crises.''--\n     Speech given at the Exchequer Club Luncheon, Washington, DC. \n     February 21, 2007.\n       Fed Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn downplayed the possibility \n     of a crisis but said,\n       ``In such a world, it would be imprudent to rule out sharp \n     movements in asset prices and deterioration in market \n     liquidity that would test the resiliency of market \n     infrastructure and financial institutions.\n       While these factors have stimulated interest in both crisis \n     deterrence and crisis management, the development of \n     financial markets has also increased the resiliency of the \n     financial system. Indeed, U.S. financial markets have proved \n     to be notably robust during some significant recent shocks.''\n       In other words, just thinking about crises makes them less \n     likely.\n       ``The Federal Reserve, in its roles as a central bank, a \n     bank supervisor, and a participant in the payments system, \n     has been working in various ways and with other supervisors \n     to deter financial crises. As the central bank, we strive to \n     foster economic stability. As a bank supervisor, we are \n     working with others to improve risk management and market \n     discipline. And in the payments and settlement area, we have \n     been active in managing our risk and encouraging others to \n     manage theirs.''\n       In other words, the Fed will deter any crisis.\n       ``The first line of defense against financial crises is to \n     try to prevent them. A number of our current efforts to \n     encourage sound risk-taking practices and to enhance market \n     discipline are a continuation of the response to the banking \n     and thrift institution crises of the 1980s and early 1990s.''\n       ``Encourage sound risk-taking practices''--did I hear that \n     right?\n       ``Identifying risk and encouraging management responses are \n     also at the heart of our efforts to encourage enterprise wide \n     risk-management practices at financial firms. Essential to \n     those practices is the stress testing of portfolios for \n     extreme, or ``tail,'' events. Stress testing per se is not \n     new, but it has become much more important. The evolution of \n     financial markets and instruments and the increased \n     importance of market liquidity for managing risks have made \n     risk managers in both the public and private sectors acutely \n     aware of the need to ensure that financial firms' risk-\n     measurement and management systems are taking sufficient \n     account of stresses that might not have been threatening ten \n     or twenty years ago.''\n       In other words, the Fed's number one job is to prevent \n     ``extreme'' events--or was that, to cause such events?\n       ``A second core reform that emerged from past crises was \n     the need to limit the moral hazard of the safety net extended \n     to insured depository institutions--a safety net that is \n     required to help maintain financial stability. Moral hazard \n     refers to the heightened incentive to take risk that can be \n     created by an insurance system. Private insurance companies \n     attempt to control moral hazard by, for example, charging \n     risk-based premiums and imposing deductibles. In the public \n     sector, things are often more complicated.''\n       I guess they are! In other words the Fed must refrain from \n     bailing out markets or it will encourage risk and \n     speculation.\n       ``The systemic-risk exception has never been invoked, and \n     efforts are currently underway to lower the chances that it \n     ever will be.''\n       Well, I think that record has now been broken--into several \n     trillion pieces.\n\n\n                                Kroszner\n\n       ``Recent Innovations in Credit Markets.''--Speech given at \n     the Credit Markets Symposium at the Charlotte Branch of the \n     Federal Reserve Bank in North Carolina, March 22, 2007.\n       Fed Governor Randall S. Kroszner was the Fed's number-one \n     guy in terms of regulation of financial markets. He was the \n     point man in preventing things like systemic risk, but he \n     considered all this financial ``innovation'' and \n     ``engineering'' to be a good thing:\n       ``Credit markets have been evolving very rapidly in recent \n     years. New instruments for transferring credit risk have been \n     introduced and loan markets have become more liquid. . . . \n     Taken together, these changes have transformed the process \n     through which credit demands are met and credit risks are \n     allocated and managed. . . . I believe these developments \n     generally have enhanced the efficiency and the stability of \n     the credit markets and the broader financial system by making \n     credit markets more transparent and liquid, by creating new \n     instruments for unbundling and managing credit risks, and by \n     dispersing credit risks more broadly. . . .\n       The new instruments, markets, and participants I just \n     described have brought some important benefits to credit \n     markets. I will touch on three of these benefits: enhanced \n     liquidity and transparency, the availability of new tools for \n     managing credit risk, and a greater dispersion of credit \n     risk.''\n       What he then goes on to discuss are ``recent developments'' \n     such as credit default swaps (CDS) of which the ``fastest \n     growing and most liquid'' are credit-derivative indexes \n     involving such things as packages of subprime residential \n     mortgages. He says that ``Among the more complex credit \n     derivatives, the credit index tranches stand out as an \n     important development.''\n       He goes on to state that, historically, secondary markets \n     were illiquid and nontransparent (banks held their own \n     loans!). Now liquidity has improved and transparency has \n     improved. This promotes better risk management as risk is \n     measured and priced better because market participants have \n     better tools to manage risk. The result has been a ``wider \n     dispersion of risk.''\n       ``On its face, a wider dispersion of credit risk would seem \n     to enhance the stability of the financial system by reducing \n     the likelihood that credit defaults will weaken any one \n     financial institution or class of financial institutions.''\n       Yes, there are some concerns, but most of these concerns \n     are ``based on questionable assumptions.'' Yes, there is \n     risk, but it's the risk that has been out there all along; \n     now we can trade this risk among ourselves. There is \n     ``nothing fundamentally new to investors . . . credit \n     derivative indexes simply replicate the sort of credit \n     exposures that have always existed.'' Plus, remember that \n     this risk is greatly diminished because lenders require \n     borrowers to put up collateral.\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\n       What Kroszner has failed to realize is that by allowing \n     institutions to disperse their risk, the regulators have \n     encouraged and allowed for a huge increase in the aggregate \n     amount of risk. When banks kept their own loans on their own \n     books, they were careful to make prudent loans, but with \n     nearly free money available from the Fed, they wanted to make \n     more loans, and the only way to do that is to make riskier \n     loans. They didn't want to hold the risky loans so they \n     ``dispersed'' them.\n       Kroszner told his audience that the market already \n     experienced a surprise in May of 2005, but that since that \n     time much energy has been expended by market participants to \n     improve risk management.\n       We don't have to worry, Kroszner tells us, because Gerald \n     Corrigan is in charge of making sure nothing goes wrong. \n     Corrigan--a former president of the New York Fed and a \n     managing director in the Office of the Chairman of Goldman \n     Sachs--has been in charge of a private-sector group that \n     controls ``counterparty risk management policy'' for the \n     financial industry.\n       ``Cooperative initiatives, such as [this one led by \n     Corrigan] can contribute greatly to ensuring that those \n     challenges are met successfully by identifying effective \n     risk-management practices and by stimulating collective \n     action when it is necessary. . . . The recent success of such \n     initiatives strengthens my confidence that future innovations \n     in the market will serve to enhance market efficiency and \n     stability, notwithstanding the challenges that inevitably \n     accompany change.''\n       Checking ahead, we find Kroszner still bullish later that \n     same year.\n       ``Risk Management and the Economic Outlook.''--Speech given \n     at the Conference on Competitive Markets and Effective \n     Regulation, Institute of International Finance, New York. \n     November 16, 2007.\n       ``Looking further ahead, the current stance of monetary \n     policy should help the economy get through the rough patch \n     [yes, he called it a rough patch] during the next year, with \n     growth then likely to return to its longer-run sustainable \n     rate. As conditions in mortgage markets gradually normalize, \n     home sales should pick up, and homebuilders are likely to \n     make progress in reducing their inventory overhang. With the \n     drag from the housing sector waning, the growth of employment \n     and income should pick up and support somewhat larger \n     increases in consumer spending. And as long as demand from \n     domestic consumers and our export partners expand, increases \n     in business investment would be expected to broadly keep pace \n     with the rise in consumption.''\n       Over the next year, the Dow would lose 6,000 points; we \n     have now doubled the amount of unemployment, adding more than \n     7 million unemployed. Consumer confidence hit a 27-year low \n     this week, and sales of new homes hit the lowest level in a \n     half a century--the lowest level on record! Kroszner, an \n     economist groomed by the Institute for Humane Studies, has \n     since returned to the University of Chicago and the \n     directorship of the George Stigler Center.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       We can see that the Fed is a confidence game. Their public \n     pronouncements, while heavily nuanced and hedged, uniformly \n     present the American people with a rosy scenario of the \n     economy, the future, and the ability of the Fed to manage the \n     market. Ben Bernanke told Congress this week that we are in \n     the early stages of an economic recovery. Of course, he has \n     been saying that since the spring of 2009 (if not earlier). \n     These are the people who said that there was no housing \n     bubble, that there was no danger of financial crisis, and \n     then that a financial crisis would not impact the real \n     economy. These are the same people who said they needed a \n     multitrillion dollar bailout of the financial industry, or we \n     would get severe trouble in the economy. They got their \n     bailout, and we got the severe trouble anyways. It is time to \n     bring this game, this confidence game, to an end.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now be in a period \nof debate only with a 10-minute limitation on speeches, to accommodate \nthe speakers on Wall Street reform or other matters; that there be no \namendments or motions in order during this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I want to amend my shortcoming. Sorry about that. I would \nask that unanimous consent agreement be modified so that Senators Dodd \nand Shelby, the two managers of this banking bill, be recognized for up \nto 30 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I rise to discuss flood insurance extension and our need \nto address that now, to get rid of uncertainty in the market and real \nconcern that this will not be done in time, and the vital National \nFlood Insurance Program may be allowed to lapse yet again, as happened \nin the recent past.\n  Obviously, the National Flood Insurance Program is basic; it is \nnecessary. It is necessary for the entire country, for real estate \ntransactions everywhere. But it is certainly necessary in my home State \nof Louisiana and in a hurricane and flood zone.\n  As we sit here today, the National Flood Insurance Program will \nexpire in the first few days of June, during the Memorial Day recess. \nSo it is necessary and important that program be extended. I suggest we \ntake up this noncontroversial matter now, do it now. There is no \ncontroversy. There is no objection on the substance of the program.\n  This will accomplish two things. First of all, our taking it up now \nrather than at the last moment right when we are pushed up against the \nMemorial Day recess will take care of real uncertainty in the market \nand give everyone--homeowners, those who need these extensions, those \nwho need these policies, everyone in real estate--the security that \nthis will be extended properly through at least the end of the year.\n  Secondly, I think it is reasonable to take it out of the context of \nthe extenders package, which is otherwise very controversial. There are \na lot of elements of the extenders package which will merit debate. \nThere are a lot of elements of the extenders package which will be \ncontroversial and which will garner legitimate ``no'' votes.\n  This flood insurance extension is not one of them. This flood \ninsurance extension, on its merits, does not have controversy and does \nnot have objection, including because of the fact that it does not cost \nus anything. It is completely budget neutral, this extension through \nthe end of the year.\n  This approach, which would erase uncertainty, which would calm the \nmarkets, which would remove it from other unrelated more controversial \nissues, is supported by everyone in the marketplace. In that regard, I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter from \nthe National Association of REALTORS in strong agreement with this \napproach and a similar letter from the National Association of Mortgage \nBrokers in strong agreement with this approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, did my friend propound a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. VITTER. Simply to make these letters a part of the Record.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     National Association of Realtors',\n                                                     May 13, 2010.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: the National Association of \n     REALTORS' supports S. 3347, to extend authority \n     for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) until \n     December 31, 2010. The authority should be extended to \n     provide market certainty and give Congress sufficient time to \n     enact meaningful reform.\n       Most property buyers obtain federally related mortgage \n     loans to purchase property; for property located in a \n     federally designated floodplain, flood insurance is required \n     to obtain such a mortgage. When the NFIP expired earlier this \n     year, thousands of real-estate transactions were delayed, if \n     not cancelled. Extending the program until year's end will \n     provide much needed certainty to a recovering real estate \n     market and the millions of taxpayers nationwide who rely on \n     the program for basic flood protection.\n       We urge the Senate to pass S. 3347 to extend the NFIP, and \n     look forward to working with you as legislation is developed \n     to reform and reauthorize the program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Vicki Cox Golder, CRB,\n     2010 President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                             Mortgage Brokers,\n\n                                                     May 13, 2010.\n       Dear Senator, on behalf of the members of the National \n     Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB), I urge you to support \n     S. 3347, a bill introduced by Senator Vitter (R-LA)\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\n     to extend the National Flood Insurance Program through \n     December 31, 2010. NAMB applauds Senator Vitter for his \n     diligent work on this necessary bill to ensure continued \n     availability of coverage for homeowners living in areas prone \n     to flooding.\n       NAMB strongly supports this bill to extend the National \n     Flood Insurance Program to protect the nearly 5 million \n     homeowners living in high flood risk areas from losing their \n     property without being covered. This is particularly \n     significant for those home buyers in high flood risk areas \n     where flood insurance is required by law in order to qualify \n     for mortgage loans from federally regulated lenders. The \n     program has lapsed twice this year, severely hindering \n     borrowers from obtain homeownership in flood areas, and \n     countering any relief to the housing market. This legislation \n     is critical to the housing recovery, but is also equally \n     important to small businesses, which have suffered through \n     the economic decline. An extension to the program will \n     prevent any further disruptions to homeowners, and provide \n     much needed stability to the market.\n       We urge timely passage of this critical legislation and \n     believe it will provide necessary protections for consumers \n     in high flood risk areas, as well as help in the housing \n     recovery and relieve small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jim Pair, CMC,\n                                         NAMB President 2009-2010.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-consent Request--S. 3347\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, with that introduction, I would now \npropound my underlying unanimous-consent request. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of \nCalendar No. 372, which is the Vitter bill, S. 3347, a bill that \nextends the National Flood Insurance Program at no cost, deficit \nneutral, through December 31, 2010; that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my friend \nknows we have an extenders package which we have to complete before we \nleave for the Memorial Day recess. There are a number of matters in \nthat bill that are extremely important to people throughout this \ncountry, vital to people throughout this country.\n  My friend said his issue is noncontroversial. The controversy is in \nthe eye of the beholder. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, if I could inquire, \nthrough the Chair, what the basis of the objection is, I think that \nwould further the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator propounding \nan inquiry to other Senators? There is no right to ask a question of \nanother Senator who does not have the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, again, I was inquiring through the Chair. I ask \nunanimous consent to inquire through the Chair and to propound the \nquestion, What is the nature of the objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no objection to the request. No \nSenator is compelled to respond.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would simply make the request that we have a brief \nconversation about it, in that case. I realize no one is compelled to \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, it was a compelling argument. But, again, I am \nsaddened by the fact that we cannot proceed in a straightforward way. \nThere is no objection to the substance of this extension. This is a \nnecessary program. It is a vital program. The extension, which my bill \nwould accomplish through December 31, 2010, would be budget neutral and \ndeficit neutral.\n  We would take this out of a much more controversial debate. We would \nsettle the issue well before the program would otherwise expire. We \nwould give people confidence. We would settle the markets. We would \nhelp people in real estate. We would help people in the economy. I \nsuppose they are all compelling reasons not to travel down that path up \nhere in Washington.\n  I think that is a shame. I think it is really sad because this should \nbe, and is, on its substance noncontroversial.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the speakers on this side be \nin the following order: Senator Cardin be recognized for 5 minutes; \nthen the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley, be recognized for 10 \nminutes; then that I be recognize for 10 minutes on this side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend to modify his request so \nthat if there are Republicans who wish to be recognized, we would do \nthat alternately.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Leader. I intended that when I said ``on this \nside'' there would be alternates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is so modified. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to call to my colleague's \nattention my pending amendment, amendment No. 4050. This is the \namendment that would require the oil companies to disclose the payments \nthat they make to countries for mineral rights.\n  It is in order to give investors transparency and knowledge about the \nrisks that may be involved in regards to oil companies. This is real if \nyou look at what is happening in Nigeria and other countries.\n  Investors have a right to know where oil companies are making \npayments. This amendment would also further good governance. I think \nmost of us are familiar with the mineral curse; that is, countries that \nhave mineral wealth are some of the poorest in the world. It also helps \nfinance corruption because the government leaders are taking these \npayments for themselves rather than for the people of the country. My \namendment would require the SEC to allow for the disclosure of the \npayments made by oil companies that are regulated by the SEC.\n  This is mostly foreign companies. These are not U.S. companies by and \nlarge. It puts U.S. companies on a level playing field because U.S. \ncompanies are prohibited by law from being involved in any part of \ncorruption.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. It is cosponsored by Senator Lugar. \nHe has been one of the true leaders on this issue for many years. My \ncosponsors include Senators Durbin, Schumer, Feingold, Merkley, \nJohnson, and Whitehouse. It comes out of the work of the Helsinki \nCommission. We have held hearings on this within the Commission. This \nis one of the priorities we have on basic human rights. It is supported \nby the Obama administration.\n  I say all that knowing full well we are now postcloture. It is \nunlikely we will get a vote on this amendment. I find that disturbing. \nWe have made the technical changes in order to make sure we adhere to \nthe concerns expressed by Members. Quite frankly, I am not aware of any \nSenator who objects to the substance of this amendment. I hoped perhaps \nwe could move forward and include this, but I am a realist, and I \nunderstand the current circumstances.\n  I want my colleagues to know I will try to work with the chairman and \nranking member in conference to see whether we can get some of these \nprovisions included. We do have a similar provision on disclosure \nrelated to the Congo. We do have this subject matter that will be \nbefore the conferees.\n  I am hopeful, after conversations with Senators Dodd and Shelby, that \nwe will be able to continue this discussion as this bill moves forward \nto conference. I will also look for other opportunities to bring this \nissue back.\n  I know Senator Dodd has voiced his support for the amendment. I have \ntalked to Senator Shelby. He has indicated to me that he is sympathetic \nto the amendment. I hope we will be able to find a way to prevent the \ncitizens of Third World countries from being denied a share of the \nwealth of their own countries and to give investors the information \nthey need in order to make intelligent decisions as to whether they \nwant to invest in a particular company.\n  I want my colleagues to know that if we don't get a chance to vote on \nthis amendment tonight, it will not be the end. We will look for other \nopportunities, whether it is in conference or other bills that move \nforward.\n  I thank many of my colleagues who have been supportive. I know we \nwill succeed in protecting the mineral wealth of Third World nations \nfor the people of the country rather than to fund corruption and giving \ninvestors the information they should have as to whether they want to \ninvest in a mineral company.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, under the current unanimous consent \nagreement, there will be 10 minutes now for Senator Merkley, then to be \nalternated to the Republican side. Actually, it would go first to the \nRepublican side, then back to Senator Merkley. Then, if there is a \nRepublican, it would go back to the Republican and then back to me. \nThat is the current agreement.\n  Senator Enzi wishes to speak for up to 30 minutes. He has been \ngracious enough to agree that both Senator Merkley and I go with our \n10-minute remarks before him. I modify the unanimous consent agreement \nand ask unanimous consent that Senator Merkley be recognized for 10 \nminutes and then I be recognized for up to 10 minutes and then Senator \nEnzi be recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of a long path \nof consideration of fundamental financial reforms. A key piece of the \ndiscussion along that trail has been whether we are going to modify the \nway securities operate, how high-risk investment pools operate, and how \nordinary banking that takes deposits and makes loans operate, so that \nall three will do better in their role of aggregating capital and \nallocating capital.\n  We have some fundamental challenges in our society. One is that \ninside of a bank holding company, we have both the high-risk investing \nand the standard process of taking deposits and making loans. These two \nare both excellent systems, but they don't belong under the same roof. \nWhen they are under the same roof, they create two problems. The first \nproblem is the bank that is providing the loans has access to a \ndiscount window in insured deposits. All of that is intended to make \nsure money gets to small businesses and families. But when they are \nunder the same roof, we have the temptation of the resources being \ndirected to high-risk investing rather than getting into the hands of \nour families and small businesses.\n  In every corner of Oregon and in every corner of every State, folks \nare finding it hard to get loans. Lines of credit are being cut in \nhalf. Projects to expand and hire additional employees are being \nthwarted because the local bank says: We can't do any more lending \nbecause we have hit our limit on leverage and our capital is such-and-\nsuch.\n  We do not want large banks that have both functions to be diverting \ntheir energy and resources from the lending that is so important to \nMain Street into high-risk investing. They need to be separate for that \nreason.\n  The second reason is that when the investing blows up, as it does \nperiodically, then we have a situation where it blows up the lending, \nsends shock waves through lending. It causes lending to freeze. When \nthat happens, the economy suffers, Main Street suffers, and families \nsuffer. That is where we are right now.\n  Let's take a look at the facts. We have a situation where over the \npast couple years we have seen Lehman Brothers, which had high-risk \ntrading losses of over $30 billion, go down. Merrill Lynch had $20 \nbillion of loss, saved by TARP; Morgan Stanley, $10 billion, saved by \nTARP; JPMorgan Chase, $25 billion from TARP; Goldman Sachs, $10 billion \nfrom TARP; Bank of America, over $45 billion in TARP funds. Proprietary \ntrading blew up some of our biggest financial institutions and froze \nlending to businesses on Main Street across this Nation.\n  We need to have a firm separation. We need to make sure that if you \nare buying fireworks for the Fourth of July, you are not storing those \nin the living room. By that I mean high-risk investing is the \nfireworks, and you don't store them in your living room where you are \ndoing the lending so important to Main Street.\n  This is a Wall Street-Main Street battle. My colleague Senator Levin \nand I have been working on this for quite some time. We need to make \nour financial system work better for America.\n  Two days ago, we offered to have our amendment voted on, not with a \n50-vote standard but with 60 votes. The leadership across the aisle \nthwarted that unanimous consent request and said: You may not have a \nvote on your amendment.\n  Not even at 60 votes?\n  No, you may not.\n  Not even with two Democratic Senators off in their home States \nbecause they had primary elections?\n  No, you may not. You may not debate this amendment on the floor.\n  Quite frankly, that is the result of pressure from Wall Street saying \nthat fundamental financial reform should not be discussed in this \nChamber. What is this Chamber? Is this Chamber a puppet to Wall Street \nor are we a serious gathering of men and women from across the Nation \nwhose responsibility is to build a better financial system?\n  Another fundamental piece of this amendment is to end the conflict in \nsecurities. This is simple. If you design securities and you sell them, \nyou don't take out insurance on them because you think they might fail \nafter you have sold them. That is a fundamental conflict of interest.\n  That is like somebody who wires your house; you bring them to your \nhouse and you say: Please do the wiring or fix the wiring. And they \ntake out a fire policy on your house because they know they did such a \nbad job, they think your house is going to burn down. You would never \nhire that electrician. Or it is like a car dealer. The dealer says: I \nwill sell you this car. And after they sell it to you, they take out a \nlife insurance policy on you because they didn't do the brakes right. \nIt would make you pretty nervous. You would not buy a car from an auto \ndealer who has taken out an insurance policy on your life. That is a \nsimple issue addressed in the securities provision of this bill.\n  We are hearing word that Republicans are going to go through a \nparliamentary maneuver, even though our amendment is now in order and \npending, to kill debate on the pending Merkley-Levin amendment. We hope \nthat is not true, but we are hearing that in not so many minutes, \nsometime this evening, there is going to be a process to kill the \namendment our amendment is attached to so there will be no debate on \nthis issue.\n\n  I cannot believe the Senate of the United States is afraid to have a \ndebate and vote on fundamental financial reforms important to the \nintegrity of our securities and important to Main Street getting loans. \nBut that seems to be where we are headed. I hope I am wrong. I hope my \ncolleagues from across the aisle will come out and say: No, we have \nreconsidered. We think this body should debate serious issues. You \nmight win, you might lose, but we should hold the debate.\n  We have asked the Republican leadership to sever the connection \nbetween our amendment and the Brownback amendment, which are on \ndifferent topics. One is on fundamental financial structures, and one \nis on automobile dealers and whether they are covered by the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. We said: Sever them. Let each have a \nseparate debate. They have told us no. They will not sever the \nconnection and allow a debate on each topic. That is why, if the \nprimary amendment is withdrawn, ours will go down, too, and the people \nof the United States will be deprived of having a legislature that \ndebates seriously the structure of reform.\n  I will wrap it up. I know my colleague is going to expand on these \nremarks. It has been a pleasure working with him. It has been a \npleasure working with the Banking staff.\n  But before I conclude, I want my colleagues to know that based on the \nconversations I have had in this body, if we were to have this vote, we \nwould win tonight, based on the comments of folks who say they either \nsupport or are strongly leaning toward supporting it. That means we \nwould go to conference with a very strong position, as we should. If \nthis is withdrawn tonight, if we are not able to have this debate and \nvote, I hope the leadership on both sides of the aisle will say, even \nthough we didn't debate it, we will take this strong position for \nfinancial reform to the conference.\n  The USAA, which is a group that serves our veterans, has commented \nabout this amendment. They said:\n\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\n\n       Senators Merkley and Levin recognize the value of insurance \n     company investments which already are subject to well-defined \n     state insurance restrictions. . . . In that vein, we urge you \n     to support the amendment and include it in the Restoring \n     American Financial Stability Act that is passed out of the \n     United States Senate.\n\n  May 13, 2010.\n  A person from the Washington Post writes:\n\n       Probably the most important amendment comes from Sens. Carl \n     Levin and Jeff Merkley, Democrats from Michigan and Oregon, \n     respectively. It would replace the vague language of the Dodd \n     bill, which gives discretion to regulators as to how much \n     proprietary trading they would allow, with a clear provision \n     banning federally insured banks from such trading \n     respectively (the ``Volcker rule''). If the banks want to \n     turn themselves into casinos, they can--but if Merkley-Levin \n     passes, they would do so without taxpayer support when their \n     bets go sour.\n\n  A New York Times editorial:\n\n       The Senate bill also imposes needless delays on the \n     enactment of the so-called Volcker rule, which would bar \n     banks from making risky market trades for their own accounts \n     and from owning hedge funds and private equity funds. \n     Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, \n     both Democrats, have an amendment to enact the Volcker rule \n     without undue delays or tinkering.\n\n  The Independent Community Bankers of America is asking for this to be \npassed to strengthen our financial system.\n  The Campaign for America's Future, the former head of Citibank, who \nwatched as the two sides of his bank collided in a spectacular \ndisaster, are supporting this amendment. This amendment should be \ndebated and voted on on the floor of the Senate. To do otherwise would \nnot fulfill our responsibility to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Merkley for \nhis extraordinary work on this amendment of ours. We are very hopeful \nwe are going to be able to get to a vote. As it stands right now, we \nare going to get to a vote because we are the pending amendment. That \nis where it stands. We are in order. We are germane. It is postcloture \nbut we are germane. The only way we know of where we could be thwarted \nfrom getting to a vote is if there were a decision made on the other \nside to withdraw the underlying amendment. We hope that decision will \nnot be made.\n  These issues are too important not to be voted on. A parliamentary \ntrick should not be used now to avoid a vote on this critically \nimportant amendment, which will strengthen in very significant ways the \nunderlying Dodd bill.\n  We saw, weeks ago, that the Republican leadership was going to try to \ndeny us the opportunity to even get to this bill, and there was such a \npublic outrage at the Republican filibuster that they had to back off \nfrom that. Well, if we do not get to a vote tonight on Merkley-Levin, \nthere is going to be similar outrage from people because they \nunderstand what the stakes are. The stakes are whether we are going to \ntake the steps to avoid a repeat of the deep recession we are now in--a \nrecession that was brought about in large measure by the excesses, the \nextreme greed of Wall Street, taking high-risk mortgages, dubious \nmortgages, securitizing them, dicing them, slicing them in different \nways, enlarging the risk dramatically, selling them to clients and \ncustomers, and then, to add insult to injury, betting against them--in \nthe case of Goldman Sachs, making a fortune on those bets; in the case \nof the banks that bet the other way, ending up being bailed out by the \ntaxpayers on the losing bets.\n  That is what has happened. While our constituents may not be able to \ndefine what a collateralized debt obligation is or what a naked default \nswap is--and there are very few people in the country who can--they do \nknow they have been had. They know how many houses in their \nneighborhoods have been vacated, have been foreclosed upon. They know \nbecause they themselves or their neighbors have been unable to keep up \nwith mortgage payments because the value of housing has gone down, and \nthey sense that the Wall Street greed was a big part of this.\n  It is more than the greed. It is the conflicts of interest which \naccompanied that greed. Our bill addresses some of the major problems \nthat got us here, and some of that is proprietary trading where the \nWall Street banks put their own interests ahead of their clients' \ninterests and gambled--gambled, as it ended up--with our taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  So our constituents understand this. What I want to do is spend the \nfew minutes I have left talking about the conflict of interest that \nexisted on Wall Street: betting against themselves. I think yesterday's \nNew York Times perhaps quoted someone who put it best--a man named \nCornelius Hurley, director of the Morin Center for Banking and \nFinancial Law at Boston University and former counsel to the Federal \nReserve Board. This is what he said:\n\n       Their business model--\n\n  The business model that now exists at banks such as Goldman--\n\n     has completely blurred the difference between executing \n     trades on behalf of customers versus executing trades for \n     themselves. It's a huge problem.\n\n  That shift in the business model has to be addressed by us. We have \nto act to put an end to the conflict of interest which exists when a \nGoldman Sachs--as we showed at our hearing--is able to sell securities \nto customers, packaging these mortgage-based debts, these asset-backed \nsecurities or these securities which referred to assets--these are the \nsynthetic ones where there is nothing there but a reference to some \nother security, a bet--and then betting against their own customers.\n  This was one of the most dramatic findings of our subcommittee. Our \nsubcommittee investigated this matter for about a year and a half. We \nhad four hearings. We had millions of pages of documents. We started \nwith a bank in the State of Washington which took dubious mortgages--\nfraudulent mortgages, in many cases, in a large percentage of the \ncases--based on liar loans, where the mortgage companies would fill in \nthe amount of people's income and then securitize them. Because they \nsaw--and we had the evidence in their e-mails, where the mortgage \ncompanies saw--there was a high default rate in these mortgages, they \ndecided they better get them off their books quick because there were \nhigh defaults coming down the river.\n  So what happened? They securitized them, shipped these to a very \nwelcoming Wall Street that would then resecuritize them, slice them in \na different way, sell them to their customers, and then bet against \nthem. The added insult was when, inside the same bank, the salespeople \nknew they were selling junk and said so in e-mails in words that are \neven worse than ``junk''--treating customers that way, putting their \nown interests at Goldman Sachs ahead of the interests of their \ncustomers.\n  That is what happened. We have to end this conflict, and we have to \ngive the Securities and Exchange Commission the running orders to end \nthe conflict. That is what our amendment does. We do it in a very \nthoughtful way, a very careful way. We set forth the requirement that \nthe conflict of interest be ended, but we assign the Securities and \nExchange Commission the responsibility to end it, to implement the \nconflict of interest prohibition we have in our bill.\n  As Senator Merkley said, we have heard there is a possibility that \nthe Republicans are going to withdraw the underlying amendment. That \nwould be an incredible signal of the power of Wall Street that the \nunderlying amendment, which has the support of so many people on both \nsides of the aisle--and probably majority support in this body relative \nto the treatment of car loans--that that amendment might be withdrawn \nin order to kill Merkley-Levin. That is the rumor we keep hearing this \nafternoon. It is the only way they can stop this amendment from coming \nto a vote that we know of.\n  We believe, as Senator Merkley said, there should be a vote on both \namendments; that these two matters should be split. The only way we \ncould get a vote on Merkley-Levin--this incredibly important \nstrengthening amendment to the underlying Dodd bill--was by offering it \nas a second-degree amendment to the Brownback amendment. We are \nperfectly happy to have separate votes.\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nThat is the best way to do it. We cannot do that without unanimous \nconsent. But rather than agreeing to separate votes, so both matters \ncould be voted on and disposed of by the Senate, what we keep hearing \nis they may withdraw the underlying amendment and bring down the \npending Merkley-Levin amendment with it.\n  If you needed any additional evidence of the power of Wall Street \naround this body, that would be it. If that happened--to withdraw an \namendment which is so important to a majority, probably, of the body--\nto make it impossible for us to vote on Merkley-Levin would be some of \nthe most powerful evidence--and there has been plenty of it--of the \npower of Wall Street, the long arm of Wall Street reaching into this \nbody.\n  I hope it is not true. But being honest with our colleagues, this is \nwhat we hear is possibly in the wings. It would be a disservice to the \npeople of the United States not to have a vote on Merkley-Levin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there was a request made to me by the \nSenator from Delaware if he could have 1 minute to add his name to this \ndiscussion that has just been held. I ask unanimous consent that it not \nbe taken out of my time, but that 1 minute be given to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I thank my neighbor across the hall from \nWyoming. He is a gentleman, as always, and I appreciate it.\n  I just want to stand and say, from the beginning I have talked about \none of the most important parts of this bill is that we make sure we \nseparate commercial banking activities from investment banking \nactivities. It is very important we have commercial banks that are \nsafe, with deposits supported by the FDIC, but that they not be in \nrisky business.\n  I just want to say, I agree with the Senator from Michigan and the \nSenator from Oregon that it is absolutely essential we have a vote on \nMerkley-Levin and find the will of the Senate on the fact that we \nshould not have banks involved in proprietary betting, and that we go \nwith what the President and former Fed Chairman Volcker said, and go \nwith a bill that separates these and does not allow banks to be \ninvolved in proprietary trading. It is absolutely essential.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Wyoming, a gentleman, as always.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the amendment \nthat has just been talked about is not the only one that is not getting \na vote that is absolutely essential to making this bill work--the \namendments the American people expect.\n  There was some comment about the Brownback amendment. That is one to \nallow automobile dealers to still sell automobiles, which they may not \nbe able to do under this bill the way it is written. Another concern, \nof course, comes from anybody else who sells something on installment. \nThat would include dentists and realtors and a whole range of people \nwho sell things that way, and they are not going to be allowed to get a \nfix under this bill.\n  So I want you to understand how wide-ranging this bill is. This is \ngoing to get into everybody's pockets. I am not talking about \nbusinesses; I am talking about individuals. The dadgum government is \ngoing to be in everybody's pockets with this bill. This gives the \ngovernment permission to look at your records. In fact, it requires \nyour bank to keep them and send them to the Federal Government--to this \nnew bureau we are creating.\n  This little 1,408-page bill, which with amendments I think is now \nover 1,500 pages, probably should have been three bills. It probably \nshould have been three bills. We could have worked it properly, and \nmaybe people would have read it.\n  The Republicans did stop cloture twice, and they did it so they could \namend the too big to fail. Too big to fail was actually a bailout--a \nperpetual bailout--for big banks. That is why Goldman Sachs, at a \nhearing here, said: Well, we can live with that. That is why Citi said \nthey could live with it. The big banks did not have any problem with \nit. But it has been revised now because it was held up, and we were \nfinally able to get some amendments on the first section.\n  There is another section in here. It is called derivatives. We talk \nabout ``derivatives'' because we know America will not understand that, \nso they, again, will not understand how we are getting into their \npockets. But that is a section that needed changes. I think the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, the chairman, Mr. Dodd, realized that and drew up \nsome. But it is my understanding he was not allowed to put those in \nhere, even though I read in the paper one morning, joyously, that he \nhad some amendments that were going to make some corrections. But he \nwas forced not to put them in.\n  So that is one-third of the bill that, obviously, has some faults in \nit yet. But that is not even the part I am really concerned about. I am \nconcerned about this last third of the bill. It is 268 pages. Of \ncourse, there are another 100 pages that follow that of other acts that \nare going to be affected by it.\n  This is a brandnew bureau. We don't have enough government? We are \ngoing to start a whole new bureau, and we are going to turn everything \nfinancial over to that bureau. But don't worry about it. We are going \nto stick it into the Federal Reserve, which we don't have any control \nover, and we are telling the Federal Reserve: You don't have any \ncontrol over this new bureau, but you have to give up to 12 percent of \nyour money to operate this bureau. That is why we put it under there; \nit will be off budget so it will not show up right away in the \ndeficits, but it does. It is going to cost us 12 percent of the \noperating revenue of the Federal Reserve. Does anybody know how much \nthat is? Well, they are going to get 12 percent of it. What fascinates \nme is that following that, there is a paragraph that says it will be \nadjusted for inflation. Wow. Let's see. If I get 12 percent of \nsomething, it is probably an expanding amount from year to year anyway, \nbut if it doesn't expand one year, this bureau is still going to get \nthe money as though the economy had expanded.\n  I get worked up over it because I had an amendment that I think might \nhave solved things for people--it certainly would have calmed me down a \nlittle bit--and that is one that would have provided for personal, \nindividual privacy. I wasn't allowed to bring that up. I wasn't allowed \nto make it pending, in which case it would have been germane now and in \nwhich case we would have been able to vote on it now. I was kept from \ndoing that. That is because somebody intends to give this bureau \nunlimited power to snoop. It is going to be devoted to snooping into \npersonal records. My amendment very simply would have prevented Big \nBrother from looking over your shoulder at your personal financial \nrecords unless you give permission.\n  Part of what we want to do is, if you are having a problem with your \ncredit card company, we are hoping there is some way to fix it. \nSometimes that happens in your State, but it doesn't always happen in \nthe State. So the way this was sold is if you are having a problem with \nyour credit card and you get ahold of this bureau, by golly, they will \nstraighten it out. They will be looking at your records whether you \nhave a problem or not. Maybe they are going to decide whether you have \na problem or not. There is no real jurisdiction in here. There are 268 \npages, but it doesn't say exactly what this outfit is going to do and \nthey get to write their own rules and nobody gets to oversee the rules. \nThen they enforce those rules, and there isn't any real limit on that \nexcept for the amount of fines they can charge, which they mention, and \nthey are pretty drastic anyway.\n  So your bank is going to have to keep your records for 3 years, and \nthey are going to have to send them to this bureaucracy. I will point \nout some other things they are going to require with your personal \naccounts. It should have been in there.\n  When I was talking about this, I picked up several people on the \nother side of the aisle. It would have been a\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nbipartisan amendment that I am sure would have passed, but it created a \nlittle concern over there, so they came out with their own version of \nthe privacy amendment. Mine was a mere couple sentences long; theirs \nwas considerably longer than that. But mine did something, theirs \ndidn't. So I proposed an amendment to protect consumer privacy to give \neach of us a choice in how little or how much financial data the \nFederal Government and this bureau would be able to access and if we \nwanted their help. My amendment very simply prevented Big Brother from \nlooking over your shoulder on a daily basis at your personal financial \nrecords.\n  Rather than fixing the problem, I mentioned this side-by-side \namendment, No. 4082, that makes the government intrusion even worse. \nUnder that privacy amendment, it didn't do anything to stop the so-\ncalled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--I think it ought to be \ncalled the Consumer Financial Control Bureau--from snooping wherever \nthey want. In fact, your bank, as I mentioned, would have to send them \nrecords.\n  I wish to be a little bit more specific. I will explain why the Dodd \namendment is worse than the underlying bill because it tries to trick \nthe people with the promise of privacy and, at the same time, uses \nweasel words to comb through your personal lives anyway. I will lay out \nhow the Federal Government will be watching over your shoulders with \nfreedoms just slipping away a little at a time.\n  The underlying bill and the Dodd amendment both use slippery sleight \nof words, but this isn't some magic trick that will suddenly disappear. \nNo, my friends, this would be one of the sickest jokes you can imagine.\n  I stand before you to educate the people of America about the \nfallacies in this underlying bill. I stood before my colleagues a few \ndays ago saying that I recognize some consumers out there may want the \ngovernment in their lives monitoring their transactions. I still do not \nclaim to understand that desire, but my amendment would not take away \ntheir choice in the matter. In fact, my amendment would allow me as a \nconsumer--if I get into credit card trouble and want the bureau's help, \nall I have to do is contact the bureau and give them permission to look \nat my financial documents. People who are having problems with the \nFederal Government get ahold of our staff people in our State all the \ntime so we can work on straightening out that problem with the Federal \nGovernment. But you know what. You better have them sign a privacy \nrelease or you could be in big trouble. This bureau isn't going to have \nto get a privacy release. My amendment would give consumers the ability \nand the personal option. As long as the bureau has written permission \nfrom a consumer, they can look at the financial past, present, and \nfuture. Without my amendment, they can look at your financial past, \npresent, and future without your permission.\n  I am adamantly opposed to this privacy amendment that was drafted by \nthe other side. It paves the way for a radical shift away from your \nright to privacy. I hope you will take a few seconds necessary to read \nthe two-page amendment, No. 4083, the side-by-side to my privacy \namendment. If you do, you will instantly notice the weasel words in \nthis amendment. That amendment and the underlying bill promote yet \nanother government takeover of another portion of our lives. They want \nto take over how we spend our money.\n  Think of all the takeovers there have been in the last year and a \nhalf. This one is the big one--your finances. The American people have \nhad enough government takeovers already, and I don't think they will \nstand for the Federal Government accessing one more facet of our lives. \nAlthough I respect my colleague from Connecticut and the other people \non the other side of the aisle, this version of sham privacy would \nactually encourage a takeover of your finances behind your back or \nmerely in the name of protecting us from ourselves. As I mentioned, \none-third of this bill is devoted to snooping into records. This bill \nwas supposed to be about regulating Wall Street. Instead, it is \ncreating a Google Earth of your every financial transaction. That is \nright. The government will be able to see every detail from the 50,000-\nfoot perspective or they can look right down into the tiny details to \nthe time and place where you pulled cash out of an ATM. The real kicker \nis, despite claiming the Dodd amendment creates privacy protection, it \ndoesn't do anything to stop this snooping into individuals' lives.\n  Yesterday, I read an article in the Philadelphia Enquirer from former \nSenator Rick Santorum, who is a former colleague of mine from \nPennsylvania. In this article, he talks about the lack of reform of the \nhousing markets and more specifically how the greatest contributors to \nthe collapse of the housing market--the GSEs, Fannie Mae, and Freddie \nMac--have gone untouched and unreformed in this bill. We had a \ndiscussion on that in the Budget Committee. We had a little amendment \nthat would have made sure the liabilities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nwould show up on the Federal financial statement because the Federal \nGovernment is liable for them. The answer was: Well, we can't take it \noff their balance sheet and put it on ours because that would make them \nlook good. I said: Oh, no, no. You wouldn't take it off theirs. It \nwould be a consolidated statement. It would show up on both of them. \nBut what the Federal Government owes ought to be clear--not that we do \ngood governmental accounting around here.\n\n  This bill even leaves their $800 billion spending ability intact for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  So then Senator Santorum asked if Fannie and Freddie had gone \nuntouched and this entire bill was meant to rein in Wall Street--``What \nis the 1,565-page''--looking at the printed copy on our desks--\n``financial reform bill that's up for a vote this week in the Senate?''\n  He says:\n\n       My favorite among the bill's assaults on free enterprise--\n     and, more important, individual liberty--is the proposed \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This latest concept to \n     come from the Obama administration's ivory tower types is not \n     your run-of-the-mill bureaucracy. The theory behind it is \n     behavioral regulation.\n       Let's talk about that a little more. Behavioral regulation \n     is studying human behavior interactions and habits such as \n     how we spend our money, go about our daily lives, so humans \n     can be better governed, ruled, or controlled. You can pick \n     your verb, but no matter what, this ``behavioral regulation'' \n     sets up the government to interject and use its strong arm in \n     our daily financial transactions.\n\n  To continue with the Senator's article, he says:\n\n       The academic-turned-bureaucrat who came up with the bureau \n     is Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Barr, who has penned \n     such articles as ``Behaviorally Informed Financial Services \n     Regulation.'' Wonder what might be in store? Think czar for \n     checking accounts and credit cards. According to Barr \n     himself, `` . . . regulatory choice ought to be analyzed \n     according to the market's stance towards human fallibility.'' \n     That's right: He thinks our market-based economy is composed \n     of businesses designed to bilk people by exploiting their \n     flaws. I assume his research shows that government \n     bureaucrats don't share that human fallibility.\n\n  Let me say that again. He talks about business trying to bilk people, \nbut evidently his research doesn't show that government bureaucrats \nwould have that same potential flaw.\n  Continuing:\n\n       How would the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau come to \n     know you and what financial products are best for you? It \n     would be given the power to collect information on businesses \n     and individuals. It would even be able to require you--\n\n  Now listen carefully to this--\n\n       It would even be able to require you to answer questions \n     under oath about your personal finances.\n       Barr and his nanny-state administration colleagues are \n     working to require that some banks ``geo-code'' deposits to \n     allow tracking of their origins and provide other information \n     about their accounts. Think Google Earth for all our personal \n     financial transactions. I hope the data are more secure than \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       While the President has deceptively characterized this \n     debate as being about Wall Street vs. Main Street, \n     congressional Democrats have refused to police their side of \n     the street--Fannie and Freddie. Instead, they continue to \n     deny public opinion and push a bill that will further expand \n     government, invade our privacy, and assume even more control \n     over our lives.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from former Senator Santorum.\n  Think about this: The Federal Government would now be allowed to \ncollect all kinds of financial data about consumers, not just about \npotentially deceptive practices or even shady Wall Street actions but, \nmore specifically,\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\nmonitoring how we as consumers do our banking, how and why we purchase \nproducts, where and when we pull $20 out of the ATM. I ask you: How \ndoes this snooping into our daily personal lives protect consumers? \nThis bill was sold to the public as a way to rein in Wall Street, but \nnear as I can tell, this one section that we haven't talked much about \nis the perfect excuse for Big Brother to worm his way even further into \nour lives and our privacy.\n  I now wish to read two paragraphs in the underlying bill. These \nparagraphs are from the misnamed ``Consumer Protection'' title X. On \npage 1,239, section 1022(c)(4)(b)--isn't that fascinating--it says:\n\n       The Bureau may: (B) require persons to file with the \n     Bureau, under oath or otherwise, in such form and within such \n     reasonable period of time as the Bureau may prescribe, by \n     rule or order, annual or special reports, or answers in \n     writing to specific questions, furnishing such information as \n     the Bureau may require.\n\n  The reference on that was section 1022(c)(4)(b), which in the printed \ncopy is on a different page than the page I stated. It is closer to the \nbeginning of the section.\n  So the paragraph I just read says the bureau can gather and comb \nthrough your financial information ``as the Bureau may require.''\n  Remember, I said they get to set their own rules. Nobody approves \ntheir rules. They do the enforcement. Nobody is over them in \nenforcement.\n  So continuing on to the following paragraph (c), which is on page \n1,240 if you are looking on the computer:\n\n       The Bureau may: Make public such information obtained by \n     the Bureau under this section, as is in the public interest \n     in reports or otherwise in the manner best suited for public \n     information and use.\n\n  In case you missed the implications of this, I will spell it out \nfurther. Not only does the bureau have the power under this bill to \nmake consumers testify under oath, the bureau could then publish any or \nall information they have gathered about consumers and publish or use \nthis information as they see fit.\n  In reality, this bill encourages consumers to rely on government to \nprotect us from ourselves, from bad decisions we make, instead of \nempowering personal due diligence. We have the inherent freedom in this \ncountry to make choices and even the freedom to make bad choices. In \nAmerica, that is the way it works, and that is how it is supposed to \nwork.\n  I went to an honor flight yesterday for Wyomingites who fought in \nWorld War II, to visit their memorial--it was very late in happening--\nand all of them are over 80 years old. They are paying more attention \nthan they ever have in my lifetime to what is going on in the Federal \nGovernment. They had questions about what is going on here. They said: \nYou know, we didn't fight for that. We fought for freedom.\n  This bureau may create some much needed protections for consumers, \nbut it goes too far. Without my amendment, the bureau will be required \nto collect daily transactional financial services information on every \nconsumer. The government would see every time you need money or buy \nanything online, if they want to.\n  I offer another choice to my colleagues and the people of the United \nStates. This choice allows consumers to let the bureau into their \npersonal lives if they so choose. I am hoping that before this comes \nback from conference committee, they build privacy into section 10. \nThey really need to. If there was going to be a managers' amendment, it \nwasn't going to have the privacy piece. But there is not going to be a \nmanagers' amendment now because we are limiting amendments because this \nis taking so long. There are 1,408 pages, and it ought to take a while \nto talk about this.\n  I had a visit from the economic adviser of the President, Mr. \nSummers. I just talked about this section. He said: No, no, no, this \nwill work like the FDA and OSHA.\n  I know people aren't too pleased about OSHA, but I couldn't buy that \nargument because I am ranking member on the HELP Committee. OSHA is \nunder us and FDA is under us. We know about oversight and who has \ncontrol and who writes the regulations and who gets to oversee the \nregulations and, just as important, where they get their budget, the \nappropriations, the money to operate.\n  Remember, I said this one is going to get 12 percent of the operating \nrevenues of the Federal Reserve. That won't show up in the score \nbecause the Federal Reserve is over on the side. The amendment we had \nto have an audit of the Federal Reserve--which is probably long \noverdue--will show that. But it won't show up in the score because they \nare spending it before it comes into the Federal Government's budget. \nBut it will reduce the amount of money that comes to the Federal \nGovernment. So it will add to the debt and the deficit.\n  I think we ought to require this new bureau--new bureau? How many \npeople do you think they will hire? In the health bill, we gave \npermission and I guess it is for IRS agents to look at who is buying \ninsurance and who is not and whether they are buying the mandatory \ninsurance, the mandatory minimum we put on there--we hired 16,000 IRS \nagents. That is where the growth is in the job market. It is still \nstagnant, but we are adding a lot of government employees--16,000 IRS \nagents--to see if you are buying the right kind of insurance or paying \na fee if you don't.\n  Well, that is minor in light of this one. We didn't even say how big \nthis bureau could be. We didn't limit their money. We didn't say we \nwould ever look at anything they do. I am sure we are going to have to \nbecause we are going to have people from all over this country yelling \nand screaming about somebody getting into their pockets.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the amendment I have offered when \nthey get to conference committee. I am certain they are going to make a \nconference committee or I hope they have a conference. There are still \nproblems in every single section, and maybe they can solve some of \nthem.\n  The way we do it now is we lay down a bill and say: This is the way \nit is going to be. If you want to make a little tweak, OK, but don't \ncount on making any major changes.\n  When Senator Kennedy and I worked on bills, we went through the \ncommittee process, and we looked at every amendment that came in, \nrecognizing there was this seed of an idea there that maybe needed to \nbe included in the bill. The whole thing might not work, but there \nought to at least be a seed there because somebody thought of a way the \nbill ought to be improved.\n  We have eliminated that this year. Now we are going to take it to the \nfloor, and if you want to try to make an amendment, you can. But \nremember, we have the majority of the votes, and we will put a 60-vote \nthreshold on it, which means neither side will be able to do many \namendments, and that has been shown here. Immediately, we will complain \nabout how much time has been taken to debate this bill. Let me tell \nyou, a whole lot more time should have been taken to debate this bill, \nand more amendments should have been looked at with this bill. We might \nhave made a unanimous consent that they all had to be relevant, but we \nshould have considered the relevant ones and not gone off into \ndifferent areas.\n  A lot of people are complaining about this. They have looked at their \npart of the bill, and they know it is going to damage their business. \nThat is why there was the amendment to fix things for the auto dealers. \nThat is just one small part of people who do things on a series of \npayments. An orthodontist talked to us, and they do dental work over a \nperiod of time and take payments. I don't know if that will be possible \nanymore. We are not going to exempt anybody; we are not going to exempt \nany individual. They are all going to be required to pony up and show \nwhat they have, no matter how personal their finances are to them.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to think about what this \namendment and underlying bill will do to their privacy. To my \ncolleagues especially, your constituents will not stand for this \ninvasion of privacy or these sham attempts at privacy. Do them a favor: \nlet them make their own choices about who can get in their bank \naccounts and who can't.\n  I don't very often get upset. But I am upset. I think I am just a \nreflection of the average person out there--the average person who \nmight have looked through a little bit of this, and they can do that on \nthe computer now--and they expect us to read it, and I expect a lot of \npeople have not read title X. If\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\nthey did, I think they would be just as upset as I am--all 268 pages of \nit. A brandnew bureau, new bureaucracy, total autonomy, funded by the \nFederal Reserve, as I mentioned--12 percent of their operating \nrevenues. Does anybody know how much that is? Again, they do that so it \nis off budget. The Federal Reserve will not have any control over this \noutfit. It is just under there for the purpose of the money.\n  Here is another thing that fascinates me. If they have revenue left \nover at the end of the year, they get to invest it. It doesn't say we \ncan look and see how much they have and how much they are investing and \nhow much autonomy they have because of the money they banked. It \ndoesn't say that if they have excess money one year, the amount they \nwill get will be less the next year. No, they are guaranteed 12 percent \nthe next year, plus inflation. I don't know how we write bills like \nthat.\n  They have the exclusive enforcement authority. They can coordinate \nexaminations with other regulators, but they are the primary \nenforcement authority, not anybody who might have some oversight. They \nare the primary authority, and you will find that on page 1103 of the \nhard copy.\n  Let's see. At first, when you are reading this section, you think \nthis is just going to cover banks that have over $10 billion. That is \npage 1101. Then you think, I don't have very many banks over $10 \nbillion, and I am for small business anyway. So my community banks and \ncredit unions are going to be OK. Then you get to page 1110, which says \nthe rules cover everybody under $10 billion. Let's see. If it covers \neverybody over $10 billion and everybody under $10 billion, with my \nmath, that is everybody. Everybody is going to be controlled by this \nnew consumer protection bureau. It really ought to be called a consumer \ncontrol bureau.\n  Well, let's move to page 1139, the mortgage loan disclosure document. \nYou are going to get another disclosure document now when you buy a \nhouse. We get to oversee the director, but that is the last oversight \nwe get. He gets to hire anybody he wants. Then he gets--if he gets \naround to it--to write rules and regulations and make up a new mortgage \nloan disclosure document. You don't have any obligation to maintain \npersonal records--1141. They are going to look at them, and you are \ngoing to want to answer when they do that.\n  Page 1145 is going to provide a private education loan ombudsman. \nNormally, that sounds good. This would be somebody who straightens \nthings out, I guess, with your loan operator or maybe even with the \nconsumer protection bureau that will have all this control over you. \nPage 1146 says the ombudsman evaluates his own effectiveness annually. \nHow zealous is he going to be?\n  I have a whole list of things here I won't go into. My time is up. I \nshould have asked for my whole hour under postcloture. Look at this \nbill, and you will be just as upset as I am.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a bipartisan amendment \nI have spent many weeks working on with Senator Brown of Massachusetts. \nIt is an amendment dealing with a very crucial issue--a major gap in \nour system of financial regulation. It has been approved by Senator \nShelby, the distinguished ranking Republican, and also by Senator Dodd. \nIn fact, I think it is fair to say that if we can get a vote on it \ntonight, it would have enormous bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I am concerned that we won't get a vote on amendment No. 3982, and as \na result it is very likely this bill will pass.\n  After all the problems the country has seen with these large banks \nand large financial institutions, it still will be possible for a bank \nto sell a product to an institution or a consumer, bet against that \nproduct, and it will not be disclosed to the buyer. That is not right.\n  What Senator Brown and I have been able to do, working with Senator \nShelby's very capable staff and Senator Dodd's very capable staff, is \nwe have been able to put together a bipartisan amendment--the new \nSenator from Massachusetts and myself--that would close this loophole, \nthat would ensure there is at least simple, garden-variety, basic \ndisclosure so that someone purchasing one of these financial products \nwould know that the seller is actually betting against the product that \nis being sold to the consumer.\n  If I were to sell you a financial product and without your knowledge \nplaced a separate bet that the product would decline in value, there is \nno question in my mind that the distinguished Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Illinois, would feel wronged by that transaction and \neveryone would say: Rightly so. If I stood to gain by convincing my \nclients to buy something that I knew would fail, they would have every \nreason to feel betrayed, to feel swindled, to feel they had been had.\n  The fact is, some of these major financial institutions invented and \nsold incredibly complicated financial products that they actually were \nhoping would fail, and they hid their positions behind a wall of \nomission and complexity.\n  I think it would surprise most Americans to learn that somehow this \nkind of mischievous--actually devious--business behavior was actually \nlegal. The tragedy, of course, is it may be legal but it is certainly \nnot right.\n  At present, under current law and if this bill clears the Senate \ntonight in its current form, the major financial institutions, these \nWall Street banks, would not be required to disclose an absolutely \nessential piece of information to a client, what, in my view, would be \na material conflict of interest.\n  From everything I have heard, the folks on Wall Street see these \ntransactions in which a bank constructs and invests in a financial \nproduct that is designed to fail and then markets this product to those \nwith an interest in its success as an honest transaction. Boy, I do not \nknow of anybody at home in Oregon who sees something like this as \nhonest or, in light of the recent hearings, fabulous.\n  Senator Brown of Massachusetts and I said: We are going to get \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and do something about it. We put \ntogether an amendment, which I wish to point out to colleagues tonight \nis acceptable to Senator Shelby, is acceptable to Chairman Dodd. We are \ngetting ready to vote on an amendment where we have bipartisan Senate \nsponsorship, we have the very constructive and very valuable input of \nSenator Shelby's staff, and we have Chairman Dodd's involvement. If we \ngot it before a vote, we would have an overwhelming, bipartisan vote \nfor a simple proposition that everybody can understand on the streets \nof Illinois, Oregon, or anywhere else, and that is, you ought to \ndisclose when, in fact, you are selling a product that you are betting \nagainst.\n  The disclosure of conflicts amendment I am describing, coauthored by \nSenator Brown of Massachusetts, would direct the new financial \nstability oversight council, which is established in the underlying \nbill, to put forward rules requiring banks to disclose to their clients \nwhether they have a material conflict of interest with respect to a \nfinancial product they are selling. It comes down to a simple \nproposition: If these firms are willing to create and sell these \nproducts, they ought to stand behind them and be honest with their \nclients. It is a very short amendment.\n  On Main Street, all across the country, everybody would understand \nwhat the bipartisan amendment that Senator Brown and I are offering--\ndisclosure. We are not saying we are going to ban all of these sales. \nColleagues made a very compelling case, by the way, on going further \nthan we do. But certainly there ought to be disclosure. We want to \nbring greater honesty and transparency to the relationship between \nbuyers and sellers of complicated financial products.\n  It is fair to say--and I surely consider myself a market-oriented \nDemocrat. That is what I tried to do on health care and what I \ncontinued to try to do in a bipartisan proposal with Senator Gregg to \nfix our tax system--you cannot have functioning markets without honesty \nand transparency. Without it, we end up with a game that is rigged \nagainst the typical American investor and taxpayer.\n  I also wish to express my appreciation to my new colleague from \nMassachusetts for working with me to advance this simple and \nstraightforward\n\n[[Page S4063]]\n\nproposition. As I stated, I am very appreciative of Chairman Dodd and \nSenator Shelby and their counsel with respect to our bipartisan idea.\n  I also want to make it clear that I do not see a problem with \nfinancial firms taking steps to manage their risks. In fact, I \nencourage it. If firms had done so in the early part of this decade, \nour economy might not have suffered in the meltdown we have seen in \nfinancial services.\n  My concern--and I see the chairman of the full committee, Senator \nDodd, in the Chamber--my concern from the very beginning, as Chairman \nDodd has done his very good work on this legislation, is the opaque \nnature of these transactions. The fact is, it is so hard for the \nAmerican people and the purchaser to understand what these transactions \nare all about, and certainly they ought to be given information when \nthe person selling it is taking a very different financial position \nthan the person who is buying.\n  We ought to turn this curtain back on the current financial model and \nshow it to the rest of the country. Let's pull the curtain back on the \nWall Street business model and show it to the rest of the country.\n  I have wracked my brain to try and find another industry that would \nbet against their own product while selling it to the American people. \nDoes the person selling me a toy for the Wyden twins stand to make \nadditional money if the toy breaks? Obviously not.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator still has 30 seconds left on his original time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is obvious that in no other part of the \nAmerican economy do we have people betting against their own product \nwhile selling it to the American people. You do not see Apple creating \nthe iPod in the hope that sales will be far below expectations and then \ngoing out and betting some of its own money on the failure. No \nindustry--none--thinks of betting against their own product while \nselling it to the American people. I do not even think that owners of \nracehorses bet against their own ponies.\n  The kind of disclosure that Senator Brown and I have called for is \nfundamental for investment confidence in the integrity of the U.S. \nfinancial system. If financial firms can market products they are \nbetting will fail without disclosing that to their clients, the \nconditions that caused the current financial crisis, in my view, will \nbe recreated with Wall Street firms packaging up toxic assets and \nmarketing them as securities to unsuspecting buyers. ``Buyer beware'' \nwill again become ``taxpayer beware.'' That should not be acceptable to \nany Senator.\n  I know colleagues are waiting to speak. I repeat, amendment No. 3982, \nauthored by Senator Brown of Massachusetts and myself, will fill a \nloophole in this bill that is going to be passed tonight that, in my \nview, is a glaring omission that does not meet the test of the consumer \nprotection the American people deserve.\n  This bill is clearing the Senate tonight without even minimal \nconsumer protection, without even disclosure of financial institutions \nbetting against products they are going to sell. That is not right. I \nhope we will return to this subject as soon as possible.\n  I see Chairman Dodd on the floor. I thank him for the time he has \ngiven me in the course of this legislation. I commend him for all his \nefforts on this bill.\n  I also thank Senator Shelby and his very able staff director, Mr. \nDuhnke, whom we know from our Intelligence work, for their support in \nputting together this amendment. I surely hope it will come out of \nconference because the American people deserve this kind of consumer \nprotection and this kind of disclosure.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               Exemptions\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that one of the \nreasons for providing the Federal Reserve Board, and, eventually, the \nbureau, with authority to provide exemptions under paragraph (7) of \nthis new section 129(l) of the Truth in Lending Act, is to allow the \nregulator to make adjustments to the points and fees cap with respect \nto smaller loans. I further understand that it is not the intent of the \nnew section 129(l) to cover a streamline refinancing as provided by \ngovernment programs such as FHA, and that the Board/bureau will \nestablish appropriate guidelines for exemption. Is this view correct?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the words \nof Chairman Dodd. There are a number of lenders in Maine that make \nsmaller size loans. Because the points and fees cap in the Merkley-\nKlobuchar amendment, which I supported, is based on a percentage of the \nprincipal amount of the loan, the points and fees cap established in \nthe amendment may limit the ability of some lenders to make smaller-\nsize loans. As a result, like Senator Dodd, I assume that it is the \nSenator's intention that the regulator use the authority to make \nadjustments to the standards in the case of these smaller loans. Is \nthis correct?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the points made by my colleagues from \nMaine and Connecticut are correct. The purpose of the amendment is to \nensure that consumers are sold loans that they are able to repay. The \nauthority granted to the agency to prescribe rules establishing other \ncriteria--and to ``revise, add to, or subtract from'' the existing \ncriteria--relating to the presumption of compliance is intended to \nallow the agency to craft criteria that would permit lenders who extend \nlow-dollar loans to meet the presumption of compliance, while promoting \nfair pricing and sustainable lending. This is particularly important in \nrural areas and other areas where home values are lower.\n  Mr. President, the gentleman is also correct in regard to streamline \nrefinancing under rules of the FHA, the VA, and other government \nagencies. It is intended that the Federal Reserve Board, or the bureau, \nwill exempt such loans under the exemption authority of paragraph \n(7)(A).\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator very much. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I understand that it is not the intent of \nparagraph (6)(C) of this new section 129(l) of the Truth in Lending Act \nto include regular periodic mortgage insurance premiums that are paid \nafter the closing date in meaning of ``points and fees payable in \nconnection with the loan.''\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The gentleman is correct that we would expect the \nFederal Reserve Board, and, in time, the bureau, to exempt any mortgage \ninsurance premiums that are required to be paid after closing that \nmight otherwise be covered, consistent with the exemption authority \nunder paragraph (7)(A). Post-closing mortgage insurance premiums are \ndistinct from points and fees charged at the time the loan is obtained, \nand those post-closing premiums are not contemplated to be covered \nunder this section.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator very much. I agree with the Senator.\n\n\n                        sc accredited investors\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Would the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee \nyield for a question on provisions of the bill relating to SEC rules on \n``accredited investors.''\n  Mr. DODD. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Section 412 of the legislation requires the Securities \nand Exchange Commission to conduct a rulemaking to implement changes to \nthe definition of ``accredited investor'' in regulation D, and other \nsections of the legislation will require the SEC to conduct other \nrulemaking to implement the new law. It is my understanding, and I \nbelieve the understanding of my colleague from Alaska, that the SEC has \nauthority under existing law to amend the definitions of ``accredited \ninvestor'' in Regulation D and related SEC rules and ``qualified \ninstitutional buyer'' in rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, to \nexpressly include Federal, State and local government bodies within \nthose definitions. In fact, the SEC proposed to do so in 2007 but has \nnot completed that rulemaking. Does the Senator from Connecticut concur \nthat the SEC already has the authority to amend these definitions?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Alaska is correct. The SEC certainly has \nexisting authority to add State and local governments to the \ndefinitions of ``accredited investor'' and ``qualified institutional \nbuyer'' under its Securities Act rules.\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Would the Senator from Connecticut yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. DODD. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Our State--the great State of Alaska--believes that it \nwould be appropriate and in the public interest and, in the interests \nof State and local governments across the Nation, for the SEC to add \ngovernmental entities to the definitions of ``accredited investor'' and \n``qualified institutional buyer'' when it promulgates rules pursuant to \nthis legislation. The reasons for including governmental entities in \nthese definitions are as sound today as they were 3 years ago. In \nparticular, governments are large and sophisticated investors with \nprofessional treasury management staffs that manage large amounts of \nthe government's own money and seek to invest in bonds and other \nsecurities investments in order to prudently diversify their investment \nportfolios and obtain a favorable return. Many of the most attractive \ninvestments are offered only in private placements to institutional \ninvestors conducted under regulation D or rule 144A. Without access to \nthese investments, the government earns a lower return and has less \ndiversification in its investments than would be optimal. Does the \nchairman agree with us that when the SEC promulgates its rules under \nthis legislation, it should address, while taking care to ensure \nappropriate minimum asset protections are in place, the inclusion of \nState and local governments in the definitions of accredited investor \nand qualified institutional buyer?\n  Mr. DODD. I believe it would be appropriate for the SEC to take the \nopportunity presented by the rulemakings under this legislation, to \nconsider whether to include State and local government bodies within \nthose definitions.\n\n\n                              credit sales\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. During the Senate's consideration of this legislation, I \nauthored an amendment approved by voice vote to confirm that small \nbusiness merchants and retailers would not be subject to regulation by \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, when they engage in \ncredit sales. This amendment was supported by a number of key small \nbusiness stakeholders, including the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, IBNF, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The amendment \nincluded a three-prong test that excludes such entities from the CFPB \nwhen they (1) only extend credit for the sale of nonfinancial goods and \nservices; (2) retain the credit they have extended on their books; and \n(3) meet the relevant industry size threshold to be a small business, \nbased on annual receipts, pursuant to the Small Business Act. It is my \nunderstanding that wholesale merchants and distributors and \nmanufacturers would not generally need to avail themselves of that \nexclusion because their sales of nonfinancial goods and any related \nfinancing they may provide, are not to consumers in the first instance. \nIs this view correct?\n  Mr. DODD. I believe point of the Senator from Maine is well taken. \nWholesalers and manufacturers do not provide any products to consumers \nfor their personal, family, or household use, let alone consumer \nfinancial products or services. Thus, wholesalers' and manufacturers' \nsales of nonfinancial goods to other businesses would be outside the \nbureau's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would support the Feinstein amendment No. \n4113 to close the London loophole. Senator Feinstein and I and other \ncolleagues have been working together for years to put a cop back on \nthe beat in U.S. commodity markets, and it is a pleasure to be here \ntoday at the verge of Senate approval of a bill that has so many strong \ndisclosure and regulatory provisions for commodity markets. The prices \npaid for energy commodities like oil, natural gas, jet fuel, diesel \nfuel, not to mention food commodities like wheat, corn and soybeans \nhave a profound impact on our economy, our markets, and our way of \nlife. They matter to consumers, business, and governments. For too \nlong, our commodity markets have been out of control, with undisclosed \ntrades in unregulated markets, wildly gyrating prices unconnected to \nmarket forces, and unconscionable profits for commodity traders \noperating outside the real economy. This bill will go a long way toward \nrectifying those problems, and I commend Senators Dodd, Reed, Lincoln, \nand so many others for their hard work.\n  The amendment introduced by Senator Feinstein focuses on an area that \nhas long concerned me and other observers of the commodity markets--the \nway that commodity traders living right here in the United States are \nusing terminals located here to trade U.S. produced goods on foreign \nmarkets outside of U.S. regulatory control. I am talking, for example, \nabout U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil traded on the ICE exchange \nin London. That oil is produced and used right here--it never leaves \nour shores--but U.S. traders are trading its oil futures in London--in \npart to duck U.S. position limits and other regulatory controls. Other \ncountries are trying to set up similar exchanges and win permission for \nU.S. traders to trade on their foreign exchanges, affecting U.S. \ncommodity prices, without those commodity traders ever leaving our \nsoil.\n  The bill as currently drafted takes a number of steps to get foreign \nboards of trade to enforce the same rules for U.S. commodities that we \nhave here at home. But the bill fails to take one critical step that is \nessential to U.S. enforcement authority--it doesn't require foreign \nboards of trade to formally register with the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission or CFTC, our watchdog agency for commodity markets, in order \nto obtain approval for their trading terminals to be physically located \nhere in the United States. Most of the CFTC's enforcement authority \napplies only to entities that are registered with the Commission. Right \nnow, foreign boards of trade don't have to register here before \ninstalling trading terminals here. That constituted regulatory evasion \nand defies common sense.\n  I know my colleagues want a cop on the beat in all commodity markets \nwhere U.S. commodities are traded. And they want a cop that can enforce \nthe law to prevent excessive speculation and market manipulation. That \nmeans we need to require foreign boards of trade seeking to locate \ntrading terminals here in the United States to register with the CFTC. \nIt is straightforward, it is simple, and it is essential. The CFTC has \nasked for this registration requirement, and I commend Senator \nFeinstein for her determination to get this done. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for this amendment to ensure U.S commodities are traded on fair \nand open commodity markets free of excessive speculation, manipulation, \nand deception.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there were two amendments I supported \nduring debate on the financial reform bill that would take steps to \nimprove our Nation's housing policy. Unfortunately, only one of these \namendments was adopted by the Senate. Senator McCain offered an \namendment, that I supported, that would have required the Federal \nGovernment to end its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 2 \nyears after the financial reform bill was signed into law. While the \namendment was not perfect, I supported it because neither the current \nstructure of Fannie and Freddie nor the billions of taxpayer dollars \nthat the Federal Government is using to prop up Fannie and Freddie are \nsustainable. Federal taxpayer support of Fannie and Freddie needs to \nend, and the McCain amendment would have provided a timetable for \nbringing that Federal support to an end.\n  I was pleased that the Senate did adopt an amendment I supported, \noffered by Senator Merkley, to curb predatory lending practices \nthroughout the Nation. These unconscionable predatory lending practices \ncontributed to the subprime housing mess, and the Merkley amendment \nincluded commonsense provisions to address some of these practices. Too \noften, loan originators received higher compensation if they steered \nborrowers into subprime loans than if they had placed those borrowers \ninto qualifying prime loans. The Merkley amendment would address this \nperverse financial incentive to put borrowers into predatory loan \nproducts by preventing loan originators from receiving payments based \non the terms of loans. The amendment, which also includes stronger \nunderwriting standards, provides sensible protections to Wisconsin's \nborrowers.\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have many times this \nCongress, to talk about the role of fraud at the heart of the financial \ncrisis.\n  I have previously discussed the urgent need for law enforcement to \ngive high priority to the investigation and prosecution of financial \nfraud, and for Congress to provide law enforcement with the tools it \nneeds to do so, including increased funding and stiffer sentences.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Leahy last year on the Fraud \nEnforcement and Recovery Act. I was proud to work again with Senator \nLeahy, as well as Senator Baucus, the leader, and many others to \ninclude key antifraud provisions in the health care legislation signed \ninto law in March.\n  Last month, I, along with the other members of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, my Senate colleagues, and Americans \nwatching at home, were treated to a truly revelatory series of hearings \nchaired by Senator Levin.\n  Chairman Levin and his staff deserve high praise for their tenacity \nand diligence: Beginning in the fall of 2008 and culminating this \nspring, the chairman and his staff reviewed millions of pages of \ndocuments, conducted over 100 interviews, and consulted with dozens of \nexperts.\n  Thanks to the Levin hearings, we now have a thorough accounting of \nwhat happened--and what went wrong.\n  Mortgage origination practices were rife with fraud, and bank \nmanagement and bank regulators failed miserably in their oversight.\n  The practice of mortgage securitization allowed everyone in the \nfinancial industry to earn lucrative fees and commissions, even though \nbanks knew that these securitized mortgages were filled with liar's \nloans and other fraudulent products that practically guaranteed their \neventual collapse.\n  At all levels of the industry, compensation structures favored the \nriskiest loans and the most minimal oversight. As a result, \nunderwriting standards were laughable. Banks didn't care that they were \nwriting bad loans because they did not believe those loans would stay \non their books.\n  The regulators and ratings agencies were totally captured by the \nbanks, due in part to their absolute dependence on the banks for \nrevenue. The Office of Thrift Supervision relied on Washington Mutual \nfor 12-15 percent of its operating budget.\n  The credit ratings agencies gamed by investment banks, which had \nreverse engineered their models--bent over backwards to stamp AAA and \nother investment grade ratings on what was actually junk because they \nneeded the fees.\n  Investment banks marketed synthetic CDOs, which they had permitted \nthe ``big shorts'' to design so that they were most likely to fail, in \nsome cases without disclosing that material information to their \ncustomers and despite their own inherent conflict of interest.\n  As long as the music played, there was plenty of money to go around. \nBut when the music stopped, banks were bailed out and the American \ntaxpayers were left without a chair.\n  Fixing the system requires an all out effort by the bank regulators, \nthe FBI, the SEC, and the Justice Department. And Congress should not \nrest until in its oversight capacity we are convinced that a systemic, \nstrategic and foundational approach to targeting and prosecuting fraud \nis well funded and well underway.\n  Bank regulators, especially, must execute a 180-degree cultural turn, \nassisting the FBI by providing roadmaps to the fraud that has occurred.\n  But we still need to do far more than just add more cops to the beat \nand ensure that they're looking in all the right places. We also need \nto realign incentives so that banks are encouraged to make sound loans, \nso that credit ratings agencies can dispense untainted evaluations of \ncreditworthiness, and so regulators aren't beholden to those they \nregulate.\n  That is why I am proud to support Senator Levin's package of \namendments. Each of the eight proposals in the package grows directly \nout of lessons learned through the Levin hearings.\n  The Levin-Kafuman package will restore regulatory independence by \ninstituting a cooling off period for regulators--putting a stop to the \nrevolving door between industry and regulator. The amendment will also \nguarantee that the FDIC as secondary regulator can never again be shut \nout of an examination by the primary regulator.\n  To realign bankers' incentives, the Levin-Kaufman package will \nrequire that anybody who securitizes a pool of loans must maintain at \nleast a 5-percent stake in a representative sampling of those \nsecurities. Other risky lending practices would be banned outright, \nsuch as synthetic asset-backed securities, which have no purpose other \nthan speculation.\n  Finally, the package will improve oversight and operation of the \ncredit ratings agencies by prohibiting them from relying on faulty due \ndiligence and by permitting the SEC to monitor and regulate the \nmethodologies that the ratings agencies employ.\n  The Levin hearings also set in stark relief the untenable conflicts \nthat rest at the heart of our financial system.\n  The Levin hearings focused on the residential housing market. But \nconflicts of interest permeate almost every corner of our capital \nmarkets, whether in the context of asset backed securities, or \nproprietary trading, or a broker selling private order flow into a \nprivate dark pool, or the prioritization of trades by a broker ahead of \nits clients.\n  We simply cannot leave it to the banks and the brokers to manage \nconflicts of interest in any way they see fit. If we can learn one \nthing from the financial crisis, surely, it is that.\n  Under current law, broker-dealers are not required to disclose \nconflicts of interest to their clients. They are not required to \nresolve conflicts in favor of their clients. They are not required to \nact in the best interests of their clients.\n  In fact, they are permitted to knowingly fleece their clients, \nprovided the client is ``sophisticated'' enough and provided the broker \nhas disclosed the requisite information about the product.\n  This must change. We can't expect a full economic recovery without \nrestoring the public's trust in markets. This is why I support, and \nhave cosponsored, two amendments that would impose a fiduciary duty on \nthe part of broker-dealers to their customers, one sponsored by Senator \nSpecter and the other by Senator Akaka.\n  Imposing such a duty would protect investors and improve the level of \nintegrity in our capital markets. No longer would brokers like Goldman \nSachs be able to withhold critical information about its conduct from \nclients and conceal fraud under the cover of caveat emptor.\n  Just as important, it would help address the widespread and \nunderstandable mistrust of the securitization process, which in turn \nmakes capital more expensive and hinders recovery.\n  I also support Senator Specter's aiding and abetting amendment, which \nwould reinstate an important deterrent to the sorts of fraud that \ncontributed to our current financial crisis.\n  On March 15, 2010, I came to the Senate floor to discuss the \nBankruptcy Examiner's report on Lehman Brothers and said--as many of us \nhave suspected all along--that there was fraud at the heart of the \nfinancial crisis.\n  Lehman Brothers could not have accomplished this apparent fraud--the \nuse of so-called Repo 105 transactions to ``window dress'' its balance \nsheet and mislead investors--without the help of its accounting firm.\n  And that is true of many sophisticated fraud schemes, where the \nadvice or analysis of third parties enables or facilitates the fraud.\n  Those third parties were answerable to their victims in court, and \ntherefore faced a real deterrent, at least until 1994. That year, in \nCentral Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, a divided \nSupreme Court rejected years of settled precedent and limited Federal \nlaw in this area to so-called ``primary violators.'' The Central Bank \ndecision, like many others since, reflected the Court's probusiness \nbias. It also left the SEC alone to bring civil suits against aiders \nand abettors, and too often left victims holding the bag.\n  Regulators will fail. When they do, however, we must depend on \nprofessionals such as accountants and lawyers to acquit their roles as \ngatekeepers against accounting fraud, not to materially aid that fraud. \nOne way\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\nto make sure they learn their lesson this time around is to reinstitute \nthe ability of victims to seek compensation from these fraud \nfacilitators.\n  Senator Specter and I have worked hard to make sure that this \namendment is narrowly drawn, ensuring that only truly culpable third \nparties are subject to liability.\n  The amendment allows suits only against those who have actual \nknowledge that their conduct is assisting another person to violate the \nFederal securities laws.\n  Until those who facilitate the fraud of others understand that they \nwill be held accountable, whether criminally or civilly, we can't hope \nto change their behavior.\n  Finally, I want to mention a bipartisan package of antifraud measures \nthat I have worked on with Chairman Leahy and Senators Grassley and \nSpecter.\n  These measures will deter schemes that damage the economy and hurt \nhard-working Americans by increasing sentences for securities fraud and \nbank fraud. They will give prosecutors new tools to investigate and \nprosecute fraud cases and will foster vital cooperation between \nregulators and prosecutors. And they will extend important \nwhistleblower protections.\n  Whistleblowers provide a vital early warning system to detect and \nexpose fraud in the financial system. With the right protections, \nwhistleblowers can help root out the kinds of massive Wall Street fraud \nthat contributed to the current financial crisis.\n  As I have said before, this is ultimately a test of whether we have \none justice system in this country or two. For our citizens to have \nfaith in the rule of law, we must treat fraud on Wall Street like we \ntreat fraud on Main Street. And for our economy to work for all \nAmericans, investors must have faith in the honest and open functioning \nof our financial markets.\n  The amendments I have discussed today will promote both the rule of \nlaw and faith in the markets two cornerstones of our democracy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.\n  Mr. President, today I will support the Wall Street Reform Act.\n  I applaud Chairman Chris Dodd and my colleagues for having crafted a \nbill that includes many provisions that I support, in particular the \nestablishment of a consumer finance protection division and urgently \nneeded reforms of the over-the-counter derivatives markets. These are \nlegislative achievements that will significantly improve our financial \nsystem. I am also pleased that the bill bans stated income loans, which \nwere a major source of fraud at the root of the crisis. I will be \nwatching carefully to ensure the bill is not weakened in conference.\n  I remain deeply concerned, however, that when it comes to the \nstability and health of the U.S. financial markets and its \ninstitutions, much unfinished business remains. We must never rest in \nour efforts to prevent another financial crisis like that which \noccurred in 2007-08, which shattered the American economy and deeply \nharmed the lives of millions of our fellow Americans. Indeed, much work \nremains to be done so that we can restore the credibility of our \nfinancial markets and the rule of law on Wall Street, both of which are \nbadly in need of repair.\n  Some of my concerns are rooted in shortcomings of the bill; others \nneither fell within the scope of the bill's ambitions nor were a part \nof the Senate debate; and still others fall legitimately on the \nshoulders of our regulatory and law enforcement agencies.\n  As for the bill, for the past 4 months I have addressed at length \nwhat I believe to be the central issue to preventing future financial \ncrises: Passing laws that will stand for generations to ensure \nfinancial stability by separating speculative risky activities from the \ngovernment-guaranteed portion of our financial industry, as well as by \nmandating limits on the size and leverage of our shadow banks.\n  Instead, the bill reshuffles existing regulatory powers that banking \nregulators already possessed--and failed to exercise in ways that would \nhave prevented the financial crisis. It relies on regulatory discretion \nto decide limits on the size, leverage and activities of dangerously \nconcentrated financial institutions. Rather than statutorily limit the \nsize and risk of megabanks through limits on unstable nondeposit \nliabilities, rather than statutorily impose specific and higher \nleverage requirements on our largest banks, the bill simply hands the \nresponsibility for regulating ``too big to fail'' banks back to the \nregulators. Moreover, it vests the hopes of the American taxpayers--who \nshould never again be forced to step into the breach in a banking \ncrisis--in a resolution authority limited by U.S. law, which I fear \ncannot possibly work to resolve large global institutions. I remain \ndeeply concerned that it does not represent lasting and effective \nreform of our largest financial institutions, which I have said \nrepeatedly have become too big to manage, too big to regulate and too \nbig to fail.\n  In the next few years, chastened U.S. regulators may try their best \nto insist that U.S. megabanks not gorge themselves again on highly \nleveraged risky investments. But one need only look to Europe today to \nunderstand that, without additional preventive measures, bailouts lie \nin our future, too.\n  I predict Congress will one day revisit these issues, unfortunately \nin the wake of a future crisis in which average Americans again will be \nforced to come to Wall Street's rescue to fend off a possible \ndepression. When that day arrives, Congress I expect will pass needed \nstructural reforms, including a version of the Brown-Kaufman amendment \npreemptively to address the problem of dangerous financial \nconcentration--and also a restoration of the Glass-Steagall separation \nof commercial and investment banking activities, the repeal of which in \n1999 was one of this country's costliest mistakes.\n  There are other issues that this debate never addressed.\n  Naked Short Selling--We still have not restored the uptick rule, \nwhich worked for 70 years as a systemic check on predatory bear raids. \nWe still have an unenforceable rule that fails to prevent naked short \nselling of stocks. I remain concerned that until we impose a pre-trade \n``hard locate'' requirement, bank stocks in particular will remain \nvulnerable to predatory bear raids.\n  Market Structure issues--High frequency trading has echoes of the \nderivatives market: I have said repeatedly that whenever you have a lot \nof money pouring into a financial activity, markets that are changing \ndramatically, no transparency in those dark markets, and therefore no \neffective regulation, that is a prescription for disaster. That was the \ncase in the over-the-counter derivatives market. And I believe the so-\ncalled flash crash of May 6 in our stock market revealed the fault \nlines that have long concerned me about the structure of our equity \nmarkets and how it has come to be dominated by high frequency traders. \nCongress cannot simply look backward at the last financial crisis; \nCongress and regulators alike must instead try also to look over the \nhorizon and identify systemic risks before they occur.\n  As I wrote to the SEC on August 21, 2009, ``The current market \nstructure appears to be a consequence of regulatory structures designed \nto increase efficiency and thereby provide the greatest benefits to the \nhighest volume traders. The implications of the current system for buy-\nand-hold investors have not been the subject of a thorough analysis.'' \nNine months later, our stock markets failed for 20 minutes to meet \ntheir essential function: discover the prices of securities by \nbalancing buyers and sellers. Two weeks later, the SEC and CFTC still \ncannot say why, but the answer is no doubt wrapped up in the fact that \nin the past few years technology developments have moved us rapidly \nfrom an investor's to a trader's market. Our fragmented market of more \nthan 50 market centers have become dominated by black-box algorithmic \nand high-frequency traders, and they are too opaque for our regulators \nto understand or to police.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--My Republican colleagues are correct in \npointing out that we must deal with the problems of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, which continue to siphon off billions in taxpayer funds. \nIt is wrong and irresponsible to offer rash and unwise solutions, \nhowever. Almost all mortgage originations currently receive government \nsupport, whether from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or from the FHA. Lest \nthere be any confusion, without this government backstop, our housing \nsystem and economy\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\ncould have collapsed. Solving these problems and developing a new \nmortgage finance system will take a great deal of thoughtful \nconsideration, and I urge the Congress to begin this important work.\n  Finally, and perhaps of most concern, we simply must concentrate the \nneeded resources and effort that will return the rule of law to Wall \nStreet. The hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nchaired by Senator Carl Levin and in which I was proud to participate, \nrevealed that the U.S. real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive \nfraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex \neffectively at the heart of Wall Street. Congress in its oversight \ncapacity must ensure that bank regulators, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice \nDepartment are working together in a foundational, strategic, and \ncoordinated fashion to ensure that every last perpetrator of fraud--\nfrom the smallest mortgage broker to the senior-most executives of our \nmost powerful Wall Street institutions--is thoroughly investigated and, \nwhere appropriate, brought to justice.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in order to protect the economic health of \nour Nation and the security of the financial system on which it \ndepends, I will support the financial reform legislation before the \nSenate today. I want to thank Majority Leader Reid and Senate Banking \nCommittee Chairman Dodd for their efforts to bring to the floor \nlegislation that is so critical to our Nation's prosperity.\n  Over the past decade, the greed on Wall Street has destroyed millions \nof jobs and wiped out the life savings of too many Americans. That \ngreed turned our Nation's financial markets into a casino where \nfairness and full disclosure were lost in complexity of riskier and \nmore lucrative new financial products. Unfortunately, even those \nrunning the casino didn't understand the dangerous hand they were \ndealing to unsuspecting consumers.\n  As a result, American taxpayers had to bail out the big financial \ncompanies that made the mess. It didn't seem fair and nobody liked it, \nexcept those getting the bail out. But it had to be done in order to \nstop the economy from going over the cliff not just ours but the whole \nglobal economy.\n  It all started in 2008 with the Federal Government stepping in to \nprevent financial institutions, investment banks, mortgage providers, \nand insurance companies from going under. Even though these steps were \nnecessary, they certainly reinforced the view of many Americans that \nbad behavior was being rewarded with taxpayer bailouts.\n  The experience made it clear that Congress needs to update our \noutdated financial regulatory scheme and reestablish transparency, \nfairness and long-term stability to our financial system.\n  We have an obligation to restore responsibility and accountability to \nour financial system to insure this never happens again. We have got no \nchoice. Strong medicine is needed to avoid a future economic \ncatastrophe.\n  I believe this critical legislation will reign in Wall Street, create \njobs on Main Street, and protect consumers from fraud and abuse. It \nalso will help restore confidence in our capital markets and our \nfinancial institutions.\n  We have to make sure that taxpayers never again pick up this tab. And \nthis bill does just that.\n  Under this legislation, firms that are supposedly ``too big to fail'' \ncan be shut down and liquidated before their systemic failure endangers \nour financial markets. No more taxpayer bailouts that increase our \nFederal debt.\n  The Financial Reform Act creates the Federal Stability Oversight \nCouncil to identify and address systemic risks posed by large, complex \ncompanies, products, and activities before they threaten the stability \nof the economy. It also imposes new capital and leverage requirements \nthat make it more difficult for financial companies to become ``too big \nto fail''. It will require such companies to periodically submit so \ncalled ``funeral plans'' for their rapid and orderly shutdown should \nthey fail. And those who fail to submit acceptable plans will be \nsubject to higher capital requirements as well as restrictions on \ngrowth and activity.\n  A critical part of this legislation deals with the costs of future \nbank failures. There is no rationale for banks to continue gambling \nwith taxpayer-backed funds in the stock market or anywhere else. I am \npleased the bill includes a recommendation from the Obama \nadministration, called ``the Volcker rule'' after the former Federal \nReserve Bank Chair and current National Economic Recovery Advisory \nBoard Chairman, Paul Volcker. The Volcker rule will stop financial \ninstitutions from using their assets to invest in the stock market or \nengage in privately owned trading operations, unrelated to serving \ncustomers for its own profit. Banks can once again focus on lending, \nespecially to small businesses, which is why they receive special \naccess to the Federal Reserve in the first place.\n  Some of the things that have happened on Wall Street are \nunbelievable. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nalleges that that Goldman Sachs worked with a third party, Paulsen and \nCompany, to select pools of subprime mortgages sold the securities to \ninvestors without telling them they were designed to fail. Then both \nGoldman Sachs and Paulsen bet against those securities. How can that be \nfair?\n  Over the past decade, irresponsible lending, irresponsible borrowing \nand a lack of basic oversight and effective regulation put millions of \nfamilies in homes they could not afford. Too many Americans took \nunreasonable risks to buy a home when markets were booming. Too many \nfinancial institutions lowered their lending standards but didn't plan \nappropriately for increased risk. At the same time, some borrowers \ninflated their incomes and misrepresented themselves in order to buy \nexpensive homes that they could not afford.\n  The damage has been staggering. Millions of homeowners are facing \nforeclosure. The loans financing these homes are now frozen on the \nbalance sheets of banks and other financial institutions, preventing \nthem from providing new loans. Today we are living with the \nconsequences: an economy teetering on the edge.\n  One of the most importation provisions of this legislation sets up a \nnew independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect \nconsumers from unfair, deceptive and abusive financial products and \npractices. The goal of the new bureau is to insure that when families \napply for a mortgage, a bank loan or other complicated financial \nproducts, they will also receive clear information that they need to \nmake the best decision possible. With a watchdog in place, families \nwill be less likely to enter into mortgages they don't understand or be \na victim of unfair and deceptive loan practices. It will increase \nfairness and help reduce the casino atmosphere of too many financial \nproducts.\n  Another crucial ingredient in today's crisis is the use of complex \nfinancial derivatives. Warren Buffett has called them `` financial \nweapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, \nare potentially lethal.''\n  These complex financial maneuvers hidden from the view of most \nAmericans have quietly become a crucial part of managing risk in our \neconomy. In May, the Bank for International Settlements estimated that \nthe total value of derivative contracts was approximately $600 \ntrillion. To put this speculation in context--that's 200 times larger \nthan the Federal budget.\n  Derivatives are essentially bets on future economic behavior: \nfinancial contracts which can gain or lose value as the price of some \nunderlying commodity, financial indicator or other variable changes. \nUnfortunately their rise to prominence in our economy was not matched \nwith an increase in regulation or transparency.\n  The legislation gives the SEC and CFTC the authority to regulate \nover-the-counter derivatives to stop irresponsible practices and \nexcessive risk-taking. It requires central clearing and exchange \ntrading for derivatives that can be cleared. It requires margin for \nuncleared trades in order to offset the greater risk they pose to the \nfinancial system and encourage more trading to take place in \ntransparent, regulated markets. It increases data collection and \npublication through clearing houses or swap repositories to improve \nmarket transparency and provide regulators important tools for \nmonitoring and responding to risks.\n  When you add it all up, the financial crisis is a result of failures \nover the\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\npast generation to provide appropriate regulation and supervision of \nthe financial services industry. During the Bush administration, \nhowever, what was effectively a trend toward deregulation turned into a \nstampede.\n  We have an obligation to prevent another stampede. We have an \nobligation to restore responsibility and accountability to our \nfinancial system. We have an obligation to make sure America's \ntaxpayers are not left with the casino's bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this financial reform legislation \nbecause it will protect the continued health of our economy. It will \nrevamp our regulatory practices, fix the derivatives market, and \nprovide liquidity for small businesses and families looking to buy a \nhome. More importantly, it will rebuild the trust that the American \npeople have lost in our financial system.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support the reform bill before \nus, S. 3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n  I commend Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd and Majority \nLeader Harry Reid for shepherding this significant piece of legislation \nthrough the Senate. Getting to this point was no small feat given the \nnear-unanimous opposition to Wall Street reform that this effort has \nencountered from the other side of the aisle. But Senators Dodd and \nReid persevered because they know that fixing our troubled financial \nsystem is absolutely, unequivocally in the best interests of our \ncountry and its citizens.\n  The recent financial crisis revealed several flaws in our current \nregulatory system. Many large Wall Street investment banks and \ninsurance companies hid their shaky finances from stockholders and \ngovernment regulators. Corporate executives saw their salaries rise to \nextreme heights, even as their companies were failing and seeking \ngovernment assistance. Through it all, federal regulatory agencies \nfailed to provide the necessary oversight to rein in reckless actions. \nIf this crisis has taught us anything, it is that the look-the-other \nway, hands-off deregulatory policies that were in vogue in recent times \ncan jeopardize not only private investments, but our entire economy.\n  The bill we are voting on today goes directly at the heart of the \nWall Street excesses that brought our economy to the brink. For far too \nlong Wall Street firms made risky bets in the dark and reaped enormous \nprofits. Then, when their bets went sour, they turned to America's \ntaxpayers to bail them out. This bill is about changing the culture of \nrampant Wall Street speculation and doing what needs to be done to get \nour economy back on track. We need more transparency and oversight of \nWall Street, and this legislation finally will allow regulators to go \nafter the fraud, manipulation, and excessive speculation on Wall \nStreet.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am particularly \npleased that the bill includes provisions I authored to ensure law \nenforcement and federal agencies have the necessary tools to \ninvestigate and uncover financial crimes; to protect whistleblowers who \nhelp uncover these crimes; and to introduce true transparency and \nsunshine into the complex operations of large financial institutions \nand the federal agencies that regulate them.\n  Another major step forward is the derivatives section of the bill, \nwhich was authored by the Agriculture Committee on which I serve. These \nreforms will finally bring the $600 trillion derivatives market out of \nthe dark and into the light of day, ending the days of backroom deals \nthat put our entire economy at risk. The narrow end-user exemption in \nthe bill will allow legitimate commercial interests, such as electric \ncooperatives and heating oil dealers, to continue hedging their \nbusiness risks, but it will stop Wall Street traders from artificially \ndriving up prices of heating oil, gasoline, diesel fuel and other \ncommodities through unchecked speculation.\n  The bill also includes an amendment by Senator Dick Durbin that I \nsupported to protect our small businesses from complicated predatory \nrules that big credit card companies impose on Vermont grocers and \nconvenience stores. The Durbin amendment will ensure that a small \nbusiness will be able to advertise a discount for paying cash, or for \nusing one card instead of another. I do not want Vermonters to pay more \nfor a gallon of milk just because the credit card companies are \ndemanding a high fee on small transactions and are not allowing the \ngrocer to ask for cash instead of credit.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes an amendment I cosponsored \nwith Senator Bernie Sanders to shine more sunshine on the bailout \ntransactions made by the Federal Reserve. Under the Sanders amendment, \nthe Government Accountability Office will conduct a one-time audit of \nall of the emergency actions the Federal Reserve has taken since the \nfinancial crisis began, to determine whether there were any conflicts \nof interest surrounding the Federal Reserve's emergency activities. It \nis time we know more about the closed-door decisions made by the \nFederal Reserve throughout this financial crisis.\n  The Senate has before it today a bill that will reign in Wall Street \nabuses, end government bailouts, and give everyday Americans the \nconsumer protection they deserve and expect. I believe that cleaning up \nthese Wall Street abuses will help build confidence in our economy and \ncontinue our progress toward economic recovery.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I strongly support the Wall Street reform \nbill. The chairman of the Banking Committee, my friend from \nConnecticut, has done such tremendous work on this historic \nlegislation. Senator Dodd has worked with me and other members to \ncreate a bill that will better educate, protect, and empower consumers \nand investors. I am extremely proud of this legislation and appreciate \nthe willingness of the chairman to work to address so many issues \nimportant to working families.\n  Education is a primary component of financial literacy. In this bill, \nwe create an Office of Financial Literacy within the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. The Office will develop and implement initiatives to \neducate and empower consumers. A strategy to improve the financial \nliteracy among consumers, that includes measurable goals and \nbenchmarks, must be developed.\n  The Administrator of the bureau will serve as vice chairman of the \nFinancial Literacy and Education Commission to ensure meaningful \nparticipation in Federal efforts intended to help educate, protect, and \nempower working families.\n  The legislation also requires a financial literacy study to be \nconducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC. The SEC will \nbe required to develop an investor financial literacy strategy intended \nto bring about positive behavioral change among investors.\n  This legislation provides essential consumer and investor protections \nfor working families. It establishes a regulatory structure that will \nhave a greater emphasis on investor and consumer protections. \nRegulators failed to protect consumers and that contributed \nsignificantly to the financial crisis. Prospective homebuyers were \nsteered into mortgage products that had risks and costs that they could \nnot understand or afford. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will \nbe empowered to restrict predatory financial products and unfair \nbusiness practices in order to prevent unscrupulous financial services \nproviders from taking advantage of consumers.\n  I take great pride in my contributions to the investor protection \nportion of the legislation. Section 914 will strengthen the ability of \nthe SEC to better represent the interests of retail investors by \ncreating an Investor Advocate within the SEC. The Investor Advocate is \ntasked with assisting retail investors to resolve significant problems \nwith the SEC or the self-regulatory organizations, SROs. The Investor \nAdvocate's mission includes identifying areas where investors would \nbenefit from changes in Commission or SRO policies and problems that \ninvestors have with financial service providers and investment \nproducts. The Investor Advocate will recommend policy changes to the \nCommission and Congress on behalf of investors.\n  The SEC's existing Office of Investor Education and Advocacy provides \na variety of services and tools to address the problems and questions \nthat confront investors. The Office posts information to warn people \nabout scams, compiles complaints, and provides help for people seeking \nto recover funds.\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\n  The proposed Office of the Investor Advocate will be a very different \noffice. The Investor Advocate is precisely the kind of external check, \nwith independent reporting lines and independently determined \ncompensation, that cannot be provided within the current structure of \nthe SEC. It is not that the SEC does not advocate on behalf of \ninvestors, it is that it does not have a structure by which any \nmeaningful self-evaluation can be conducted. This would be an entirely \nnew function. The Investor Advocate would help to ensure that the \ninterests of retail investors are built into rulemaking proposals from \nthe outset and that agency priorities reflect the issues confronting \ninvestors. The Investor Advocate will act as the chief ombudsman for \nretail investors and increase transparency and accountability at the \nSEC. The Investor Advocate will be best equipped to act in response to \nfeedback from investors and potentially avoid situations such as the \nmishandling of information that could have exposed Ponzi schemes much \nearlier.\n  Organizations in support of section 914 include the Consumer \nFederation of America, CFP Board of Standards, Inc., Consumer Action, \nConsumer Assistance Council, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, \nCommunity Reinvestment Association of North Carolina, Financial \nPlanning Association, Fund Democracy, International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters, Massachusetts Consumers' Council, National Association of \nConsumer Advocates, National Consumers League, New Jersey Citizen \nAction, North American Securities Administrators Association, Oregon \nConsumer League, Sargent Shriver Center on Poverty Law, and Virginia \nCitizens Consumer Council.\n  I also worked to include in the legislation clarified authority for \nthe SEC to effectively require disclosures prior to the sale of \nfinancial products and services. Working families rely on their mutual \nfund investments and other financial products to pay for their \nchildren's education, prepare for retirement, and be better able to \nattain other financial goals. This provision will ensure that working \nfamilies have the relevant and useful information they need when they \nare making decisions that determine their financial future.\n  This legislation also includes important protections for remittance \ntransactions. Working families often send substantial portions of their \nearnings to family members living abroad. In Hawaii, many of my \nconstituents remit money to their family members living in the \nPhilippines. Consumers can have serious problems with their remittance \ntransactions, such as being overcharged or not having their money reach \nthe intended recipient. Remittances are not currently regulated under \nFederal law, and State laws provide inadequate consumer protections.\n  The bill will modify the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to establish \nconsumer protections. It will require simple disclosures about the cost \nof sending remittances to be provided to the consumer prior to and \nafter the transaction. A complaint and error resolution process for \nremittance transactions would be established.\n  This legislation also includes essential economic empowerment \nopportunities for working families. Title XII is the most important \neconomic empowerment provision in the bill. I appreciate the efforts of \nSenator Kohl in helping me put this title together. I appreciate the \nsupport and contributions made to this title provided Senators Schumer, \nBrown, Merkley, and Menendez. I appreciated the work done by Chairman \nDodd to include this amendment at the committee mark up.\n  I grew up in a family that did not have a bank account. My parents \nkept their money in a box divided into different sections so that money \ncould be separated for various purposes. Church donations were kept in \none part. Money for clothes was kept in another and there was a portion \nof the box reserved for food expenses. When there was no longer any \nmoney in the food section, we did not eat. Obviously, money in the box \nwas not earning interest. It was not secure.\n  I know personally the challenges that are presented to families \nunable to save or borrow when they need small loans to pay for \nunexpected expenses. Unexpected medical expenses or a car repair bill \nmay require small loans to help working families overcome these \nobstacles.\n  Mainstream financial institutions are a vital component to economic \nempowerment. Unbanked or underbanked families need access to credit \nunions and banks and they need to be able to borrow on affordable \nterms. Banks and credit unions provide alternatives to high-cost and \noften predatory fringe financial service providers such as check \ncashers and payday lenders. Unfortunately, approximately one in four \nfamilies are unbanked or underbanked.\n  Many of the unbanked and underbanked are low- and moderate-income \nfamilies that cannot afford to have their earnings diminished by \nreliance on these high-cost and often predatory financial services. \nUnbanked families are unable to save securely for education expenses, a \ndown payment on a first home, or other future financial needs. \nUnderbanked consumers rely on non-traditional forms of credit that \noften have extraordinarily high interest rates. Regular checking \naccounts may be too expensive for some consumers unable to maintain \nminimum balances or afford monthly fees. Poor credit histories may also \nlimit their ability to open accounts. Cultural differences or language \nbarriers also present challenges that can hinder the ability of \nconsumers to access financial services. I also want to clarify that in \nsection 1204, small dollar-value loans and financial education and \ncounseling relating to conducting transactions in and managing accounts \nare only examples of, and not limitations on, eligible activities.\n  More must be done to promote product development, outreach, and \nfinancial education opportunities intended to empower consumers. Title \nXII authorizes programs intended to assist low- and moderate-income \nindividuals establish bank or credit union accounts and encourage \ngreater use of mainstream financial services. It will also encourage \nthe development of small, affordable loans as an alternative to more \ncostly payday loans.\n  There is a great need for working families to have access to \naffordable small loans. This legislation would encourage banks and \ncredit unions to develop consumer friendly payday loan alternatives. \nConsumers who apply for these loans would be provided with financial \nliteracy and educational opportunities.\n  The National Credit Union Administration has provided assistance to \ndevelop these small consumer-friendly loans. Windward Community Credit \nUnion in Hawaii implemented a very successful program for the U.S. \nMarines and other community members in need of affordable short term \ncredit. More working families need access to affordable small loans. \nThis program will encourage mainstream financial service providers to \ndevelop affordable small loan products.\n  I am proud of the work we have done on this legislation. However, \nthere is one issue that still has not been resolved. There is one \nprovision in the legislation that needs to be changed. Section 913, \ncontains a study and rulemaking regarding obligations of brokers, \ndealers, and investment advisers. This study is unnecessary. The \nsection does not provide the authority needed by the Securities and \nExchange Commission to effectively protect investors. The decisions \nthat the heads of households make with their investment choices \ndetermine their future financial condition. Investment professionals \nthat provide personalized advice can significantly influence investor \ndecisions.\n  Imposing a fiduciary duty on brokers, when giving personalized \ninvestment advice is necessary because it will ensure that all \nfinancial professionals, whether they are an investment advisor or a \nbroker, have the same duty to act in the best interests of their \nclients. Investors must be able to trust that their broker is acting in \ntheir best interest.\n  Unfortunately, too many investors do not know the difference between \na broker and an investment advisor. Even fewer are likely to know that \ntheir broker has no obligation to act in their best interest. \nInvestment advisors currently have fiduciary obligations. However, \nbrokers must only meet a suitability standard that fails to \nsufficiently protect investors.\n  In a complicated financial marketplace, for investors in which \nrevenue\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\nsharing agreements and commissions can vary significantly for similar \nproducts, we must ensure that all investment professionals that offer \npersonalized investment advice have a fiduciary duty imposed on them.\n  In 2005, I first introduced legislation that would have imposed a \nfiduciary duty on brokers. I knew then that action was necessary. In \nthe wake of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing \nhighlighting the activities of Goldman Sachs that appeared to put firm \nprofits before the interest of their clients, this issue becomes even \nmore important to include in the bill.\n  We must act to ensure that brokers have an obligation to do what is \nbest for their clients and not allow brokers to push higher commission \nproducts that may be inappropriate for a particular client. The \nimposition of a fiduciary duty on brokers has extensive support.\n  There are brokers that are supportive of doing what is in the best \ninterest of their clients. I greatly admire the recent bold statements \nmade by Ms. Sallie Krawcheck, president of Bank of America Global \nWealth and Investment Management. Ms. Krawcheck said that brokers \nshould ``do right by our clients by embracing our fiduciary \nresponsibilities for them . . . embracing reform will enable us to \nchampion what is indisputably right for clients.''\n  There is widespread support for imposing a fiduciary duty on brokers. \nAARP, the Consumer Federation of America, the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association, the National Association of Secretaries of \nState, the National Governors Association, Americans for Financial \nReform, the Investment Advisers Association, the National Association \nof Personal Financial Advisers, the Council of Institutional Investors, \nand the Financial Planning Association are several examples of \norganizations that support this important investor protection.\n  There are not many that continue to oppose imposition of a fiduciary \nduty. Insurance agents and the insurance industry remain among the few \nthat oppose this investor protection. Some within the industry have \neven chosen to misrepresent our efforts as ending the commission-based \nmodel. If they were to merely read the proposed legislative language, \nthey would know that this is not true.\n  I thank my friend from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, and his staff, \nfor working with me on this issue. I also want to acknowledge all of \nthe tremendous work done to advance this vital consumer protection by \nHouse Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank. I will continue to work \nto ensure that that this obligation is included in the final version of \nthe legislation that is enacted.\n  I also thank the Banking Committee staff for all of their \nextraordinary work, including Levon Bagramian, Julie Chon, Brian \nFilipowich, Amy Friend, Catherine Galicia, Lynsey Graham Rea, Matthew \nGreen, Marc Jarsulic, Mark Jickling, Deborah Katz, Jonathan Miller, \nMisha Mintz-Roth, Dean Shahinian, Ed Silverman, and Charles Yi.\n  Also, I appreciate all of the work done by the legislative assistants \nof Members of the Committee, including Laura Swanson, Kara Stein, Jonah \nCrane, Ellen Chube, Michael Passante, Lee Drutman, Graham Steele, \nAlison O'Donnell, Hilary Swab, Harry Stein, Karolina Arias, Nathan \nSteinwald, Andy Green, Brian Appel, and Matt Pippin.\n  In conclusion, this bill will improve the lives of working families. \nI will continue to work to bring about enactment of this legislation \nthat will educate, protect, and empower consumers and investors.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment at \nthe posture of the massive legislative overhaul of our financial \nmarkets that appears set to pass this body.\n  I am disappointed at what this bill, as written, means for businesses \non Main Street and for the livelihoods of Americans who had nothing to \ndo with the financial meltdown.\n  I am also disheartened at how this body has made a bad bill even \nworse. For all the times the other side of the aisle has accused the \nminority of being obstructionists, for all the claims of partisanship, \nthe process by which this bill has become the government power-grab it \nis today illustrates how the majority has served as its own ``party of \nno''.\n  After repeated efforts by Republicans in the past 18 months to reach \na middle ground on necessary reforms for America's financial regulatory \nstructure, reasonable compromises we presented were rejected at every \nturn.\n  And two years after the jolt of the economic crisis, and with no hope \nin sight for cooperation from the White House, a 1,400-page, one-sided \npiece of legislation was brought to the Senate floor.\n  Now with more than 400 amendments filed, and just 10 percent of those \nconsidered, this administration is again set to sign into law another \nmammoth piece of legislation--one with enormous and long-lasting \nrepercussions for this country--with little to no Republican input.\n  The consequences of actions we take here in the coming days will be \ndrastic in their reach into American businesses of all sizes.\n  Make no mistake: This bill will not punish Wall Street. In fact, the \nCEOs of Wall Street firms are supportive of this bill as written.\n  After all, it is difficult to say this bill goes after Wall Street \nwhen the CEO of one of its largest financial institutions says ``. . . \nthe biggest beneficiaries of reform will be Wall Street itself.'' Lloyd \nBlankfein, CEO, Goldman Sachs, Homeland Security & Government Affairs \nhearing, 4/27/10.\n  No, the real targets will be businesses across America, not just big \nfirms on Wall Street but auto dealers in suburbs or appliance stores on \nsmall-town Main Streets. Everywhere a small business allows its \ncustomers to pay with lines of credit, the Federal Government will be \nthere.\n  One of the biggest problems with this legislation is that it does not \naddress one of the root causes of America's economic crisis: Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac.\n  These entities--effectively deemed by the White House and others as \n``too big to legislate''--continue to perpetuate a sickness on the \nAmerican economy.\n  As structured, these ``bailout behemoths'' continue to rely on \ntaxpayer money to maintain their fiscal imprudence--to the tune of $145 \nbillion. But nothing in this bill attempts to stop that drain on \ntaxpayers' wallets.\n  Another glaring example of government intrusion in this bill is the \ncreation of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau empowered to collect \nany information it chooses from private businesses and consumers, \nincluding personal and financial information.\n  This new agency will have the authority to share that information \nwith the very financial firms it is attempting to regulate. In other \nwords, taxpayers will be paying for Wall Street's market research.\n  As for Title VII--the derivatives title--it is simply a debacle.\n  As ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, I have spent a great \ndeal of time examining how derivatives have played a role in the market \nmeltdown, and not surprisingly, we have found that there are a number \nof regulatory improvements we need to make relative to the oversight of \nswap market participants.\n  However the language we are considering today is, quite frankly, \nanother power grab by the administration and the regulators for \nprovisions in law that had absolutely nothing to do with the crisis we \nexperienced in the market place 2 years ago.\n  This administration, along with the majority in this body, want to \nregulate Ford Motor Credit the same as they regulate large banks such \nas JP MorganChase and Goldman Sachs. Guess who is going to end up \npaying the price for that change in regulation? My Georgia constituents \nwho want to buy cars. They will be paying more in the form of interest \nbecause if this bill is enacted into law, Ford will be forced to pay \nmore to hedge its interest-rate risk.\n  The majority wants to make it more difficult for clearinghouses to \napprove swaps for listing, which is senseless, as they also require \nmandated clearing.\n  The majority claims that by forcing more swaps into a clearinghouse \nit will lessen systemic risk. Why, then, are we making the \nclearinghouses jump through more hoops to clear these contracts?\n  As I understand it, the current system where clearinghouses have the \ndiscretion to list contracts for clearing\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nhave experienced no problems. And as we know, the clearinghouses \ncertainly aren't responsible for the financial crisis.\n  The majority is also requiring major swap participants to hold more \ncapital in reserve. I can understand the need for requiring those who \nhold large swaps positions to margin, or collateralize, their \npositions. But why are we also going to make them set aside capital? \nAgain, we are treating them like banks and they are not banks.\n  If we make manufacturers set aside capital, it will only tie up money \nthey would otherwise have available to hire workers, pay benefits and \nrun their companies. With unemployment approaching 10 percent, we \nshould not make it more difficult for employers to hire. We should not \napply a banking model to market participants that are not banks.\n  As for market participants that need swaps to manage risk and have \nnegotiated individualized arrangements where they pledge noncash \ncollateral: How are they going to pledge collateral to a clearinghouse? \nLast time I checked, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, and \nInternational Continental Exchange, ICE, did not accept natural-gas \nleases as margin.\n  This bill will now require theses customers to post cash collateral \nto the clearinghouse, thereby tying up resources they would otherwise \nbe investing in locating more natural gas or petroleum. This is not a \nvery smart plan when we so desperately need to become less dependent on \nforeign sources of energy.\n  Rather than focusing on perfecting what actually could help lessen \nrisk within the derivatives system, we have a clear case of what I \nbelieve the administration and some in this body see as an opportunity \nto regulate simply for the sake of regulating.\n  The financial crisis and its causes seem to have become \nafterthoughts. The objective has shifted from regulating Wall Street to \nregulating manufacturers, energy producers, food producers, hospitals \nand anyone else who might seek to enter into a contract to manage their \nrisk.\n  Meanwhile, consumers will pay the price. Why? Because the White House \nand the majority in Congress lost sight of the problem that should be \nfixed and seized the opportunity to insert government into every \nindustry, financial and otherwise.\n  Mr. President, our side came to the table in good faith with ideas on \nnecessary reforms to America's financial markets.\n  We presented our thoughts on how best to prevent another meltdown. We \nnegotiated, we compromised, and we tried to work across the aisle \ntoward a common goal.\n  Ultimately, these efforts were fruitless. The other side stonewalled, \nand our ideas were opposed.\n  Now this bill--which will have a similar economic impact as the \nhealth care bill, yet which has only been debated for a fraction of the \ntime--will soon be law. And our economy and the livelihoods of \nAmericans who work in large and small businesses will be worse for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is with regret that I come to the floor \nto announce my opposition to this piece of legislation. I express \nregret not because this is somehow a good bill with a few flaws serious \nenough to warrant a no vote--I express regret because this bill is an \nabysmal failure and serves as yet another example of Congress' \ninability to tackle tough problems and institute real, meaningful and \ncomprehensive reform.\n  In the past 2 years America has faced her greatest fiscal challenges \nsince the Great Depression. When the financial markets collapsed it was \nthe American taxpayer who came to the rescue of the banks and big Wall \nStreet firms--but who has come to the rescue of the American taxpayer? \nCertainly not Congress. So what has Congress done? By enacting policies \nthat can only be described as inexplicable generational theft--we've \nsaddled future generations with literally trillions of dollars of debt. \nSince January of 2009 we have been on a spending binge the likes of \nwhich this nation has never seen. In that time our debt has grown by $2 \ntrillion. We passed a $1.1 trillion ``stimulus'' bill. We spent $83 \nbillion to bail out the domestic auto industry. We passed a $2.5 \ntrillion health care bill. The President submitted a budget for next \nyear totaling $3.8 trillion. We now have a deficit of over $1.4 \ntrillion and a debt of over $12.9 trillion. Unemployment remains at \nalmost 10 percent. And, according to Forbes.com, a record 2.8 million \nAmerican households were threatened with foreclosure last year, and \nthat number is expected to rise to well over 3 million homes this year. \nAnd how has the Senate responded to this crisis of staggering debt, \ncatastrophic job loss and unimaginable foreclosure rates? Did the \nmajority take on the special interests? Did they seize the opportunity \nto develop a bill that goes right to the heart of the problem and make \nserious, meaningful and comprehensive reforms? Nope. They punted. Out \nof pure political expediency, they shrugged their shoulders and kicked \nthe can down the road and left the tough decisions for an unluckier \ngroup of Americans.\n  It is clear to any rational observer that the housing market has been \nthe catalyst of our current economic turmoil. And it is impossible to \nignore the significant role played by the government-sponsored \nenterprises--GSEs--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The events of the past \ntwo years have made it clear that never again can we allow the taxpayer \nto be responsible for poorly-managed financial entities who gambled \naway billions of dollars. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are synonymous \nwith mismanagement and waste and have become the face of `too big to \nfail'.\n  A May 6th editorial in the Wall Street Journal stated:\n\n       Fan and Fred owned or guaranteed $5 trillion in mortgages \n     and mortgage-backed securities when they collapsed in \n     September 2008. Reforming the financial system without fixing \n     Fannie and Freddie is like declaring a war on terror and \n     ignoring al Qaeda.\n       Unreformed, they are sure to kill taxpayers again. Only \n     yesterday, Freddie said it lost $8 billion in the first \n     quarter, requested another $10.6 billion from Uncle Sam, and \n     warned that it would need more in the future. This comes on \n     top of the $126.9 billion that Fan and Fred had already lost \n     through the end of 2009. The duo are by far the biggest \n     losers of the entire financial panic--bigger than AIG, \n     Citigroup and the rest.\n       From the 2008 meltdown through 2020, the toxic twins will \n     cost taxpayers close to $380 billion, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office's cautious estimate. The Obama \n     Administration won't even put the companies on budget for \n     fear of the deficit impact, but it realizes the problem \n     because last Christmas Eve it raised the $400 billion cap on \n     their potential taxpayer losses to . . . infinity.\n       Moreover, these taxpayer losses understate the financial \n     destruction wrought by Fan and Fred. By concealing how much \n     they were gambling on risky subprime and Alt-A mortgages, the \n     companies sent bogus signals on the size of these markets and \n     distorted decision-making throughout the system. Their \n     implicit government guarantee also let them sell mortgage-\n     backed securities around the world, attracting capital to \n     U.S. housing and thus turbocharging the mania.\n\n  During the debate on this financial reform bill, we heard much about \nhow the U.S. Government will never again allow a financial institution \nto become too big to fail. We heard countless calls for more regulation \nto ensure that taxpayers are never again placed at such tremendous \nrisk. Sadly, the bill before us now completely ignores the elephant in \nthe room--because no other entities' failure would be as disastrous to \nour economy as Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's. Yet the majority chose \nnot to address them at all in the bill before us.\n  There have been numerous warnings about the mismanagement of both \nFannie and Freddie over the years. In May of 2006, after a 27 month \ninvestigation into the corrupt corporate culture and accounting \npractices at Fannie Mae, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \nOversight--OFHEO--the Federal regulator charged with overseeing Fannie \nMae--issued a blistering, 348-page report which highlighted the culture \nof corruption which was rampant at Fannie Mae. The report stated things \nsuch as:\n\n       Fannie Mae senior management promoted an image of the \n     Enterprise as one of the lowest-risk financial institutions \n     in the world and as ``best in class'' in terms of risk \n     management, financial reporting, internal control, and \n     corporate governance. The findings in this report show that \n     risks at Fannie Mae were greatly understated and that the \n     image was false.\n       During the period covered by this report--1998 to mid-\n     2004--Fannie Mae reported extremely smooth profit growth and \n     hit announced targets for earnings per share precisely each \n     quarter. Those achievements\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\n     were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the \n     Enterprise's senior management with the aid of inappropriate \n     accounting and improper earnings management.\n       A large number of Fannie Mae's accounting policies and \n     practices did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting \n     Principles (GAAP). The Enterprise also had serious problems \n     of internal control, financial reporting, and corporate \n     governance. Those errors resulted in Fannie Mae overstating \n     reported income and capital by a currently estimated $10.6 \n     billion.\n       By deliberately and intentionally manipulating accounting \n     to hit earnings targets, senior management maximized the \n     bonuses and other executive compensation they received, at \n     the expense of shareholders. Earnings management made a \n     significant contribution to the compensation of Fannie Mae \n     Chairman and CEO Franklin Raines, which totaled over $90 \n     million from 1998 through 2003. Of that total, over $52 \n     million was directly tied to achieving earnings per share \n     targets.\n       Fannie Mae consistently took a significant amount of \n     interest rate risk and, when interest rates fell in 2002, \n     incurred billions of dollars in economic losses. The \n     Enterprise also had large operational and reputational risk \n     exposures.\n       Fannie Mae's Board of Directors contributed to those \n     problems by failing to be sufficiently informed and to act \n     independently of its chairman, Franklin Raines, and other \n     senior executives; by failing to exercise the requisite \n     oversight over the Enterprise's operations; and by failing to \n     discover or ensure the correction of a wide variety of unsafe \n     and unsound practices.\n       Fannie Mae senior management sought to interfere with \n     OFHEO's special examination by directing the Enterprise's \n     lobbyists to use their ties to Congressional staff to (1) \n     generate a Congressional request for the Inspector General of \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to \n     investigate OFHEO's conduct of that examination and (2) \n     insert into an appropriations bill language that would reduce \n     the agency's appropriations until the Director of OFHEO was \n     replaced.\n\n  So what steps were taken by the Congress to punish Fannie Mae for \nsuch deliberate manipulation and outright corruption at that time? \nBasically: none. And nothing is done to rein them in under this bill \neither.\n  Just this morning the Heritage Foundation wrote the following:\n\n       There is still nothing in this bill that addresses the \n     perverse incentives and moral hazard that is created when the \n     federal government sticks its nose into the housing market. \n     Last year, the two financed or backed about 70 percent of \n     single-family mortgage loans. They hold about $5 trillion in \n     their investment portfolios. Both are losing money fast, with \n     those losses being covered by the U.S. taxpayer. Last month, \n     Freddie announced it had lost $8 billion in the first quarter \n     of 2010 and would be asking for another $10.6 billion in \n     taxpayer help. Not to be outdone, Fannie announced an $11.5 \n     billion loss and asked for another $8.4 billion from \n     taxpayers. That's atop the nearly $145 billion of your \n     dollars that Fannie and Freddie have already received. Fannie \n     and Freddie alone prove this bill does nothing to end ``too \n     big to fail.'' Fannie and Freddie should be partly wound \n     down, the rest broken up and sold off--not replaced, \n     reformed, or rejuvenated. The Dodd bill does none of that.\n\n  As my colleagues know, I offered a good, common-sense amendment \ndesigned to end the taxpayer-backed conservatorship of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac by putting in place an orderly transition period and \neventually requiring them to operate--without government subsidies--on \na level playing field with their private sector competitors. \nUnfortunately that amendment was defeated by a near-party-line vote.\n  The majority, however, did offer an alternative proposal to my \namendment. Was it a good, well thought out, comprehensive plan to end \nthe taxpayer-backed free ride of Fannie and Freddie and require them to \noperate on a level playing field with their private sector competitors? \nNope. It was a study. The majority included language in this bill to \nstudy the problem of Fannie and Freddie for six months. Wow! Instead of \ndealing head-on with the two enterprises that brought our entire \neconomy to its knees--entities which have already cost taxpayers over \n$145 billion in bailouts--the Democrats want to study them for 6 more \nmonths. It is no wonder the American people view us with such contempt.\n  Additionally, I cosponsored an amendment with my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Cantwell, to ensure that we never again stick the \nAmerican taxpayer with another $700 billion-plus tab to bailout the \nfinancial industry. If big Wall Street institutions want to take part \nin risky transactions--fine. But we should not allow them to do so with \nfederally insured deposits.\n  Paul Volcker, a top economist in the Obama administration and former \nFederal Reserve Chairman, wants the nation's banks to be prohibited \nfrom owning and trading risky securities, the very practice that got \nthe biggest ones into deep trouble in 2008. Mr. Volcker argues that \nregulation by itself will not work. Sooner or later, the giants, in \npursuit of profits, will get into trouble. Congress and the \nadministration should accept this and shield commercial banking from \nWall Street's wild ways. ``The banks are there to serve the public,'' \nMr. Volcker said, ``and that is what they should concentrate on. These \nother activities create conflicts of interest. They create risks, and \nif you try to control the risks with supervision, that just creates \nfriction and difficulties'' and ultimately fails.\n  The amendment we offered precluded any member bank of the Federal \nReserve System from being affiliated with any entity or organization \nthat is engaged principally in the issue, flotation, underwriting, \npublic sale or distribution of stocks, bonds or other securities. \nEssentially, commercial banks may no longer inter-mingle their business \nactivities with investment banks. It is that simple.\n  Since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, this country has \nseen a new culture emerge in the financial industry: one of dangerous \ngreed and excessive risk-taking. Commercial banks traditionally used \npeople's deposits for the constructive purpose of main street loans. \nThey did not engage in high risk ventures. Investment banks, however, \nmanaged rich people's money--those who can afford to take bigger risks \nin order to get a bigger return, and who bore their own losses. When \nthese two worlds collided, the investment bank culture prevailed, \ncutting off the credit lifeblood of Main Street firms, demanding \ngreater returns that were achievable only through high leverage and \nhuge risk taking, and leaving taxpayers with the fallout.\n  When the glass wall dividing banks and securities firms was \nshattered, common sense and caution went out the door. The new mantra \nof ``bigger is better'' took over--and the path forward focused on \nshort-term gains rather than long-term planning. Banks became \noverleveraged in their haste to keep up in the race. The more they \nlent, the more they made. Aggressive mortgages were underwritten for \nunqualified individuals who became homeowners saddled with loans they \ncouldn't afford. Banks turned right around and bought portfolios of \nthese shaky loans.\n  Sub-prime loans made up only 5 percent of all mortgage lending in \n1998, but by the time the financial crisis peaked in late 2008, they \nwere approaching 30 percent. Since January 2008, we have seen 264 state \nand national banks fail. In my home State of Arizona, eight banks have \nshut their doors, leaving small businesses scrambling to find credit \nfrom other banks that may have already been overleveraged.\n  Banks sold sub-prime mortgages to their affiliates and other \nsecurities firms for securitization, while other financial institutions \nmade risky bets on these and other assets for which they had no \nfinancial interest. As the market grew bigger, its foundation became \nshakier. It was like a house of cards waiting to fall. And fall it did.\n  In October 2008, the financial system was on the brink of collapse \nwhen Congress was forced to risk $700 billion of taxpayer dollars to \nbailout the industry. These financial institutions had become too big \nto fail. In fact, the special inspector general of Troubled Asset \nRelief Program--TARP--testified before Congress last year that ``total \npotential Federal Government support could reach $23.7 trillion'' to \nstabilize and support the financial system. Ironically, some of these \n``too big to fail'' institutions have now become even bigger. A recent \neditorial from the New York Times stated:\n\n       The truth is that the taxpayers are still very much on the \n     hook for a banking system that is shaping up to be much \n     riskier than the one that led to disaster.\n       Big bank profits, for instance, still come mostly courtesy \n     of taxpayers. Their trading earnings are financed by more \n     than a trillion dollars' worth of cheap loans from the \n     Federal Reserve, for which some of their most noxious assets \n     are collateral. They benefit from immense federal loan \n     guarantees, but they are not lending much. Lending to \n     business, notably, is very tight.\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\n       What profits the banks make come mostly from trading. Many \n     big banks are happy to depend on the lifeline from the Fed \n     and hang onto their toxic assets hoping for a rebound in \n     prices. And the whole system has grown more concentrated. \n     Bank of America was considered too big to fail before the \n     meltdown. Since then, it has acquired Merrill Lynch. Wells \n     Fargo took over Wachovia. And JPMorgan Chase gobbled up Bear \n     Stearns.\n       If the goal is to reduce the number of huge banks that \n     taxpayers must rescue at any cost, the nation is moving in \n     the wrong direction. The growth of the biggest banks ensures \n     that the next bailout will have to be even bigger. These \n     banks will be more likely to take on excessive risk because \n     they have the implicit assurance of rescue.\n\n  The Federal Government has set a dangerous precedent here. We sent \nthe wrong message to the financial industry: you engage in bad, risky \nbusiness practices, and when you get into trouble, the government will \nbe there to save your hide. It amounts to nothing more than a taxpayer-\nfunded subsidy for risky behavior.\n  The consolidation of the banking world was also riddled with \nconflicts of interest, despite the purported firewalls that were put \ninto place. If an investment bank had underwritten shares for a company \nthat was now in financial trouble, the investment bank's commercial arm \nwould feel pressure to lend the company money, despite the lack of \nmerits to do so. This amendment would have eliminated some of these \nconflicts.\n  It is time to put a stop to the taxpayer financed excesses of Wall \nStreet. No single financial institution should be so big that its \nfailure would bring ruin to our economy and destroy millions of \nAmerican jobs. This country would be better served if we limit the \nactivities of these financial institutions. Banks should accept \nconsumer deposits and invest conservatively, while investment banks \nengage in underwriting and sales of securities.\n  In an op-ed titled ``Bring Back Glass-Steagall,'' Wall Street Journal \ncolumnist Thomas Frank summed up the situation very nicely recently \nwhen he wrote:\n\n       One of these days, we will finally dispel the `New Economy' \n     mysticism that beclouds this issue and begin to think \n     seriously about how to re-regulate the financial sector. And \n     when we do, we may find the answer involves some version of \n     the idea behind Glass-Steagall--drawing a line between banks \n     that the government effectively guarantees and banks that \n     behave like big hedge funds, experimenting with the latest \n     financial toxins. Hopefully, that day will come before Wall \n     Street decides to take another headlong run at some \n     attractive cliff.\n\n  Unfortunately, our amendment was defeated by a procedural motion and \nwas not even brought up for a vote.\n  Again, I regret that I have to vote against this bill. I assure my \ncolleagues, and the American people, that if this were truly a bill \nthat instituted real, serious and effective reforms--I would be the \nfirst in line to cast a vote in its favor. But it is not. It serves as \nevidence of a dereliction of our duty and a missed opportunity to \nprovide the American people with the protections necessary to avert yet \nanother financial disaster. They deserve better from us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, tonight we are nearing the end of the \nSenate's consideration of a historic piece of legislation. In response \nto the most significant financial crisis this country has seen in a \ngeneration, we have been engaged in a debate about the future of our \nfinancial system.\n  Two years ago, our economy came to a grinding halt. Credit markets \nshut down, business activity basically stopped in some areas, and world \ntrade virtually collapsed. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and \ntheir homes, and they saw trillions in savings wiped out.\n  As a witness to the near collapse of our financial system and the \neconomic devastation it has wrought, I am fully aware of the \nfundamental importance of the legislative effort we will soon complete. \nBecause the financial system serves as the heart of our economy, this \nlegislation will have a profound effect on the economic future of this \ncountry. The decisions we have made will have an impact on the lives of \nAmericans for decades to come. Furthermore, the impact of this \nlegislation will extend far beyond our shores.\n  For these reasons, I believe we must get it right. In the end, we \nwill be judged by whether we have created a more stable, durable, and \ncompetitive financial system. That judgment will not be rendered by \nself-congratulatory press releases, but, rather, by the marketplace. \nAnd the marketplace does not give credit for good intentions.\n  Knowing that millions of Americans suffered greatly because of the \nfinancial crisis and that generations of future Americans are relying \non us to get this right, how did we go about this proceeding that \nbrought us to where we are tonight? I am going to pose a number of \nquestions.\n  Did we conduct a thorough review of every facet of the crisis?\n  Did we look at the structure of our markets, examine the role of the \nregulators, and determine how the existing regulations drove certain \nmarket actions?\n  Did we investigate the GSEs, examine their capital and leverage, \naddress the inherent weaknesses in their dual and conflicting \nobjectives of maximizing returns for private owners while serving as a \npublic housing mission?\n  Did we explain Bear Stearns and the causes of its collapse, along \nwith the SEC regulatory program entrusted at that time with its \noversight?\n  Did we collect and analyze data regarding the areas hardest hit by \nforeclosures?\n  Did we determine whether there were any specific loan types, however \ncharacterized, that led to the foreclosures?\n  Did we take time to learn lessons from the debacle of the AIG \nfinancial products division or securities lending operations or of \noverheated tri-party repo activity?\n  Did we analyze how maturity transformation allowed the shadow banking \nsystem to, in effect, create money out of AAA rated securities?\n  Did we analyze how activities in the shadow banking system led to an \nincreased concentration of inherently runnable activities?\n  Did we analyze liquidity buffers at broker dealers?\n  And did we wait for the Financial Crisis Inquiring Commission, a \ncreation of this Congress, to deliver lessons that it learned about the \nfinancial crisis so as to inform our deliberations even more?\n  The answer to all of these questions I posed is no, we did not. In my \nview, this represents a fundamental failure of this body to do its own \ndue diligence before we even attempt such a significant undertaking as \nwe are about to tonight.\n  Millions of people lost their jobs, their homes, and trillions of \ndollars of wealth. The American people expect more and certainly \ndeserve more, I believe, from us.\n  Nonetheless, it certainly did not take much investigation to know \nthat the heart of the crisis was massive failures in our mortgage \nunderwriting and securitization systems. Therefore, the most \nincredulous shortcoming of this bill, in my judgment, is the lack of \nany serious attention by the Senate being paid to the government-\nsponsored enterprises that we know as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  Yesterday, one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said \nwe were not dealing with the GSEs in this bill because it is too hard. \nI have to say we certainly have come a long way in the wrong direction.\n  There was a time not long ago when we did things because they are \nhard and because they are worth doing. What a difference a few years \nmakes. It is simply a failure of will that nothing is being done to \nreform the GSEs or, at the very least, cap the allowable losses.\n  This bill has 12 titles totaling well over 1,500 pages. It has been \namended dozens of times. Yet the bill does nothing to affect the \nongoing, unlimited bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that to date \nhave cost the American taxpayers at least $146 billion, one of the \nlargest bailouts in history, and it is growing. Our distinguished \nchairman, the Senator from Connecticut, has expressed his outrage on a \nnumber of occasions that consumers paid around $40 billion in overdraft \nfees in 2009, and he is right. The GSEs now have cost the American \ntaxpayers over 3\\1/2\\ times that amount and counting. To quote my old \nfriend and former majority leader, Bob Dole: Where is the outrage here?\n\n  Perhaps what is most disappointing about the lack of attention to \nFannie and Freddie is the fact that there is no end in sight. Losses \ncontinue to mount\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nand the taxpayer exposure is unlimited. For example, in a recent SEC \nfiling, Fannie Mae reported a need for another $8\\1/2\\ billion from the \ntaxpayers. Hardworking Americans in my State of Alabama and throughout \nthe Nation will be asked to pony up again and again until we do \nsomething to stop it. When will it stop? According to my Democratic \nfriends, not yet. The best they can do for the American people in this \nbill is a study. That is simply incredible.\n  The GSEs should have been our primary focus. Instead, they were \nignored and further enabled by the administration when they raised the \ncap on losses in December of last year. In an attempt to do something \nabout the GSEs, Senators McCain, Gregg, and I, joined by several of our \nRepublican colleagues, introduced an amendment to this bill that would \nhave ended these bailouts. However, just as they presented action to \nrein in Fannie and Freddie in the past, Democrats once again embraced \nthe status quo and blocked the road to real GSE reform.\n  Once our amendment failed, several of my Republican colleagues and I, \nled by Senator Crapo of Idaho, decided that if we could not end these \nunlimited bailouts, we would try to cap the losses and provide for a \ntrue accounting of the costs. Our amendment would have capped these \nbailouts at $400 billion, which is a lot of money. Yet even at nearly \n$\\1/2\\ trillion, the Democrats could not bring themselves to stop the \nhemorrhaging of Fannie and Freddie and voted against the amendment.\n  How much will the GSEs have to lose before my Democratic friends will \nsay enough is enough? Will $\\1/2\\ trillion be enough? Will Democrats \nallow reform of Fannie and Freddie before it costs the taxpayers $1 \ntrillion? How much is too much?\n  The supporters of this bill have argued that it will stabilize our \nfinancial sector--the bill itself. I am not sure, however, it can \nstabilize anything when it does nothing--nothing--to address the two \nlargest destabilizing forces of the crisis, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nThe fact that it is costing taxpayers nearly $7 billion every month \nshould be enough to convince anyone that something needs to be done and \ndone now. Unfortunately, my Democratic friends, led by the President, \nare telling the American people they are going to have to pony up and \nwait again.\n  The failure to address the GSEs is the most glaring omission in this \nlegislation. There are, however, many things that are in this bill that \nraise similar concerns for the future of our economy, and I will go \nthrough some of them.\n  A major component of the bill deals with the creation of a massive \nnew consumer bureaucracy, along with a separate title 12, which is a \nliberal activist's dream come true. Provisions in this title will \ncompel financial institutions to provide free services to selected \ncommunity groups. This is the exact same model that led us to the \ncrisis in the first place, except for one distinct difference. The \ngovernment bailout is built in from the beginning through the use of \ntaxpayer guarantees.\n  The American people are being misled. The authors of this bill are \ntelling them this legislation has been drafted to address the recent \nfinancial crisis and that it will tame Wall Street. I am afraid they \nare going to be disappointed. By the Democrats' own admission, the most \nimportant facet of this legislation is the creation of a massive new \nconsumer bureaucracy. It has been described by my Democratic friends as \nthe ``third rail'' of this bill.\n  During our negotiations on the consumer bureaucracy, my Democratic \nfriends were not focused on the mortgage market. Their sights were set \non the rest of the economy. Make no mistake, behind the veil of anti-\nWall Street rhetoric is an unrelenting desire to manage every facet of \ncommerce under the guise of consumer protection. They may be interested \nin protecting consumers, but they are more interested in managing them. \nAll one has to do is read the academic writings of the authors of this \nnew bureaucracy and it becomes very clear what their goals are.\n  The Democrats' new bureaucracy is an enormous reach across virtually \nevery segment of our economy and a massive expansion of government \ninfluence in our daily financial lives. The people of America have been \nclear: They do not want a massively intrusive, continuously growing, \nand overly expansive government. They do not want a continuation of our \nunsustainable government promises, government spending, government \ndeficits, and government debt. They saw what happened in Greece when it \noverpromised and overspent, and Americans do not want to leave European \nfiscal legacy to their children.\n  Yet this bill does not listen to the American people. It promises \nmassive government overreach into even routine daily financial \ntransactions of ordinary Americans and businesses, large and small. Why \ndoes the Federal Government need information on ``pertinent \ncharacteristics''--whatever that might mean--of persons covered by the \nnew consumer bureaucracy?\n  This new consumer bureaucracy will become massive, populated with \nthousands of bureaucrats who will create, within the new bureau, what \nadministration officials have referred to as a correct ``culture'' of \nconsumerism. What is that? The new consumer protection bureaucracy is \nfunded by over $\\1/2\\ billion per year, funded through an Argentina-\nstyle raid on our central bank. Of course, this opens the door for \nunlimited Federal taxpayer funds for community organizers and groups \nsuch as ACORN.\n  I favor consumer protection. I believe all of us do. This new bureau, \nhowever, promises to be more abusive than protective. By abuse, I mean \nthat the bureau will lower the living standards of Americans. This new \nconsumer bureaucracy is intended, by its architects in the Treasury, to \nbegin the process of financial regulation with the intent of changing \nthe behaviors of the American people.\n  I have faith in the American people and their ability to make good \nchoices. Granted, we do not always choose well, but that is the human \ncondition. I believe a poor choice freely made is far superior to a \ngood choice that is made for me. I am afraid the architects of this \nbill do not share this sentiment, nor do they share my faith in the \nAmerican people.\n  They view us as victims in need of their guidance. They view us as \nfallible and in need of government bureaucrats to protect us from \nourselves. It is a bit ironic, however, that the sponsors of this new \nbureaucracy seem to believe regulators do not share the same \nfallibility of ordinary Americans. Tell that to the hundreds of Bernie \nMadoff victims.\n  This is the world view that is driving this bill, and it should \nconcern every American. It seems, increasingly, that the view of the \nDemocrats toward virtually all American business is a cynical view that \nAmericans are out to take advantage of one another. I don't share that \nview either. My presumption is Americans are honest and hardworking and \nhistory has shown that to be true.\n  This bill promises to slow economic growth and kill jobs because it \nwill place onerous regulatory burdens on businesses large and small. \nThis bill will stifle innovation in consumer financial products and \nreduce small business activity. It will lead to reduced consumer credit \nand higher costs for available credit. Less credit at a higher price \nwill dampen the very small business engines of job creation so \ndesperately needed right now, when unemployment hovers near double \ndigits nationally and is at 11 percent in my home State of Alabama. I \ncannot support legislation that threatens business conditions and the \npotential for job creation, especially at a time when we are crawling \nout of a severe recession.\n  Aside from onerous new consumer regulations, another avenue through \nwhich the bill will slow economic activity is in the treatment of \nderivatives. This bill will chase risky financial trades overseas and \nfurther into the unregulated shadow banking system, thereby magnifying, \nnot reducing, unmonitored systemic risks.\n  This bill demonstrates an imprudent disregard for the economic \neffects of a severely misguided approach to derivatives. Given the \ntreatment of derivatives in this bill, end users--that is everyone from \ncandy bar makers to beer brewers--who rely on these financial \ninstruments to manage their risks will face massive increases in costs. \nBecause risk management will now be\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\nsignificantly more expensive, we can expect lower business investment, \nwhich, again, means fewer jobs.\n  Why are we increasing costs to ordinary end users of derivatives, \nsuch as your home heating provider or makers of candy bars? There seems \nto be an irrational desire to make all financial products of certain \ntypes standard, whether that can or should be done. Once again, the \nattitude seems to be: We are government and we know best. That attitude \nwill almost surely lead to massive concentrations of risks in central \nderivatives clearinghouses. It will also, ironically, chase derivatives \nactivities overseas and into the unregulated shadow banking system. Who \nwill back up these clearinghouses at the end of the day should market \nstresses prove to be severe? The Federal Government and the Federal \nReserve will back them up, promising even more bailouts in the future--\nthis time possibly for clearinghouses.\n  The approach to hedge fund oversight in this bill is symptomatic of \nan overall careless approach to assigning regulatory responsibility. \nHedge funds have not been identified as a cause of the financial \ncrisis, but hedge funds have been identified as a potential source of \nsystemic risk.\n  However, rather than subjecting hedge funds to a systemic risk \noversight regime, hedge fund advisers will be subject to a registration \nregime and the investor-protection oriented requirements that go along \nwith it.\n  On its face, registration sounds reasonable.\n  The SEC, however, is not a systemic risk regulator, and when it tried \nto be one through the Consolidated Supervised Entity--``CSE''--program, \nit failed. Yet, now, we are doubling down on the SEC, the very agency \nthat failed us to begin with.\n  An unfortunate consequence of the treatment of hedge funds in the \nbill is that investors will likely treat SEC registration as an SEC \nseal of approval. Fraudulent hedge fund advisors will be virtually \ninvited to use registration as a marketing tool.\n  Investor protection is an important job for the SEC, but its \nresources are not endless, and the SEC has been notoriously unable to \ninspect advisors on a regular basis.\n  Limited SEC resources should not be diverted from regulated public \ninvestment companies, such as mutual funds, to the monitoring of hedge \nfund advisors, as the reported bill proposes to do.\n  If the SEC is spending its resources in this manner, it will not be \nlong before investors that do not meet the accredited investor \nthreshold start demanding to be allowed to invest in hedge funds.\n  It will be hard to counter the argument that they should have access \nto such investments when the SEC is on the case.\n  Mr. President, there are dozens of problems with the Lincoln-Dodd \nover-the-counter--OTC--derivatives title, which I would be more than \nhappy to document. In the interest of brevity, however, I will point \nout just a few of the most egregious examples:\n  The Lincoln-Dodd derivatives title does not provide regulators with \naccess to the information they need to do their job.\n  The title is unworkable. In a 6-month marathon rulemaking session, \nregulators are to make massive changes in a huge market without the \nusual notice-and-comment that allows for broad public input.\n  Neither the SEC nor the CFTC has the staff that it needs to write the \nrules, let alone implement them. Companies, including Main Street \nbusinesses, all across the United States will also face operational, \nlegal, and financial challenges as they strive to come into compliance \nwith record keeping, reporting, capital, margin, clearing, and business \nconduct requirements.\n  Key provisions in the Lincoln-Dodd derivatives title directly \ncontradict key provisions in other titles and current law. Section 716, \nfor example, would preclude a clearinghouse--even one that does not \nclear swaps--from receiving access to the discount window. This is \ndirectly contrary to title 8, which empowers the Federal Reserve to \ngrant discount window access to clearinghouses.\n  The proposed regulatory framework in the Lincoln-Dodd derivatives \ntitle poses new risks to the system. For-profit clearinghouses will \nhave an incentive to clear as many swaps as possible.\n  If they do not properly assess and collect margin for risks \nassociated with these products or do not have sufficient operational \ncapacity, an unanticipated event in the market could topple a \nclearinghouse and send shock waves throughout the rest of the system.\n  The Lincoln-Dodd derivatives title will benefit big dealers who can \nshift their swaps business overseas over small dealers who cannot.\n  The so-called end user exemption contained in the Lincoln-Dodd \nderivatives title is illusory. Main Street businesses will not be able \nto continue hedging their business risks as they now do.\n  Many end users will find themselves subject to clearing mandates, \nbank-like capital requirements, and extensive dealer-like business \nconduct requirements. As a result, Main Street businesses will face \nhigher costs that will ultimately be borne by consumers.\n  Consumers will be paying more for everything from electricity to \ncandy bars. The Lincoln-Dodd derivatives title will work as an \nantistimulus plan that will pull resources out of the economy, hurt \ngrowth, and slow job creation. The derivatives title has real world \nconsequences that cannot be wished away with a few technical fixes at \nthe margins.\n  Those are but a few of nearly one hundred flaws in the derivatives \ntitle. Yet there is another title--title 8--which has received less \nattention than derivatives, but is equally troublesome.\n  Title 8 would give a stability Council broad power to identify \nfinancial market utilities, payment, clearing, or settlement activities \nthat it deems to be now, or likely to become, systemically important. \nThose entities and activities would then be subject to risk regulation \nby the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n  This title is another example of an inappropriate delegation of an \ncongressional responsibility to decide who should be regulated and by \nwhich regulator. The extent of delegation is left uncomfortably open, \nas it depends on open-ended language in which key terms are undefined.\n  The definition of ``payment, clearing, and settlement activities,'' \nfor example, include any ``activity carried out by 1 or more financial \ninstitutions to facilitate the completion of financial transactions.'' \nWith definitions like this one guiding the Council, it could decide to \nassign any aspect of the financial market to the Fed.\n  Lack of regulatory accountability contributed to the recent financial \ncrisis. Title 8 exacerbates the problem by allowing the Council to \nbring the Fed into significant sectors of the financial system as a \nback-up regulator. If a problem arises, both the Fed and the relevant \nsupervisory agency will have someone else to blame. And both will be \nable to blame Congress for its careless delegation of its own \nresponsibilities.\n  Yet another troublesome title is title 9, which could appropriately \nbe labeled the ``Grab-Bag'' title, since it is a grab-bag of items on \nthe years-old wish lists of special-interest groups.\n  These items are not designed to respond to problems identified in the \nlast crisis or likely in any crisis, and have not been considered in \nhearings.\n  The grab bag includes puzzling items, like a provision that would \ncreate a redundant office at the SEC and another provision that \nrequires disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's compensation \nto the chief executive officer's compensation.\n  It looks to me like the way is being paved to achieve so-called \n``social justice'' in income distribution. This is another disturbing \nexample of the government getting its nose under the private sector's \ntent.\n  The grab bag also includes anti-investor provisions. The proxy access \nprovision, for example, enables special interest groups to push their \nagendas at the expense of the rest of the shareholders.\n  It also includes a surprising self-funding provision that will give \nthe SEC complete control over the size and allocation of its budget. \nLet me repeat that. The Democrats are going to give the SEC virtual \nbudget autonomy from congressional oversight after the SEC\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\ndropped the ball in the Madoff and Stanford frauds, and in the wake of \nthe SEC's pornography scandal.\n  When the ``grab bag'' title does attempt to address issues related to \nthe crisis, it takes the wrong approach.\n  With respect to credit rating agencies, for example, the effort to \npull ratings out of the statutes and regulations is lost in a \ncomplicated new regulatory framework that only the big credit rating \nagencies will be able to navigate. This will stifle competition--the \nvery thing we need to be encouraging. The failure of the ratings \nagencies was central to the crisis and this bill represents half \nmeasures at best.\n  The heightened liability standards, corporate governance \nrequirements, and qualification standards for credit rating analysts \nwill lull investors into greater apathy and discourage competition.\n  With respect to securitization, rather than focus on the root cause \nof the housing bubble by establishing clear, tough, and fair \nunderwriting standards, this title imposes a 5 percent risk-retention \nrequirement across-the-board for securitizations.\n  In combination with changes in accounting and bank capital rules, a \nrisk retention requirement could force an entire securitization to be \nretained on a bank's balance sheet for accounting and capital purposes. \nSecuritization activity would then become economically unviable.\n  This approach to securitization is a risky gamble to take at a time \nwhen our securitization markets are just starting to recover and show \nsome signs of life.\n  The whistleblower provisions are well-intentioned attempts to address \nthe SEC's failure during the Madoff scandal.\n  However, the guaranteed massive minimum payouts and limited SEC \nflexibility ensure that a line of claimants will form at the SEC's door \nhoping for some of the hundreds of millions in the whistleblower pot. \nThe SEC will spend limited resources sorting through these claims that \nwould have been better spent bringing enforcement cases.\n  Title 9 devotes 250 pages to provisions that either have nothing to \ndo with the crisis or purport to provide solutions that will not \nactually solve problems but, rather, promise to give rise to many new \nproblems.\n  This bill has been largely outsourced to Treasury officials and to \nregulators who have written key provisions to bolster their own power \nand authority.\n  This bill reflects a series of deals made, not by lobbyists, but by \nthe executive branch along with the existing financial regulators who \nfailed to do their jobs during the last crisis.\n  In negotiating key features of the bill, delays were the norm as \nresponses to my offers or inquiries had to pass through a long and \nwinding road of approval from Treasury, the Fed, the FDIC and on and \non.\n  Unfortunately, we have outsourced the writing of this legislation to \nthe Fed, Treasury, OCC, SEC, CFTC, among other government \nbureaucracies.\n  Let me give an example. Consider the derivatives title in the bill. \nThis title was largely authored by the CFTC. We see this manifested in \nnumerous provisions that give the CFTC broad new authority, sometimes \nto the exclusion of other regulators.\n  The CFTC used this bill as an opportunity to grab jurisdiction from \nthe SEC, which was purposely excluded from the negotiating room during \ncritical meetings.\n  As a result, the derivatives title gives the CFTC regulatory \nauthority over a wide swath of Wall Street and Main Street companies.\n  The CFTC, in addition to its traditional role of overseeing the \ncommodity futures markets, will be charged with protecting retail \ninvestors, assessing systemic risk, imposing capital requirements on \nmanufacturing companies, regulating banks, and assessing the regulatory \ncapability of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  This is the sort of result you get when you hand the legislative pen \nto the regulators.\n  My Democrat colleagues like to talk about the influence of Wall \nStreet lobbyists, but the real influence in this process has been \nexerted by the bureaucracies. I thought that one of the main objectives \nof this legislation was to plug regulatory gaps and streamline our \nfinancial regulatory structure?\n  We still have the Fed, the FDIC, the SEC, the CFTC, and the OCC. We \nhave also added some new letters to the alphabet soup, as with the CFPB \nand the OFR.\n  We have also seen a complete about face with respect to the Federal \nReserve.\n  The process seemed to have begun with a commitment to rein in their \nbailout powers and take away their consumer protection authority, given \nthe Fed's failures. By contrast, this legislation actually expands the \nFed's powers.\n  Americans see developments in Europe, where a monetary union faces a \nsevere test and market participants are running away from the debts of \nprofligate governments. Americans are increasingly worried that the \nout-of-control spending here in the U.S. and the massive expansion of \ngovernment will very soon test American fiscal viability.\n  An appropriate response would be to rein in the costs and breadth of \nrunaway government spending and bureaucratic expansion. The wrong \nresponse would be the financial regulation bill before us.\n  From legislative process to the final bill language, this bill is \nflawed. This bill promises more government, more costs, slower economic \ngrowth, and fewer jobs. It threatens privacy rights and fails to \naddress crucial elements of the recent crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the Republican leader, and I \nand the managers of the bill and a number of others who worked long and \nhard on this consent agreement, I now ask unanimous consent that all \npostcloture time be yielded back; except for 5 minutes for the \nRepublican leader or his designee to raise a budget point of order \nagainst the Dodd-Lincoln substitute amendment No. 3739; Senator Dodd or \nhis designee be recognized to waive the applicable point of order; that \nthe Senate then vote on the motion to waive the budget point of order \nwithout further intervening action or debate; that if the waiver is \nsuccessful, then all pending amendments be withdrawn; the substitute \namendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time; and the Banking Committee then be discharged of H.R. 4173, \nthe House companion; that the Senate then proceed to its consideration; \nthat the text of the Senate bill, as read a third time, be inserted in \nlieu thereof, the bill be advanced to a third reading and the Senate \nthen proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage, the \nSenate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses; further, that on Monday, May \n24, it be in order for Senator Brownback to be recognized for a period \nnot to exceed 10 minutes, and Senator Dodd for the same period; prior \nto Senator Brownback offering a motion to instruct the conferees with \nrespect to H.R. 4173 on the subject of auto dealers; that after the \nmotion is made, the Senate then proceed to vote on the motion to \ninstruct; upon disposition of the motion to instruct, Senator Hutchison \nor her designee be recognized for a period of up to 10 minutes to make \na motion to instruct with respect to proprietary trading, and Senator \nDodd also be recognized for the same period of time; that upon the use \nor yielding back of the time, the Senate then proceed to vote on the \nHutchison motion to instruct; that upon disposition of the above-\nreferenced motions to instruct, no further motions be in order, and \nthat the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate with a ratio of 7-5; that the Senate bill then be returned to \nthe Calendar; provided further that if the waiver is not agreed to, \nthen this agreement be null and void; and the cloture motion on the \nbill be withdrawn; provided further, no amendments or motions be in \norder to the\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\nmotion to instruct; and the title amendment, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am here to raise a budget point of \norder. The substitute and the underlying bill came to the floor \nspending money the Banking Committee did not have in its 302(a) budget \nallocation. It has exceeded the budget allocation. How much direct \nspending is in the Dodd-Lincoln substitute as amended? About $21 \nbillion, partially offset by raising revenues resulting in an increase \nto the deficit by $10.6 billion over the 5-year timeframe--that is the \ntimeframe we are using for budget enforcement--and over the 10-year \nperiod, reflected in the baseline, it would increase the deficit by \n$19.7 billion.\n  So our 10-year deficit outlook--the Obama administration policies \nwill contribute to the debt by running massive deficits for the next 10 \nyears, averaging nearly $1 trillion a year from 2011 through 2020. The \nprojected deficit of 8.9 percent of GDP for 2011 will come at a time \nwhen the administration is predicting a return to prerecession economic \ngrowth. The total public debt stands at over $13 trillion, with fiscal \nyear 2009's $1.4 trillion deficit having contributed significantly to \nour Nation's credit card bill. With unsustainable levels like this, the \nSenate must knowingly, consciously, and with full awareness decide each \ntime a bill comes to the floor to increase our debt burden further.\n  I object and therefore raise a budget point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration \nof legislation that exceeds an authorizing committee's 302(a) \nallocation. The substitute, as amended, provides for net increases in \ndirect spending of $21 billion and, if adopted, would cause the \nunderlying bill to exceed the allocation to the Banking Committee over \nthe 2010-2014 period.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I want to be heard on the \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, the Budget Committee, like all authorizing \ncommittees, has the option, at the outset, when the budget resolution \nis considered, to set aside a reserve fund in anticipation of some \npiece of legislation coming along that may cost more. We did not do \nthat. We did not know what that would be. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  If we had spent $1, since we had zero in terms of a budget allocation \nfor our committee, $1 over it would have provoked a potential budget \npoint of order. So the fact that the committee has spent money in this \nbill on a major restructuring of our financial structures of the Nation \nshould not come as any great surprise. But, secondly, it is somewhat \nironic the only reason we find ourselves at the point of $19.7 billion \nover is because--at the request, I might point out, of my good friends \non the minority side--we eliminated the upfront prepayment cost of the \n$50 billion we had in the bill.\n  Many believed the optics of that just did not look good so we took \nthat money out, as you recall, in the Shelby-Dodd amendment, one of the \nfirst amendments we considered.\n  Had that money stayed in, of course we would not be talking about any \ndeficit at all in this bill. The fact is, of course, that post payments \ncoming out of creditors, coming out of the industry itself, and the \nfact the bankrupt company does not have the assets, then it will be \npaid for.\n  I say to my colleagues respectfully here, it is a very technical \namendment dealing primarily with 302. It has to do with the allocations \ngiven to committees. Had we been $1 over, we would have been subjected \nto this point of order. But we have not. But on that basis, \ntheoretically we ought to be waiving.\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I \nmove to waive the applicable sections of that act for purposes of the \npending amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order must first be raised.\n  Mr. DODD. Was a point of order made?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act, which prohibits the consideration of \nlegislation that exceeds an authorizing committee's 302(a) allocation. \nThe substitute, as amended, provides for net increases in direct \nspending of $21 billion, and if adopted it would cause the underlying \nbill to exceed the allocation of the Banking Committee over the 2010-\n2014 period.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 108th \nanniversary of Cuba's independence. On May 20, 1902, after a long and \nbitter struggle, the people of Cuba established a democratic Republic. \nToday, the Cuban people are again fighting for democratic change and \nindependence in their homeland.\n  On this day, we honor Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who died this year after \na prolonged hunger strike while protesting his inhumane treatment at \nthe hands of the Cuban prison authorities. We stand in solidarity with \nthe Ladies in White, including Zapata Tamayo's mother Reina Luisa \nTamayo, who through their quiet dignity, continue to call the world's \nattention to the arrests of their fathers, husbands, and brothers for \nexercising free speech and daring to challenge the regime. We also \nrecognize the contributions of Cuba's journalists, bloggers, and \nactivists, who undertake great personal risk to tell the world about \nthe realities of life in Cuba.\n  The legacy of Cuban independence endures with these heroes past and \npresent, who fight against the forces of repression and totalitarianism \nfor the promise of a free and democratic society. Now more than ever, \nthe U.S. and the international community must press the Cuban regime to \nfree all political prisoners. On behalf of the people of Florida and \nall Americans, we stand in solidarity with the Cuban people in their \nstruggle in the hope that one day freedom of expression and basic \nliberty are possible in Cuba without the fear of persecution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/20/senate-section/article/S4078-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4078-S4080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                U.S.-JAPAN COOPERATION ON NUCLEAR POWER\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mike \nMansfield once said, ``the U.S.-Japan relationship is the most \nimportant bilateral relationship in the world, bar none.''\n  About a month ago, China Daily ran an article in which they compared \nthe United States' nuclear program to Rip Van Winkle, the legendary \nAmerican folk hero who fell asleep for 20 years after a night of \ncarousing with Henry Hudson's men in the Catskill Mountains. ``A \nthunder from China has woken up Uncle Sam, like Rip Van Winkle, from a \n20-year nap, to a different world,'' boasted the China Daily article. \n``This world is in the midst of a Green Revolution. It is the biggest \nsea change since the Industrial Revolution, and Uncle Sam has slept too \nlong to take the lead in this new movement.''\n  I am not sure that this is really the case, but the point in well \ntaken. Out of fear and mistrust, and after a few bad accidents, the \nU.S. 30 years ago decided to put aside construction of new nuclear \npowerplants. Our domestic nuclear industry still kept plodding along, \nlearning to operate the plants we had more efficiently and trying to \nsell new plants abroad. But overall we atrophied. Our nuclear \nconstruction capabilities withered while other countries' capabilities \nflourished. And so here we are, 30 years later, with a much smaller \nnuclear industry that is missing critical parts, like the ability to \nmanufacture the largest components.\n  Meanwhile the rest of the world kept moving forward. And recently, we \nhave started seeing something new--the entrance into the nuclear market \nby countries that are considered low-cost manufacturers, like China and \nSouth Korea.\n  When China recently bought Westinghouse AP1000 reactors from Toshiba, \nthey insisted on getting all the engineering specifications as well. It \nis no secret what they are planning. They are going to reverse-engineer \nthe reactor and come up with their own design. In another 5 years, \ndon't be surprised to see the Chinese marketing their own reactors \naround the world. Also look what Korea has accomplished. Before 1996 \nthey only built imported reactors in Korea, from companies like \nWestinghouse and Areva. Then they took an old design from Combustion \nEngineering, an American company, and came up with the APR1400. Last \nyear the Koreans shocked the world by beating out Areva and \nWestinghouse for a $20 billion contract to build four new reactors in \nthe United Arab Emirates. What is going to happen when China enters \nthis market? I suspect in 20 years the Chinese will be selling nuclear \nreactors in Wal-Mart.\n  Now there are two ways of looking at this. One is to say this is a \nworld of cutthroat competition and that if\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nChina wins then Japan and the United States and everyone else must lose \nas well. That is one interpretation. But the other way to look at it is \nto say we are all improving each other's game and that all this \ncompetition helps turn us all into better players.\n  And that is where international competition helps. If other countries \nstart making progress in a technology, we soon realize we had better \nemulate them. We saw this with the auto industry. There was a time when \nAmerica's big three--Ford, Chrysler and General Motors seemed \ninvincible in a way nothing could ever change. Each year they competed \nto see who could put the biggest tailfins on their new models and \nnobody ever gave a thought to quality control or gas mileage or whether \nthe car would fall apart after 50,000 miles.\n  Then these strange new companies named Toyota and Datsun and Honda \nstarted to enter the market. Their cars weren't all that stylish but \nthey were small and efficient, got good gas mileage, and ran like tops. \nYou didn't have to ``fix or repair daily,'' as they used to say about \nFord products. And some people bought them. But they still didn't rival \nthe big American manufacturers. Then the oil crisis arrived and all of \na sudden those cars that could get 30 miles to the gallon started to \nlook awfully good.\n  Well, you know the rest of the story. Toyota recently passed General \nMotors as the largest car company in the world. GM is in Federal \nreceivership. Half the cars sold in America are made by foreign \ncompanies. But of course the traffic flows the other way as well. \nNissan will be building its new all-electric Leaf in my home state of \nTennessee and we are very happy to have them as a good corporate \nneighbor.\n  There is a certain irony to all this as well. A lot of the concern \nfor maintaining quality that made Toyota and Honda and Nissan such \ngreat companies came from a man named W. Edwards Deming, a college \nprofessor who developed a lot of ideas in the 1950s about maintaining \nquality in manufactured products. Deming never attracted much attention \nin this country but he found a receptive audience in Japan. This led to \nthe tremendous emphasis on quality that made Toyota and other car \ncompanies such a huge success. It wasn't until NBC ran a documentary in \n1980 entitled ``If Japan Can, Why Can't We?'' that Americans became \naware of what Deming had done for Japanese manufacturing. One of the \nfirst American companies to turn to him for advice was Ford Motors. \nThat is one of the reasons why Ford has now gone from the old ``Fix or \nRepair Daily'' to become what is arguably America's strongest auto \ncompetitor.\n  So we have taught each other a lot about auto manufacturing. Now what \ncan we learn from each other about nuclear power?\n  Well, the first thing to note, I think, is that while China gets 2 \npercent of its electricity from nuclear and America gets 20 percent, \nJapan gets 30 percent. In terms of shifting to nuclear, Japan is ahead \nof us. At the same time, the U.S. still leads all countries with 104 \noperating commercial reactors, one-fourth the world's total. That great \nbuilding spree from 1970 to 1990, when we constructed about 100 \nreactors in 20 years, still stands us in good stead. But it isn't going \nto last forever. There are now 55 reactors under construction around \nthe world in 13 different countries, including one in Japan with four \nmore likely to start. Meanwhile, American reactors are aging fast and \nwe are just getting ready to break ground on our first new reactor in \n30 years. By the way, I should mention that South Korea leads both our \ncountries with 35 percent of its electricity from nuclear.\n  One place where Americans can feel proud is the way we run our \nreactors. The entire industry now operates at 90 percent capacity. That \nmeans reactors are up and running more than 90 percent of the time. \nMany of them now go for almost 2 years without shutting down. And when \nthey do shut down it is for refueling, which used to take 3 months and \nis now done in only 5 weeks. We have learned a lot about efficiency and \nquality control and getting things done on time. Japan runs its fleet \nat 75 percent capacity and France is just behind us at 85 percent. But \nthat is a special case. The French are now the world's biggest net \nexporters of electricity and still have so much nuclear capacity that \nthey often close down their reactors for the weekend. You know how much \nthe French like their weekends. Once again, though, I have to note the \nKoreans are running their reactors at 95 percent, so we all have \nsomething to learn there. We have figured out how to run reactors \nefficiently and ultimately that means cheaper.\n  We also run our reactors safely. Since the Three Mile Island Incident \nwe have improved our safety record and reduced risk at our nuclear \nreactors. The American nuclear industry is proud to say that there has \nnever been a death from a nuclear incident at an American reactor. We \nhave learned that safe does not have to equal expensive.\n  What about new technologies? Our Secretary of Energy, Stephen Chu, \nhas recommended that the United States find a niche in mini-reactors, \nthe so-called ``nuclear batteries.'' He's willing to concede that the \nJapanese and the French and the Koreans and possibly the Chinese will \neffectively compete against us for sales of large traditional reactors. \nBut maybe we can specialize in these 25-to-300-megawatt reactors that \ncan be assembled at the factory and shipped to the site where they are \nput together like Lego blocks.\n  I think mini-reactors are a great idea. You could power a whole town \nof 20,000 people with something that could be buried 60 feet \nunderground and refueled every 30 years. But I wonder how quickly we \nare going to be able to move into this market? It's taking us 5 years \nto get a design approval through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The \nNRC has told one manufacturer they do not even have time to consider \nsmall reactors because they are so involved in looking at big ones. If \nthere is real money to be made in the field of mini-reactors, won't \nother countries jump in well before we do? Toshiba already has a model \nthey are offering to isolated Alaskan villages. The Russians have one \nthey are barging into Siberian villages. We had better get going or we \nwill be left behind there as well.\n  One area in which nearly everyone seems to be progressing is fuel \nreprocessing. The United States gave up reprocessing in this country in \nthe 1970s. In retrospect, I think that it was a mistake. We thought we \nwere saving the world from nuclear proliferation. It was a noble \nexperiment, but it wasn't very practical. We thought if we didn't \nisolate plutonium in this country nobody else would be able to figure \nout how to manufacture it and rogue nations wouldn't be able to acquire \nnuclear weapons. Well, North Korea has developed a nuclear weapon and \nthey didn't do it by stealing American or someone else's--plutonium. \nThey simply built their own reactor and manufactured weapons \nthemselves. Iran is doing the same thing with enriched uranium. Nuclear \ntechnology is no secret anymore. Controlling nuclear proliferation is \ngoing to be a diplomatic task, not a technological one.\n  While America has hung back from reprocessing, however, Japan and \nother countries have forged ahead. The Japanese have been burning \nexcess plutonium in mixed oxide MOX fuel at several reactors. Now they \nhave built the world's first reactor designed specifically to burn MOX \nfuel, at Hokkaido. The French do the reprocessing and the first \nboatload of MOX fuel just made it back to Japan from France without \nbeing hijacked by rowboats from Greenpeace. This is all plutonium that \nwill never find its way into nuclear weapons.\n  In the U.S., we have been turning swords into ploughshares. In an \nagreement struck in 1996 by Senators Sam Nunn, Pete Domenici and \nRichard Lugar, the United States has been purchasing enriched uranium \nfrom Soviet weapons stocks and blending it down for use in American \nnuclear reactors. Half our reactor fuel now comes from the program, \nmeaning 1 out of every 10 lightbulbs in America is lit by a former \nSoviet weapon.\n  Another place where America remains on the cutting edge is in basic \nresearch. We have designed generation III reactors, which are much more \nsimplified and oriented toward safety. Now we are looking for a fourth \ngeneration of reactors that will make reprocessing much easier. One of \nthe ideas on the drawing board is the ``Traveling Wave'' reactor, which \nwill consume its own waste and burn for up to twenty years\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\nwithout refueling. America's favorite innovator, Bill Gates, has \ninvested in a company that is exploring the Traveling Wave. If Bill \nGates is embracing nuclear, I think it's safe to say America will soon \nbe back in the game.\n  But we need to continue our commitment to basic science research. We \nmust rebuild our industrial capacity and continue producing a skilled \nworkforce for the future. We need to start building new reactors in \nAmerica and we need to bring the next generation of reactors to market \nto recognize the benefits of full-recycling. It all starts with \nlearning from our experience and the experience of other nations like \nJapan.\n  So these two nations as well as others--are prepared to move forward \ntogether in the great nuclear renaissance that is sweeping the world. \nJapan is on the cutting edge of reactor construction and reprocessing \ntechnology and I hope we will soon be able to join them by expanding \nour own nuclear fleet and adding our research capabilities. We have \ncome a long, long way in 70 years since the closing day of World War II \nwhen scientists unlocked the energy buried at the heart of the atom. \nNuclear power has since been used for threats, it has been used for \ndestruction, and it has been used to frighten humanity into confronting \nthe idea that we might be capable of destroying ourselves and the \nplanet along with us. But I think right now we can safely say that \nthese two nations are poised on the edge of an era of cooperation when \nwe will turn the benefits of nuclear power to the greater good of all \nmankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/20/senate-section/article/S4080-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NIEL ELLERBROOK\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nLugar, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the service of \nNiel Ellerbrook, who is retiring as chief executive officer of \nEvansville-based Vectren Corporation after more than 30 years of \nservice with the company and its predecessor. Mr. Ellerbrook's \naccomplishments as a business leader in Indiana are well documented and \ntoo numerous to mention. Suffice it to say, Niel has been a strong and \npositive force for change in the State for many years. He successfully \nengineered the merger between two utility companies and built the \nresulting company Vectren Corporation into one of Indiana's largest \npublically traded corporations with more than 3,700 employees and \noperations encompassing half of the United States. Under Niel's \nleadership, Vectren has embarked on an impressive campaign to provide \nconsumers cleaner energy and cost-saving energy conservation programs \nall of which have become models for others in the industry to follow.\n  Niel's business acumen tells only a part of the story, however. The \nson of a minister and elementary schoolteacher, Niel was born into a \nhousehold that put a premium on sacrifice and doing for others. Niel's \ngenerous commitment of time and resources to civic endeavors in \nEvansville has benefited untold numbers of Hoosiers. Niel is an active \nsupporter of the United Way and devotes significant energies toward \neducation serving as chairman of the board of trustees at the \nUniversity of Evansville, on the board of Signature Learning Center in \nEvansville, and as cochair, with his wife Karen, of the fundraising \ncampaign that led to the opening of the Koch Children's Museum of \nEvansville in 2006.\n  Born in Rensselaer, growing up in Franklin and graduating from Ball \nState University, Niel is a born-and-bred Hoosier success story. \nFortunately for us Hoosiers, he decided to remain in the State and \nplace his significant mark on the history of Indiana business and civic \nleadership.\n  Speaking for my colleague Senator Lugar, I can say how fortunate we \nare to call Niel a friend.\n  It is with great appreciation that Senator Lugar and I congratulate \nNiel Ellerbrook on his remarkable career, and wish him and his wife \nKaren the very best in their future endeavors together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/20/senate-section/article/S4080-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BALTIMORE HERITAGE, INC.\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay special tribute \nto Baltimore Heritage, Inc. as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. \nBaltimore Heritage, Inc.--BHI--is beginning its fifth decade of service \nto Baltimore City. BHI was founded in 1960 by leaders of the Baltimore \nbusiness and cultural community, including members of the Greater \nBaltimore Committee, the Maryland Historical Society, the Peale Museum, \nand the Junior Chamber of Commerce. For decades, the organization has \neffectively advocated for actions and broader policies that protect the \ncity's irreplaceable historic buildings and neighborhoods.\n  BHI works in three primary areas: education, planning and advocacy, \nand technical assistance. Its education programs seek to involve people \nand promote the city's heritage. To further that effort, it conducts \nmonthly guided tours of historic sites, spring walking tours, a fall \nhistory lecture, and a reception to recognize the best historic \npreservation projects.\n  Through its planning and advocacy work, BHI has helped preserve city \nlandmarks and develop strategies to use Baltimore's historic buildings \nand neighborhoods as the basis for economic growth. Some successes \ninclude: reversing plans to demolish the historic buildings surrounding \nMt. Vernon Place; saving the City Hall dome; and establishing the \nBaltimore City Commission for Historical and Architectural \nPreservation, CHAP, which has gone on to help designate more than 60 \nlocal and national neighborhood historic districts and achieve \nprotected landmark status for more than 100 historic structures, parks, \nand monuments. BHI was a partner in blocking the extension of I-83 \nthrough Fells Point and Canton and in preserving and reusing Camden \nStation and Camden Warehouse as integrated parts of the new downtown \nballpark.\n  Baltimore Heritage leaders also were partners with Preservation \nMaryland in crafting and advocating for an alternative proposal for \nrevitalizing the West Side of Baltimore's downtown--an alternative that \nproved the feasibility and great economic potential of integrating, \nrather than demolishing, the district's historic structures. This \nalternative plan now serves as the guideline for the city's official \nredevelopment plan for this important downtown district.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Baltimore Heritage for \nits dedication to showcasing our rich historic and cultural heritage. \nBaltimore is one of our Nation's most historic cities, and Baltimore \nHeritage, Inc. understands the importance of preserving the past while \nbuilding for the future. To paraphrase Sir Christopher Wren's epitaph, \n``If you seek Baltimore Heritage's monument, look around you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/20/senate-section/article/S4080-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4080-S4081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING ALCOM, INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, next week marks National Small \nBusiness Week, a time when we honor our Nation's entrepreneurs and the \ntremendous accomplishments they have made. As small business owners and \nadvocates from across America gather in Washington, DC, for several \ndays of events, among that group will be two Mainers who have earned \nthe U.S. Small Business Administration's prestigious 2010 Maine Small \nBusiness Persons of the Year award. Today I wish to recognize Trapper \nClark and Tom Sturtevant, the president and corporate vice president, \nrespectively, of Alcom, Inc., a major manufacturer of aluminum trailers \nlocated in the town of Winslow.\n  Alcom got its start in 2006 when Trapper Clark opened the firm in \n8,000 square feet of space at the historic Wyandotte Mill in \nWaterville. Trapper, a graduate of the University of Maine, had \npreviously worked for aluminum sport and utility manufacturer SnoPro, \ngiving him a deep familiarity with the industry and how it operates. \nWhen he decided to open his own small business, he approached Tom, his \nstepfather who had been retired for a decade, to help get his company \noff the ground. Mr. Sturtevant is an entrepreneur in his own right, \nhaving founded Gazelle Products--the third-largest fiberglass-canoe \nmanufacturer in the country when he sold it in 1990--and Benton \nPlastics--the third-largest manufacturer of plastic bed liners in the \nworld when he sold the firm in 1994. Clearly,\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\nboth Trapper and Tom had the knowledge, background, and expertise to \nlaunch Alcom in early 2006.\n  When the company opened its doors, it employed just a handful of \npeople but sold 105 of its trailers to dealers on its first day of \noperation. Business continued to stay strong, and within a year, Alcom \nwas using all 46,000 available square feet at the mill. Facing a \ndilemma that could have easily forced their company out of State, \nTrapper and Tom instead chose to utilize a $1.1 million SBA loan \nguarantee to move into an expanded, 70,000 square foot facility in the \nWinslow Industrial Park. In part because of the expansion, Alcom now \nemploys 80 and is slated to complete $18 million in sales in 2010. The \ncompany sells its trailers to 200 dealers throughout the United States \nand Canada. Additionally, the company's 5-year plan anticipates the \ncompany having 196 employees and $44 million in sales in 2013, an \nincredible measurement of the company's success and growth.\n  The ability of Alcom to grow and thrive during such difficult \neconomic times is a testament to the dedication and commitment of \nTrapper Clark and Tom Sturtevant, who vividly represent America's \nentrepreneurial spirit. Indeed, Alcom is truly one of our Nation's \nshining small business success stories, and has quickly become a \nnationwide leader in the design and manufacturing of recreational \naluminum trailers. I am proud that Maine is home to such a vibrant and \nresilient firm, and I am optimistic for the company's future prospects. \nOnce again, I congratulate Trapper and Tom for being exceptional models \nfor Maine and the Nation, and I wish them and everyone at Alcom all the \nbest for many more successful years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/20/senate-section/article/S4081-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DEREK JOHNSON\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Derek \nJohnson, son of Wayne and Nancy Johnson, of Aberdeen, SD. Derek will \ngraduate from Aberdeen Central High School on May 23, 2010.\n  Derek has a very unique and touching story. He has overcome much \nadversity to become the positive role model and impressive young leader \nhe is today. While playing for the Aberdeen Central Golden Eagles' high \nschool football team in the fall of 2007, Derek suffered a serious \ninjury that would change life as he knew it. After much contemplation \nand several extensive surgeries, Derek's lower left leg was amputated. \nThroughout his struggles, and the long painful recovery process, Derek \nmaintained a positive attitude and steadfast work ethic that served as \nan inspiration to his teammates, classmates, the community, and entire \nState of South Dakota.\n  In March 2009, Derek's invincible attitude and courageous spirit were \nhighlighted when he was selected as one of seven nationwide regional \nwinners of the National High School Spirit of Sport Award. This award, \nselected by the National Federation of State High School Associations, \nis presented to high school athletes, coaches, administrators, managers \nand trainers that best exemplify the ideals of the positive spirit of \nsport.\n  Perhaps nothing embodied Derek's spirit more than when he returned to \nthe athletic field this past school year. He returned to the football \nteam to provide encouragement for his teammates. Through his hard work \nand determination, he was also able to compete as part of the Aberdeen \nCentral Golden Eagles' varsity wrestling team. As a reflection of his \nathletic talent and perseverance, Derek earned eighth place in the \nSouth Dakota Class A Wrestling Championships.\n  Throughout his high school career, Derek has served as a shining \nexample and genuine role model. I want to thank Derek for being such a \npositive influence on all of the lives he has touched and wish him the \nbest of luck in his future endeavors. On behalf of the Aberdeen \ncommunity, the entire State of South Dakota, and all of us here serving \nin the U.S. Congress, I am pleased to extend my sincere congratulations \nto Aberdeen Central's Derek Johnson. This young South Dakotan will \ncontinue to be a true hero and inspiration. He has made us all very \nproud.

By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Ms. Miklulski, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Casey, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nBrown of Ohio, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Begich, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Akaka, and Ms. \nKlobuchar):\n  S. 3390. A bill to end the discrimination based on actual or \nperceived sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, all men are created equal. Our Nation's \ngreatest leaders, like Thomas Jefferson, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin \nLuther King, Jr. have shaped the course of our history by furthering \nour understanding of this principle. It is because of their struggle to \nilluminate it that we now live under a system of laws that provides \nequal protection to Americans, regardless of their race, gender, or \nreligion. It is because of their chutzpah that I, a Jew, can stand \nbefore you today as a United States Senator.\n  But there is one group for whom our realization of that principle has \nnot advanced quickly enough. Gay Americans continue to be treated as \nsecond-class citizens in our society and under our laws. Nowhere is the \nunequal treatment of gay Americans more destructive than in our \nnation's public schools.\n  Currently, Federal law provides no explicit protection to gay \nstudents against discrimination and harassment. While Federal civil \nrights statutes prohibit discrimination and harassment against students \nbased on race, sex, religion, and national origin, these laws do not \nexplicitly address sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  To remedy this injustice, I and 22 of my Senate colleagues are \nintroducing the Student Non-Discrimination Act today. This legislation \nwill prohibit schools from discriminating against or ignoring the \nharassment of students based on their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. The bill would also provide meaningful remedies for such \ndiscrimination, modeled on Title IX.\n  These protections are sorely needed. Let me tell you a sad fact--\nnearly nine out of ten LGBT students are harassed in school. This \nharassment deprives them of an equal education. Rochelle, a gay high \nschool student from California who was harassed in school, explains why \nwith a simple question. She asks, ``How was I supposed to learn when I \nwas constantly scared?'' For students like Rochelle, school is not a \nplace to learn. Rather it is a place to be bullied, beaten down, and \nhumiliated. It is no wonder that gay students who are harassed in \nschool are more likely to skip school, underachieve, and eventually \ndrop out.\n  In its worst form, the harassment of LGBT students can lead to life-\nthreatening violence and suicide. We have\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\nseen this in all too many high-profile cases in recent years, such as \nthat of Carl Walker Hoover, an 11-year-old boy from Massachusetts who \nhung himself last April. Before he committed suicide, Carl was taunted \nby his classmates on a daily basis for allegedly being gay despite his \nmother's weekly pleas to his school to address the problem. Carl's \ndeath came only about a year after Lawrence King, an eighth grader in \nCalifornia, was shot and killed by a classmate for allegedly being gay.\n  To be clear, it is not simply students who are to blame for the \nharassment of their gay classmates. Students who harass their gay peers \nhave often internalized the anti-gay bias of the adults around them. \nSometimes their bullying is even condoned by adults at school--through \nthe silence of school staff who witness the bullying or through their \nencouragement of the behavior.\n  This was certainly the case for Alex, a 16-year-old boy from Anoka, \nMN, whose teachers mocked him in front of his classmates for allegedly \nbeing gay. When Alex mentioned Benjamin Franklin in a paper, his social \nstudies teacher taunted him for ``having a thing for older men.'' A \nsecond teacher who taught a course on law enforcement volunteered Alex \nfor a student fashion show, joking that Alex ``loves to dress in \nwomen's clothes.'' Alex's peers soon caught on to the joke, and began \ntaunting him too. The harassment grew so severe that Alex eventually \nswitched schools.\n  Because Alex lives in Minnesota--one of 14 States that prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation in school--Alex and his \nfamily were able to hold his school district accountable. They filed a \ncomplaint with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. After the \nDepartment found that Alex had been subjected to ``severe and \npervasive'' harassment, the school district settled the case. The \ndistrict provided Alex and his family financial compensation, and \nadopted new rules to prevent the harassment of LGBT students.\n  Minnesota's law is effective not only because it holds school \ndistricts accountable for discrimination, but also because it provides \na powerful incentive for districts to adopt policies to prevent \ndiscrimination from occurring in the first place.\n  It is time that we extend the equal rights afforded to Minnesota \nstudents to students all across the country. No student should be \nsubjected to the ridicule and physical violence that LGBT students so \noften experience in school. I urge my colleagues to join me today in \nsupporting the Student Non-Discrimination Act. It is time we demanded \nequal treatment for all of our children under the law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3390\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Student Nondiscrimination \n     Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Public school students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, \n     or transgender (referred to in this Act as ``LGBT''), or are \n     perceived to be LGBT, or who associate with LGBT people, have \n     been and are subjected to pervasive discrimination, including \n     harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, and have \n     been deprived of equal educational opportunities, in schools \n     in every part of the Nation.\n       (2) While discrimination, including harassment, bullying, \n     intimidation, and violence, of any kind is harmful to \n     students and to the education system, actions that target \n     students based on sexual orientation or gender identity \n     represent a distinct and especially severe problem.\n       (3) Numerous social science studies demonstrate that \n     discrimination, including harassment, bullying, intimidation, \n     and violence, at school has contributed to high rates of \n     absenteeism, dropping out, adverse health consequences, and \n     academic underachievement, among LGBT youth.\n       (4) When left unchecked, discrimination, including \n     harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, in schools \n     based on sexual orientation or gender identity can lead, and \n     has led, to life-threatening violence and to suicide.\n       (5) Public school students enjoy a variety of \n     constitutional rights, including rights to equal protection, \n     privacy, and free expression, which are infringed when school \n     officials engage in or are indifferent to discrimination, \n     including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, \n     on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n       (6) While Federal statutory provisions expressly address \n     discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, \n     disability, and national origin, Federal civil rights \n     statutes do not expressly address   discrimination on the \n     basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. As a result, \n     students and parents have often had limited recourse to law \n     for remedies for discrimination on the basis of sexual \n     orientation or gender identity.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that all students have access to public \n     education in a safe environment free from discrimination, \n     including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, \n     on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (2) to provide a comprehensive Federal prohibition of \n     discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (3) to provide meaningful and effective remedies for \n     discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity; and\n       (4) to invoke congressional powers, including the power to \n     enforce the 14th amendment to the Constitution and to provide \n     for the general welfare pursuant to section 8 of article I of \n     the Constitution and the power to make all laws necessary and \n     proper for the execution of the foregoing powers pursuant to \n     section 8 of article I of the Constitution, in order to \n     prohibit discrimination in public schools on the basis of \n     sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Franken in \nsponsoring the Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2010, SNDA, an \nimportant step in our march toward a more inclusive Nation. This bill \ncontinues the civil rights work we began earlier this Congress when I \noffered the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct as an amendment to the defense authorization bill last year. The \nStudent Non-Discrimination Act will ensure that under Federal law, all \npublic school children are protected equally from discrimination. \nChildren deserve a safe environment where they can learn the skills and \nknowledge necessary to be good citizens.\n  More than 55 years ago, in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, the Supreme Court reaffirmed our Nation's commitment to \njustice and equal rights for all Americans by ending racial segregation \nin our public schools. A unanimous Court recognized that ``it is \ndoubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life \nif he [or she] is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an \nopportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right \nwhich must be made available to all on equal terms.''\n  Congress continued on the path of progress by passing laws like the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, the Education Amendments of 1972, and the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973. These laws protected students in federally-\nfunded public schools from discrimination and harassment based on race, \nnational origin, sex, and disability. President John F. Kennedy said in \n1963, ``Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all \ntaxpayers . . . contribute, not be spent in any fashion which \nencourages, entrenches, subsidizes or results in . . . \ndiscrimination.''\n  Tragically, for far too long, U.S. taxpayer dollars have gone to \npublic school systems that tolerate or perpetuate discrimination, \nharassment, and even violence based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity. To paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., ``now is the time \nto make justice a reality'' for all of our children--now is the time \nfor Congress to extend existing Federal protections against \ndiscrimination to all public school students.\n  The legislation we introduce today does just that by prohibiting \ndiscrimination and harassment based on actual or perceived sexual \norientation and gender identity in public, non-religious, federally-\nfunded schools.\n  Vermont has recognized the importance of creating a safe school \nenvironment for our children. In 1993, the State legislature enacted a \nlaw to protect school children from harassment based on sexual \norientation, and in 2007, the law was strengthened to protect against \nharassment based on gender identity. Nine other States and the District \nof Columbia protect school children from discrimination based on\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\ngender identity and sexual orientation. This legislation makes clear \nthat it would not preempt state laws such as those in Vermont, which \nprovide additional protections and remedies.\n  The Student Non-Discrimination Act also preserves our First Amendment \nfreedoms of expression and religion. The bill is narrowly tailored to \ncomply with the Supreme Court's First Amendment precedents. It includes \nprovisions that explicitly exempt parochial schools, and to make clear \nthat religious groups in public schools continue to be protected by the \nFirst Amendment and the Equal Access Act.\n  I urge all Senators to come together to support this important bill \nto ensure that all of our students are given the opportunity to \nsucceed, free from harassment or discrimination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3394. A bill to establish the veterans' business center program, \nto improve the programs for veterans of the Small Business \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as Chair of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to introduce the \nStrengthening Entrepreneurship for America's Veterans Act of 2010. This \nvital and timely legislation builds upon the Small Business \nAdministration's, SBA, existing counseling programs that successfully \nassist hundreds of thousands of veterans, service-disabled veterans and \nreservists annually, creating thousands of jobs. By strengthening and \nimproving these programs, the SBA will be able to reach even more \nveterans, helping them to achieve their dream of starting or growing \ntheir own small businesses.\n  According to the Department of Veteran Affairs, there are currently \nmore than 23.8 million veterans in the United States. Since 2001 alone, \nmore than 2 million of these servicemembers have been deployed in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. This \nmeans that every day, hundreds of new veterans are returning home from \nservice in Iraq and Afghanistan. Seeking to move on with their lives \nafter long deployments, many veterans become entrepreneurs to support \nboth themselves and their families.\n  However, in the face of historically high unemployment and tight \ncredit, starting a business has never been more difficult. During the \n111th Congress, the Committee has heard from many small business owners \nthroughout the country. They have told me that the programs and \nservices currently offered by SBA provide access to important resources \nthat enable them to start, grow and expand their businesses. But in the \nface of the worst economic recession since the Great Depression, demand \nfor these services is at an all time high. For these reasons, it is \ncritical that we do more to help our entrepreneurs and small \nbusinesses, especially the hundreds of veterans returning home each day \nwho are significantly more likely to struggle to find work.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Strengthening Entrepreneurship \nfor America's Veterans Act of 2010. Since the passage of legislation \nestablishing the Office of Veterans Business Development, OVBD, in \n1999, the SBA has operated a network of centers and programs that \nprovide technical assistance and support to veterans interested in \nstarting or growing their own small businesses. This legislation will \nfurther enhance and improve these existing programs by providing more \nincreased access to business counseling and technical assistance \nthrough a new network of Veterans Business Centers, modeled after the \nsuccessful Small Business Development Centers, SBDC, and Women's \nBusiness Centers, WBC, programs. The Veterans Business Center Program \nwill not only provide services to returning veterans and service-\ndisabled veterans, but also to the families, spouses and surviving \nspouses of these heroic men and women.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Snowe for her continued \nleadership on small business issues and especially for her \ncosponsorship of this important legislation. Senator Snowe has been a \ntireless advocate for the many veterans and reservists in her home \nstate of Maine and I am pleased to have her support on this \nlegislation.\n  I would also note that many of the provisions in this bill were \nincluded in S. 1229, the Entrepreneurial Development Act of 2009, which \nI introduced earlier this Congress with Senator Snowe's support. S. \n1229 passed out of Committee with unanimous and bipartisan support in \nJune of 2009. However, given the importance of this legislation to our \nmore than 23 million veterans, I have decided to reintroduce these \nprovisions as a standalone bill. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to bring this legislation to the President's \ndesk in the coming months.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Mary \nLandrieu, Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, to introduce the Strengthening Entrepreneurship for \nAmerica's Veterans Act. This critical legislation, which is a slightly \nmodified version of language we included in S. 1229, the \nEntrepreneurial Development Act of 2009, will establish a nationwide \nVeterans' Business Center program, housed at the Small Business \nAdministration, or SBA, to tailor counseling and outreach programs for \naspiring veteran entrepreneurs. This program will build on the \nextraordinary work of the SBA's Office of Veterans Business \nDevelopment, headed by Bill Elmore, which currently oversees eight such \ncenters and last year counseled or trained over 120,000 veterans.\n  According to the Department of Veteran Affairs, almost 2 million \nbrave American men and women have deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq \nsince the beginning of combat operations in September 2001, nearly 1.2 \nmillion of whom are now veterans. Regrettably, the unemployment rate \namong these veterans stands at 13.1 percent over three percentage \npoints higher than the national average. It is critical that when our \nNation's service-members return from duty, they receive the assistance \nthey deserve to seamlessly assimilate back to civilian life.\n  Many of these veterans are aspiring entrepreneurs seeking to open \ntheir own business and live the American dream. To assist them in their \nefforts, our legislation establishes a Veterans' Business Center \nprogram to create a nationwide network of entrepreneurial assistance \ncenters for veterans and reservists, along with their spouses and \nsurviving spouses. Each center would receive an annual grant between \n$150,000 and $200,000 for a 5-year period, followed by the opportunity \nfor additional 5-year renewal periods. These centers would provide \nspecific education, training, advice, and counseling tailored to \neligible individuals regarding financing planning and access to \ncapital; management and business operations; marketing and advertising; \nprocurement and contracting opportunities; and other general small \nbusiness opportunities for reservists and their spouses.\n  Furthermore, each district office under the auspices of the SBA would \nbe required to designate one employee to serve as a ``veterans business \nownership representative'' responsible for increasing coordination \nbetween that region's Veterans' Business Center and SBA district \noffice, to leverage resources and perform outreach to a greater number \nof veterans.\n  Additionally, our legislation will ensure proper oversight of the \nrecently formed Interagency Task Force on Veterans Small Business \nDevelopment by requiring the SBA to issue biennial reports to Congress \nregarding the establishment and progress of this body. This task force \nwas included in the Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business \nReauthorization and Opportunity Act which Senator John Kerry and I \nfought for last Congress and which was signed into law by former \nPresident George W. Bush on February 14, 2008. After more than 2 years \nof delay, the task force was finally established by Executive Order on \nApril 26 of this year.\n  The purpose of the task force is to coordinate the efforts of Federal \nagencies necessary to increase capital and business development \nopportunities for, and increase the award of Federal contracting \nopportunities to, small businesses owned and controlled by veterans. \nGiven that we are fast approaching the ninth anniversary of the \ncommencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, this type of coordinated \nand targeted effort by our Federal government is long overdue.\n  Finally, our bill includes several additional reporting requirements \nto ensure that the Veterans' Business Center program is being \nadministered effectively and providing truly unique and proper \nresources, counseling, assistance, and training to veterans. Because \ncredit to small businesses remains stifled, one of these reports will \nexplore the sources of credit utilized by veteran-owned small \nbusinesses, obstacles faced by veterans trying to access credit, and \nthe extent to which deployment and other military responsibilities \naffect the credit history of veterans and reservists. This crucial \nreport will provide a detailed picture of the access to credit \nlandscape confronting veteran entrepreneurs, and will afford us an \nopportunity to make necessary policy changes that alleviate any \nchallenges they face.\n  As our service-members and reservists answer our Nation's call to \nduty, we must similarly fulfill our obligations to help protect their \nlivelihood back home. That is why I am pleased to be introducing this \ncritical legislation today with Chair Landrieu, and I pledge to push \nfor its passage before the end of this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Burris, and \n        Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 3395. A bill to provide cost-sharing assistance to improve access \nto the markets of foreign countries for energy efficiency products and \nrenewable energy products exported by small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nRenewable Energy Market Access Program Act, or REMAP Act, which I \nintroduced to help grow American renewable energy and energy efficiency \nexports abroad. This bill would help small- and medium-sized renewable \nenergy businesses promote, export and ultimately penetrate foreign \nmarkets.\n  I know my colleagues are well aware of the importance of exports to \nour Nation's economy, as evidenced by their support for efforts to \nincrease American competitiveness abroad. I am also encouraged by the \nPresident's National Export Initiative and its goal to double American \nexports over the next five years. This effort will be critical to a \nfull economic recovery and I encourage the administration to continue \nits work; however, I believe that we need to do more to support a \nsector that shows tremendous growth potential.\n  In 2009, $162 billion was invested in clean energy worldwide, and it \nis estimated that this investment will increase to $200 billion in \n2010. Additionally, 90 percent of worldwide investments in renewable \nenergy goods occur in G-20 countries and the developing world is \nprojected to comprise 80 percent of the world's future energy demand. \nWhile I continue in my belief that the United States must remain \ncompetitive in both public and private domestic investments in \nrenewable energy, I also believe that we cannot ignore the growing \npotential for American businesses to access markets abroad. Growing \nprivate and public investment in the global economy means\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\ngrowing markets for American companies of all sizes here at home--which \ntranslates into sustainable, well-paying jobs. In this economic \nclimate, I know the most important thing on everyone's mind--Democrats \nand Republicans alike--is putting people back to work. However, those \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses and companies, which are the engine \nfor our domestic economy, are likely to need more assistance in \naccessing these growing foreign renewable energy markets. This is why I \nhave filed legislation that focuses on equipping small- and medium-\nsized enterprises with the tools they need to access foreign markets \nand thereby strengthening our domestic economy and creating jobs.\n  My legislation would support the promotion of American renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency products abroad by creating a Renewable \nEnergy Market Access Program or REMAP. Through REMAP, trade \nassociations and State-regional trade groups would apply to the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce and enter into cooperative agreements to provide \nmarketing and trade assistance to small and medium-sized companies in \nthe renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. The assistance \nwould help facilitate the export of their goods to existing and new \nforeign markets. The agreements would also offer eligible participants \nan opportunity to share the costs related to innovative marketing and \npromotion activities. The public funding for any one application would \nnever exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the proposal, ensuring \nbuy-in from the applicant and an ongoing working relationship with the \nDepartment of Commerce. In sum, this bill will help streamline access \nto the global marketplace for small business and help promote American \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency products overseas.\n  I would like to highlight a sector in the renewable energy industry \nthat could make good use of the REMAP program and in turn help \nstrengthen the American clean energy manufacturing sector. The small \nwind sector is just one renewable energy area that has recently \nexperienced strong growth and has great potential. According to \nindustry statistics, the U.S. small wind market grew by 15 percent in \n2009 despite our economic challenges. What has been even more \nencouraging is that approximately 95 percent of units sold in the U.S. \nin 2009 were produced by U.S. manufacturers. Not only is the U.S. small \nwind industry working to meet our growing domestic appetite for small-\nwind generation, it is also poised to be a growing force in the global \nmarket. In 2009, U.S. manufacturers accounted for 47 percent of global \nsmall wind sales and exports accounted for approximately 36 percent of \nU.S. manufacturers' sales, which represents an eight percent increase \nfrom 2008. As countries develop energy policies that drive investment \nin their renewable energy economy, our domestic renewable energy \nindustry will see its potential to export grow. The question that \nremains is: how do we ensure that American small wind producers realize \ntheir full potential to help meet the global demand for the goods they \nproduce? The answer is through efforts to promote U.S. renewable energy \nand energy efficiency products abroad. I believe that the U.S. can grow \nas a leader, not just in small wind, but in all sectors of renewable \nenergy and I believe that REMAP can help take us there.\n  I want to be clear that I strongly believe that this legislation is \nan important step in the right direction to support a growing industry, \nbut I want to acknowledge that there is more that needs to be done to \nensure that our country's renewable energy goods have fair access to \nforeign markets. Congress must find sensible policy mechanisms to \naddress the unfair trade barriers and other anti-competitive tactics \nthat are used to keep our goods from the shores of other nations with \nwhich we have stable relations, and we should continue having \nconversations on how these matters can be best addressed. But no matter \nthe situation, we must stand in support of our domestic small \nbusinesses and provide them the resources they need to help them access \nnew and growing markets, while we fight to ensure fairness in the \nglobal economy. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 536, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 536) designating June 1, 2010, as \n     ``Declaration of Conscience Day'' in commemoration of the \n     60th anniversary of the landmark ``Declaration of \n     Conscience'' speech delivered by Senator Margaret Chase Smith \n     on the floor of the United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, unwavering in principle and hewing always \nto her Maine roots and hallmark independence, Margaret Chase Smith \nexemplified the finest qualities of our great state of Maine which she \nrepresented with the highest distinction in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the U.S. Senate. A true American political icon and \nesteemed stateswoman, she was and remains the embodiment of Maine's \nmotto, Dirigo or ``I Lead.'' And lead she did.\n  As I said 10 years ago, on the 50th anniversary of her groundbreaking \nremarks, in order to lead, one must first be able to follow--follow \none's conscience, follow one's own ideals, and follow what you know in \nyour heart to be right. In taking the path less travelled, Senator \nSmith became a truly distinguished leader, not just of her time, but \nfor all time, and delivered what we remember as her signature \ncontribution to America and the very freedoms we cherish.\n  Indeed, on this momentous occasion, we pay tribute to a political \ngiant and legend, who rose from the most humble of beginnings to the \nhighest corridors of power--the heights of which she never sought for \npersonal gain, but rather in order to serve the state she loved and the \nNation she revered. And we honor her uncommon courage in confronting a \nscourge no other Senator sought to challenge, which she demonstrated \nwithout equivocation on June 1, 1950.\n  During a time enveloped by a crucible of hatred and fear, it was \nSenator Margaret Chase Smith who became the first U.S. Senator to speak \nthe words that much of America had been thinking to itself back in the \ndark spring of 1950--as Senator Joseph McCarthy made sensational and \nunsubstantiated charges that, through blatant opportunism, had turned \nhim into a national celebrity.\n  But while her colleagues hid behind their silence, with her famous \n``Declaration of Conscience'' speech, Margaret Chase Smith articulated \nthe truth and, in so doing, courageously challenged a giant of \ndemagoguery. Senator Smith stood and bravely defended what she termed \n``some of the basic principles of Americanism.'' She managed to \naccomplish in 15 minutes what 94 of her colleagues had not dared to do, \nprompting American financier and presidential adviser, Bernard Baruch, \nto say that, ``had a man made that speech, he would have become the \nnext President of the United States.''\n  Margaret Chase Smith was a teacher, a telephone operator, a newspaper \nwoman, an office manager, a secretary, a wife, a Congresswoman, and a \nU.S. Senator. She was a visionary of endless ``firsts'' . . . the first \nwoman to be elected to both Houses of Congress . . . the first woman to \nbe nominated for President by a major party . . . even the first woman \nto break the sound barrier in an F-100F Super Sabre Air Force jet.\n  But because of her bravery--both in politics and in life itself--she \ninspired millions of young girls, and became a role model for countless \nmore women across America who never before thought they could aspire to \nany kind of public office. She certainly paved the way for Senator \nCollins and me--after all, who could have predicted that, one day, \nMaine would make history by electing two Republican women to serve \nconcurrently in the U.S. Senate. That is why, as direct beneficiaries \nof Senator Smith's groundbreaking public service in the U.S. Congress, \nit is a tremendous privilege to introduce this resolution.\n  In the end, the measure of Senator Smith's life is in the standard of \nleadership established by her resonating words and powerful actions. We \ncannot begin to overstate the legacy she has bequeathed to us, the \nhallmark of which was her Declaration of Conscience speech. In the \nwords of the ancient Greek, Aeschylus, she ``was not to seem, but to \nbe, the best.'' Simply put, she was and she will always be! Her example \nwill forever illuminate this chamber and light our way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Margaret Chase Smith's \n``Declaration of Conscience'' speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Margaret Chase Smith\n\n                       Declaration of Conscience\n\n                              June 1, 1950\n\n                            (In the Senate)\n\n       Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly and simply \n     about a serious national condition. It is a national feeling \n     of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide \n     and the end of everything that we Americans hold dear. It is \n     a condition that comes from the lack of effective leadership \n     either in the legislative branch or the executive branch of \n     our government.\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\n       That leadership is so lacking that serious and responsible \n     proposals are being made that national advisory commissions \n     be appointed to provide such critically needed leadership.\n       I speak as briefly as possible because too much harm has \n     already been done with irresponsible words of bitterness and \n     selfish political opportunism. I speak as simply as possible \n     because the issue is too great to be obscured by eloquence. I \n     speak simply and briefly in the hope that my words will be \n     taken to heart.\n       Mr. President, I speak as a Republican. I speak as a woman. \n     I speak as a United States senator. I speak as an American.\n\n\n              a forum of hate and character assassination\n\n       The United States Senate has long enjoyed worldwide respect \n     as the greatest deliberative body in the world. But recently \n     that deliberative character has too often been debased to the \n     level of a forum of hate and character assassination \n     sheltered by the shield of congressional immunity.\n       It is ironical that we senators can in debate in the \n     Senate, directly or indirectly, by any form of words, impute \n     to any American who is not a senator any conduct or motive \n     unworthy or unbecoming an American--and without that non-\n     senator American having any legal redress against us--yet if \n     we say the same thing in the Senate about our colleagues we \n     can be stopped on the grounds of being out of order.\n       It is strange that we can verbally attack anyone else \n     without restraint and with full protection, and yet we hold \n     ourselves above the same type of criticism here on the Senate \n     floor. Surely the United States Senate is big enough to take \n     self-criticism and self-appraisal. Surely we should be able \n     to take the same kind of character attacks that we ``dish \n     out'' to outsiders.\n       I think that it is high time for the United States Senate \n     and its members to do some real soul searching and to weigh \n     our consciences as to the manner in which we are performing \n     our duty to the people of America and the manner in which we \n     are using or abusing our individual powers and privileges.\n       I think that it is high time that we remembered that we \n     have sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution. I think \n     that it is high time that we remembered that the \n     Constitution, as amended, speaks not only of the freedom of \n     speech but also of trial by jury instead of trial by \n     accusation.\n       Whether it be a criminal prosecution in court or a \n     character prosecution in the Senate, there is little \n     practical distinction when the life of a person has been \n     ruined.\n\n\n                  the basic principles of americanism\n\n       Those of us who shout the loudest about Americanism in \n     making character assassinations are all too frequently those \n     who, by our own words and acts, ignore some of the basic \n     principles of Americanism--\n       The right to criticize.\n       The right to hold unpopular beliefs.\n       The right to protest.\n       The right of independent thought.\n       The exercise of these rights should not cost one single \n     American citizen his reputation or his right to a livelihood \n     nor should he be in danger of losing his reputation or \n     livelihood merely because he happens to know someone who \n     holds unpopular beliefs. Who of us does not? Otherwise none \n     of us could call our souls our own. Otherwise thought control \n     would have set in.\n       The American people are sick and tired of being afraid to \n     speak their minds lest they be politically smeared as \n     ``Communists'' or ``Fascists'' by their opponents. Freedom of \n     speech is not what it used to be in America. It has been so \n     abused by some that it is not exercised by others.\n       The American people are sick and tired of seeing innocent \n     people smeared and guilty people whitewashed. But there have \n     been enough proved cases, such as the Amerasia case, the Hiss \n     case, the Coplon case, the Gold case, to cause nationwide \n     distrust and strong suspicion that there may be something to \n     the unproved, sensational accusations.\n\n\n                  a challenge to the republican party\n\n       As a Republican, I say to my colleagues on this side of the \n     aisle that the Republican party faces a challenge today that \n     is not unlike the challenge which it faced back in Lincoln's \n     day. The Republican party so successfully met that challenge \n     that it emerged from the Civil War as the champion of a \n     united nation--in addition to being a party which \n     unrelentingly fought loose spending and loose programs.\n       Today our country is being psychologically divided by the \n     confusion and the suspicions that are bred in the United \n     States Senate to spread like cancerous tentacles of ``know \n     nothing, suspect everything'' attitudes. Today we have a \n     Democratic administration which has developed a mania for \n     loose spending and loose programs. History is repeating \n     itself--and the Republican party again has the opportunity to \n     emerge as the champion of unity and prudence. The record of \n     the present Democratic administration has provided us with \n     sufficient campaign issues without the necessity of resorting \n     to political smears. America is rapidly losing its position \n     as leader of the world simply because the Democratic \n     administration has pitifully failed to provide effective \n     leadership.\n       The Democratic administration has completely confused the \n     American people by its daily contradictory grave warnings and \n     optimistic assurances, which show the people that our \n     Democratic administration has no idea of where it is going.\n       The Democratic administration has greatly lost the \n     confidence of the American people by its complacency to the \n     threat of communism here at home and the leak of vital \n     secrets to Russia through key officials of the Democratic \n     administration. There are enough proved cases to make this \n     point without diluting our criticism with unproved charges.\n       Surely these are sufficient reasons to make it clear to the \n     American people that it is time for a change and that a \n     Republican victory is necessary to the security of the \n     country. Surely it is clear that this nation will continue to \n     suffer so long as it is governed by the present ineffective \n     Democratic administration.\n\n\n                    ``the four horsemen of calumny''\n\n       Yet to displace it with a Republican regime embracing a \n     philosophy that lacks political integrity or intellectual \n     honesty would prove equally disastrous to the nation. The \n     nation sorely needs a Republican victory. But I do not want \n     to see the Republican party ride to political victory on the \n     Four Horsemen of Calumny--Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry, and \n     Smear.\n       I doubt if the Republican party could do so, simply because \n     I do not believe the American people will uphold any \n     political party that puts political exploitation above \n     national interest. Surely we Republicans are not that \n     desperate for victory.\n       I do not want to see the Republican party win that way. \n     While it might be a fleeting victory for the Republican \n     party, it would be a more lasting defeat for the American \n     people. Surely it would ultimately be suicide for the \n     Republican party and the two-party system that has protected \n     our American liberties from the dictatorship of a one-party \n     system.\n       As members of the minority party, we do not have the \n     primary authority to formulate the policy of our government. \n     But we do have the responsibility of rendering constructive \n     criticism, of clarifying issues, of allaying fears by acting \n     as responsible citizens.\n       As a woman, I wonder how the mothers, wives, sisters, and \n     daughters feel about the way in which members of their \n     families have been politically mangled in Senate debate--and \n     I use the word ``debate'' advisedly.\n\n\n                    ``irresponsible sensationalism''\n\n       As a United States senator, I am not proud of the way in \n     which the Senate has been made a publicity platform for \n     irresponsible sensationalism. I am not proud of the reckless \n     abandon in which unproved charges have been hurled from this \n     side of the aisle. I am not proud of the obviously staged, \n     undignified countercharges which have been attempted in \n     retaliation from the other side of the aisle.\n       I do not like the way the Senate has been made a rendezvous \n     for vilification, for selfish political gain at the sacrifice \n     of individual reputations and national unity. I am not proud \n     of the way we smear outsiders from the floor of the Senate \n     and hide behind the cloak of congressional immunity and still \n     place ourselves beyond criticism on the floor of the Senate.\n       As an American, I am shocked at the way Republicans and \n     Democrats alike are playing directly into the Communist \n     design of ``confuse, divide, and conquer.'' As an American, I \n     do not want a Democratic administration ``whitewash'' or \n     ``coverup'' any more than I want a Republican smear or witch \n     hunt.\n       As an American, I condemn a Republican Fascist just as much \n     as I condemn a Democrat Communist. I condemn a Democrat \n     Fascist just as much as I condemn a Republican Communist. \n     They are equally dangerous to you and me and to our country. \n     As an American, I want to see our nation recapture the \n     strength and unity it once had when we fought the enemy \n     instead of ourselves.\n       It is with these thoughts that I have drafted what I call a \n     Declaration of Conscience. I am gratified that the senator \n     from New Hampshire [Mr. TOBEY], the senator from Vermont [Mr. \n     AIKEN], the senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE], the senator from \n     New York [Mr. IVES], the senator from Minnesota [Mr. THYE], \n     and the senator from New Jersey [Mr. HENDRICKSON] have \n     concurred in that declaration and have authorized me to \n     announce their concurrence.\n       The declaration reads as follows:\n\n                 Statement of Seven Republican Senators\n\n       1. We are Republicans. But we are Americans first. It is as \n     Americans that we express our concern with the growing \n     confusion that threatens the security and stability of our \n     country. Democrats and Republicans alike have contributed to \n     that confusion.\n       2. The Democratic administration has initially created the \n     confusion by its lack of effective leadership, by its \n     contradictory grave warnings and optimistic assurances, by \n     its complacency to the threat of communism here at home, by \n     its oversensitiveness to rightful criticism, by its petty \n     bitterness against its critics.\n       3. Certain elements of the Republican party have materially \n     added to this confusion in the hopes of riding the Republican \n     party to victory through the selfish political exploitation \n     of fear, bigotry, ignorance, and intolerance. There are \n     enough mistakes of the Democrats for Republicans to criticize \n     constructively without resorting to political smears.\n       4. To this extent, Democrats and Republicans alike have \n     unwittingly, but undeniably, played directly into the \n     Communist design of ``confuse, divide, and conquer.''\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\n       5. It is high time that we stopped thinking politically as \n     Republicans and Democrats about elections and started \n     thinking patriotically as Americans about national security \n     based on individual freedom. It is high time that we all \n     stopped being tools and victims of totalitarian techniques--\n     techniques that, if continued here unchecked, will surely end \n     what we have come to cherish as the American way of life.\n     Margaret Chase Smith,\n       Maine.\n     Charles W.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 536) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 536\n\n       Whereas on June 1, 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith of \n     the State of Maine, in her first major speech on the floor of \n     the Senate, delivered a courageous and heroic speech \n     responding to the contemptible actions and words of Senator \n     Joseph McCarthy from the State of Wisconsin;\n       Whereas in 15 minutes, Senator Smith accomplished a task \n     that 94 of her male colleagues did not dare to attempt;\n       Whereas Senator Smith had the will and integrity to speak \n     out vigorously when silence was a safer course;\n       Whereas through the power of her iconic words, Senator \n     Smith challenged a giant of demagoguery, prompting financier \n     and presidential advisor, Bernard Baruch, to say that ``had a \n     man made that speech, he would have become the next President \n     of the United States'';\n       Whereas Senator Smith, because of her bravery both in \n     politics and in life, inspired millions of young girls, and \n     became a role model for countless more women across the \n     United States, who had never before thought that women could \n     aspire to any kind of public office;\n       Whereas Senator Smith was a legendary and undeniable force \n     of civic good and political courage, whose bravery, civility, \n     compassion, and integrity are woven indelibly into the fabric \n     of the greatness of the United States;\n       Whereas Senator Smith was a much-beloved and universally \n     admired daughter of the State of Maine and forever the pride \n     of Skowhegan, Maine, her birthplace and home;\n       Whereas Senator Smith was a teacher, telephone operator, \n     newspaper woman, office manager, secretary, wife, \n     Congresswoman, and Senator;\n       Whereas Senator Smith was the first woman to be elected to \n     both Houses of Congress; and\n       Whereas Senator Smith was--\n       (1) a timeless leader for the State of Maine and the United \n     States;\n       (2) a friend to freedom and the public trust;\n       (3) a fearless defender of democracy and the bedrock \n     principles of democracy; and\n       (4) above all else, a Stateswoman and public servant who \n     belongs not just to the State of Maine and the United States, \n     but to the ages: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 1, 2010, as ``Declaration of Conscience \n     Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the landmark \n     ``Declaration of Conscience'' speech delivered by Senator \n     Margaret Chase Smith;\n       (3) honors the heroism of the immortal words and actions of \n     Senator Smith; and\n       (4) pays tribute to the integrity and courage of Senator \n     Smith, which reverberates to this day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/20/senate-section/article/S4106-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ACTION ON H.R. 3951 VITIATED\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.
