Mr. President, this month, the Obama administration will \nsubmit its review of the war in Afghanistan. I expect--and I think a \nnumber of Members of Congress expect--that this review will provide \nanswers to the key questions before us, questions the American people \ndeserve answers to. I believe these questions fall into three broad \ncategories: first of all, Afghan governance; second, development and \nhumanitarian efforts; and, finally, establishing a sustainable security \nenvironment in Afghanistan.\n  Since the announcement of a new strategy in December of 2009 and the \ndeployment of 30,000 additional troops, I have sought to carefully \nmonitor U.S. progress toward its goals. As part of this effort, I have \npaid special attention to combating the top killer of U.S. troops, \nwhich, of course, is improvised explosive devices. I chaired a Senate \nForeign Relations Committee hearing on this topic on November 18 and \nwill continue to press our government and our leaders and governments \nin the region to do more to restrict the availability of components \nthat make up these terrible weapons, especially, of course, ammonium \nnitrate, which flows into Afghanistan every day of the week to make \nIEDs that kill our troops.\n  I am pleased significant progress has been made by the Department of \nState, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of \nDefense to coordinate an all-of-government approach to this problem. I \nwish to applaud the recent efforts of the Afghan security forces that \nseized one metric ton of ammonium nitrate on Monday in Zabul Province. \nAll the key players appear to be on the same page on this issue, but \nthere still has not been a significant decrease of these deadly weapons \nin Afghanistan. I trust that the December review by the administration \nwill address the flow of ammonium nitrate, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work closely with the administration on this issue.\n  At a strategic level, too many questions remain as we head into the \nDecember review. I would like to list some of those right now.\n  First of all, on the issue of governance, I have two questions I hope \nthe December review will address. First, do we have a political \nstrategy--a political strategy--in place to ensure that the Afghan \nGovernment is prepared to enact reforms that concretely show the \npopulation it represents their key interests and concerns? I believe \nour efforts to pressure the Afghan Government have been at best uneven \nin this area, due, in large part, to a reluctance to pressure the \nAfghan leadership.\n  Any security gains in Afghanistan can be easily squandered without \nserious progress on governance. The United States, ISAF, and Afghan \nsecurity forces are sacrificing too much as the Afghan Government fails \nto enact reforms in the best interests of the Afghan people. It will be \ndifficult to succeed in Afghanistan without a strategy to help build \nthe institutions of governance, including the judiciary, political \nparties, and, of course, electoral institutions.\n  As difficult as these interactions may be, the international \ncommunity must be more willing to confront the Afghan Government on \nissues of political representation, corruption, and the rule of law. We \nshould stand ready to help build and develop these democratic \ninstitutions.\n  The 2009 Presidential election and the 2010 parliamentary elections \nwere rife with problems that seriously undermined the confidence of the \ninternational community in Afghanistan's ability to conduct elections \nfree of fraud and manipulation. If the electoral process remains deeply \nflawed, the Afghan people's support for the democratic process itself \nmay well erode.\n  While the government has said it wants to develop a ``strategy for \nlong-term electoral reform that addresses in particular the \nsustainability of the electoral process,'' few steps have been taken in \nthis direction. The election law is in need of serious reform. The \nexecutive branch has nearly exclusive power over the Independent \nElection Commission and Electoral Complaints Commission. The single \nnontransferable vote system impedes the development of political \nparties, an essential long-term way to organize and represent the \ninterests of the Afghan people.\n  Corruption continues to be a serious issue that affects citizens \nacross Afghanistan, especially in the southern part of the country. A \nrecent public opinion survey conducted by the Washington Post, ABC \nNews, the BBC, and ARD television in Germany showed that 55 percent of \nrespondents in Kandahar say they have been asked for bribes from the \npolice--55 percent--well above the national figure of 21 percent. \nMoreover, most Kandahar residents say their situation would only get \nworse if they exercised due process and filed a complaint about a \npublic official.\n\n  U.S. efforts to improve governance at times compete with our security \nconcerns. There is an inherent tension between the United States and \nISAF forces in efforts to engage, to combat extremist elements at the \nlocal level and cooperation with warlords who rule over certain areas. \nWhile there is an imperative to collect intelligence and conduct \noperations that may require cooperation with local power brokers, I am \nconcerned the long-term cost of such interaction is very high. Are we \nempowering another generation of local power brokers who have little \nregard for representing the interests of the local population? That is \na question that needs to be asked over and over, and we need answers to \nthat question.\n  It is a simple fact, disaffection among Afghan citizens with the \ncentral government and local power brokers provides recruiting \nopportunities for the Taliban. This is a serious concern because it \ngets to the heart of our engagement in Afghanistan: Cooperation\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\nwith local warlords can provide short-term security gains, but what is \nthe long-term impact? I hope the administration's December review will \naddress this issue.\n  Question No. 2: What is the state of the reconciliation process with \nthe Taliban? I have expressed serious concerns about the impact of \nnegotiations with the Taliban on women and other vulnerable groups in \nAfghanistan. My concern grew--and I know others' concern as well--our \nconcern grew in reading the poll numbers from Afghanistan recently. \nThere was a 13-percent jump from last year among respondents who say \nwomen's rights are suffering.\n  The December review should address the current state of play with \nrespect to these negotiations. The recent Afghan poll showed that \nnearly three-quarters of Afghans now believe their government should \npursue negotiations with the Taliban, with almost two-thirds willing to \naccept a deal allowing Taliban leaders to hold political office.\n  Ultimately, there must be a political solution to end the war in \nAfghanistan. I am not suggesting we are close at this time to that \nresult, but we need to know the degree to which the administration and \nthe Karzai government are coordinated and headed down the same path. \nInternational engagement on any negotiation process will be essential \nto long-term success. Pakistan has a role to play and is a necessary \nelement to any long-lasting peace agreement.\n  The next area, security. U.S. operations in southern Afghanistan \nappear to be having a positive impact on Afghan public opinion. Sixty-\nseven percent of the people in the Province of Helmand describe their \nsecurity as good, a 14-percent jump from December 2009. Nearly two-\nthirds of Helmand residents state that Afghanistan is on the right \ntrack.\n  This is an indication that positive momentum has been built in \nAfghanistan's most sensitive region. But such gains can be short-lived, \nand in order to facilitate a sustainable security, we must take a long-\nterm approach to ensure that the Afghan Government can provide for its \nown security.\n  The training of the Afghan National Security Forces is a key \nthreshold question. We cannot allow Afghanistan to once again become a \nhaven for al-Qaida or other extremist groups to launch attacks against \nthe United States. ISAF forces have denied al-Qaida this haven since \n2001. However, we cannot provide this security in perpetuity. The \nAfghans have to assume more responsibility for their own security, and \nwe must do all we can to prepare the Afghan National Security Forces \nfor that day.\n  So where do we stand at this point? I would have to say the view is \ndecidedly mixed. For years, the international community exercised what \ncan be characterized as gross neglect in building Afghan security \nforces, and only recently have we begun to take on this task.\n  First, some positive news on this issue. We do not hear enough about \nthis.\n  Under the leadership of Lieutenant General Caldwell, the NATO \nTraining Mission-Afghanistan, the so-called NTM-A, has been a source of \nreal progress. The Afghan National Army and Police are exceeding--\nexceeding--their recruitment goals. As of August of this year, the \nAfghan National Army's total strength had grown to 138,164, exceeding \nthe goal for October 2010 by more than 8,000 troops. As of August, the \nAfghan National Police had an end strength of 119,639, exceeding the \n2010 goal of 109,000.  These recruitment numbers are an important sign \nof progress, but serious concerns remain related to the quality of the \nforce, the retention rate, and the low rate of literacy.\n\n  The Afghan National Army has significant shortages in officer and \nnoncommissioned officer leadership. Effective junior leaders are \nessential to a professional force since they control immediate on-the-\nground situations.\n  The Ministry of Defense and the training mission in Afghanistan are \nworking to overcome a shortfall of more than 4,500 Afghan National Army \nofficers. There are more Officer Candidate School units, twice as many \nseats in the Integration Mujahedeen Course, and larger classes at the \nNational Military Academy.\n  As for noncommissioned officers, the Afghan National Army faces a \nshortage of more than 10,500. Similar expansions in training capacity \nand direct entry programs are underway to address this deficiency. \nAccording to a recent Pentagon report, the gap will not be closed until \nthe end of 2012.\n  The Pentagon also reports we face a shortfall of more than 900 \ninternational trainers in Afghanistan. I hope our allies in ISAF can \nhelp to address this very important training need. Many European \ncountries have a proud history of developing elite paramilitary forces. \nThis valued expertise is needed right now in Afghanistan.\n  While expanding capacity is critical to growing the force, I hope the \nDecember review by the administration will address not just the efforts \nto grow more leaders but also describe how these leaders are laying the \nfoundation for professionalizing the Afghan national security forces.\n  Retention and attrition rates. For years, the Afghan national \nsecurity force's attrition rate has been an issue. Facilitating rapid \ngrowth while increasing quality requires that retention rates remain \nhigh.\n  In January 2010, the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board approved \nthe goal of developing a force of 305,600 personnel by October 2011. \nRecruiting efforts compared with increased retention have allowed the \nforce to grow ahead of schedule so far. Moving forward, projections \nremain uncertain. The Defense Department reports the police have met \nattrition and retention goals. However, the Afghan National Army still \nhas issues with attrition that may impact its ability to maintain its \nimpressive growth in numbers. This month's review by the administration \nshould clarify projections and detail efforts to boost retention.\n  Literacy is a big problem. The literacy rates are very low in the \nAfghan Security Force and this must be addressed. Consider this story \nfrom Lieutenant General Caldwell. He visited a base in northern \nAfghanistan where 90 percent of the troops claimed they had been unpaid \nfor months. To limit corruption, the government has been paying the \ntroops by electronic funds transfer instead of cash. The troops had no \nidea, however, since they could not read their bank statements.\n  Think about weapons security. How can a soldier be sure he has been \nassigned a weapon if he cannot read the serial number? Illiteracy is \nwidespread in the force: Only 11 percent of enlisted personnel can \nread, write, or do simple math. This creates significant challenges in \nprofessionalizing the security force. In response, a huge literacy \nprogram has grown around the fielding of the Afghan security forces. So \nwe have much to do on that.\n  I will move to the last part of our concerns, and that is on \ndevelopment. A qualified Afghan soldier is much cheaper to train and \nequip on the field than an American, so the overall cost to U.S. \ntaxpayers would certainly diminish as the U.S. forces draw down. But by \ninvesting in this large force, there are long-term implications. Do we \nexpect to pay for the Afghan security forces 10 years from now, 20 \nyears from now? At what point will the Afghan Government be able to \ncollect its own revenue to fund its security as well as other \npriorities?\n  That is, again, why responsible Afghan governance is essential. While \nthe international community will shoulder much of the humanitarian and \nsecurity burden in the short term, the Afghan Government needs to take \nsteps to increase its domestic revenue collection, as well as put into \nplace a sound legislative framework to encourage investment. They need \nto develop a minerals framework law, and they also need to put in place \nchanges to bring about a stronger infrastructure.\n  Let me close with a reflection upon our troops. We have the \nobligation here in the Senate to ask and have answers to very critical \nquestions, whether they relate to development or governance or \nsecurity, and especially on the question of security. We also have an \nobligation to remember and keep in mind the human toll.\n\n\n                           SSG SEAN FLANNERY\n\n  In the State of Pennsylvania, as in a lot of States, we have lost a \nlot of soldiers. To date, we have lost 60 servicemembers since the \nbeginning of the war in Afghanistan. In Iraq, we got to the number of \nabout 196--just below 200. Let me share one story as I conclude. Two \nweeks ago, Pennsylvania\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nlost Army SSG Sean Flannery who died a hero in Afghanistan. He is from \nthe town of Wyomissing, PA, in Bucks County. He was an infantry squad \nleader who was killed after delivering first aid to a wounded Afghan \nsoldier. Sean and his team carried the man to an evacuation helicopter. \nThey stepped on an improvised explosive device which killed Sean and \nanother soldier. Staff Sergeant Flannery was 29 years old. After he \ngraduated from Wyomissing High School in 1999 and Shippensburg \nUniversity, he was determined to serve his country. He was on his \nfourth tour of duty after having served two tours in Iraq and a prior \ntour in Afghanistan. He earned a Bronze Star because of his heroism and \nthen another commendation last week. One of his high school classmates \npaid tribute to his friend at a service earlier this week. He said:\n\n       His fellow soldiers talked about how much they respected \n     him and what a great leader he was and how they had true love \n     for him, and not a word of it surprised us. He was the type \n     of guy everybody wants their son to be--loyal, humble, and \n     generous. I was honored to have him as a friend.\n\n  That is what Matt Rader, a classmate of Sean Flannery's, said about \nSean.\n  All of us are honored to represent these young men and women who \nfight for us and some who die for this cause. Today we pray for those \nfamilies. We pray for Sean and his family. But in the larger sense I \nguess we pray for ourselves as well. We pray that we are worthy and can \nprove ourselves worthy of their valor.\n  One of the ways Members of the Congress can prove ourselves worthy of \nthat valor is to ask and demand answers to these very difficult \nquestions, no matter who the administration is and no matter what \nparty, because we have to get this policy right. We have an obligation \nto get it right, for Sean Flannery and for those who have loved and \nlost, and for our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, \nSenator Reed, be given time on the floor for his remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8732-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8732-S8733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JACE JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to pay tribute to \nsomeone who is very special and very dear to me, my former Chief of \nStaff, Jace Johnson. Over this past recess, I learned that my Chief of \nStaff, Jace Johnson, would be leaving the Senate to pursue \nopportunities in the private sector.\n  Change often catches us by surprise. As the Presiding Officer can \nimagine, I had come to rely on the talents and insight that Jace \noffered over many these past years. He was my strong right arm, someone \nin whom I had complete confidence, and still do. For 8 years, Jace \nworked on my staff and dedicated his efforts to serving Utah and \nimproving our country. Undoubtedly, his work ethic and his \nstraightforward approach to public service have greatly benefited us \nall. Jace is sorely missed by all of us on our staff and all of us in \nour office. He provided strong leadership at a time when it was \nabsolutely crucial to us.\n  To fully understand the void created by Jace's absence, one has to \nknow a bit more about him. When you walked into Jace's office, you were \ngreeted by proudly displayed Utah college and university pennants. \nAside from making an interesting and welcoming environment, the banners \nproclaimed Jace's passion for sports. Like me, he spent his boyhood as \nan avid basketball player. I regret we never had the opportunity for a \none-on-one game, but I am still convinced I would have kicked his tail \nand I would have won. Although when I think about it, he is in a lot \nbetter shape than I am.\n  His love of hoops led Jace to play basketball at Snow College in \ncentral Utah. Soon thereafter, Jace served a 2-year mission for the \nChurch of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints in the Philadelphia, PA \narea. Being from smalltown Idaho, I can only imagine the new \nexperiences Philadelphia had to offer. It undoubtedly left quite an \nimpression. His wife Cori credits her husband's time in Philadelphia \nfor his willingness to venture back to the east coast after college.\n  Jace and Cori met while they were attending college at Brigham Young \nUniversity in Provo, UT. They have three wonderful children--Ashley, \nBenjamin, and Christian. Upon finishing school at BYU, Jace and Cori \nmade the move to Washington, DC, so he could attend graduate school at \nGeorge Washington University and earn his MBA.\n  While Jace was still in school, he actually worked in my office as an \nintern. He didn't stay long, however, because as the saying goes, he \nhad bigger fish to fry. By the time he returned to Capitol Hill to work \non a more permanent basis, he had already achieved remarkable success \nin the business world. After working for a few years at Visa \nInternational, he became the director of finance at the Corvis \nCorporation, a cutting-edge network and media solutions company. Jace \nwas the third employee to be hired at Corvis when it was still a \nstartup, and while he was there he helped secure financing for the \ncompany as it prepared to go public in the year 2000. Jace's \ncontribution to Corvis allowed the company to grow from a small startup \nemploying a handful of people into an international company with more \nthan 3,000 employees and a value of $40 billion.\n  Jace joined my staff in 2002, coming on as a legislative assistant, \nworking mostly on telecommunications issues. In that position, he \ndemonstrated the keen understanding and strategic thinking that had \nmade him such a success in the business world. After 3 years, I \nappointed him to be my legislative director, and in that position he \ncontinued to excel and became a vital and integral part of my efforts \nhere in the Senate. I grew to depend on him more and more, and in \nJanuary of 2008, Jace took over as my Chief of Staff.\n  I used to joke with him that working for me was only a hobby, because \nhe didn't need the money. Of course, anyone who knew and worked with \nJace can attest that is simply not true. He put his heart and soul into \nhis work in the Senate. For Jace, failure wasn't permissible, so he \nspent early mornings and late nights ensuring the work was done and \ndone right. His commitment to me personally and to my work here in the \nSenate was rooted in his belief--a belief he reiterated at every \nopportunity--that what we were doing was in the best interests of our \ncountry and for the people of Utah.\n  I think what I appreciated most about Jace is his unwavering honesty. \nIn a town filled with people who only want to tell you what they want \nyou to hear, Jace was refreshingly direct and straightforward. I have \nalways attributed this to the fact that he is, to put it bluntly, just \na little bit smarter--maybe not just a bit smarter, a whole lot \nsmarter--than most people. People who don't see the big picture and who \ncan't predict what might happen down the line have the need to hedge \nbets, cover bases, and speak without committing. Jace Johnson has never \nhad that problem. When a goal is identified and a plan set in motion, \nhe is usually a few steps ahead of everyone else and he can see where \nproblems might arise. Chances are he has already come up with solutions \nto those problems. An individual with that kind of rare insight and \nunderstanding has the license to speak directly where others would hem \nand haw. I was lucky enough to be the beneficiary of Jace's ability to \nspeak frankly and honestly, and on more than one occasion that meant I \nwas on the receiving end. I think I can speak for every Member of the \nSenate when I say that that kind of support from staff is a treasured \ncommodity.\n  It is very clear I will miss Jace Johnson on my staff. However, I \nthink it would be even more telling to hear from some of the people of \nUtah who have high praise for Jace and the service he has rendered.\n  Utah Governor Gary Herbert had this to say:\n\n       Jace is a man of great insight and understanding. He is \n     able to think strategically and anticipate potential \n     roadblocks, which has, and will continue, to serve him well. \n     I wish him the best of luck and success in his new position.\n\n  Jason Perry, Governor Herbert's Chief of Staff, said:\n\n       I have had the opportunity to work with Jace for many \n     years. His uncanny ability to\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\n     diffuse potentially difficult situations, coupled with his \n     pleasant and approachable nature, has proven invaluable on \n     several occasions.\n\n  Utah Senator-elect Mike Lee said:\n\n       I have looked to Jace Johnson on many occasions for his \n     keen insight, depth of wisdom, and wise counsel. He has \n     proven to be a tremendous resource and has truly made a \n     difference for me, Senator Hatch, the people of the great \n     State of Utah, and for our country. His legacy of service \n     will stand as a benchmark of excellence for years to come.\n\n  Former Utah Republican Party Chairman Stan Lockhart said this:\n\n       Jace Johnson is a class act. In positions of responsibility \n     and authority, he is approachable and down to earth. In an \n     environment of hardball politics, he maintains integrity. \n     With many issues to deal with on a daily basis, he \n     understands the big picture and small nuances of good policy. \n     I always liked the fact that he understands the private \n     sector, with a successful background in the technology \n     industry before he came to Washington, D.C. I'll miss Jace.\n\n  A prominent Salt Lake City lawyer and a political leader, Doug \nFoxley, in the State said about Jace:\n\n       Behind that I-am-just-a-boy-from-Blackfoot-Idaho, was a \n     keen, astute political mind who always had Orrin's interest \n     at heart and had a quality of making everyone feel that he \n     was their best friend. Not diminishing any other person who \n     has worked for Orrin, but Jace was a delight and any trip to \n     D.C. without seeing Jace was not a trip. A true committed \n     conservative who was not an obnoxious ideologue, but one who \n     truly believed what he espoused: hard work, honor, \n     commitment, dedication to family, Church, and country and \n     imbued with a belief in limited government and in the private \n     sector were guiding principles. This, coupled with compassion \n     for those less fortunate, is the Jace Johnson legacy.\n\n  Mr. President, that is high praise, and we have lots of others who \nfeel the same way. I will leave it at that.\n  During my time here in the Senate, I have been extremely fortunate \nwhen it comes to my staff. I have had the privilege of serving with \nsome of the most gifted and devoted individuals our Nation has to \noffer. Each of them has brought something unique and important to the \ntable. But I have to say that, even among the select fraternity of \ntalented Senate staffers, Jace Johnson belongs in the hall of honor, an \nelite class that very few have been or will be able to attain.\n  I have no doubt that Jace will succeed in the new position. Success \nhas been the defining characteristic of every endeavor he has \nundertaken. While the selfish part of me wishes he would have stayed in \nthe Senate just a little bit longer, I want to wish Jace, his wife \nCori, and his whole family the very best going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8733-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8733-S8734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our \ncolleagues who are departing the Senate after distinguished service on \nbehalf of their States and on behalf of the Nation. I have been \nprivileged to work with these individuals, to learn from them, to \ncollaborate and cooperate with them, and to, in some small way, help \nthem do what they have done so well--represent their States with \nfidelity, with great effort, and to move the agenda of the Nation \nforward.\n\n\n                               Evan Bayh\n\n  Evan Bayh, a colleague and friend. We served together on the Banking \nCommittee and the Armed Services Committee. His lovely wife Susan and \ntheir two children have contributed extraordinarily to Indiana as a \nGovernor, and then as a Senator serving the Nation.\n  I can recall very early on in the operations in Iraq, where it became \nclear to Senator Bayh that unless we armored our humvee vehicles, \nthousands and thousands of soldiers would be at risk, and also marines, \nsailors, and airmen. He fought tenaciously to ensure, against initial \nopposition, that we were able to begin to armor those vehicles, begin \nto develop new generations of armored vehicles to protect our soldiers. \nSo, quite literally, his efforts saved the lives of thousands of young \nAmericans. For that alone, we owe him a huge debt of gratitude.\n  In every endeavor, from issues of children's health to education \npolicy, he brought a thoughtful, measured, and brilliant mind to bear \nthat is hard to match. I wish him the very best.\n\n\n                             Robert Bennett\n\n  Bob Bennett and I served together on the Banking Committee. His \nthoughtful questioning and his deep knowledge of the subjects were \ncritical on so many different issues. I remember when we were trying to \nget the extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act completed so the \nmarkets--particularly the markets for large properties--would not \nfreeze up, he was instrumental in getting that done. That is just one \nexample of what he has done throughout a career of public service to \nthe people of Utah and of this Nation. I wish he and Joyce the very \nbest as they continue to serve, as I am sure they will, this Nation and \ntheir State of Utah.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n  Kit Bond and Linda Bond have served with such distinction also. As a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, he has made wise and judicious \ndecisions about how we invest in this country. In that process, he \nnever forgot the obligation to groups who are often overlooked.\n  One of the areas where he has done so much work, and so effectively, \nhas been on the issue of homelessness. His efforts, joined by our \ncolleagues and friends, Barbara Mikulski and Patty Murray, have made a \nreal difference in providing effective and efficient shelter for so \nmany in our large communities and in our rural areas, who otherwise \nliterally would be on the streets of America. One of the most \ndisheartening images in this country is to see people who are forced to \nbe on the streets. There are many reasons for that. But Kit Bond has \ndone a lot to ensure there is at least a capacity to help people who \nneed that kind of help. I thank him for that and commend him for so \nmuch of what he has done for the people of Missouri and the people of \nthis Nation.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n  I congratulate Governor-elect Sam Brownback. He has decided to leave \nthe rigors of the Senate for the tranquility of being a Governor. I see \nour Presiding Officer, who enjoyed the tranquility of being the \nGovernor of Virginia. I know Sam is going to do great, but I think at \nsome moment he might mop his brow and say that it wasn't quite as \nhectic back in the Senate.\n  Along with Mary and his family he has distinguished himself. Sam is \nsomeone who is indefatigable when involved in an issue. He does it from \nprinciple and conscience. We appreciate that.\n  I was pleased to work with him on legislation I introduced, the \nConquer Childhood Cancer Act, which became law. That is one example of \nhis great skills as a legislator. In foreign affairs he was someone who \nkept watch on areas of the world which otherwise might have been \nneglected. His efforts with respect to Darfur, striving to bring \njustice and peace to that region, are particularly commendable. I thank \nthe Senator for his service and wish him well as he assumes the \ndaunting responsibilities as Governor of the State of Kansas.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  Senator Jim Bunning and I served together for many years on the \nBanking Committee. Jim and Mary Catherine and their family brought so \nmuch to not only the Senate as an organization, but to the Senate as a \ngroup of individuals. Jim was one of the first and most insightful \nobservers and critics of the growing issues in the securities market. \nHe did it based upon his experience as a financial stockbroker in the \nworld of finance. He did it also with his grasp of common sense and \nlooking at things carefully and pragmatically, based on Main Street not \non financial centers. We worked together on the Securities Committee, \nand we did it in a way that I enjoyed the collaboration immensely.\n  A focus on the issues and their importance to the country was also in \nthe forefront of his mind. He distinguished himself immensely. I wish \nhim well.\n\n\n                             Roland Burris\n\n  Senator Roland Burris brought a great bit of vitality and energy to \nthe Senate in his time here. I wish Roland and Berlean the very best. \nHe has had a remarkable career in Illinois as someone who was in the \nbanking industry and then public service--been a pathbreaker in so many \ndifferent ways. When he came to the Senate, he came\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\nwith that same enthusiasm, knowing that his service would be limited in \ndays but not limited by any aspirations or any ideals. He wanted to do \nthe best for the people of Illinois and the Nation. I thank him.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Next is Byron and Kim Dorgan and their family. Again, Byron was an \nintegral part for many years in this Senate. He is one of those \nindividuals whose wisdom you appreciate more and more each day. He is \nsomeone who spoke years ago about the offshoring of jobs, and he spoke \nyears ago about a tax system that doesn't reward investment in American \njobs but ironically might encourage disinvestment of those jobs. He is \nsomeone who spoke with reason, candor, thoughtfulness, and facts about \nissues that the rest of us are beginning to recognize today are \ncritical to the future of this country.\n  We will also miss his steady hand on the Appropriations Committee, \nwhere he battled to ensure that the reasonable priorities of this \nNation were met. His support and help in terms of LIHEAP funding and \nhis help to me personally in so many different ways is deeply \nappreciated. I thank him for his service. I know he will continue to \nprovide, in his writings and speeches, the wise and thoughtful insights \nthat, again, as we look back, I think we should have heeded with much \nmore energy and enthusiasm when he spoke them.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  Senator Russ Feingold--and this is said often, but it applies so \naccurately--is a conscience of this body. He is someone who came here \nto fight for the principles in which he deeply believes and would not \ndeviate from that very serious challenge. He did it with skill, \nthoughtfulness, and gentility. I appreciate that very much. He was a \nchampion for so many things--Pell grants, making sure the opportunity \nwas still a watchword of this country. What he was most famous for was \nhis efforts in campaign finance reform. Frankly, we will miss him \ndearly because of that.\n  There is a growing concern in this country that elections have become \nauctions, not about the quality of the candidates and their positions, \nbut simply how much money can be funded and by how many different \nsources. So at a time when we have to confront again an even more \nserious challenge of campaign finance reform, we are losing one of the \ngreat voices and great minds in that effort. I know he will be helping \nus in this effort going forward, and I thank him for that.\n\n\n                             Carte Goodwin\n\n  Carte Goodwin served with us for a very brief period of time, but in \nthat time, we saw the incredible talent of this young Senator--his \nskill, his judgment, his ability to communicate with everyone in this \nSenate. He has been succeeded by another remarkable gentleman, Senator \nManchin, who is certainly keeping up the high standards of Senators \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Carte, good luck, and thank you for your service, and I know you will \ncontinue to serve the country.\n\n\n                               Judd Gregg\n\n  Senator Judd Gregg and Kathleen are stalwarts in the Senate, with \ntheir 18 years of service. I worked very closely with Judd on so many \nissues but most recently on the Dodd-Frank bill, where we worked \ncollaboratively on this whole complex concept of derivatives. I was \nimpressed with his intellect, his grasp, his balance, and I think we \nboth pushed ourselves to think harder, to do better, and to come up \nwith a solution, frankly, that was much better than I know I could have \ndone individually. So I thank Judd Gregg for what he did there and on \nso many other things.\n\n\n                              Ted Kaufman\n\n  My dear friend Ted Kaufman and Lynne. We traveled the world \ntogether--including Afghanistan multiple times. He served with such \ndistinction. He took up the effort to ensure that our securities \nmarkets in particular are well regulated, especially in regard to the \nnew phenomenon of high-frequency trading. And it is no coincidence that \njust this week, we had a hearing on high-frequency trading. Ted has not \nlet us forget that very critical issue for the future.\n\n\n                             George LeMieux\n\n  Senator George LeMieux and his wife Meike. Again, they served here \nfor a short period of time but with such distinction, such character, \nand such concern. I want to salute him. He and I worked together on the \nTeacher and Principal Improvement Act. He is a brilliant and a decent \ncivil servant. I thank him.\n\n\n                            Blanche Lincoln\n\n  Blanche Lincoln. Blanche and I served in the House together. She \ndecided to raise her family and then came back to the Senate. I can say \nwithout any hesitation that without her very courageous stand with \nrespect to some of the aspects of the Dodd-Frank financial legislation, \nit would not be as comprehensive, as effective as it is today. She \nstood up and essentially demanded that we create a structure where you \ncould trade derivatives rather than simply clear them. That is a \nremarkable achievement, and it is her achievement.\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Finally--and I beg the indulgence of my colleague from Vermont, who I \nknow is scheduled to speak--let me say to Arlen Specter and Joan \nSpecter, thank you for such service. Senator Specter is the champion of \nNIH. It is an incredible achievement, what he has done to fund that \nover the years.\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S8734, December 10, 2010, the Record reads: . . . over \nthe years.

Mr. President, I rise again to recognize the service of \nanother great Federal employee. This is a tradition that was started by \nour friend and former colleague, Senator Kaufman, and I am proud to \ncarry on that tradition. But I want to first say that I appreciate the \nremarks of the Presiding Officer about our colleagues who are leaving \nthis body, and I share his great respect for not only Senator Kaufman \nbut all of the colleagues who are leaving the body at the end of this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, oftentimes we forget that thousands of Federal \nemployees go to work every day with the sole mission of making this \ncountry a safer place to live. Ms. Deborah Autor is one of those \nemployees.\n  As we enter into the cold and flu season, there is great concern \nabout harmful medications that may fall into the hands of our children \nor other loved ones. As Director of the Food and Drug Administration's \nDrug Compliance Office, Ms. Autor works to protect public health by \nminimizing Americans' exposure to unsafe, ineffective, and poor-quality \ndrugs that enter the marketplace.\n  Ms. Autor is particularly focused on removing potentially dangerous \nprescription medicines, including cough medicines, anti-inflammatory \ndrugs, antihistamines, and migraine medications, just to name a few. \nUnder her leadership, the FDA has taken enforcement action to remove \nmore than 500 unapproved prescription drugs from the market. She is \nalso credited with designing a program used to identify unapproved \ndrugs, evaluate the public health consequences, and explore any \npotential legal challenges.\n  Many believe Ms. Autor is the brains behind the FDA's aggressive \nenforcement efforts. In conducting the research for these remarks, we \nfound a quote from Mr. Steven Galson, a former Acting U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral, and this is what he had to say about Ms. Autor:\n\n       She developed the program under budget constraints, \n     withstood scrutiny and criticism from some in the drug \n     industry and\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\n     Congress, successfully navigated the internal FDA process and \n     took aggressive action to clamp down on illegal drug \n     marketers.\n\n  There are many others who have sung her praises and highlighted her \ncommitment to public service.\n  Prior to work at the FDA, Ms. Autor was a trial attorney for the \nOffice of Consumer Litigation at the Department of Justice, where she \nserved for 7 years. In this role, she litigated civil and criminal \ncases on behalf of the FDA.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Ms. Autor for her \ndedicated public service and important contributions to our Nation's \nhealth and safety.\n  I would also add that in these challenging fiscal times, as we \napproach and go through the holiday season, I hope we all recognize the \nenormous contribution all of our Federal employees make. The Presiding \nOfficer many times reminds all of us of the enormous role our men and \nwomen in the armed services play, and our thoughts and prayers are with \nall of them. But I think it is also important to recognize these great \nFederal employees such as Ms. Autor and literally the countless others \nwho oftentimes--and sometimes at the disdain of folks in elective \noffice--are the folks who provide enormous public service to all \nAmericans. So I hope we keep them in our thoughts as well during this \nholiday season.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I also wish to thank my friend, the \nSenator from Vermont, who is a passionate advocate for trying to end \nthe growing income inequality in this country. I know he is going to be \nmaking some impassioned comments, and I appreciate his giving me a \ncouple of moments to recognize this Federal employee, and I look \nforward to hearing his comments.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8735-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8735-S8781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my friend from \nVirginia for doing what is very important. I think the essence of what \nhe is saying is that today there are millions of Federal employees, \npeople in the Armed Forces, who are doing the very best they can. In \nmany instances, they are doing a great job to protect our country, to \nkeep it safe. And very often, to be honest with you, these folks get \ndumped on. So it is important that people such as Senator Warner come \nhere and point out individuals who are doing a great job, people of \nwhom we are very proud. So I thank Senator Warner for that.\n  Mr. President, as I think everyone knows, President Obama and the \nRepublican leadership have reached an agreement on a very significant \ntax bill. In my view, the agreement they reached is a bad deal for the \nAmerican people. I think we can do better.\n  I am here today to take a strong stand against this bill, and I \nintend to tell my colleagues and the Nation exactly why I am in \nopposition to this bill. You can call what I am doing today whatever \nyou want. You can call it a filibuster. You can call it a very long \nspeech. I am not here to set any great records or to make a spectacle; \nI am simply here today to take as long as I can to explain to the \nAmerican people the fact that we have to do a lot better than this \nagreement provides.\n  Let me enumerate some of the reasons I am opposed to this agreement.\n  First, as everybody knows, this Nation has a recordbreaking $13.8 \ntrillion national debt at the same time as the middle class is \ncollapsing and poverty is increasing. And I think it is important to \nsay a word--because I am not necessarily sure a lot of Americans know \nthis--about how we got to where we are today in terms of the national \ndebt.\n  I know there are some people who think this all began the day \nPresident Obama took office. Well, that is not quite the case. When \nPresident Clinton left office, this country was running, in fact, a \nvery significant surplus, and the projections were that we were going \nto continue to run a surplus. During the 8 years of President Bush's \nadministration, for a number of reasons--the primary reasons being the \nwar in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, huge tax breaks for the wealthiest \npeople in this country, a Medicare Part D prescription drug program, \nthe Wall Street bailout, among other things, all of which were not paid \nfor--we saw an almost doubling of the national debt. Since President \nObama has been in office, we have passed a stimulus package which has \nalso added to the deficit and national debt.\n  But here we are today with a $13.8 trillion national debt, a $1.4 \ntrillion deficit, and almost all Americans are in agreement that this \nis a very serious issue. So the first point I would make is that it \nseems to me to be unconscionable--unconscionable--for my conservative \nfriends and for everybody else in this country to be driving up this \nalready too high national debt by giving tax breaks to millionaires and \nbillionaires who don't need it, and in a number of cases they don't \neven want it.\n  Here is one of the interesting ironies. There are lists of many very \nwealthy people who have come forward and said: Sure, I want a tax \nbreak. Everybody wants a tax break. But you know what, there are other \npriorities in this country, and I don't need it. Two of the wealthiest \npeople in the world--and these are billionaires--Bill Gates of \nMicrosoft and Warren Buffett of Berkshire, say: It is absurd. We don't \nneed a tax break.\n  All over the country, you hear a lot of folks who have a lot of money \nsaying: Don't drive up the deficit and force our kids to pay higher \ntaxes to pay off the national debt in order to give tax breaks to the \nrichest people in this country. We have been told not to worry too much \nbecause the extension of these tax breaks for the wealthy will only \nlast 2 years--not to worry. Maybe that is the case. But given the \npolitical reality I have seen in Washington, my guess is that 2 years \nfrom now these tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country \nwill be extended again. What happens around here is that the argument \nwill be made that if you end these tax breaks you are raising taxes. \nThat is what we are hearing right now. I see no reason why, in the \nmiddle of a Presidential election, those arguments will not be made \nagain and I see no reason not to believe that those tax breaks will be \nextended again.\n\n  (The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SANDERS. Clearly, we have a number of Republicans who want to \nmake that extension permanent. Whether it will ever be made permanent I \ndon't know. But the point is, when you hear folks say it is only a 2-\nyear extension, I suggest you take that with a grain of salt.\n  Let me say, if in fact we do what the Republicans have wanted to do \nright now as we enter this debate--they wanted a 10-year extension--\nthat would add $700 billion to our national debt. I have four kids and \nI have six grandchildren. None of them has a whole lot of money. I \nthink it is grossly unfair to ask my kids and grandchildren and the \nchildren all over this country to be paying higher taxes in order to \nprovide tax breaks for billionaires because we have driven up the \nnational debt. That is plain wrong. I think the vast majority of the \nAmerican people, whether they are progressives like myself or whether \nthey are conservatives, perceive that concept of giving tax breaks to \nbillionaires when we have such a high national debt makes no sense at \nall.\n  Furthermore, it is important to point out that extending income tax \nbreaks to the top 2 percent is not the only unfair tax proposal in this \nagreement. This agreement between the President and the Republican \nleadership also calls for a continuation of the Bush era 15-percent tax \nrate on capital gains and dividends, meaning that those people who make \ntheir living off their investments will continue to pay a substantially \nlower tax rate than firemen, teachers, nurses, carpenters, and \nvirtually all the other working people of this country. I do not think \nthat is fair. That is wrong. If this agreement were to be passed, we \nwould be continuing that unfair arrangement.\n  On top of all that, this agreement includes a horrendous proposal \nregarding the estate tax. That is a Teddy Roosevelt initiative. Teddy \nRoosevelt was talking about this in the early years of the 20th \ncentury. It was enacted in 1916 and it was enacted for a couple of \nreasons. Teddy Roosevelt and the people of that era thought it was \nwrong that a handful of people could have a huge\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nconcentration of wealth and then give that wealth, transmit that wealth \nto their children. He did not think that was right.\n  Furthermore, it was a source, a progressive and fair source, of \nrevenue. Under the agreement struck between the Republican leadership \nand the President, the estate tax rate, which was 55 percent under \nPresident Clinton--and let's all remember, we had problems with the \neconomy under President Clinton but very few will deny that during \nthose years we were creating a heck of a lot more jobs than we did \nunder President Bush. That is the fact--over 20 million jobs under \nPresident Clinton. We lost 600,000 private sector jobs under President \nBush. During the Clinton era, the tax rate on the estate tax was 55 \npercent. What this arrangement would do is lower that tax rate to 35 \npercent, with an exemption on the first $5 million of an individual's \nestate and $10 million for couples.\n  Here is the important point I think many people do not know. I have \nto confess my Republican friends and their pollsters and their language \npeople have done a very good job. This is the so-called death tax. I \nthink all over America people say this is terrible. I have $50,000 in \nthe bank and I want to leave that to my kids and the Government is \ngoing to take 55 percent of that, 35 percent of that. What an outrage.\n  Let us be very clear: This tax applies only--only--to the top three-\ntenths of 1 percent of American families; 99.7 percent of American \nfamilies will not pay one nickel in an estate tax. This is not a tax on \nthe rich, this is a tax on the very, very, very rich.\n  If my Republican friends had been successful in doing what they want \nto do, which is eliminate this estate tax completely, it would have \ncost our Treasury--raised the national debt by $1 trillion over a 10-\nyear period. Families such as the Walton family, of Wal-Mart fame, \nwould have received, just this one family, about a $30 billion tax \nbreak.\n  I find it hard to believe when we are talking about massive cuts in \nprograms for working families, when we have this huge national debt, \nthat anybody would be agreeing to lowering the estate tax rate to 35 \npercent. That is what this agreement does and I think that is a very \nbad idea.\n  Once again, while the agreement on the estate tax is for 2 years--\nonce again, there is very little doubt in my mind that the Republicans \nwill continue to push for lower and lower estate tax rates because that \nis what they want. I think Senator Kyl has been pretty clear about \nthis. They want to permanently repeal that tax. That is $1 trillion in \ntax breaks to the top three-tenths of 1 percent. I think we are down a \nbad path there and that is another reason why this agreement does not \nmake a whole lot of sense.\n  Third--and this is a very important point that I think has not yet \ngotten the attention it deserves--this agreement contains a payroll tax \nholiday which would cut $120 billion from Social Security payroll taxes \nfor workers. There are a lot of folks out there who say: This is pretty \ngood. I am a worker, my contribution will go from 6.2 percent today \ndown to 4.2 percent. I will have more money in my paycheck. It is a \ngood idea.\n  Let's take a deep breath and let's think about it for a second and \nunderstand what this whole thing is about. This payroll tax holiday \nconcept, as I understand it, originally started with conservative \nRepublicans. I know the Vice President recently made the point this was \noriginally a Republican idea. Why did the Republicans come up with this \nidea? These are exactly the same people who do not believe in Social \nSecurity. These are the same people who either want to make significant \ncuts in Social Security or else they want to privatize Social Security \nentirely. Here is the point: They understand that if we divert funding \nthat is supposed to go into the Social Security trust fund, which is \nwhat this payroll tax holiday does, this is money that goes into the \nSocial Security trust fund that is now being diverted, cut back, in \norder to provide financial support for workers--but that is a lot of \nmoney not going into the trust fund.\n  What the President and others are saying is not to worry because that \nmoney will be covered by the general fund. That is a very bad and \ndangerous precedent. Up until now, what Social Security has been about \nis 100 percent funding from payroll contributions, not from the general \ntax base. Once again, this is a 1-year program. The loss of revenue \ngoing into Social Security can be covered by the general fund. But we \nhave a $13 trillion national debt. How much longer will the general \nfund put money into Social Security? Is it a good idea for the general \nfund to be doing that?\n  I would argue this is not a good idea. This is a very dangerous step \nforward for those of us who believe in Social Security. But this is not \njust Bernie Sanders saying this. One of the more effective and I think \nimportant senior groups in America is called the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare. I don't know exactly how many \nbut they have many members all over this country. I know they are \nactive in the State of Vermont. I want to read to you from a press \nrelease they sent out the other day. This is the headline on it, from \nthe National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare: \n``Cutting Contributions to Social Security Signals the Beginning of the \nEnd. Payroll Tax Holiday Is Anything But.''\n  This is what they say. This comes from Barbara Kennelly. Barbara came \nfrom the House of Representatives. I have known her for years. She is \nnow the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare, one of the strong senior groups in the country.\n  Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the current \neconomic crisis, it has been bartered in a deal that provides deficit-\nbusting tax cuts for the wealthy. Diverting $120 billion in Social \nSecurity contributions for a so-called ``tax holiday'' may sound like a \ngood deal for workers now, but it's bad business for the program that a \nmajority of middle-class seniors will rely upon in the future.\n  That is what the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare says about that agreement and I agree with them. For all of us \nwho understand that Social Security is life and death for tens of \nmillions of Americans today and will be vitally important for working \npeople as they reach retirement age, it is important that we understand \nthat Social Security has done a great job. A few minutes ago the \nPresiding Officer was on the floor talking about the strong work that \nour Federal employees do, and he is absolutely right. Sometimes we also \ntake for granted that Social Security has been an enormous success. It \nhas done exactly what those people who created it have wanted it to \ndo--nothing more, nothing less. It has succeeded. It has taken millions \nof seniors out of poverty and given them an element of security. It has \nalso helped people with disabilities maintain their dignity. Widows and \norphans are also getting help.\n  For 75 years it has worked well. It has a $2.6 trillion surplus today \nand it can pay out benefits for the next 29 years. It is strong. We \nwant to make it stronger. This payroll tax holiday I am afraid is a \nstep very much in the wrong direction and that is one of the important \nreasons why this agreement between the President and the Republicans \nshould be defeated.\n  Included in the agreement are a number of business tax cuts. I am not \ngoing to be here to say that some of them may not work. Some of them \nmay work. Some will work better than others. There is a whole list of \nthem. But this is what I will say. Economists on both ends of the \npolitical spectrum believe that if we are serious about addressing the \nhorrendous economic crisis we are in now, 9.8 percent unemployment, \nthere are far more effective ways of creating the jobs we have to \ncreate than those tax proposals. With corporate America already sitting \non close to $2 trillion cash on hand, it is not that our friends in \ncorporate America don't have any money, we have to help them. They have \n$2 trillion cash on hand. The problem is not in my view that corporate \ntaxes are too high; it is that the middle class simply doesn't have the \nmoney to purchase the goods and products that make our economy go and \ncreate jobs.\n  I think if our goal is to create the millions and millions of jobs we \nneed, and if our goal is to make our country stronger internationally \nin a very tough global economy, I would much prefer, and I think most \neconomists\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nwould agree with me that a better way to do that, to create the \nmillions of jobs we have to create, is to invest heavily in our \ninfrastructure.\n  The truth is--and I don't think anyone disputes this, the \ninfrastructure in the United States is crumbling, and I will go into \nmore detail about that later.\n  I have some very good information on it. But you do not have to be a \ncivil engineer to know that. All you have to do is get in your car \ntoday and drive someplace in my State and all over this country. What \nyou are going to see are roads that are in disrepair. You are going to \nsee bridges that, in some cases, have actually been shut down. You are \ngoing to see water systems--I remember I was in Rutland, VT, the second \nor third largest city in the State of Vermont, and the mayor showed me \na piece of pipe, an old piece of pipe.\n  He said: You know, the engineer who helped develop this water system \nand lay this pipe, after he did this work for Rutland, he went off to \nfight in the war.\n  I knew there was a catch line coming. I said: What war was it?\n  He said: It was the Civil War.\n  So you are talking about water pipe being in Rutland, VT--and this is \ntrue all over the United States--laid in the Civil War. The result is, \nwe lose an enormous amount of clean water every day through leaks and \nwater pipes bursting all over the United States of America.\n  Well, we can put people to work improving our water systems, our \nwastewater plants. It is a very expensive proposition to develop a good \nwastewater plant. I was a mayor, you were a Governor, Mr. President. It \nis an expensive proposition for roads, bridges. Furthermore, I do not \nhave to tell anybody here, our rail system, which used to be the \ngreatest rail system in the world, is now falling way behind every \nother major country on Earth.\n  As a result of the stimulus package, we did a whole lot of very good \nthings in the State of Vermont. One of the things we were able to do \nwas use $50 million of Federal funds and private money to make major \nrepair on one of our important railways in the State.\n  But we remain far behind most other countries around the \nindustrialized world. China is exploding in terms of the number of \nhigh-speed rail lines they have. We have to do better. Our airports \nneed work. Our air controllers need to be updated in terms of the \ntechnology they have and use to make our flights safe.\n  The point is, what most economists would tell you is when you invest \nin infrastructure, you get a bigger bang for the buck. You create more \njobs for your investment than, in most instances, giving a variety of \ntax breaks to the corporate world.\n  Second of all, and not unimportantly, when you invest in \ninfrastructure, you are improving the future of this country. You are \nmaking us more productive. It is not just creating jobs, it is creating \njobs for very specific purposes, which makes our Nation more productive \nand efficient.\n  Thirdly, let me tell you something. As a former mayor, infrastructure \ndoes not get better if you ignore it. You can turn your back, if you \nare a mayor or Governor, on the roads and the highways because you do \nnot have the money to fix them today, but they are not going to get \nbetter next year. At some point, they are going to have to be repaired \nand fixed. We may as well do that right now.\n  So I believe the money, the very substantial sums of money in this \nagreement between the President and the Republicans, which goes into \ntax breaks for corporate America, could be effectively spent on \ninfrastructure.\n  The fifth point I want to make in opposition to this agreement and \nwhat we have heard from the President and others is that this is a \ncompromise. You cannot get everything you want. Well, you cannot get \neverything you want around here is true, but one of the examples of \ncompromise is an extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months.\n  Well, let me be very clear. In the midst of a serious and major \nrecession, at a time when millions of our fellow Americans are not only \nout of work through no fault of their own, but they have been out of \nwork for a very long time, it would be, in my view, immoral and wrong \nto turn our backs on those workers. Their unemployment benefits are \ngoing to be running out soon. It is absolutely imperative that we \nextend those unemployment benefits for the 2 million workers who would \nlose them.\n  But here is the point I want to make. Some people say this is a \ncompromise. Well, the Republicans gave on unemployment; the President \ngave on extending tax breaks for the rich, et cetera. But here is the \npoint. I do not believe, honestly, that the Republican support now for \nextending unemployment benefits constitutes much of a compromise \nbecause the truth is, for the past 40 years, under both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations, under the leadership in the Senate and the \nHouse of Democrats or Republicans, it has been bipartisan policy that \nwhenever the unemployment rate has been above 7.2 percent, unemployment \ninsurance has always been extended. So what we have had is \nlongstanding, bipartisan policy. That is what we have always done. That \nis what we should be doing in the future. I do not regard Republicans \nnow supporting what their party has always supported, extending \nunemployment benefits when unemployment becomes very high--I do not see \nthat as a compromise. I see that as what has been going on in this \ncountry and in the Senate for four decades.\n  I have talked about the negative aspects of this proposal. But I am \ngoing to be the first to admit that, of course, there are positive and \ngood agreements in this. And what are they? What are some of the \npositive aspects of this agreement? Let me just tick them off.\n  No. 1, I believe very strongly, and I know the President does, it is \nabsolutely imperative that we extend middle-class tax cuts for 98 \npercent of the American people. I do not think there has been any \ndebate about that.\n  When median family income has gone down by over $2,000 during the \nBush years, when millions of our people today are working longer hours \nfor low wages, when people cannot afford to send their kids to college \nor to take care of childcare, I think it makes absolute sense. I do not \nthink anyone will argue it is absolutely imperative that we extend \nmiddle-class tax cuts. That is what this provision does. That is the \nright thing.\n  Furthermore, in this agreement we have an extension of the earned-\nincome tax credit for working Americans, and the child and college tax \ncredit are also in there. Every one of these agreements is very \nimportant. These programs will keep millions of Americans from slipping \nout of the middle class and into poverty. They will allow millions of \nAmericans to send their kids to college.\n  So I am not here to say there is not anything of value in this \nagreement between the President and the Republicans. There are, and we \nhave to fight to make sure all of those programs remain in the final \npackage when it is passed--when the final package is passed. But when \nwe look at the overall agreement, we must put it in a broader context; \nthat is, what will the passage of this legislation mean for the future \nof our country?\n  In that area, if you look at it in that context, I think the evidence \nis pretty strong it is not just a good agreement and not something that \nshould be passed. The passage of this agreement would mean we would \ncontinue the Bush policy of trickle-down economics for at least 2 more \nyears. That is not a good thing to do because, I think, as most \nAmericans know, that philosophy, that economic approach, simply did not \nwork. The evidence is quite overwhelming. I do not think there is much \ndebate, when median family income during Bush's 8 years goes down by \n$2,200, when we end up losing over 600,000 private sector jobs, and all \nof the job growth was in the Federal level, I do not see how anybody \nwould want to continue that philosophy. But that, in essence, is what \nwill happen if this agreement is passed.\n  Now, I want to make another point about what happens if--if, and I \nwill do my best to prevent this from happening--but what would happen \nif this agreement would pass? Does anybody seriously believe our \nRepublican colleagues would then say: OK, well, we have an extension of \ntax breaks for the very richest people. We have lowered the tax rate on \nthe estate tax. Those are good victories for millionaires and\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nbillionaires. We are going to go home now. We are not going to continue \nthe fight.\n  I do not think so. We are already hearing sounds about where our \nRepublican friends want to go. The President put together what I \nthought was a very poor deficit reduction commission. I thought the \nfolks on it were not reflective of the American people. I thought there \nwas very much a big business, corporate partiality there.\n  The initiatives that came out of that commission--which, fortunately, \ndid not get the 14 votes they needed--suggest to me that those of us \nwho are concerned about protecting the needs of the middle class and \nworking families are going to have to push back pretty hard for what is \ncoming down the pike.\n  I think what we will be seeing is--if this proposal negotiated \nbetween the President and the Republicans is passed, what you will be \nseeing within a few months are folks coming on the floor of the Senate, \nand this is what they will say: You know what. The deficit is high. The \nnational debt is too high. And, yes--oh, yes--we drove the national \ndebt up by giving tax breaks to millionaires. That is the way it goes. \nBut we are going to have to deal with our national debt.\n  The Republicans will tell you: Oh, we have a great plan to deal with \nit. We are giving tax breaks to millionaires. But now what we are going \nto have to do is start making deep cuts in Social Security, and that \ndeficit reduction commission started paving the way for that, very \nsubstantial cuts in Social Security.\n  Maybe we will have to raise the retirement age in Social Security to \n69 or 70. Maybe we will have to make cuts in Medicare. Maybe we will \nhave to make cuts in Medicaid. I think we are beginning to see, in the \nState of Arizona now, what goes on when you make deep cuts in Medicaid.\n  In Arizona right now there are people who are in line who need \ntransplants, who will die if they do not get transplants, as a result \nof legislation they passed there. They are saying to people, young \npeople: Sorry, we cannot afford to give you a transplant, and you are \ngoing to have to die.\n  Well, is that what we are looking forward to saying all over America? \nI certainly will do everything I can to prevent that.\n  We are certainly going to see a tax on environmental protection, on \neducation. Some of us believe if this country is going to prosper and \nsucceed in the global economy, we have to have the best educational \nsystem in the world from childcare through college.\n  Right now, it is extremely difficult for middle-class families to \nsend their kids to college. Does anyone have any doubt whatsoever that \nour Republican friends are not going to come back here and say: Oh, we \ncannot afford to raise Pell Grants as we have in recent years. We \ncannot afford to support working families who have their kids in \nchildcare. Cut. Cut. Cut.\n  That is insanity. I am being honest about it. So I would suggest \ntheir argument is that we have a high deficit and a high national debt; \nthat if we pass this agreement and the national debt goes higher, it \nonly gives them more impetus to go forward to cut programs that benefit \nworking families and the middle class.\n  Let me also say there is no doubt in my mind what many--not all but \nmany--of my Republican colleagues want to do; that is, they want to \nmove this country back into the 1920s when essentially we had an \neconomic and political system which was controlled by big money \ninterests; where working people and the middle class had no programs to \nsustain them when things got bad, when they got old, and when they got \nsick; when labor unions were very hard to come by because of antiworker \nlegislation. That is what they want. They do not believe in things like \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. They do not believe in things like \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal aid to education. That is \nthe fight we will be waging.\n  I think to surrender on this issue is to simply say we are going to \nbe waging fight after fight, starting within a couple of months.\n  President Obama has said he fought as hard as he could against the \nRepublican tax breaks for the wealthy and for an extension in \nunemployment. Well, maybe. But the reality is that fight cannot simply \nbe waged inside the Beltway. Our job is to appeal to the vast majority \nof the American people to stand up and to say: Wait a minute. I do not \nwant to see our national debt explode. I do not want to see my kids and \ngrandchildren paying higher taxes in order to give tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  The vast majority of the American people do not support that \nagreement in terms of giving tax breaks to the very rich. Our job is to \nrally those people. I would like very much to see the American people \nsaying to our Republican colleagues and some Democratic colleagues: \nExcuse me. Don't force my kids to have a lower standard of living in \norder to give tax breaks to the richest people.\n  What the President and all of us should be doing is going out and \nsaying to those people: Call the Members of the Senate, call the \nMembers of the House and say: Excuse me. How about representing the \nmiddle class and working families, for a change, rather than the \nwealthiest people. That is what democracy is about.\n  This fight is not going to be won inside the beltway in a Senate \ndebate. It is going to be won when the American people stand and say: \nWait a second. We cannot continue to give tax breaks to people who are \ndoing phenomenally well right now. We cannot give tax breaks to the \nrich when we already have the most unequal distribution of income of \nany major country on Earth. The top 1 percent earns 23 percent of all \nincome in America, more than the bottom 50 percent. They don't need \nmore tax breaks to be paid for by our kids and grandchildren.\n  The vast majority of people are behind us on this issue, but they \nhave to make their voices heard to their Senators, to their \nCongressmen. When they do, I believe we can come forward with an \nagreement which protects the middle-class and working families and is \nnot a boondoggle for the wealthiest people.\n  It is important to put the agreement the President struck with \nRepublicans in a broader context. We can't just look at the agreement \nunto itself. We have to look at it within the context of what is going \non in the country today, both economically and politically. I think I \nspeak for millions of Americans. There is a war going on in this \ncountry. I am not referring to the war in Iraq or the war in \nAfghanistan. I am talking about a war being waged by some of the \nwealthiest and most powerful people against working families, against \nthe disappearing and shrinking middle class of our country. The \nbillionaires of America are on the warpath. They want more and more and \nmore. That has everything to do with this agreement reached between \nRepublicans and the President.\n  In 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners made 23.5 percent of \nall income. Let me repeat that: The top 1 percent earned over 23 \npercent of all income; that is, more than the bottom 50 percent. One \npercent here; fifty percent here. But for the very wealthy, that is \napparently not enough. The percentage of income going to the top 1 \npercent nearly tripled since the 1970s. All over this country people \nare angry, frustrated. It is true in Vermont. I am sure it is true in \nVirginia. It is true all over America. But one of the reasons people \nare angry and frustrated is they are working incredibly hard. In \nVermont, I can tell my colleagues, there are people who don't work one \njob, two jobs; there are people working three jobs and four jobs, \ntrying to cobble together an income in order to support their families. \nI suspect that goes on all across the country. While people are working \nharder and harder, in many cases their income is going down. The fact \nis, 80 percent of all new income earned from 1980 to 2005 has gone to \nthe top 1 percent. Let me repeat that because that is an important \nfact. It explains why the American people are feeling as angry as they \nare. They are working hard, but they are not going anyplace. In some \ncases, in many cases, their standard of living is actually going down. \nEighty percent of all income in recent years has gone to the top 1 \npercent. The richer people become much richer, the middle class \nshrinks. Millions of Americans fall out of the middle class and into \npoverty.\n  That is not apparently enough for our friends at the top who have a \nreligious ferocity in terms of greed. They\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nneed more, more. It is similar to an addiction. Fifty million is not \nenough. They need $100 million. One hundred million is not enough; they \nneed 1 billion. One billion is not enough. I am not quite sure how much \nthey need. When will it stop?\n  Today, in terms of wealth as opposed to income, the top 1 percent now \nowns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. When we went to school, we \nused to read in the textbooks about Latin America, and they used to \nrefer to some of the countries there as ``banana republics,'' countries \nin which a handful of families controlled the economic and political \nlife of the nation. I don't wish to upset the American people, but we \nare not all that far away from that reality today. The top 1 percent \nhas seen a tripling of the percentage of income they earn. Since the \n1970s, the top 1 percent owning 23 percent of all income, more than the \nbottom 50 percent. The top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the \nbottom 90 percent. That is not the foundation of a democratic society. \nThat is the foundation for an oligarchic society. The rich get richer. \nThe middle class shrinks. Poverty increases. Apparently, God is not \ngood enough yet for some of the richest people.\n  I say ``some of the richest'' because there are a lot of folks with a \nlot of money who do love this country, they are not into greed, but \nthere are some who are. More, more more, that is what they need.\n  For example--this galls me and galls many of the people in this \ncountry--the horrendous recession we are in right now, where millions \nand millions of people have lost their jobs, their savings, their \nhomes, this recession was caused by the greed and recklessness and \nillegal behavior on Wall Street. These guys, through their greed, \ncreated the most severe economic recession since the Great Depression. \nThe American people bailed them out. Now, 2 years after the bailout, \nthey are giving themselves more compensation than they ever have. They \nare saying to the American people: Sorry we caused this recession \nbecause of our greed. Sorry you are unemployed. Sorry you lost your \nhouse. But that is not all that important. What is important is that I, \non Wall Street, continue to get millions of dollars in compensation and \nin bonuses, that I have big parties. How can I get by on one house? I \nneed 5 houses, 10 houses. I need three jet planes to take me all over \nthe world. Sorry. We have the money. We have the power. We have the \nlobbyists here on Wall Street. Tough luck. That is the world, get used \nto it.\n  The rich get richer. The middle class shrinks. Not enough, not \nenough. The very rich seem to want more and more and more, and they are \nprepared to dismantle the existing political and social order in order \nto get it. So we have the economics and distribution of income and \nwealth as one thing, but then we must discuss politics.\n  What happened last year, as I think most Americans know, is the \nSupreme Court made a very strange decision. The Supreme Court decided \nthat corporations are people and they have the right of free speech and \nthe right without disclosure--all of this is through the Citizens \nUnited Supreme Court decision--to put as much money as they want into \ncampaigns all over the country. In this last campaign, that is what we \nsaw: Billionaires, in secret, pouring money into campaigns all over the \ncountry. Does that sound like democracy to anybody in America; that we \nhave a handful of billionaires probably dividing up the country? I will \nput this amount in Virginia, California, wherever.\n  That is what they were able to do. The rich get richer, and they \ndon't sit on this money. What they then do is use it to elect people \nwho support them and to unelect people who oppose their agenda and they \nuse their political power to get legislation passed which makes the \nwealthy even wealthier.\n  One of the manifestations of that is, in fact, the agreement reached \nbetween the President and the Republican leadership. The wealthy \ncontribute huge sums of money into campaigns. The wealthy have all \nkinds of lobbyists around here through corporate America. What they are \ngoing to get out of this agreement are huge tax breaks that benefit \nthemselves. That is not what we should be supporting.\n  We should understand this agreement is just the beginning of an \nassault on legislation and programs that have benefited the American \npeople for 70 or 80 years. Mark my words, there will be an intensive \neffort to privatize Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. \nFurthermore, it is part of the Republican agenda. They want to expand--\nand it is not only Republicans here, some Democrats as well--our \ndisastrous trade policies so large companies can continue their efforts \nto outsource American jobs to China and other low-wage countries. Any \nobjective analysis of our trade policies has shown it has been a \ngrotesque failure for ordinary Americans. It is hard to calculate \nexactly, but I think it is fair to say we have lost millions of decent-\npaying jobs. During the Bush years alone, some 48,000 factories shut \ndown. We went from 19 million manufacturing jobs to 12 million \nmanufacturing jobs. Historically, in this country, manufacturing jobs \nwere the backbone of the working class. That is how people made it into \nthe middle class. That is how they had decent health care benefits and \npensions. Every day we are seeing those jobs disappear because \ncorporate America would prefer to do business in China or other low-\nwage countries.\n  I returned from a trip to Vietnam last year, a beautiful country. \nPeople there work for 25, 30 cents an hour. Sometimes when you go to a \nstore, you may see a shirt made in Bangladesh. That shirt, in all \nlikelihood, is made by a young girl who came in from the countryside to \none of the factories there. The good news is that in Bangladesh, the \nminimum wage was doubled. It went from 11 cents an hour to 23 cents an \nhour. Are American workers going to be able to compete against \ndesperate people who make 23 cents an hour?\n\n  So my view--and I think it reflects the views of the American \npeople--is that of course we want to see the people of Bangladesh and \nthe people of China do well. But they do not have to do well at the \nexpense of the American middle class. We do not have to engage in a \nrace to the bottom. Our goal is to bring them up, not us down. But one \nof the results of our disastrous trade policies is that in many \ninstances wages in the United States have gone down.\n  I believe in the coming months you are going to see an \nintensification of efforts to expand unfettered free trade. I think \nthat will be a continuation of a disastrous policy for American \nworkers.\n  Let me personalize this a little bit. This gentleman, shown in this \npicture I have in the Chamber--I have no personal animus toward him at \nall; I think I met him once in a large room. His name is James Dimon. \nHe is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Over the past 5 years, Mr. Dimon, who \nis the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, received $89 million in total \ncompensation--a bank that we now know received hundreds of billions in \nlow-interest loans and other financial assistance from the Federal \nReserve and the Treasury Department.\n  So Mr. Dimon received $89 million in total compensation. His bank was \nbailed out big time by the taxpayers. But under the legislation the \nPresident negotiated with the Republicans, Mr. Dimon--I use him just as \none example for thousands; nothing personal to Mr. Dimon--will receive \n$1.1 million in tax breaks. So $1.1 million in tax breaks for a major \nCEO on Wall Street, who over the last 5 years received $89 million in \ntotal compensation.\n  Meanwhile--just to contrast what is going on here--2 days ago, I \nbrought before the Senate legislation which would provide a $250 one-\ntime check to over 50 million seniors and disabled veterans, who for \nthe last 2 years have not received a COLA on their Social Security. \nMany of those seniors and disabled vets are trying to get by on \n$14,000, $15,000, $18,000 a year. The total package for that bill was \napproximately $14 billion that would go out to over 50 million seniors \nand disabled vets. We won that vote on the floor of the Senate 53 to \n45. But just because you get 53 votes in the Senate does not mean you \nwin. Because the Republicans filibustered, I needed 60 votes. I could \nnot get 60 votes. I could not get one Republican vote to provide a $250 \ncheck to a disabled veteran trying to get by on $15,000 or $16,000 a \nyear.\n  But Mr. Dimon, who made $89 million in the last 5 years, will get a \n$1 million tax deduction if this agreement is passed. Now, that may \nmake sense to\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\nsome people. It does not make a lot of sense to me.\n  Again, I have no particular knowledge, animus--I do not know if I \never met John Mack in my life. He is the CEO of Morgan Stanley. In \n2006, he received a $40 million bonus, which at the time was the \nlargest bonus ever given to a Wall Street executive.\n  Two years after receiving this bonus, Morgan Stanley received some $2 \ntrillion in low-interest loans and billions from the Treasury \nDepartment. Instead of losing his job, under this agreement, Mr. Mack \nwill be receiving an estimated $926,000 tax break next year. \nCongratulations, Mr. Mack. You are doing fine. We could not get $250 \nfor a disabled vet.\n  Over the past 5 years, Ken Lewis, the former CEO of Bank of America, \nreceived over $165 million in total compensation. In 2008, Bank of \nAmerica received hundreds of billions in taxpayer-backed loans from the \nFed and a $45 billion bailout from the Treasury Department.\n  What will Mr. Lewis receive if the agreement negotiated between the \nPresident and the Republicans goes forth? He will get a $713,000 tax \ncut.\n  And on and on it goes. I did not mean to specifically pick on these \nguys. Some of the wealthiest people in the country will be receiving a \nmillion-dollar-plus tax break. So we as a nation have to decide whether \nthat makes a lot of sense. I think it does not.\n  Let me mention that a couple weeks ago the Fed, the Federal Reserve, \npublished on their Web site some 21,000 transactions that took place \nduring the Wall Street meltdown period. That disclosure was made \npossible as part of a provision that I put into the financial reform \nbill because I thought it was important the American people, for the \nfirst time, lift the veil of secrecy at the Fed and get a sense of the \nkind of money that was lent out by the Fed and who received that money.\n  What is very interesting is that the American people and the media \nhave focused on the $700 billion Wall Street bailout now known as TARP. \nI happen to have voted against that agreement, but, in fairness, that \nagreement was pretty transparent. The Treasury Department put up on \ntheir Web site all of those banks and financial institutions that \nreceived the money. If you want to know where the money went, it is \nright up there on the Treasury Department's Web site.\n  But at the same time, a bigger transaction than TARP was taking \nplace, which got relatively little attention, and that was the role the \nFed was playing in terms of the Wall Street bailout.\n  While the TARP issue was being debated during that period, Ben \nBernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Tim Geithner, who was \nthen the president of the New York Fed, and a handful of other very \npowerful people were sitting behind closed doors getting ready to lend \nout trillions--underline trillions--of taxpayer dollars to large \nfinancial institutions and corporations, with no debate going on in \nCongress, no debate whatsoever.\n  On March 3, 2009--and I am a member of the Senate Budget Committee--I \nasked the Fed Chairman, Mr. Bernanke, to tell the American people the \nnames of the financial institutions that received this unprecedented \nbackdoor bailout from the Fed, how much they received, and the exact \nterms of this assistance. I will never forget that. I asked Mr. \nBernanke for that information. He said: Senator, no, not going to give \nit to you, not going to make it public.\n  Well, on that day, I introduced legislation to make that information \npublic, working with a number of Members of the House and the Senate. \nSome strange bedfellows--conservatives and progressives--came together \non this issue. We managed to get in the Wall Street reform bill a \ndisclosure provision, and on December 1--last week--that information \nwas made public. Let me talk a little bit about what was in that \ninformation made public by the Fed.\n  After years of stonewalling, the American people have learned the \nincredible, jaw-dropping details of the Fed's multimillion-dollar \nbailout of Wall Street and corporate America--not just Wall Street. It \nis one of the things we learned. As a result of this disclosure, in my \nview--we are going to get into what was in what we learned--Congress \nhas to take a very extensive look at all aspects of how the Federal \nReserve functions and how we can make our financial institutions more \nresponsive to the needs of ordinary Americans and small businesses.\n  What have we learned from the disclosure of December 1? This is based \non an examination of over 21,000 separate Federal Reserve transactions. \nMore work, more research needs to be done. But this is what we have \nlearned so far.\n  As it turns out, while small business owners in the State of Vermont \nand throughout this country were being turned down for loans, not only \ndid large financial institutions--and I am talking about every major \nfinancial institution--receive substantial help from the Fed, but also \nsome of the largest corporations in this country--not financial \ninstitutions--also received help in terms of very low interest loans.\n  So you have every major financial institution, you have some of our \nlargest private corporations, but here is something we also learned, \nand that is that this bailout impacted not just American banks and \ncorporations but also foreign banks and foreign corporations as well, \nto the tune of many billions of dollars.\n  Then, on top of that, a number of the wealthiest individuals in this \ncountry also received a major bailout from the Fed. The ``emergency \nresponse,'' which is what the Fed described their action as during the \nWall Street collapse, appears to any objective observer to have been \nthe clearest case that I can imagine of socialism for the very rich and \nrugged free market capitalism for everybody else.\n  In other words, if you are a huge financial institution, whose \nrecklessness and greed caused this great recession, no problem. You are \ngoing to receive a substantial amount of help from the taxpayers of \nthis country. If you are a major American corporation, such as General \nElectric or McDonald's or Caterpillar or Harley-Davidson or Verizon, no \nproblem. You are going to receive a major handout from the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  But if you are a small business in Vermont or California or Virginia, \nwell, guess what, you are on your own because right now we know one of \nthe real impediments to the kind of job creation we need in this \ncountry is that small businesses are not getting the loans they need.\n  Furthermore, what we now know is the extent of the bailout for the \nlarge financial corporations. Goldman Sachs received nearly $600 \nbillion. Morgan Stanley received nearly $2 trillion. Citigroup received \n$1.8 trillion. Bear Stearns received nearly $1 trillion. And Merrill \nLynch received some $1.5 trillion in short-term loans from the Fed.\n  But I think what is most surprising for the American people is not \njust the bailout of Wall Street and the financial institutions, and the \nbailout of large American corporations such as General Electric, but I \nthink the American people would find it very strange that at a time \nwhen the American automobile sector was on the verge of collapse--and \ngoodness only knows how many thousands and thousands of jobs we have \nlost in automobile manufacturing in this country--the Federal Reserve \nwas also bailing out Toyota and Mitsubishi, two Japanese carmakers, by \npurchasing nearly $5 billion worth of their commercial paper from \nNovember 5, 2008, through January 30, 2009. While virtually no \nAmerican-made cars or products of any kind are bought in Japan, I think \nthe American people would be shocked to learn that the Fed extended \nover $380 billion to the Central Bank of Japan to bail out banks in \nthat country.\n\n  Furthermore, I think the American people are interested to know that \nthe Fed bailed out the Korea Development Bank, the wholly owned, state-\nowned Bank of South Korea, by purchasing over $2 billion of its \ncommercial paper. The sole purpose of the Korea Development Bank is to \nfinance and manage major industrial projects to enhance the national \neconomy not of the United States of America but of South Korea. I am \nnot against South Korea. I wish the South Koreans all the luck in the \nworld. But it should not be the taxpayers of the United States lending \ntheir banks' money to create jobs in South Korea. I would suggest maybe \nwe want to create jobs in the United States of America. At the same \ntime, the Fed also extended over $40 billion\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\nfor the Central Bank of South Korea so that it had enough money to bail \nout its own banks.\n  At a time when small businesses in Vermont and all over this country \ncannot get the loans they need to expand their businesses, I think the \nAmerican people would find it extremely--I don't know what the word \nis--maybe amusing that the Fed bailed out the state-owned Bank of \nBavaria--not Pennsylvania, not California, but Bavaria--by purchasing \nover $2.2 billion of its commercial paper.\n  Furthermore, when we cannot get support on the floor of this Senate \nto extend unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who are on the \nverge of seeing them expire, I think the American people would find it \nincomprehensible that the Fed chose to bail out the Arab Banking \nCorporation based in Bahrain by providing them with over $23 billion in \nloans with an interest rate as low as one-quarter of 1 percent. So \nsmall businessmen all over America: Maybe you have to run to Bahrain \nand work with the Arab Banking Corporation there to get some pretty \ngood loans. But it would be nice if maybe the Fed would start to pay \nattention to banks in this country.\n  Furthermore, the Fed extended over $9.6 billion to the Central Bank \nof Mexico.\n  What is interesting about all of this is that we had a very vigorous \ndebate here in the Senate and in the House over the $700 billion TARP \nprogram. Every person in America could turn on C-SPAN and hear that \ndebate. They could hear what President Bush had to say, hear what then-\nSenator Obama and Senator McCain had to say. It was all pretty public. \nBut what took place at the Fed, which, in fact, amounted to a larger \nbailout, was done behind closed doors. Over $3 trillion was lent with \nzero transparency. In fact, as a result of this recent disclosure--this \nis the first time we have gotten a glimpse of the magnitude and the \nparticulars, the specificities of where that money was lent, and I \nthink this is not a good thing for this country. Again, I voted against \nthe bailout of Wall Street, but the debate was open and public. People \nwrote to their Senators and called their Senators. That is called \ndemocracy. After the TARP bailout took place, all of the loans were put \nup on the Web site. Transparency--the American people knew who got the \nmoney. But the actions of the Fed were done behind closed doors, and, \nin my view--it is an issue we are studying right now--I think there \nwere significant conflicts of interest. I think we had people sitting \nthere at the New York Fed who were beneficiaries of this bailout, and \nthat is an issue we need to explore. I should tell my colleagues that \nas part of the provision we got into the financial reform bill, the GAO \nis, in fact, doing just that--investigating possible conflicts of \ninterest at the Fed with regard to this bailout.\n  I think the question the American people are asking as they read \nabout what the Fed did during the financial crisis is whether the Fed \nhas now become the central bank of the world without any debate on the \nfloor of the Senate or the Congress and without the knowledge of the \nAmerican people. I think that is wrong. So I hope, out of this effort \nin bringing disclosure and transparency to the Fed, that one of the \nthings that will come will be more transparency at the Fed.\n  As I indicated a moment ago, the Fed said this bailout was necessary \nin order to prevent the world economy from going over a cliff. But 3 \nyears after the start of the recession, millions of Americans remain \nunemployed and have lost their homes, their life savings, and their \nability to send their kids to college. Meanwhile, huge banks and large \ncorporations have returned to making incredible profits and paying \ntheir executives recordbreaking compensation packages, as if the \nfinancial crisis they started never occurred.\n  What this recent disclosure tells us, among many other things, is \nthat despite this huge taxpayer bailout, the Fed did not make the \nappropriate demands on these financial institutions which would have \nbeen necessary to rebuild our economy and protect the needs of ordinary \nAmericans. In other words, what they simply did was give out billions \nand billions of dollars which were used in the self-interests of these \nfinancial institutions rather than saying: The American people who are \nhurting are bailing you out, and now that they have bailed you out, \nyour responsibility is to do what you can to create jobs and to improve \nthe standard of living of the people, many of whose lives you have \nseverely impacted.\n  Let me give a few examples of what could have been done and what \nshould be done. At a time when big banks have nearly $1 trillion in \nexcess reserves parked at the Fed, the Fed has not required these \ninstitutions to increase lending to small and medium-sized businesses \nas a condition of the bailout. In other words, instead of the Fed just \ngiving money to these financial institutions, the Fed should have said: \nWe are giving you this money in order to get it into the economy. Start \nproviding affordable loans to small businesses.\n  At a time when large corporations are more profitable than ever, the \nFed did not demand that corporations that received this backdoor \nbailout create jobs and expand the economy once they returned to \nprofitability. So what is going on in America? Unemployment is \nofficially at 9.8 percent and in a real sense probably at 15 or 16 \npercent, but Wall Street is now doing fine.\n  A few years ago, Wall Street earned some 40 percent of all profits in \nAmerica, and they are doing great. But what the Fed should have done \nand should do now is to tell Wall Street: You are part of the economy. \nYou are not an isolated area just living for yourselves. You have to be \na part of the productive economy. You have to lend money to small \nbusinesses to start creating jobs.\n  My office intends to investigate whether these secret Fed loans, in \nsome cases, turned out to be direct corporate welfare to big banks that \nmay have used those loans not to reinvest in the economy but, rather, \nto lend back to the Federal Government at a higher rate of interest by \npurchasing Treasury securities. Now, we don't know that. Maybe that is \ntrue, maybe it is not true, but we will take a look at it. In other \nwords, did the Fed give one-half of 1 percent loans to a bank and that \nbank then purchased a Treasury security at 2 or 3 percent? If so, you \nhave a 2-percent profit margin, and that is nothing but corporate \nwelfare. The goal of the bailout was not to make Wall Street richer; \nthe goal was to expand our economy and put people to work.\n  Furthermore, we know that as part of the TARP agreement, there was an \neffort to say to the financial institutions: We are not bailing you out \nin order for you to get huge compensation packages. We are not going to \ngive you Federal money so you can make all kinds of money. We put \nlimitations on executive compensation.\n  Did the Fed play the role of allowing some of the large financial \ninstitutions to pay back the TARP money, use the Fed money, and then \ncontinue with their very high executive compensation? We don't know, \nbut it is worth investigating.\n  Furthermore--and this is an issue I have worked on for a number of \nyears. We know every major religion on Earth--Christianity, Judaism, \nIslam, you name it--has always felt that usury is immoral. What we mean \nby usury is that when someone doesn't have a lot of money and you loan \nthem money, you don't get blood out of a stone. You can't ask for \noutrageously high interest rates when somebody is hurting. That is \nimmoral. Every major religion, all great philosophers have written \nabout this. Yet today we have millions of people in our country--and I \nhear from Vermonters every week on this issue--who are paying 25 \npercent or 30 percent and in some cases even higher interest rates on \ntheir credit cards--20 percent, 30 percent interest rates. That is \ngetting blood out of a stone. Yet many of the credit card companies \nwere bailed out by the taxpayers of this country. What the Fed must do \nis say to those companies: Sorry, you can't continue to rip off the \nAmerican people and charge them 25 percent or 30 percent interest \nrates.\n  As it happens, the four largest banks in this country, which are Bank \nof America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, issue half of \nall mortgages in this country. Four huge financial institutions issue \nhalf of all mortgages in this country. That unto itself is a huge \nproblem. They issue half of all mortgages, two-thirds of all credit \ncards. That speaks to another issue about the need to start bringing\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\nup these financial institutions. But when you have a handful of banks \nthat received huge bailouts from the Federal Government that are \nissuing two-thirds of the credit cards in this country, it seems to me \nto be somewhat absurd that the Fed did not say to them: Sorry, you \ncan't charge people 25 or 30 percent interest rates on your credit \ncards. The same principle applies to mortgages. I don't have to tell \nanybody in this country that we have seen millions of folks lose their \nhomes through foreclosure, and once again we see that the four largest \nbanks in this country--Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, \nand Citigroup--issue half of all mortgages. Four banks issue two-thirds \nof the credit cards and half of the mortgages. We bail these financial \ninstitutions out. Don't they have some responsibility to the American \npeople? How many more Americans could have remained in their homes if \nthe Fed had required those bailed-out banks to reduce mortgage payments \nas a condition of receiving these secret loans?\n  In terms of the interest rates on credit cards, a lot of people don't \nknow this, but right now the banks are able to charge as much as they \nwant to charge, but, in fact, credit unions are not.\n  Right now, we are looking at a situation where over one-quarter of \nall credit cardholders in this country are now paying interest rates \nabove 20 percent and in some cases as high as 79 percent. In my view, \nwhen credit card companies charge over 20 percent interest, they are \nnot engaged in the business of making credit available to their \ncustomers; they are involved in extortion and loan-sharking--nothing \nessentially different than gangsters who charge outrageously high \nprices for their loans and who break kneecaps when their victims can't \nafford to pay them. So that is where we are right now.\n  I get calls--and I am sure every other Senator gets calls--from \nconstituents who are very upset. They are going deeper and deeper into \ndebt because they can't pay 25 or 30 percent interest rates on their \ncredit cards. We bailed out the credit card companies. There was no \nprovision that said: Stop ripping off the American people. Stop these \ncompanies from committing usury.\n  We are working on legislation that would say to these private banks \nnot to charge any more money for the credit they provide than do the \ncredit unions. It is going to be a tough fight because the lobbyists \nfrom Wall Street are all over this place. Wall Street spends huge \namounts of money in campaign contributions, and it is going to be \ntough. But I think we need to pass that. I think the Fed needs to be \nmuch more active, in terms of what kinds of interest rates credit card \ncompanies should be paying.\n  Today, I am going to focus a lot, obviously, on an agreement reached \nbetween the President and the Republican leadership, which I think does \nnot serve the American people well. One of the areas, as I mentioned \nearlier, where I think we could do a lot better in addressing the \ncrisis of high unemployment in this Nation is by investing the kinds of \nmoney we need in our infrastructure.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, they graded \nAmerica's roads, public transit, and aviation with a D. They said we \nmust invest $2.2 trillion over the next 5 years simply to get a \npassable grade. Unfortunately, in the agreement struck between the \nPresident and the Republican leadership, to the best of my knowledge, \nnot one nickel is going into investing in our infrastructure.\n  Let me tell you why we need to invest in infrastructure. A, that is \nwhere you can create the millions of jobs we desperately need in order \nto get us out of this recession. Second of all, we need to invest in \ninfrastructure because, if we don't, we will become less and less \ncompetitive internationally.\n  According to the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue \nStudy Commission, $225 billion is needed annually for the next 50 years \nto upgrade our surface transportation system to a state of good repair \nand create a more advanced system. The Federal Highway Administration \nreports that $130 billion must be invested annually for a 20-year \nperiod to improve our bridges and the operational performance of our \nhighways. At present, one in four of the Nation's bridges is either \nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete. One in four of our \nbridges is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Yet \nin this agreement struck by the President and the Republican \nleadership, to the best of my knowledge, not one nickel is going into \nour infrastructure. We need to invest in our infrastructure. We need to \nimprove our infrastructure. When we do that, we can create millions of \njobs.\n  The Federal Transit Administration says $22 billion must be invested \nannually for a 20-year period to improve conditions and performances \nfor our major transit systems. In Vermont, the situation is no \ndifferent than in the rest of the country. Thirty-five percent of \nVermont's 2,700 bridges--nearly 1,000 bridges--are functionally \nobsolete. In recent years, we have had to shut down bridges, which \ncaused a lot of inconvenience to people who live in those areas, to \nworkers who had to get to work using a bridge. Nearly half the bridges \nin Vermont have structural deficiencies. Rural transit options are few \nand far between, making rural, low-income Vermonters especially \nvulnerable to spikes in gas prices. In other words, in Vermont, and in \nother areas of rural America, you have one choice in the vast majority \nof cases as to how you get to work. That one choice is that you get in \nyour car, you pay $3 for a gallon of gas, and that is it. That is \nbecause rural transportation in this country is very weak.\n  We can create jobs building the buses and vans we need, making it \neasier and cheaper for workers in rural America to get to work. In \nurban areas, it is no different. Transit systems in Chicago, New York, \nand even here in Washington, DC, are in disrepair. Let's improve and \nrepair them. That makes us more efficient, more productive, and more \ncompetitive, and it creates jobs now. Not one nickel, as far as I can \nunderstand, has been invested in our infrastructure in this agreement.\n  The United States invests just 2.4 percent of GDP in infrastructure; \nwhereas, Europe invests twice that amount.\n  Here is something I think every American should be keenly aware of \nand very worried about. I don't have to tell anybody that the Chinese \neconomy is exploding every single day in almost every way. In China, \nthey are investing almost four times our rate--or 9 percent--of their \nGDP annually in their infrastructure. Years ago, I was in Shanghai, \nChina. I was coming from the airport to downtown as part of a \ncongressional delegation. While we were on the bus coming in, my wife \nnoticed something. She said: What was that? There was a blur that went \nby the window. Of course, I didn't notice it; she did. It turned out \nthat blur was an experimental train they were working on--high-speed \nrail, which is now operational there, and other similar prototypes are \nbeing developed in China. Here we are, the United States of America, \nwhich for so many years led the world in so many ways, and now you are \nseeing a newly developing country such as China with high-speed rail \nall over their country, making them more productive and efficient, and \nin our cities, our subways are breaking down. Amtrak is going 50, 60 \nmiles an hour, and the Chinese and Europeans have trains going hundreds \nof miles an hour.\n  This is the United States of America. Maybe I am old-fashioned. I \nthink we can do it too. I think we can rebuild our rail system, make \nour country more efficient and create jobs.\n  China invested $186 billion in rail from 2006 to 2009, and according \nto the New York Times, within 2 years, they will open 42 new high-speed \nrail lines, with trains reaching speeds of 200 miles an hour. That is \nChina. So I think if China can do it, the United States of America can \ndo it. That is the way to rebuild America, make us stronger and create \njobs.\n  By 2020, China plans to add 26,000 additional miles of tracks for \nfreight and travel, as well as 230,000 miles of new or improved roads, \nand 97 new airports--97 new airports. Does anybody in America have the \nsame problem I have when you go to the airport, where you are waiting \nin line and you have to deal with all the problems of older airports? \nChina is building 97 new ones. We are not. If we are going to be \neffective in the international economy, and if our kids will have \ndecent jobs, it is high\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\ntime we woke up and began investing in our infrastructure. So that is \nnot only to improve the long-term strength of America, our economic \nprowess, but it is also to create jobs right now that we desperately \nneed.\n  Unfortunately, in this bill, this tax agreement between the President \nand the Republican leadership, there are many billions of dollars going \ninto tax breaks for corporations. But there is not a whole lot of \nmoney--in fact, zero dollars--going into rebuilding our infrastructure.\n  Similarly--and I know there has been debate since yesterday on this \nissue. There may be a small breakthrough. I don't have to tell \nAmericans, least of all the people in Vermont, about what happens when \nthe weather gets cold and you are forced to pay very high prices for \nheating oil. The time is long overdue for us to make the investments we \nneed to transform our energy system away from coal, away from oil. We \nare spending as a nation--and everybody in America has to appreciate \nthis--$350 billion every single year--$1 billion a day, roughly--\nimporting oil from Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries, in order \nto make our economy go and in order to keep people warm.\n  Let me be very clear. The royal family of Saudi Arabia, which is our \nmajor source of oil, is doing just fine. Don't worry about the royal \nfamily of Saudi Arabia. They have zillions and zillions of dollars. \nMaybe it is a good idea that we seek energy independence, that we break \nour dependence on fossil fuel, and become more energy efficient, which, \nby the way, investing in public transportation certainly will do, and \nwe move to sustainable energy, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and \nbiomass. Guess what. China is doing that. Many of the solar panels \ncoming into this country are not made in the United States but are made \nin China. They are big into wind turbines. I think the time is now for \nus to rebuild our infrastructure and create the jobs we desperately \nneed.\n  Again, unfortunately, despite the enormous infrastructure needs we \nhave in this country, this agreement, signed by the President and the \nRepublican leadership, does not do that. When we talk about \ntransforming our energy system and moving away from fossil fuel and \nmaking our homes more energy efficient and building solar panels, \nmoving toward solar thermal power, in the Southwest of this country--\nNew Mexico, Arizona, Nevada--we have some of the best solar exposure in \nthe entire world. There are estimates that just in the Southwest of \nthis country, on Federal land, we can provide 30 percent of the \nelectricity American homes need, if we move toward solar thermal. We \nneed to invest in our transmission lines.\n  What we are talking about is massive investment to create jobs, make \nus energy independent, clean up the environment, and deal with the huge \namount of greenhouse gas emissions which are contributing to global \nwarming. That is a win-win-win situation. Yet we are not seeing that in \nthis bill.\n  I wish to tell you something, Mr. President. I will get into this at \ngreater length later. When we talk about our good friends in the oil \nindustry--and I am not here to make a long speech about BP and what \nthey have done in Louisiana, et cetera. I want everybody to know this. \nI will get into this at greater length later. Last year, our friends at \nExxonMobil--and ExxonMobil has historically been the most profitable \ncorporation in the history of the world. Last year, ExxonMobil had, for \nthem, a very bad year. They only made $19 billion in profit. Based on \n$19 billion, you might be surprised to know ExxonMobil not only paid \nnothing in taxes, they got a $156 million return from the IRS. How is \nthat? For those of you who are working in an office, working in a \nfactory, earning your $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year, you \npay taxes. But if you are ExxonMobil, and you made $19 billion in \nprofits last year, not only did you not pay any taxes this year, you \ngot $156 million in return.\n\n  It is not just the large oil companies that do not pay their fair \nshare of taxes. I am going to get into this a little bit later, but \nwhen we try to understand why we have such a huge national debt and a \n$1.3 or $1.4 trillion deficit, it is also important to understand that \nmany large and profitable corporations avoid virtually all of their tax \nresponsibility.\n  In August 2008, the General Accountability Office issued a report. \nAccording to this report, two out of every three corporations in the \nUnited States paid no Federal income taxes between 1998 and 2005. We \nhave a $13.7 trillion national debt, and according to a GAO report \npublished in August of 2008 two out of every three corporations in the \nUnited States paid no Federal income taxes between 1998 and 2005. \nAmazingly, these corporations had a combined $2.5 trillion in sales but \npaid no income taxes to the IRS.\n  Furthermore, according to a report from Citizens For Tax Justice, 82 \nFortune 500 companies in America--I guess that is 82 out of 500--paid \nzero or less in Federal income taxes in at least 1 year from 2001 to \n2003. That is a report from Citizens For Tax Justice. And the Citizens \nFor Tax Justice report goes on to say:\n\n       In the years they paid no income tax, these companies \n     earned $102 billion in U.S. profits. But instead of paying \n     $35.6 billion in income taxes, as the statutory 35 percent \n     corporate tax rate seems to require, these companies \n     generated so many excess tax breaks that they received \n     outright tax rebate checks from the U.S. Treasury totaling \n     $12.6 billion.\n\n  That is from the Citizens For Tax Justice report.\n  So when we take a comprehensive look at what is going on in this \ncountry, why we have a $13.7 trillion national debt, it is terribly \nimportant to understand that while the middle class pays its share of \ntaxes, there are many large corporations that not only are paying \nnothing in taxes, they are getting rebates from the Federal Government.\n  I will go into greater length later on, but as a member of the Budget \nCommittee I can tell you we discuss quite often how every single year--\nevery single year--corporate interests and wealthy individuals stash \naway huge amounts of money in tax savings in the Cayman Islands, \nBermuda, and other countries in order to avoid paying their taxes in \nthe United States of America. These are American corporations turning \ntheir back on the American people, saying--as Mrs. Helmsley said so \nmany years ago, many of you remember--only small people pay taxes. Only \nthe working stiffs out there pay taxes.\n  If you are a large corporation and you have a good lawyer or a good \naccountant, you know what to do. You invest your money in the Cayman \nIslands and in Bermuda, and you don't have to pay American taxes. But, \nby the way, as the disclosure report last week indicated, no problem; \nyou get bailed out. When things get bad, you will be bailed out by the \nAmerican taxpayers. On and on and on it goes. The rich and large \ncorporations get richer, the CEOs earn huge compensation packages, and \nwhen things get bad, don't worry; Uncle Sam and the American taxpayers \nare here to bail you out. But when you are in trouble, well, we just \ncan't afford to help you, if you are in the working class or the middle \nclass of this country.\n  I want to return for a moment to the agreement that the President and \nthe Republican leadership negotiated because I think that is the issue \nthat all of America is now talking about. The President and the \nRepublican leadership say it is a good deal. Democrats in the House \nyesterday said: Wait a second. It doesn't look to us like it is a good \ndeal. In fact, we don't even want to bring it up on the floor of the \nHouse. In the Senate, I can tell you there are a number of us--I don't \nknow how many--who say: Wait a minute. This is not a good deal for the \nmiddle class, it is not a good deal for our kids, and it is not a good \ndeal for our workers. We can negotiate a better deal. The reason we are \ntrying to delay passage of this agreement--and I hope very much it \ndoesn't have the votes here--is we want the American people to stand \nand say: Wait a second, it makes no sense to us to be giving huge tax \nbreaks to the richest people in this country--literally millionaires \nand billionaires--and driving up the national debt so our kids can pay \nmore in taxes in order to pay off that debt.\n  This is a transfer of wealth. It is Robin Hood in reverse. We are \ntaking from the middle class and working families and we are giving it \nto the wealthiest people in this country. I believe the agreement \nstruck between the President and the Republican leadership is a bad \ndeal. There may be some\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\ngood parts to it, but, by and large, it is not a good deal. We can do \nbetter, and the American people must stand up and work with us. They \nmust get on their phones and call their Senators and call their \nCongress men and women. They must make their voices heard and say: \nEnough is enough. The rich have it all right now--the top 1 percent \nearns 23\\1/2\\ percent of all income, more than the bottom 50 percent--\nand it is absurd that we continue to bail out people who do not need \nany help and who are doing just fine.\n  I am here to take a stand against this bill, and I am going to do \neverything I can to defeat this bill. I am going to tell my colleagues \nand the American people exactly why, in my view, this is not good \nlegislation. Let me just tick off some of the reasons I think this bill \ndoes not serve the best interests of the disappearing middle class of \nthis country.\n  I don't know what kind of telephone calls the Presiding Officer is \nreceiving from Colorado, but I can tell you that in the last 3 days \nalone, according to my front desk staff both here in Washington and in \nVermont, we are over 5,000 telephone calls and e-mails, and I believe \nwell over 98 percent of those messages are against this agreement. I \ndon't know to what degree that is indicative of what is going on all \nover this country, but I suspect it is not radically different in other \nStates. I think the American people are saying, with a $13.8 trillion \nnational debt, let's not give tax breaks to billionaires and drive up \nthat national debt, forcing our kids to pay more in taxes, and at the \nsame time have Republicans coming forward to start slashing Medicare \nand Medicaid and Social Security because of this large debt that we are \nmaking larger.\n  I appeal to my conservative friends. I am not a conservative, but \nmany conservatives have spent their entire political careers saying we \ncannot afford to drive up the national debt, that it is unsustainable. \nI agree with that. So vote against this agreement because it is driving \nup the national debt. In a significant way it is doing that by giving \ntax breaks to people who absolutely don't need it.\n  Once again, for those people who are earning $1 million a year or \nmore, on average--on average--they will be getting a $100,000-a-year \ntax break, and for people earning $100 million a year, that number will \nbe a lot higher. Who believes that makes any sense at all?\n  Let me give some other reasons I think this agreement is a bad \nagreement. The President says: Well, yes, we are going to extend tax \nbreaks for all, including the top 2 percent. But don't worry, it is \nonly going to be for 2 years--not to worry, it is only going to be for \n2 years.\n  Well, maybe that will be the case. But you know what. I doubt that \nvery much. I have been in Congress long enough to know if you extend a \ntax break, it is very hard to undo that extension because if we can't \ntell our Republican colleagues that it is absurd to continue giving tax \nbreaks to millionaires and billionaires--if we can't do it now--what \nmakes you think we will do it in the midst of a Presidential election?\n  I say that as somebody who admires and likes the President. The \nPresident is a friend of mine. But his credibility has been severely \ndamaged. If he is going to go forward, and if he is the Democratic \nnominee, I suspect he will say: Yes, I extended it for 2 years against \nmy will; but, don't worry, I am going to repeal them after 2 years. \nTell me, who will believe him? His credibility has been severely \ndamaged. We are caving in on this issue and we should not be.\n  The polls show us the American people do not believe millionaires and \nbillionaires need more tax breaks. If the calls to my office are \nindicative of what is going on in this country, there is overwhelming \nopposition to that agreement.\n  So I am saying that while the President says don't worry, that this \nis only temporary, I don't like it. But it is only 2 years. I have my \ndoubts. I expect in 2 years, if this agreement goes forward, it will be \nextended again. As you know, Mr. President, they wanted 10 years on \nthis extension of tax breaks for the rich. I have my strong suspicion \nthat is exactly what will happen, if not made permanent. This country \ncannot afford to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and \nhave the middle class pay higher taxes to pay them off.\n  I want to say also that while a lot of attention has been focused on \nthe personal income tax issue, that is not the only unfair tax proposal \nin this agreement. This agreement continues the Bush era 15 percent tax \nrate on capital gains and dividends.\n  Let me be clear about what that means. It means those people who make \ntheir living off of their investments--if you invest, if you earn \ndividends--will continue to pay a substantially lower tax rate than the \naverage American person in the working class, middle class--our \nfiremen, our teachers, our nurses. Those people are not going to pay 15 \npercent. They pay a higher rate than folks who have capital gains and \ndividends. I think that is wrong. This agreement extends those \nprovisions.\n  Furthermore--and this is a point that has to be made over and over--\nthis agreement between the President and the Republicans lowers the \nestate tax rate to 35 percent. Under this agreement, the estate tax \nwill decline to 35 percent. Under President Clinton, when the economy \nwas much stronger, the estate tax was 55 percent.\n  Now, I know the Republicans have done a very good job in trying to \nconvince the American people this is a so-called death tax; that in \nevery family in America, when a loved one dies, the family is going to \nhave to pay 35 percent, 45 percent, or 55 percent. I have had people in \nBurlington, VT, come up to me and say: What are you doing? I have \n$30,000 in the bank that I want to leave to my kids. Why are you \nforcing my kids to pay such a large tax?\n  So let me be very clear. The Republicans have done a very good job in \ntotally distorting this issue. The estate tax is paid only by the top \nthree-tenths of 1 percent of families in America. If you are in the \nmiddle class, even if you are modestly wealthy, even if you are \nwealthy, or if you are poor, if you are lower middle class, you don't \npay a nickel in estate tax if somebody in your family were to die and \nleave you wealth--not a nickel. This applies not just to the rich but \nto the very, very rich.\n\n  What the Republicans have been arguing for several years now is they \nwant to repeal the estate tax entirely. If they were successful in \ndoing that, that would mean increasing the national debt by $1 trillion \nover a 10-year period and all of the benefits--not some, all of the \nbenefits--go to the top three-tenths of 1 percent; 99.7 percent of the \npeople do not gain one nickel.\n  What is in this agreement is not what the Republicans ideally want, \nwhich is a repeal of the tax entirely, but what they do get is a \nreduction to 35 percent with an exemption on the first $5 million of an \nindividual's estate.\n  Here is a chart which indicates just what I said a moment ago. \n``Repealing the estate tax would add more than $1 trillion to the \ndeficit over 10 years.'' It is over $1 trillion, and the beneficiaries \nof it are just the very wealthy.\n  Let me give an example of what the repeal of the estate tax would \nmean. I will read it right off this chart.\n\n       Sam Walton's family, the heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune, are \n     worth an estimated $86.8 billion. The Walton family would \n     receive an estimated $32.7 billion tax break if the estate \n     tax was completely repealed.\n\n  This is what our Republican friends want.\n  This agreement between the President and the Republicans certainly \ndoes not repeal the estate tax, but it does significantly lower the \nrates that the richest people, the very richest people in this country, \nwould have to pay.\n  (Mr. UDALL of Colorado assumed the chair.)\n  Two days ago, I brought to the floor of the Senate a very simple \npiece of legislation. I think how that legislation was treated speaks \nvolumes about the debate we are having now. This legislation said that \nwith over 50 million senior citizens on Social Security and disabled \nvets for the second year in a row not getting a cost-of-living \nadjustment, a COLA--over 50 million seniors on Social Security and \ndisabled vets not getting any COLA at all--despite the fact their \nprescription drug costs are going up and their health care costs are \ngoing up, they got no COLA. I said I think that in these tough\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\ntimes, it is appropriate that we provide those folks--if we cannot get \nthem a COLA, let's get them the equivalent of a measly 2 percent COLA, \na $250 check to all of our seniors and disabled vets. That is what we \ndid, by the way, in the stimulus package. That is all. For over 50 \nmillion people, a $250 check costs our government about $14 billion. \nYet I could not get one Republican vote in support of that. Republicans \nsay: My goodness, imagine a senior or disabled vet living on $15,000 or \n$20,000 a year getting a $250 check. What an outrage. We have different \npriorities, they say. We want to give a $1 million tax break to \nsomebody who earns $50 million a year. That about says it all. If you \nare very, very rich, the good news is you are going to get more tax \nbreaks. But if you are a senior or disabled vet, we can't get you a \n$250 check.\n  I will say that the vote on the floor of the Senate was 53 people in \nfavor of providing that one-time check, 45 against--53 to 45: We won. \nBut here in the Senate, majority does not rule. Republicans filibuster \nalmost everything, and it requires 60 votes. We did not get the 60 \nvotes, and seniors did not get that check. I am going to do my best to \nsee that they do get it. We are going to bring that issue back and back \nagain.\n  I raise that issue to tell you that one of the very weakest proposals \nin this agreement, totally outrageous, is the decrease in taxes for the \nestate tax.\n  There is another issue I want to touch on. I am going to spend a lot \nof time on this issue because it has not gotten the coverage and the \nattention I think it deserves.\n  This agreement deals with the so-called payroll tax holiday. I know \nthe Vice President and the President and others have been touting this. \nThey say this is really a good thing because it will put more money \ninto the pockets of the working people. What will happen--right now, if \nyou are a worker, you put 6.2 percent into Social Security. It is going \nto be reduced for 1 year to 4.2 percent. You get the difference, and \nthis is really a good thing. All of us want to see working people have \nmore money in their pockets. That is what we do. That is what we are \nfighting for.\n  But let me be clear that while on the surface this so-called payroll \ntax holiday sounds like a good idea for working people, it is actually \na very bad idea. What the American people should understand is that \nthis payroll tax holiday originated from rightwing Republicans whose \nultimate goal, trust me, is not to put more money into the pockets of \nworking families; it is the ultimate destruction of Social Security. \nWhat they understand is that if we divert funding that is supposed to \ngo into the Social Security trust fund, this will ultimately weaken the \nlong-term financial viability of Social Security. In other words, what \nwe are doing is, for the very first time, diverting money which is \nsupposed to go into the Social Security trust fund and we are giving it \nto workers today. It is like eating our seed.\n  Rather than going into Social Security, the President says: Don't \nworry, this is going to be covered this year by the Federal Government. \nWe have never seen that before. I don't want Social Security to be \ndependent on the Federal Government because the Federal Government has \na $13.7 trillion national debt. And what I worry about is this is not \njust a 1-year provision; this also could be extended.\n  Let me quote Barbara Kennelly.\n  I am glad to see I am joined here on the floor by one of the \nstrongest fighters for working families in the Senate, Senator Sherrod \nBrown of Ohio. I just want to say this before I ask him a question or \nbefore he asks me a question or whatever the protocol is.\n  I want to quote what Barbara Kennelly, the president and CEO of the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said. This \nis one of the largest senior citizens groups in America.\n\n       Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the \n     current economic crisis, it has been bartered in a deal that \n     provides deficit-busting tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\n  Here is the key point:\n\n       Diverting $120 billion in Social Security contributions for \n     a so-called ``tax holiday'' may sound like a good deal for \n     workers now, but it's bad business for a program that a \n     majority of middle-class seniors will rely upon in the \n     future.\n\n  Barbara Kennelly, president and CEO of the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  I am joined by my very good friend from Ohio, and I want to ask him \nhis sense of this overall agreement.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. My sense is similar to yours. I was just on a TV \nshow a minute ago. I was asked, the liberals or the conservatives, what \nthey think about this. This really is not a liberal-conservative issue. \nFirst of all, the tax cuts overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest \ntaxpayers. We are seeing the kinds of tax cuts that millionaires and \nbillionaires get from the income tax and from the estate tax. But it is \nalso equally important that it blows a hole in our budget deficit.\n  In some sense, we are borrowing tens of billions of dollars every \nyear now--if this agreement becomes law, we are borrowing tens of \nbillions of dollars every year from the Chinese, and we are putting it \non the credit cards of our children and grandchildren for them to pay \noff who knows when, and then we are giving these tax cuts to \nmillionaires and billionaires. In those simple terms, it doesn't make \nsense. It doesn't make sense in our relationship with China. It doesn't \nmake sense in the lost jobs that come from that China trade policy. It \ndoesn't make sense in undermining the middle class. It doesn't make \nsense in terms of fairness in the tax system. It doesn't make sense for \nour children and grandchildren and the burden they are going to have to \nbear to pay off this debt. Giving a millionaire a tax cut and charging \nit to our kids, who are paying taxes on, unfortunately, in the last few \nyears, declining wages, is morally reprehensible.\n  I know Senator Sanders has been on the floor 2 hours now talking \nabout this and how important it is and really analyzing it and \neducating about it and all that. I think about the economic policy, \ntoo, that this embodies.\n  Nine or 10 years ago, Senator Sanders and the Presiding Officer, when \nhe was a Member of the House, Senator Udall from Colorado, and I and \nothers voted against the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, principally \nbecause those tax cuts overwhelmingly went to the wealthy and ended up \nadding to our national debt. We had a surplus then. We sure don't now. \nWe had the largest surplus we ever had in 2001. It blew a hole in that. \nBut we passed those tax cuts under the belief, those who supported it--\nPresident Bush and Senator McConnell and so many others--under the \nbelief that that kind of trickle-down economics would grow our economy.\n\n  In the 8 years--and this is not partisan, this is not opinion, this \nis fact--from January 1, 2001, to January 1, 2009, President Bush's 8 \nyears, we actually had private sector job loss in this country. \nContrast that with a different economic policy--January 1, 1993, to \nJanuary 1, 2001, the Clinton 8 years. Again, this isn't partisan, this \nisn't opinion, this is fact. During the Clinton 8 years, we had 21 \nmillion private sector jobs created--21 million private sector jobs \ncreated--and literally zero private sector jobs in the Bush 8 years of \ntrickle-down economics.\n  Why would we blow a hole in the budget, which this bill does, for our \nkids to pay off? Why would we continue an economic policy that clearly \ndid not work for this country? It didn't work for the middle class. We \nsaw middle-class wages--not only no job increase during those 8 years, \nexcept for the people at the very top, we saw actual wage stagnation or \nworse. Most Americans did not get a raise during the 8 Bush years. Most \nAmericans simply saw their wages flat or in many cases decline. The \nsuperwealthy saw a big increase in their incomes and in their net \nassets. And now we are going to give a tax break to them.\n  This is not class warfare. Lots of people I know have a lot of money. \nI don't have any ill will for them. But why would we help those people \nwho have done so very well and then have our children pay for it?\n  Senator Sanders just mentioned the letter from Barbara Kennelly from \none of the largest seniors organizations in the country and what this \nwill mean for Social Security. Here is my fear. If this is passed, we \nare going to see our budget deficit increase, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, about $900 billion because of this \npackage, $800-some billion over the next couple of years.\n  As soon as it is signed by President Obama, even though it was \nnegotiated\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\nwith the Republican Senate leadership and overwhelming numbers of \nRepublicans in the Senate and House--I assume they are going to vote \nfor it--they are going to say: Look at the huge budget deficit \nPresident Obama created. From that day on, they are going to go after \nways to cut the budget. That is OK. I agree we need to deal with \nspending and taxes and the whole picture.\n  But I also know from watching Republicans--I saw them in the House \nwhen they moved toward Medicare privatization in 2003, 2004, and 2005. \nThey had some success. Fortunately, we were able to beat back most of \nit. I remember that in 2005, after President Bush was reelected in a \nvery close race, he spoke repeatedly about privatizing Social Security. \nI know that is what they want to do. In the 1990s, Speaker Gingrich--\nfortunately beaten back by President Clinton--tried to privatize \nMedicare.\n  That is the way they cut the budget, they go after Medicare and \nSocial Security. So this vote on this package--to me, we need to call \nthe President, write the President, work with the President to say: No \ndeal, and this has to be something very different from what it is now \nbecause it will cause huge deficits our children and grandchildren will \nhave to bear. It will not help the economy appreciably because we saw \nwhat the trickle-down economic policies of the Bush years did. It does \nnot help the middle class enough.\n  So it is pretty clear to me how this jeopardizes Social Security, how \nit jeopardizes Medicare, how it will force more cuts and more pressure \non those programs that have lifted so many people into the middle \nclass. In 1965, when Medicare was first passed, half of the senior \ncitizens in this country had no health insurance--half of the seniors \nhad no health insurance. Today 99 percent of seniors have health \ninsurance, something like that.\n  I know we are a country now that has created a strong middle class. \nWe have seen that middle class--because of these tax cuts for the \nwealthy, trickle-down kind of economic policy, we have seen the middle \nclass shrink in the last few years. I do not want that to keep \nhappening. That is why I am very concerned about this. That is why I am \nworking with the Senate to say: No deal. We need to much more seriously \nfocus on not running up a huge debt, on making sure Social Security is \nprotected, on an economic policy that works for the middle class, on a \ntax policy that is fair to the middle class.\n  That is why Senator Sanders' work is so important on the floor today, \ntaking the floor for a longer period than anybody I have seen since I \nhave been in the Senate, in a filibuster kind of setting, where he is \nraising these questions, asking these questions, educating the public, \ntalking to people all over the country, in this Chamber and outside to \nchange this policy.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I could interrupt my friend from Ohio and ask him a \nquestion, it is on an issue the Senator dealt with last night. Talk \nabout the kind of priorities we have seen in the Senate recently, where \njust a couple of days ago the Senator and I worked very hard to try to \nmake sure seniors on Social Security and disabled vets were able to get \na $250 check at a cost of $14 billion, we could not get one Republican \nvote for that, while at the same time Republicans are pushing tax \nbreaks of over $1 million a year for the richest people in this \ncountry. Does that seem----\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. It tells a story. I came to the floor right after \nthat vote. I had supported it all along. I cosponsored Senator Sanders' \neffort to bring that to the floor, for the $250 check for all seniors \nand all disabled veterans, I might add, not just Social Security \nbeneficiaries. But I came to the floor right afterwards because I was \npretty amazed.\n  I know there is partisanship here. I know some people think their \nwhole view of the world is to give tax cuts to the richest people of \nthe world and it will all trickle down and we will all do better, it \nwill lift all boats. That is a pretty good economic theory you might \nhave learned at Harvard or you might have learned at Johns Hopkins near \nhere or wherever. But it does not work. It is a nice theory, but it \ndoes not work to lift all boats.\n  So Senator Sanders' effort was to provide a $250 check, one time, at \na cost of $14 billion. But one time, not continued $14 billion--one \ntime for seniors who had not had a cost-of-living adjustment in 2 \nyears. It just seemed to make so much sense when the average senior in \nthis country gets about a $14,000-a-year Social Security check. I think \nthat is about $1,200 a month. That is not their entire income for most \nseniors, but it is a big part of it. Many seniors live only on that. \nMany more seniors live on that, but only another couple $300, $400 a \nmonth.\n  There is not inflation maybe for people my age so much in this \ncountry, but if you are older and you have a lot of health care costs, \nthere is inflation because the health care costs seem to go up higher \nthan maybe anything but higher education, and maybe as much as that. So \nit was important that $250 be provided, we think, to every senior in \nthe country and every disabled vet.\n  What was so amazing about it was that 42 Republican Senators signed a \nletter saying they would do nothing, nothing in the Senate, until tax \ncuts for the rich were approved, until they were signed into law.\n  Now, I have never seen Senators engage in a work stoppage or a \nstrike. I mean, it was not quite a strike, which it is probably illegal \nfor us to strike. I do not know, maybe. But it was a work stoppage.\n  They are saying: We are not doing anything until you give tax cuts to \nmy rich friends, and I might say also to many people in the House and \nSenate whose income is in that bracket too. I am not accusing them of \nthat, to be sure, but they were there for their rich friends and their \nbiggest contributors and the wealthiest people in this country. But \nthey were not there for a senior citizen living on $1,200 a month that \ncould use that extra $250.\n  I have met too many seniors, and I know the Presiding Officer, when \nhe travels to Colorado Springs or he goes to Cimarron or he goes to \nDenver, I know he hears seniors say: I cut my pills in half because I \nneed my prescription to run for 2 months rather than 1 because I cannot \nafford it. Or I skipped my medicine today because my house is too cold, \nand I do not have enough heat. We know seniors make those choices. We \nmake choices here, and the choice we made is 42 Republicans made it and \nblocked it because we need 60 votes. We had a majority of voters, an \neasy majority, for Senator Sanders' effort, 53 votes, 53 votes to do \nthis, the $250, but we need 60 votes.\n  So 42 Republican Senators engaged in their work stoppage saying: We \nare not doing anything until we get these tax cuts for the rich. They \nsaid no to seniors. I am amazed by that, the callousness. I guess I am \neven more amazed when you consider--what is today, the 10th--when you \nconsider in 2 weeks it is Christmas Day. That does not seem to bother \nthem. It does not seem to bother them on unemployment benefits. And \n85,000 Ohioans, a week and a half ago, lost their unemployment \nbenefits--85,000. Their holiday season is ruined.\n  But I guess all of us will go home. I want to go home and be with \nConnie and my kids on Christmas. My children are grown. We have one \ngrandchild. I want to be with him for as much of Christmas as I can. \nBut we have a job to do today, this week and next week and this month \nand this year; and that is to extend unemployment benefits to people \nwho have lost them, who are looking for jobs as hard as they can in a \ngreat majority of cases, and extending the tax cuts for the middle \nclass and doing the right thing. So far, we have not done that.\n  I need to go to the airport. But I want to yield back to Senator \nSanders for his work today. I hope next week, when we come back on \nMonday, we are prepared to do whatever it takes to say no deal on this \none and to make this work for the middle class, make it work for Social \nSecurity beneficiaries, make it work for unemployed workers.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my good friend from Ohio, one of the real \nfighters for working families in the Senate, not only for coming down \nhere but for his years of efforts. But he makes a very important point. \nWe have a job to do and the job is--I know some people do not believe \nit. It is a rather radical concept. But our job is to represent working \nfamilies, the middle class, and not the wealthiest people in this \ncountry.\n  I have four kids, six grandchildren. I look forward to spending the \nholidays\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\nwith them. But you know what. We have a job to do, and if it means \nstaying here through Christmas Eve, through New Year's, that is our \njob. And let's pass a proposal that works well for ordinary families \nand not just for the wealthiest people in this country.\n  I wanted to thank Senator Sherrod Brown for coming down.\n  What I want to say now is, when you look at this agreement, we have \ntalked now about the absurdity, in the middle of a time when we have a \n$13.7 trillion national debt, of giving tax breaks to people who do not \nneed it. Senator Brown and I have talked about the dangers inherent in \nthis payroll tax holiday and what it might mean for the future of \nSocial Security. But I also wanted to make another point; that is, that \nthere are many billions of dollars in this proposal going to a variety \nof business tax cuts. Some of them, in fact, might work; some of them, \nin fact, might not work. But what is very clear is, if your goal is to \ncreate as many jobs as possible for every dollar of investment, this \nparticular approach is not very effective.\n\n  When we talk about tax breaks for corporations and companies, what we \nshould be aware of is that corporate America today--today--is sitting \non close to $2 trillion in cash. They have that cash on hand. The \nproblem is not that they do not have the money, the problem is that \nworking people do not have the money to buy the products these guys are \nproducing. I believe, and not just me but I think a variety of \neconomists from across the board, it makes a lot more sense if we are \nserious about creating jobs to invest in our infrastructure.\n  I say that for a number of reasons. When you put money into roads and \nbridges and public transportation, you are creating, for every dollar \nyou spend, far more jobs than giving a variety of tax breaks. That is \nan economic fact.\n  Second of all, when you are investing in our infrastructure, not only \nare you creating jobs short term, you are leaving the country with \nlong-term improvement that increases our competitiveness in a very \ntough global economy. I mentioned a moment ago, and we will get back to \nit later, China is investing huge amounts of money into high-speed \nrail, into their roads, into their bridges. Yet if you drive around \ncertain parts of America, you think we are a Third World nation. You \nhave roads with all kinds of potholes. You have bridges which you \ncannot go across. You have rail systems where trains are going slower--\nthere is a study out there that I am going to get to later--where \nsomebody said that decades and decades ago, it took less time to go \nfrom various parts of this country to the other on trains than it does \ntoday because our rail beds are in such bad shape.\n  So if we are going to make our country competitive, we have to invest \nin infrastructure. It creates jobs. It adds long-term value to this \ncountry. Unfortunately, in this agreement, there is, to the best of my \nknowledge, not one nickel going into infrastructure. It is important \nthat we, in fact, add provisions which do invest in our infrastructure \nand create jobs.\n  Another point that should be made when we look at this so-called \ncompromise agreement established by the President and the Republican \nleadership is that in the agreement there is an extension of \nunemployment benefits for 13 months. Now, there is zero question, in my \nmind; that is something that absolutely has to be done. Right now--\nSenator Brown made this point--we have millions of Americans who have, \nthrough no fault of their own, lost their jobs. Maybe their plants went \nto China. Maybe their companies could not get the loans they needed to \nstay in business. Small businesses are going under, big businesses are \nshutting plants. No question we have to extend unemployment benefits.\n  But what bothers me is that this provision in this agreement, which \nis a good provision, suggests that this is a hard-won compromise; that \nthe Republicans conceded something and they agreed to a 13-month \nextension of unemployment benefits. But here is the fact. The fact is, \nfor the last 40 years, when unemployment rates have gone above 7.2 \npercent, Republicans and Democrats, in a nonpartisan way, have come \ntogether to say, of course, we are going to extend unemployment. This \nis America. We are not going to let working families who are suffering \nhard times because, through no fault of their own, they have lost their \njobs, we are not going to let them lose their homes or not enable them \nto feed their families. This is America. We are not going to do that.\n  Republicans have said that for 40 years. Democrats have said that for \n40 years. Democratic and Republican Presidents, leaders in the House \nand Senate, have said that. So to say: Oh, my goodness, the Republicans \nmade a major concession; they are going to allow the extension of \nunemployment benefits for 13 months, that is not a concession. That has \nbeen bipartisan public policy for the last 40 years.\n  Now, I have been expressing to you and to the American people why I \nthink this is not a good agreement, why I think this agreement should \nbe defeated and why I believe we can put together a much better \nagreement.\n\n  I do want to be clear. There are positive aspects to this agreement \nwhich should be maintained in an improved proposal. Let me mention some \nof them. This proposal, in addition to extending unemployment benefits \nfor 13 months, extends the middle-class tax cuts. That is obviously \nsomething we have to do. The reality is that the middle class is \ncollapsing. During the Bush years we saw a $2,200 decline per year in \nmedian family income. Working families are hurting. There is no \nquestion. To not extend that tax cut for 98 percent of America would be \na travesty. So we have to maintain those tax cuts, and that is a \npositive thing in the agreement which obviously any future agreement \nmust maintain.\n  Also in this agreement is the earned-income tax credit for working \nAmericans, a very important provision, and the child and college tax \ncredits are also in this agreement. These proposals will keep millions \nof Americans from slipping out of the middle class and into poverty, \nand they will allow millions of Americans to send their kids to \ncollege. I am not here to say to the President or the Vice President \nthat there are not any good proposals and parts of this agreement. \nThere are. But we can do much better.\n  What the President says--and he makes a valid point--show me the \nvotes; he is good at counting. We tried a proposal here, where we only \ngot 53 votes, which said we are going to extend the tax breaks for the \nmiddle class and not the very rich. The President knows, as everybody \nelse knows, that around here Republicans filibuster everything. We need \n60 votes, and he said: Show me the votes. This is what I would say: \nWhat our job right now is about is reaching out to the American people \nfrom one end of the country to the other, from California to Vermont, \nincluding a lot of our very conservative States. Frankly, it is not a \nconservative approach to substantially increase the national debt by \ngiving tax breaks to billionaires. How many times have we been here on \nthe floor hearing our Republican colleagues give long speeches about \nthe danger and the unsustainability of a $13.7 trillion national debt \nand a $1.4 trillion deficit? We have heard it day after day. That is \ntheir mantra. If they believe that, why are they voting for a proposal \nthat substantially increases the national debt for the very \nunproductive reason of giving tax breaks to the richest people who \ndon't need it?\n  The reason we have to defeat this proposal and fight for a much \nbetter one is, I would hope that people throughout this country, from \nVermont and Colorado, and many of our conservative States, would come \nforward and say: Wait a second. I do not want to see my kids and \ngrandchildren pay more in taxes because we have borrowed money from \nChina to increase the national debt in order to give tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires who have done extraordinarily well in \nrecent years and, by the way, have seen a significant decline in their \neffective tax rate.\n  I know the Chair has heard wealthy people such as Warren Buffett make \nthe point over and over again that what he really pays in taxes, his \neffective tax rate, is lower than his secretary's. All over this \ncountry we have examples where very rich people are able to stash money \nin the Cayman Islands, take advantage of all types of loopholes, and \nare paying rather low effective tax rates, in many cases lower\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nthan police officers or firemen or teachers or nurses. Opposition to \nthis agreement should be tripartisan. We should have conservative \nRepublicans, liberal Democrats.\n  I am an independent progressive. I can tell my colleagues in the last \n3 days my office has received probably close to 3,000 phone calls, 98 \npercent of them against this agreement, probably higher than 98 \npercent, and a huge number of e-mails also overwhelmingly against this \nagreement. I suspect--I don't know it for a fact--that this is the kind \nof message the American people are sending us all over America. But \nthey have to continue to do so. They have to make it clear so we can \nwin over at least a handful of Republicans and some wavering Democrats \nand say: Wait a second. We are not going to hold hostage extending \nmiddle-class tax breaks in order to give tax breaks to billionaires. We \nwill not hold hostage extending unemployment for workers who have lost \ntheir jobs by giving tax breaks to people who don't need it.\n  If the American people give voice to what they are feeling, that this \nis not a good agreement, that we can do a lot better, I think we can \ndefeat this proposal, and we can come back with a much better proposal \nwhich protects the unemployed, extends unemployment benefits, protects \nthe middle class, extends the Bush tax cuts for 98 percent of the \npopulation, and protects a lot of important programs, making college \nmore affordable, making childcare more affordable, and helping us \ntransform our energy system.\n  There is a lot we can do if we defeat this proposal. We are not going \nto do it inside the beltway. Republicans are very united. But what we \nhave to do is win at least a handful of them and some wavering \nDemocrats to say: Mr. President, Republican leadership, you guys have \nto involve Congress in this discussion.\n  I was pleased yesterday that the Democratic caucus said: Sorry, we \nare not bringing that proposal onto the floor. I applaud Speaker Pelosi \nand the Democratic caucus for saying so. That took courage. Congressman \nWelch from the State of Vermont played an important role. Congressman \nPeter DeFazio played an important role. I congratulate him. I \ncongratulate the caucus for saying we can do better than we are doing.\n  Let me be frank: We are not going to do better unless the American \npeople stand up and help us. We are going to need a lot of phone calls, \na lot of e-mails, a lot of messages so that all of our colleagues in \nthe House and Senate understand the American people do not want to see \ntheir kids having to pay off the debt incurred by giving tax breaks to \nbillionaires.\n  This agreement doesn't come out of the blue. It comes within a \ncontext that frightens many people. Many Americans have a sinking \nfeeling that there is something very wrong in our country today. I know \nmy father came to this country at the age of 17 without a penny in his \npocket. He became the proudest American one could ever see. He didn't \nhave much of an education, but he knew this country gave him a great \nopportunity. That is the American story. That is what it is all about. \nTo millions and millions of families, whether they came from other \ncountries, whether they just made it on their own--I know we have heard \nthe majority leader Harry Reid talking about his experience growing up \nin a desperately poor family--that is what America is about. But there \nare a lot of folks out there who believe there is something wrong, and \nthe facts back them up.\n  What is going on in this country is the middle class is collapsing. \nPoverty is increasing. I have four kids and six grandchildren. I am not \nworried about me, but I am worried about what happens to my kids and my \ngrandchildren. We have some wonderful young pages here, and we worry \nabout their futures as well. We don't want to see our kids and \ngrandchildren be the first generation in the modern history of America \nto have a lower standard of living than their parents. We don't want to \nsee this country's economy move in the wrong way. We don't want a race \nto the bottom. We want to see our kids live healthier and better lives \nthan we do, not have to work longer hours, not getting a lower quality \nof education or less education. That is not the history of this great \ncountry.\n  I want to talk about one aspect of what is going on that does not get \nthe kind of attention it deserves. There are obvious reasons why, \nhaving to do with who owns the media and corporate control of the \nmedia, having to do with who provides the campaign contributions that \nelect Members of the House and Senate, having to do with all the \nlobbyists who surround this institution. Wall Street and the oil \ncompanies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign \ncontributions. The issue I wish to discuss is who is winning and who is \nlosing in this economy. I come from New England. Everybody follows the \nCeltics. We follow the Red Sox, the Patriots. What everyone asks is, \nwho won the game? Did the Patriots win or lose? That is what we want to \nknow.\n  In fact, in America, it is pretty clear in the economy who is winning \nand losing. The vast majority of people, working people, middle-class \npeople, low-income people are losing. That is who is losing. It is \nclear who is winning. The wealthiest people are doing phenomenally \nwell. They are winning the economic struggle.\n  In America today--we don't talk about this too much, but it is time \nwe did--we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income in \nthe industrialized world. I haven't heard too many people talk about \nthat issue. Why not? Our Republican colleagues want huge tax breaks for \nthe richest people, but the reality is the top 1 percent already today \nowns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. How much more do they \nwant? When is enough enough? Do they want it all? We already have \nmillions of families today who have zero wealth. They owe more than \nthey own. Millions of families have below zero wealth. We are living in \na situation where the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent. The top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. \nThat is simply unacceptable.\n  This is something we must be absolutely ashamed about and have to \naddress, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires. Maybe we should \nappreciate the fact that about 25 percent of our children are dependent \non food stamps. We should understand that in the industrialized world, \nthe United States, as this chart shows, has the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty. Is this America? Is this America? The United States \ntoday has over 20 percent of its kids living in poverty. In Finland, \nthe number is about 2 or 3 percent; Norway, maybe 4 percent; Sweden, \nmaybe 4.5 percent; Switzerland, 6 percent, whatever it may be. But here \nwe are. If people are watching on television, what they are seeing is \nthe red line. Here is the United States, well over 20 percent. Here is \nthe Netherlands in second place. It looks to me like about 7 percent. \nThis is the future of America. So we are sitting here talking about an \nagreement which says: Let's give huge tax breaks to billionaires. And \nhere is the reality. We have a rate of childhood poverty far surpassing \nany other country on Earth.\n  This is the other half of the equation. What do my colleagues think \nhappens when we have millions of kids living in poverty? What do my \ncolleagues think happens when we have kids who are dropping out of \nschool when they are 13 or 14? I talked to a fellow in Vermont who runs \none of our jails. He said about half the kids who drop out of school \nend up in the penal system. That is what happens. The result is, the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world, and then \nwhat we end up with is more people behind bars than any other country \non Earth.\n  China is a Communist totalitarian society, much larger than the \nUnited States, which is a democratic society. We have more people in \njail than China and more people in jail than any other country. So what \nwe end up doing, which seems to be not terribly bright, is spending \nperhaps $50,000 a year keeping people in jail because they dropped out \nof school. They never found a job. They got hooked on drugs or \nwhatever. We pay to put them in jail rather than investing in \nchildcare, in education, in sustaining their families.\n  So when we look at the context in which this agreement was reached, \nwe have to see that it takes place at a time when the rich are already \ndoing phenomenally well, while we have the highest rate of childhood \npoverty in the industrialized world.\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\n  During the 8 years of President Bush, the wealthiest 400 Americans--\nthat is not a lot of people, 400 families--saw their income more than \ndouble while their income tax rates dropped almost in half. So you have \n400 families--all of whom are already multi-multimillionaires--where \nduring the 8 years of President Bush their income more than doubled \nwhile their income tax rates dropped almost in half.\n  I would say to my colleagues in the Senate, we do not have to worry \nabout these guys. They are doing just fine. They do not need an \nextension of tax breaks. The wealthiest 400 Americans now earn, on \naverage, $345 million a year, and they pay an effective tax rate of \n16.6 percent. How is that? All right. The top 400 wealthiest people in \nthis country earn $345 million a year, and they pay an effective tax \nrate of 16.6 percent. They do not need an extension of tax breaks.\n  By the way, for the United States of America, this effective tax rate \nof 16.6 percent, on average, is the lowest tax rate for the very rich \nin America that there has ever been. So we have already given the \nwealthiest people in this country the lowest effective tax rates in the \nhistory of our country, at least since they have been keeping records. \nThat is what we have done. So the idea of giving these guys--who are \ndoing phenomenally well, who already own more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent--more tax breaks is totally absurd.\n  Under the 8 years of President Bush, the wealthiest 400 Americans--we \ntalked about how they doubled their incomes; income is what happens in \n1 year--under the 8 years of President Bush, the wealthiest 400 \nAmericans increased their wealth by more than $380 billion. Four \nhundred families increased their wealth by $380 billion. That averages \nto almost $1 billion a family. Mr. President, $1 billion in 8 years. \nThat is the average; some, obviously, more.\n  Collectively--I know this is not an issue we talk about too much--the \n400 richest Americans have accumulated $1.27 trillion in wealth. If any \nof them die this year, their heirs can receive, right now, all of this \nmoney tax free because the inheritance tax has been eliminated in 2010 \nas part of the Bush estate tax repeal this year.\n  Last year, the top 25 hedge fund managers made a combined $25 billion \nin income--a combined $1 billion per person. OK. So if you are a hedge \nfund manager, you are doing pretty good. I mentioned a moment ago that \nwe tried just the other day to get checks of $250 out for disabled vets \nand senior citizens on Social Security who have not had a COLA in 2 \nyears. We could not get them that check. But last year the top 25 hedge \nfund managers made a combined $25 billion in income--$1 billion per \nperson. And our Republican friends say: Oh, my word, my word, we have \nto lower their taxes. Last year, ExxonMobil, Bank of America, and other \nlarge profitable corporations paid no Federal income taxes.\n  So what you have is a tax system which is totally distorted in the \nsense that it allows large profitable corporations to pay, in some \ncases--in many cases--zero. In fact, last year--it would be funny if it \nreally was not pathetic--as I understand it, ExxonMobil, which made $19 \nbillion, paid nothing in taxes. Bank of America--Bank of America got a \nhuge bailout from the American taxpayer, paying their executives all \nkinds of fancy, huge compensation packages--got a refund check from the \nIRS. That is how absurd the situation is. And people say: Oh, my word, \nin order to deal with our deficit, we are going to have to cut back on \nMedicare and Medicaid and education. We cannot afford it. I guess we \ncan afford to allow ExxonMobil, the most profitable corporation in the \nhistory of the world, to make huge sums of money and pay nothing in \ntaxes. We can afford to do that, but we cannot afford to protect \nworking families and the middle class.\n  In the year 2005, one out of every four large corporations in the \nUnited States paid no Federal income tax on revenue of $1.1 trillion. \nNow, what do you think? Maybe before we start cutting Social Security \nand Medicare and Medicaid and veterans programs, we would want to ask \nsome of these very large and profitable corporations to pay at least \nsomething in taxes? From 1998 to 2005, two out of every three \ncorporations in the United States paid no Federal income taxes, \naccording to the GAO report.\n  Sadly, the economic pain millions of people are experiencing did not \neven begin as a result of the Wall Street bailout. The middle class was \ncollapsing long before that. It is wrong to blame Bush for all the \nproblems. He contributed a lot to it but not all of it. That trend has \nbeen going on for many years.\n  As the Washington Post reported last January--let me quote from an \narticle because, again, I want to put the economic reality facing the \nmiddle class in contrast to the economic reality facing the very rich \nin the broad context of this agreement signed by the President and the \nRepublican leadership. As the Washington Post reported last January:\n\n       The past decade--\n\n  The Bush 8 years plus 2 years--\n\n     was the worst for the U.S. economy in modern times. . . .\n       It was, according to a wide range of data, a lost decade \n     for American workers.\n\n  ``A lost decade for American workers.'' Do you know why people are \nfurious? Do you know why they are angry at Washington and everybody \nelse? The last decade was, according to the Washington Post, a lost \ndecade for American workers.\n\n       There has been zero net job creation since December 1999.\n\n  Twelve years of zero job creation, which is why unemployment is so \nhigh, not only for the general population but even worse for our young \npeople, kids getting out of high school, young people graduating \ncollege.\n  According to the Washington Post--this came from the Washington Post \nin January:\n\n       Middle-income households made less in 2008, when adjusted \n     for inflation, than they did in 1999. . . .\n\n  In other words, the American economy has turned into a nightmare for \ntens of millions of families. Imagine that.\n\n       Middle-income households made less in 2008, when adjusted \n     for inflation, than they did in 1999--and the number is sure \n     to have declined further during a difficult 2009.\n\n  They did not have those numbers, but because of the Wall Street \ncollapse, that certainly is the case.\n  So what are we talking about? We are talking about, as I have just \ndemonstrated, the people on top seeing a doubling of their income, \nwhile their effective tax rates are going down. You are seeing the \nmiddle class collapsing.\n  What this agreement says is that we are going to provide huge tax \nbreaks for millionaires and billionaires. That is insane. Only within \nthe beltway could an agreement such as that be negotiated.\n  As I mentioned earlier, in the last 3 days, we have received \nthousands and thousands and thousands of phone calls and e-mails to my \noffice, and over 98 percent--I daresay 99 percent--say this is not a \ngood agreement, do not support it.\n  Mr. President, I have been joined on the floor by the very \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Louisiana. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to enter into a colloquy with Senator \nLandrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Landrieu very much for joining us here. \nI wondered if the Senator could give the American people her thoughts \nabout this agreement and what has been going on.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \neloquent and passionate presentation for hours this morning. He clearly \nhas presented to this Chamber and to the American people some stark \nrealities that are unpleasant. Some people might even find them hard to \nbelieve. But he has done his homework. He has documented what he said. \nIn that backdrop, it does make this agreement, made between the \nRepublican leadership and the President of the United States, even \nharder for some of us to understand.\n  I want to acknowledge, as the Senator said--I know there are \npressures on all sides, and time is running out; we have to make a \ndecision about tax cuts in a short period of time. We do not have the \nbenefit of several months or even half a year. I understand the \npressures of time. But as the Senator\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\nfrom Vermont pointed out, how about the pressures on the middle class? \nWhat about these pressures? What about this pain?\n  I was wondering, because I wanted to ask the Senator from Vermont--I \nwas not able to follow his entire presentation this morning--did he \nquote from the report ``Income Inequality and the Great Recession,'' \ndone by the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee, led by Charles \nSchumer? I ask the Senator, did you quote from this report?\n  Mr. SANDERS. We quoted from a number of studies, but not that one, I \nsay to the Senator.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to add in our colloquy, if the Senator is \naware, according to this report that just came out in September of this \nyear:\n\n       Income inequality has skyrocketed. Economists concur that \n     income inequality has risen dramatically over the past three \n     decades.\n       Middle-class incomes stagnated under President Bush. During \n     the recovery of the 1990s under President Clinton, middle-\n     class incomes grew at a healthy pace. However, during the \n     jobless recovery of the 2000s under President Bush, that \n     trend reversed course. Middle-class incomes continued to fall \n     well into the recovery, and never regained their 2001 high.\n\n  The report goes on to say--which is frightening, which is why I have \nbeen raising my voice in opposition so strongly to some parts of this \npackage--\n\n       High levels of income inequality may precipitate economic \n     crises.\n\n  In other words, if the middle class cannot see light at the end of \nthe tunnel and if the economy itself cannot grasp a way for the middle \nclass to grow, I say to the Senator, this recession may never end no \nmatter how much money you give to the very wealthy. This is the reality \nwe are facing at this moment--how to end this recession.\n\n  Republicans weren't completely to blame for it, Democrats weren't \ncompletely innocent, or vice versa. It is not about who to blame, it is \nabout how to fix it. We are about to pick up a $980 billion hammer next \nweek in an attempt to fix it. Are we hitting the nail right? We don't \nhave many $980 billion hammers to pick up. We are borrowing this one. \nSo let's get it right. This is an important issue before our country. I \nthink that is what the Senator is saying.\n  Am I putting words into the Senator's mouth? Is this what the Senator \nis trying to explain?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Exactly. The point cannot be understated. What Senator \nLandrieu is saying is that if you have a collapsing middle class and \npeople are unable to purchase anything, it impacts the entire economy. \nThe economy can't grow. We can't grow jobs if people don't have enough \nmoney to buy products made by other people. If all or a substantial \npart of the wealth in this Nation accrues in the hands of a few, they \nget three yachts and eight airplanes, I guess, but there is a limit to \nwhat they can purchase.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. And there is a limit to what they can consume.\n  What the Senator from Vermont is saying and what I am saying--I want \nto be very clear, because the Senator and I don't agree on every piece \nof legislation. He tends to be a little bit more liberal and \nprogressive in his politics than I am, but on this subject we are both \nequally concerned about the shrinking of the middle class. From my \nperspective--the Senator may have a different view--I am talking about \nthe broad middle class: incomes of $50,000 to $500,000. In my State, \n$500,000 of income--not net worth but income--is a huge amount of \nmoney. In fact, I brought a graph to show that 84 percent of the \nhouseholds in Louisiana--when I talk about middle class--84 percent of \nthe households in Louisiana make less than $75,000. I said 84 percent. \nMost people in Louisiana--most--believe they are in the middle class, \nbut 84 percent make below $75,000.\n  So when I use the term middle class--and we all have a different \nview--I am saying the broad middle class with incomes between $50,000 \nand $500,000. If you have $500,000 in income, you are quite wealthy in \nLouisiana, but I realize we are not New York, Connecticut, or \nCalifornia. Maybe if you make $500,000 or $400,000 in some of these \nplaces, you don't consider yourself very wealthy or rich. I think by \nLouisiana standards you would be, but this is a big nation. So I want \nto be as broad as I can possibly be here. I am not talking about the \nwealthy being $400,000 or $500,000. That may not be the case in \nCalifornia. But what we are talking about in this tax bill is borrowing \n$50 billion to give tax breaks to families earning over $1 million. So \nas the Senator from Vermont said, whether you put your mark at $250,000 \nor $500,000--we can disagree about how broad the middle class is, but \nis there anyone--anyone--anyone in this Chamber on either side of the \naisle from any State who believes seriously, giving what the Senator \nfrom Vermont just outlined--which is really not debatable; these \neconomic studies are not just from one side of the aisle or another--\nthat we should actually next week provide $50 billion in extended \nbenefits for the families in America who are making more than $1 \nmillion a year? Should we do that when the inequities are so great, \nwhen the needs of the middle class are so great, when there is no \nevidence to suggest from any I have seen that is convincing that even \nafter this tax cut the recession will end? We are doing this for 2 \nyears. What happens if the recession doesn't end and we have borrowed \nall of this money to provide the extension of these tax cuts, as well \nas giving $50 billion to the $1 million earners in this country? What \ndo we do then? Go borrow another trillion and try it again? I think we \nhave to try something different.\n  I don't know if the Senator has another point before I go into a few \nthoughts.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me ask the Senator--and I thank her very much and I \nagree with what she has been saying. I was mentioning earlier the calls \ncoming in and the e-mails coming into my office are overwhelming: 99 \npercent against this. Are you getting similar calls?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am getting calls, and I am getting about 50 percent \nfor and 50 percent against. The State of Louisiana is a little \ndifferent than the State of Vermont. Many of the calls coming in from \naround the country are against giving--well, actually, let me say this: \nMost of the calls coming in are absolutely against giving tax cuts to \npeople over $1 million.\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is what I am talking about.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Overwhelmingly, people are calling in and saying, Is \nthat really happening? In fact, my office told me today that actually \n10 people called who had incomes over $1 million, which I found very \ninteresting, to say they supported my position: Tell Senator Landrieu I \nmake $1 million a year and I agree with her. So I know people are \nlistening. I thank those callers. They make $1 million every year and \nthey said, Please, use the money for somebody else or something else. I \nam doing fine. I am counting my blessings. I survived the recession. \nThey know that 33,000 people are getting ready to run out of \nunemployment benefits in Louisiana alone if we don't extend it. They \nknow middle-class families making over $75,000 in income or $200,000 in \nincome or even $500,000--you can have $300,000 of income in Louisiana \nand be a strong businessperson and doing very well, and have eight \nchildren. The Presiding Officer has large families out in the West. We \nhave very large families in the South. No one ever gives us credit \nenough, I think, for that. People work very hard, a mother and a \nfather. Their income might be $200,000, $250,000, but with six \nchildren, that doesn't go that far these days. I grew up in a \nneighborhood where we routinely had 12 children in a house. How much \nmoney do you think you have to make to feed and clothe and send to \ncollege 12 children? My father sent nine of us to college. We never \nmade anywhere near that money. I still think it was a miracle any of us \never got there.\n  But, nonetheless, the issue is next week we are going to debate this \nagreement. I wish to say I support extending tax cuts to the middle \nclass, to the broad middle class. But there is something terribly wrong \nhere in Denmark. Something is not right in Denmark if we are spending \nor borrowing $50 billion, which is about what it costs to extend income \ntax rates, the lower rate and the dividend rates, and the capital gains \nrates to people making over $1 million.\n  Someone on the radio today said, Well, Senator, don't you think \ngiving\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\ntax cuts will stimulate the economy? I said, No. I am not an economist, \nbut every economist I have read on this tax package says that is one of \nthe least stimulative--am I correct, Senator--one of the least \nstimulative provisions of the bill.\n  I want to know next week, when we are debating this, I would like at \nleast one Republican--just one--it could be the minority leader Mitch \nMcConnell, it could be the budget chairman Judd Gregg, it could be just \none Republican--to give a passionate argument for why they insisted \nthis be in the package. I would like to listen to it. I would like to \nhear it with my own ears. What was it about it that they thought was so \nimportant that they had to have it in the package? Because I know, as \nangry as I am with the President right now about some matters, I know \nthe President did not insist this be in the package. I know enough \nabout him to know that he didn't call everybody in the room and say, \nOh, we forgot something. Let's make sure this tax extension includes \npeople making over $1 million. I know he didn't give that speech. I \nwant to know who did. Who did give it, because your constituents should \nknow about it. And the American people have a right to know. That is \none thing about our democracy, it is open. It could be more open. We \ncould be like Britain where they all stand up and talk at one another \nin one of the rooms. It is very interesting. I find it very interesting \nto watch sometimes. We don't do that, but at least if the people of \nBritain want to know what their people are saying, they can hear them.\n  Somebody said this. I would like to know who, and where, and when. \nWas it in the Oval Office? Was it in the cloakroom? Because I am going \nto be forced to vote--because now, I think the Senator understands, we \naren't going to have any amendments, so I am going to be forced to vote \nand have to choose, which is going to be a very tough choice, between \nextending tax cuts for 84 percent of the people in my State who make \nless than $75,000--which of course I want to do. Even though we have to \nborrow the money to do it, we can't not do it. The economic \ncircumstances are such that we have to do it. But now, in order to get \nthem help, I have to say yes to something that I have talked about--and \nI want to be serious about this; I am very serious about it--that, for \nme, borders on moral recklessness.\n\n  I have been criticized on both sides of this debate. How can you use \nwords like this? I don't know. I went to Catholic school. We went to \nmass almost every week. Every week the priest would say, Don't take \nmore than you need. Don't be greedy. Share with others. Did I go to the \nwrong school? So I would like to know. Maybe those lessons were missed \non the other side. I don't normally speak like this. I have been \ncriticized for it. I am very, very torn, because I like to be part of a \nteam.\n  I understand, I say to the Senator from Vermont, that we can't have \nevery package exactly the way we believe. I understand that. I have had \nto vote for some things that were hard for me to stomach, and I have \ndone it because there were other good things in the bill. That is the \nway the process works. But I actually cannot remember a time on either \nan appropriations bill of this magnitude or a tax bill of this \nmagnitude that we have been asked to cast a vote for something that on \nits face is so reckless, so unnecessary, so sort of in your face to the \npoor, in your face to the middle class. We are going to take our money. \nDon't you say a word about it.\n  Who said that? Did Warren Buffett come down here and ask for it? Did \nBoone Pickens come down here and ask for it? Did the Gateses come down \nhere and ask for it? Who asked for it? Why do you think you deserve it, \nand what Senator put their name on it?\n  I have a few more things to say. I don't want to keep the Senator \nfrom Vermont tied up.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Quite the contrary. The Senator from Louisiana is making \nsome very important points. I appreciate it and I look forward to \nhearing what she has to say.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you. I wish to say a few other things about this \nwhole situation, because the Senator from Vermont and I agree on some \nthings and parts of this--obviously this part--but we had a big \ndifference. I wanted to show this from my perspective.\n  I voted for the original tax cuts. I am not sure the Senator from \nVermont did. There were very good reasons on both sides. I wish to take \na minute, because I have, as I said, critics on both sides, and I want \nto explain--not explain, but share some thoughts about that and make \nsomething very clear.\n  I was one of 12 Democrats--there are only 7 of us left--in the \nChamber today who voted for the Bush tax cuts. We were for the middle \nclass and the poor and the wealthy. Everybody got income tax relief, \ncapital gains tax relief, dividend tax relief. Senator Lincoln and I \nand others worked very hard to make sure that in that package--even \nthough I would have designed it differently if I could have done it \nmyself, but there are no czars around here. This is a democracy. I \nunderstand that. I have been doing it for 30 years. We worked hard to \nshape that package the best we could to direct it and target it to the \nmiddle class. There are many critics of that who say you didn't do it \nwell enough. You didn't send it to the middle class. You sent it to the \nwealthy. I disagree. I think we did as well as we could to send it to \nthe middle class, although the higher brackets were lowered as well. \nBut I will tell my colleagues the big difference was, it was paid for \nwhen we voted for it. There was a $128 billion annual surplus. In other \nwords, we were spending $128 billion less than we were taking in. What \na happy time that was. We were paying for our Pell grants. We were \npaying for education. We were paying for health care. We had surpluses \nin Social Security, the Senator will remember, and we had a $128 \nbillion surplus that year alone, and surpluses as far as the eye can \nsee. This is before 9/11.\n  So the 12 of us--let me speak just for myself--I thought, what a \nsituation this is. Democrats had taken the tough vote. Not one \nRepublican had voted for this budget reconciliation. As the Chair \nknows, as he was then in the House and took a tough vote with the \nDemocrats to put us on that path, the middle class was expanding. Jobs \nwere being created. We were creating millionaires. Yes, I love creating \nmore millionaires. It is why I got into politics--one of the reasons. I \nlike when people are successful. I love to hear stories about my \nconstituents who came from poor families, whose mothers were household \nservants, whose fathers never went to high school--I love to hear about \nsmart little girls from Gert Town who got straight As in school, went \ndown the street to Xavier University, got their premed degree, and then \nwent on to become a doctor, and now they are millionaires. I don't \ndecry that. I celebrate it. I have fought for them to get their \nscholarships--not individually but generally. It is what I do. It is \nwhat Senators and House Members do.\n  I am so mad at people saying to me, as a Democrat, that we don't like \npeople who are rich; that we have something against them. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  I love the book, ``The Millionaire Next Door.'' It talks about how it \nis a myth that most millionaires in America have inherited their money. \nThe fact is, we have created such a great country over 250 years. We \nhave actually found the way for poor people to go from nothing to huge \nwealth and to create a life-changing opportunity for their children and \ngrandchildren. We celebrate it, write movies about it, and our \nlibraries are full of books about it. There is nothing wrong with that.\n  So when we had a surplus, I thought we should give tax breaks and use \nsome of that money. But, today, we are being asked to provide tax cuts, \nwhen the deficit is--I want to get this number correct because it is \nshocking--10 times greater than the surplus; it is $1.294 trillion. \nThat is what the annual deficit is this year. When we did the tax cuts, \nwe were generating a $128 billion surplus every year--surpluses as far \nas the eye could see. We thought maybe we should give a third of this \nbounty in tax cuts, and we made investments in other things. But, \ntoday, after what the Senator from Vermont has described as the \neconomic inequality in the country, when we have no surplus in sight, \nthe biggest, largest, most ferocious recession since the Great \nDepression, and we are running an annual deficit of $1.29 trillion--\nsomeone had the nerve on the other\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nside of the aisle to say: Wait, before you close the deal, before you \nshut the door, before you stop the printing press, please put in the \npeople in America who make over $1 million.\n  Now, for that $50 billion, there are lots of ways that we could save \nif we could correct this deal. I don't think we can. But if we could, \nas the Senator knows, do we have men and women in the military--does he \nknow what their COLA will be this year? I think it is only 1.4 percent.\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is what my understanding is. I think a lot of the \nfolks in the military are very upset about that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Every person in uniform is only getting a COLA this \nyear of 1.4 percent. Did anybody over there not think about this when \nthey raised their hand to say let's give it to millionaires? Those in \nthe military most certainly deserve a bonus. They are coming back \nwithout eyes or legs; they are leaving some of their limbs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Did anybody over there think about that?\n  The senior citizens for whom the Senator has been such an advocate \nare not seeing the kind of COLA they normally get. Talk about stimulus, \nI think every dollar you give to a senior citizen--wouldn't the Senator \nsay--gets spent right away. They have to buy food with it. They are not \ngoing out perusing a yacht or an airplane they could or could not buy. \nThey need to eat. They go to the corner drugstore; they need to get \ntheir medicine. They spend it. Yes, we give money to the poor on the \nDemocratic side and the middle class because it is the right thing to \ndo. It actually happens to be also the smart thing to do for the \neconomy and for jobs.\n  So when people say the Senator has flip-flopped on taxes, I don't \nunderstand how to say it differently. I voted for tax cuts when we had \na surplus. I am challenged about how to address this package--I most \ncertainly want to extend it for the middle class and to extend help for \nthe unemployment. People are unemployed not because they are lazy, for \nHeaven's sake. They are unemployed because there are no jobs for them. \nIt is some of the longest term unemployment we have had in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  So the other side is making us feel--they say: We gave you the \nunemployment, so surely you should give us the tax breaks for \nmillionaires. Is that really an equal trade? If somebody believes that \nactually--I have heard commentators say it on different networks. I \nhave been on these news programs, and they say: You got the \nunemployment, so that is a fair trade.\n  If there is a Senator who thinks that, I would love them to say that \nnext week. I think that would be great to have on the record. So this \nsituation is what the Louisiana families in my State are facing. \nObviously, I would like to provide tax relief for these families. We \nhave less than 1.8 percent who are making over $200,000. I am checking \nright now to find out how many families in Louisiana actually make over \n$1 million. I was told it was 3,200. That number might be too high. The \nSenator from West Virginia told me that in his State it is 599 people \nwho make over $1 million a year. Yet it looks like that is the package.\n  We are going to be in a tough situation, without amendments, having \nto vote for it. I will see what my constituents are saying over the \nweekend. I want to say one more thing about this inequity and turn it \nback over to the Senator from Vermont. Besides the other things that \nwere put into the Record about the inequality, the challenges before \nour country right now, I came across some data, and I would like the \nSenator to be on the floor to listen to this.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am not going anywhere. You can take as much time as \nyou want.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wasn't sure what his time was. I am chair of the \nSmall Business Committee. I have many hearings, but I had one in the \nlast 3 months and some of the testimony was startling to me. I wanted \nto share this with the Senator.\n  It is in the 2000 census data. Someone was testifying about why this \nrecession was taking so long to get over. They were giving figures \nabout the status of the economy and the wealth or incomes of broad \nsections of the population. They said sort of off the cuff--like, ho-\nhum, today is Monday.\n\n  They said: By the way, the average net worth, the median net worth of \nhouseholds in America, the average--median net worth--not income but \nnet worth--of households is $67,000. That is very interesting. I \nthought it would be higher than that. That is taking what you own minus \neverything you owe, and the difference is your net worth. I thought \npeople might have more than that in terms of equity in their homes, a \ncouple hundred thousand. That was concerning to me.\n  I said: Do you have that broken down by race, by any chance?\n  They said: Yes, ma'am.\n  I said: Would you share it? And they did. I will share it with you \nbecause I have not recovered from what I heard.\n  The gentlemen said to me: Well, for White families in America, the \naverage median--50 percent more, 50 percent less--is $87,000. For \nHispanic families, it is $8,000. For African-American families, it is \n$5,000.\n  I want to repeat that. Fifty percent of all families in America who \nare Caucasian, their net worth is $67,000 or less. For Hispanic \nfamilies in America, 50 percent of all Hispanic households, their net \nworth is $8,000. For African-American families today, in 2010--40 years \nafter the peak of the civil rights movement and 150 years or so after \nthe Civil War and all the things we think we have done to try to get \npeople in a more equal position in our society--it is $5,000. That is \nincluding home equity--or home ownership, I mean. Without home \nownership, that net worth for African-American families falls to \n$1,000.\n  So when people say people are in pain and suffering and anxious and \nthey can't buy anything, you wonder why. There is no cushion in a \nrecession like this. How brutal is a recession to people who have so \nlittle a cushion? For a middle-class family of any race, if you lose \nyour job, you can get unemployment, you have some equity in your home, \nor maybe you have some savings you can fall back on. There is a \ncushion, and you can bounce back up. How brutal is this recession to \nmillions of families in America who have no cushion? They are just \nhitting hard rock. They are hitting steel. There is no cushion there. \nYou wonder why people are angry. You wonder why this tea party movement \nis festering, why people are so angry. I understand that anger. I am so \nangry myself, I don't know what to do.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I can interrupt my good friend, she is right. It is \nno great secret that her politics and mine aren't the same on many \nissues. She is down here speaking from her heart, coming from the State \nof Louisiana, which is not radically different from Vermont. We have a \nlot of struggling families.\n  I want to reiterate a point. She has been talking so effectively \nabout the stress on the middle class and working families in her State \nand around the country. I want to reiterate this point. I am not here \nto pick on George W. Bush, but during his 8 years, the wealthiest 400 \nAmericans--pretty high up guys; that ``ain't'' the middle class no \nmatter how broadly you define that--their income more than doubled--got \nthat--while their income tax rate dropped almost in half.\n  The wealthiest 400 Americans now earn an average of $345 million a \nyear and pay an effective tax rate of 16.6 percent, on average. That is \nthe lowest tax rate for wealthy individuals on record.\n  So the point is, Senator Landrieu and I are talking about the people \nout in the real world who are working longer hours for lower wages. \nMedian family income has declined. People are scared that for the first \ntime in our modern history their kids will have a lower standard of \nliving than they had.\n  Is the Senator hearing that in Louisiana?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Senator Landrieu is asking a simple question, and \nmillions of people are asking the same question. The wealthiest people \nare becoming much richer, the middle class is declining, and poverty is \nincreasing. Who decided? Who said billionaires need an extended tax \nbreak and a reduction in the estate tax? It is a very simple question \nshe is asking. It is a very profound question because it speaks to what \nthis country is all about. I didn't mean to interrupt.\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I commend to my \ncolleagues this report entitled ``Income Inequality and the Great \nRecession'' from Senator Schumer and the Joint Economic Committee. I \nask unanimous consent that the Executive Summary be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Income Inequality and the Great Recession\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       This week, the U.S. Census Bureau will release new \n     statistics on income inequality in the United States, \n     allowing for an assessment of the impact of the Great \n     Recession on our nation's income distribution. In preparation \n     for that data release, the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) \n     analyzed income inequality in the United States in the years \n     preceding the Great Recession, and found:\n       Income inequality has skyrocketed. Economists concur that \n     income inequality has risen dramatically over the past three \n     decades.\n       Middle-class incomes stagnated under President Bush. During \n     the recovery of the 1990s under President Clinton, middle-\n     class incomes grew at a healthy pace. However, during the \n     jobless recovery of the 2000s under President Bush, that \n     trend reversed course. Middle-class incomes continued to fall \n     well into the recovery, and never regained their 2001 high. \n     The first year of the Great Recession dealt a sharp blow to \n     middle-class families, who had not yet recovered from the \n     pain of the last recession.\n       High levels of income inequality may precipitate economic \n     crises. Peaks in income inequality preceded both the Great \n     Depression and the Great Recession, suggesting that high \n     levels of income inequality may destabilize the economy as a \n     whole.\n       Income inequality may be part of the root cause of the \n     Great Recession. Stagnant incomes for all but the wealthiest \n     Americans meant an increased demand for credit, fueling the \n     growth of an unsustainable credit bubble. Bank deregulation \n     allowed financial institutions to create new exotic products \n     in which the ever-richer rich could invest. The result was a \n     bubble-based economy that came crashing down in late 2007.\n       Policymakers have a great deal of leverage in mitigating \n     income inequality in order to stabilize the macro-economy. In \n     the decades following the Great Depression, policy decisions \n     helped keep income inequality low while allowing for \n     continued economic growth. In contrast, policy decisions made \n     during the economic expansion during the Bush administration \n     failed to keep income inequality in check, and may have \n     exacerbated the problem. Policymakers working to rebuild the \n     economy in the wake of the Great Recession should heed these \n     lessons and pay particular attention to policy options that \n     mitigate economic inequality.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to go back to a point about this \nso that I am not misunderstood. I guess no matter what I say critics \nwill take it and do what they will with it, but I am not against tax \ncuts. I voted for them many times in my life when we had surpluses. I \nhave even been pressured to vote for things, and have done so, when we \ndidn't have the surpluses, but they were targeted and focused and there \nactually had been some rational thought attached to where we might need \nto borrow some money and spend it, such as in the stimulus package, \nbecause in that instance, if we didn't get some spending going, we \ncould slip further into a recession. Even conservative economists \ncounseled us on parts of the stimulus package.\n  By the way, contrary to popular myth, that was about the same size as \nthis package. This package is actually larger. This package is going to \nbe $900 billion. The stimulus was $800-something. It was less. But in \nthat stimulus package about a third was tax cuts. Remember that, Mr. \nPresident? A third of that was tax cuts. It wasn't all just spending. \nBut every economist--conservative, liberal--said the government has got \nto step up and spend in this economy because this place is shutting \ndown--meaning the country--and so we did.\n  People will still argue on the other side that was the wrong thing to \ndo and we shouldn't have done it. But I am here to say that without the \n$2.8 billion in tax cuts and spending that went to Louisiana through \nthat stimulus package--and my State legislature is struggling to \nbalance the budget, as I speak; they have been in the budget committee \nover the past couple of weeks--I don't know where we would be today. I \ndon't know how much went to Vermont or California or how much went to \nColorado, but people say it was a failure. Well, let me say that $2.8 \nbillion went to our State and it warded off some Draconian cuts that \nour cities and counties and parishes would have had to make, and it \nwarded off tax increases so that Governors didn't have to raise taxes \nand mayors didn't have to raise taxes all over this country. Some of \nthem have done that, but they have tried to limit it because they know \nhow fragile this middle class is.\n  I am not unmindful of the importance of providing tax cuts when we \ncan. But when we are asked to vote on a package that has a provision \nsuch as this, that borders on moral recklessness, I have to catch my \nbreath and ask: Whose idea was this? I wish to know.\n  It is going to be a long weekend. It will be a long 30 hours of \ndebate. I am glad the Senator from Vermont is going to make sure we \ntake every one of those 30 hours postcloture, if we even get to cloture \non this bill, because I think the American people are going to be \nwaiting around to find out whose idea was that.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I can interrupt the Senator from Louisiana, because \nshe makes a very important point, we are a democracy and it is the \nAmerican people who make the decisions. I know she shares with me the \nbelief that the American people have to become engaged in this very \nimportant debate, which has a lot to do with the future of this \ncountry.\n  Senator Landrieu asks a very simple question, which I would like--and \nI think the American people would like--an answer to: Whose brilliant \nidea was it--at a time when we have seen an explosion in income and \nwealth to the people on top, while their tax rates have already gone \ndown--that we drive up the national debt and ask our kids to pay higher \ntaxes to pay off that debt in order to give tax breaks to people who \ndon't need them? That is the question Senator Landrieu is asking. I \nthink the American people need an answer to that, and my hope is that \nmillions of Americans will start calling their Senators to ask that \nquestion.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Was it your idea? Whose idea was it?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Whose idea was it?\n  The irony here--and I think Senator Landrieu made this point as \nwell--is that there are plenty of millionaires out there who say: I \ndon't need it. I am more worried about the crumbling infrastructure or \nour kids out there than giving me a tax break I don't need. Thanks very \nmuch. That is what Warren Buffett has said. It is what Bill Gates has \nsaid. Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's has said it. Many millionaires have \nsaid it. We are giving some of these guys something they do not even \nwant.\n  I want to thank Senator Landrieu very much, not only for her being \nhere today--and please continue--but for raising these important \nissues.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. One more point, and then I will turn this back over to \nthe Senator.\n  I was on the Greta Van Susteren show last night. I have said Greta is \nalways a tough interviewer, but she is fair, so I am happy to go on her \nprogram. And it was a tough interview. But we debated these things, and \nI think that is important. I think it is important to debate them here, \non TV, and in townhall meetings. That is what democracy is all about. \nBut she said to me: Senator, we are so frustrated. Nobody ever hears \nanybody say they want to cut spending, or they want to eliminate waste, \nfraud, and abuse. So let me concede this point. For me, I don't think \nwe do talk enough about eliminating the waste, eliminating the fraud, \nand eliminating the abuse. I think we should spend more time, and I am \ngoing to commit myself to that, because I know the American people say: \nEvery time we ask for a tax cut, you say we can't afford it. Why don't \nyou cut some spending, et cetera.\n  Let me state that I voted for tax cuts. I am for tax cuts. I have \neven given tax cuts to people who do make higher than the $75,000 or \n$100,000 or $250,000, when we had a surplus, when I thought it was the \nfiscally responsible thing to do. Other people can disagree, but this \nis the first time I am being asked to provide a tax cut for people \nearning over $1 million with this kind of deficit.\n  But I will say this: I am going to commit myself to trying to find \nplaces we can cut. I support the Federal freeze. I support it in \nappropriations this year. Senator Inouye is taking down on the \nappropriations level $8 billion below the President's budget, and\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\nif we need to go even further, perhaps we can. But we have to be \ncareful where we cut, and I ask people to be rational about this. Do \nyou want to cut Pell grants? I looked at this the other day, I say to \nthe Senator from Vermont, particularly, because of Claiborne Pell. When \nthe Pell grant went into effect, it was a grant to help kids go to \nschool. That is still what it does. But in the 1970s, the Pell grant \npaid 100 percent of the average 2-year college. It only pays 50 percent \nof that today. I think I remember it paid almost 60 percent of a 4-year \npublic college. It only pays like 40 percent or less than that today \nbecause we have not kept up with it.\n  A program such as the Pell grant is a powerful tool to lift the \nmiddle class, or lift the poor out of poverty and expand the middle \nclass. So when we cut programs, let's be careful to cut the waste, to \ncut the abuse, but let's not cut the heart out of what we are arguing \nfor--effective tools to expand the middle class--or we will never get \nout of this recession. Because I promise you, the few thousand people \nin this country--or few tens of thousands, I don't know how many who \nmake more than $1 million a year--are not going to lift this country \nout of a recession. It is going to be the middle class. And if we don't \nhelp them get ahead, if we don't help them get training, this recession \nwill go on for a long time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I want to add the idea that when we think about cutting \nback on education--whether it is childcare, primary school, or \ncollege--we are simply cutting off our noses to spite our faces. The \nSenator is aware that where, at one time in this country, we used to \nlead the world in the number of our people who graduated college, we \nare now falling very significantly. How do you become a great economy \nif you don't have the scientists, the engineers, the teachers, the \nprofessionals out there, and many other countries around the world are \nhaving a higher percentage of their high school graduates going to \ncollege? That is something we have to address. Anyone who comes forward \nand says cut education is moving us in exactly the wrong direction.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Exactly. And I am for more accountability. If some of \nmy colleagues on the other side think some of that money is being \nwasted or we are not getting our bang for the buck, don't come with an \nacross-the-board cut to Pell grants, come with a plan to change it, \nsaying these are the requirements for our universities: You have to \ngraduate 65 percent of the kids who start or you have to have certain \nbenchmarks before you can apply for these loans or for these grants.\n  This country is at a crossroads, and I know the President and his \nadvisers understand the extraordinary challenges before this country. I \nhope the Members understand the economic danger, the minefield we are \nin here. We can't make too many mistakes here. There is no cushion \nleft. There is no surplus left. We are down to below bottom. So when we \ndo big things such as this--and this is a big thing, this $980 billion \nbig package, it is almost $1 trillion--we need to do it the best way we \ncan do it. We can't do it recklessly or frivolously. We can't do it for \nideology, for gosh almighty's sakes.\n  I wish we could have fought harder for a better package. I have not \nyet decided how I am going to vote, but I have said if I vote, I am not \nvoting quietly. I may vote yes, I may vote no, but I will vote with a \nloud voice about what I am concerned about, what I believe my \nconstituents are concerned about, and I will try my best to help them, \nto support them, and to make the best decisions we can next week. But \nthis has been troubling me, and so I wanted to come to the floor and \nspeak about it, and I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Landrieu very much for coming, and I \nthink she knows that on many issues her views and mine are different, \nbut on this issue, I believe we are speaking for the overwhelming \nmajority of the people, not just of Louisiana and Vermont but all over \nthis country, who cannot understand why we give tax breaks to \nbillionaires to drive up the deficit and the national debt at a time \nwhen the deficit and the debt are so large. I want to thank Senator \nLandrieu very much for her very articulate and heartfelt statements. I \nappreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, I was mentioning a moment ago the great contrast about \nwhat is happening in our economy between the people on top and \neverybody else. I indicated that the top 400 families during the Bush \nPresidency alone saw their income more than double, at the same time, \nby the way, as their income tax rates dropped almost in half. So that \nis what is going on for the people on top, who would make out extremely \nwell under this agreement between the President and the Republican \nleadership.\n  But I also talked about what is going on with the middle class and \nworking families of this country. If you can believe it--and this is \nquite amazing--since December of 1999--and this was in a Washington \nPost article in January--there has been a zero net job creation--a zero \nnet job creation. Middle-income households made less in 2008, when \nadjusted for inflation, than they did in 1999, and that number is sure \nto have declined further in 2009.\n  What does that mean? It means that when you look at a 10-year \nperiod--and people work very hard--in many instances--actually, in the \nvast majority of instances--you will have both husbands and wives \nworking and still not making enough money to pay the bills. In fact, \nthey have less money than they used to have.\n  When I was a kid growing up, the experience was that in the middle \nclass one person--I know young people will not believe this, but it is \ntrue--years ago in the United States, before the great global economy, \nbefore robotics, before computers, one person could work 40 hours a \nweek and earn enough money to pay the bills for the family. One person. \nToday, in Vermont and throughout this country, overwhelmingly you have \nhusbands and wives both working. And in some instances they are working \nvery long hours. But here is the rub: Today, a two-income family has \nless disposable income than a one-income family did 30 years ago \nbecause wages have not kept up with inflation, and because health care \ncosts have soared, the cost of education has soared, housing has \nsoared, and basic necessities have soared. This is a description of a \ncountry moving in the wrong direction.\n  Thirty years ago, a one-income family had more disposable income than \na two-income family does today. And there are a lot of reasons for \nthat. Maybe we will touch on them a little bit later. But one of them, \nin my view, has to do with our disastrous unfettered free trade policy, \nwhich has resulted in the shutdown of tens of thousands of factories in \nthis country. Under President Bush alone, we lost some 48,000 \nfactories. We went from 19 million manufacturing jobs to 12 million \nmanufacturing jobs, and in many instances, those were good jobs.\n  Where did they go? Some shut down for a variety of reasons. But \nothers shut down because we have trade laws that say you have to be a \nmoron not to shut down in America because if you go to China, go to \nVietnam, go to Mexico, go to a developing country, you pay workers \nthere a fraction of what you are paying the workers in America. Why \nwouldn't you go? Then you bring your products right back into this \ncountry.\n\n  A couple weeks ago, my wife and I did some Christmas shopping. \nFrankly--we went to couple stores--it is very hard to find a product \nmanufactured in the United States of America. You do not have to have a \nPh.D. in economics to understand we are not going to have a strong \neconomy unless we have a strong manufacturing capability, unless \ncompanies are reinvesting in Colorado or Vermont, creating good jobs \nhere. You do not have an economic future when virtually everything you \nare buying is coming from China or another country.\n  We are not just talking about low-end products. These are not \nsneakers or a pair of pants. This is increasingly high-tech stuff. We \nare forfeiting our future as a great economic nation unless we rebuild \nour industrial base and unless we create millions and millions of jobs \nproducing the goods and the products we consume. We cannot continue to \njust purchase products from the rest of the world.\n  When we talk about the collapse of the middle class, it is important \nto also recognize the fact, as reported in USA\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\nToday last September, ``the incomes of the young and middle-aged--\nespecially men--have fallen off a cliff since 2000, leaving many age \ngroups poorer than they were even in the 1970s.'' The point being, for \nyoung workers, for example, when we had a manufacturing base in America \nin the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, you could graduate high school and go out \nand get a job in a factory. Was it a glamorous job? No. Was it a hard \njob? Yes. Was it a dirty job? In some cases.\n  But if you worked in manufacturing, and especially if you had a union \nbehind you, the likelihood is you earned wages to take your family into \nthe middle class, you had decent health care coverage, and you might \neven have a strong pension. Where are all those jobs now? During the \nBush years alone, we went from 19 million jobs in manufacturing to 12 \nmillion jobs, a horrendous loss of manufacturing jobs. If you are a kid \ntoday in Colorado or Vermont and you are not of a mind, for whatever \nreason, to go to college--30 or 40 years ago you could go out, get a \njob in factory, and make some money. Today, what are your options? You \ncan get a minimum wage job at McDonald's or maybe at Walmart, where \nbenefits are minimal or nonexistent. That is a significant transition \nof the American economy.\n  I wish to tell you something else, when we talk about manufacturing. \nIt did not get a whole lot of publicity, but it is worth reporting. The \ngood news is, we have recently seen--after the loss of many thousands \nof jobs in the automobile industry--we have seen the auto companies, \nChrysler and others, starting to rehire. What I think has not been \nwidely reported is, the wages of the new workers who are being hired \nare 50 percent of the wages of the older workers in the plant. You are \ngoing to have workers working side by side, where an older worker who \nhas been there for years is making $25, $28 an hour, and right next to \nhim a new hire is making $14 an hour. If you understand that the \nautomobile industry was perhaps the gold standard for manufacturing in \nAmerica, what do you think is going to happen to the wages of blue-\ncollar workers in the future?\n  If all you can get with a union behind you in automobile \nmanufacturing is $14 an hour today, what are you going to make in \nColorado or in Vermont? Are you going to make $10 an hour or $11 an \nhour? Is that enough money on which to raise a family? Are you going to \nhave any benefits? Unlikely.\n  That is what happens when your manufacturing base disappears and \nthat, to a significant degree, in my view, is a result of a disastrous \ntrade policy. I have to tell you--and I think in hindsight most people \nagree I was right--when I was in the House and all the corporations in \nthe world were telling us how great NAFTA would be, free trade with \nMexico, I did not buy it. I was right. They would say: Oh, it is going \nto be even better. We will have free trade with China. Think about how \nlarge China is and all the American products they are going to buy over \nthere to create all kinds of jobs in the United States. I never \nbelieved it for a moment.\n  I will tell you a story. I was in China a number of years ago and as \npart of a congressional delegation we went to visit Walmart in China. \nThe Walmart store, amazingly enough, looked a lot like Walmart in \nAmerica--different products, but it looked like the same style. You \nwalk up and down the aisles and you see all these American products. I \nremember Wilson basketballs, Procter & Gamble soap products--different \nproducts there for the Chinese, but a lot of the products were American \nproducts. They looked pretty familiar.\n  I asked the guy who was there with us who was, I believe, the head of \nWalmart Asia--the guy in charge of all the Walmarts in Asia--I asked \nhim a simple question: Tell me, how many of these American company \nproducts are actually manufactured in the United States?\n  He was a little bit sheepish and a little bit hesitant and he said: \nWell, about 1 percent. Obviously, what everybody knew, it is a lot \ncheaper for the American companies to set up plants in China, hire \nChinese workers at 50 cents an hour, 75 cents an hour, whatever it is, \nand have them build the product for the Chinese markets than it is to \npay American workers $15 an hour, $20 an hour, provide health \ninsurance, deal with the union, deal with the environment. That is not \na great revelation. I think anybody could have figured that one out. \nBut the big money interests around here pushed it and Congress and \nPresident Clinton, at that time, signed it and we were off and running.\n  When we look at why the middle class is in the shape it is--and it is \nimportant to make sure everybody understands it because one of the \nthings that happens in this world, it is human nature I suppose, is \nthat people feel very guilty and responsible if they are not taking \ncare of their families. Right now we know, with unemployment so high--\nthis is not just cold statistics we are throwing out. These are people \nwho not only were earning an income that supported their families, they \nhad a sense of worth. Every human being wants to be productive. They \nwant to produce something. They want to be part of something. They want \nto go to work, earn a paycheck, bring it home. You feel good about \nthat.\n  Do you know what it does to somebody's sense of human worth when \nsuddenly you are sitting home watching the TV, you can't go out and \nearn a living? It destroys people. People be come alcoholic. People \ncommit suicide. People have mental breakdowns because they are not \nutilizing their skills. They are no longer being a productive member of \nsociety. That is what unemployment is about.\n  I think one of the reasons unemployment is so high, one of the \nreasons the middle class is collapsing, has a lot to do with these \ndisastrous trade policies. I have to tell you, as we have been talking \nabout all day long, these policies, these tax breaks, all this stuff \nemanates from corporate leaders whose sense of responsibility is such \nthat they want themselves to become richer, they want more and more \nprofits for their company, but they could care less about the needs of \nthe American people.\n  I remember there was one CEO of a large, one of our largest American \ncorporations, and he said: When I look at the future of General \nElectric, I see China, China, China, and China. By the way, we ended up \nbailing out that particular corporation. He didn't look to China to get \nbailed out, he looked to the taxpayers of this country.\n  But the word has to get out to corporate America, they are going to \nhave to start reinvesting in the United States of America. They are \ngoing to have to start building the products and the goods the American \npeople need rather than run all over in search of cheap labor. That is \nan absolute imperative if we are going to turn this economy around.\n  According to a Boston Globe article published last year--let me quote \nwhat they say. Again, I am trying to document here what is happening to \nthe working class of America because I do not want individual workers, \nsomebody who may be hearing this on the TV, the radio, to say: It is my \nfault. There is something wrong with me because I can't go out and get \na job.\n\n  You are not alone. The entire middle class is collapsing. Our economy \nis shedding millions and millions of jobs. I know there are people out \nthere trying hard to find work, but that work is just not there. That \nis why we have to rebuild the economy and create jobs. This is what the \nBoston Globe said last year: ``The recession has been more like a \ndepression for blue-collar workers. . . .''\n  This is an important point to be made here. When we talk about the \neconomy we kind of lump everybody together. That is wrong. The truth is \nright now in the economy people on top are doing very well. The \nunemployment rate for upper income people is very low. They are doing \nOK. That as opposed, as this Boston Globe article points out, to what \nis happening to blue collar workers: ``The recession has been more like \na depression for blue-collar workers, who are losing jobs much more \nquickly than the nation as a whole. . . .''\n  This is the working class of America. `` . . . the Nation's blue-\ncollar industries have slashed one in six jobs since 2007. . . .'' Let \nme repeat that. It is just astronomical, a fact.\n\n     . . . the nation's blue-collar industries [manufacturing] \n     have slashed one in six jobs since 2007, compared with about \n     one in 20 for all industries, leaving scores of the \n     unemployed competing for the rare job opening in construction \n     or manufacturing, with many unlikely to work in those fields \n     again.\n\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\n\n  Never.\n\n       Up to 70 percent of up employed blue-collar workers have \n     lost jobs permanently, meaning their old jobs won't be there \n     when the economy recovers.\n\n  That is the Boston Globe, last year. When we talk about the economy, \nwhat we have to do is understand that blue-collar workers, middle-\nclass, young workers are hurting very much. In the context, again, of \nthe debate we are now having, the discussion of whether we should \napprove the agreement reached between the President and the Republicans \non taxes, the idea of not significantly investing in our economy but, \nrather, giving tens of billions of dollars to the very rich in more tax \nbreaks makes no sense to many of us.\n  When we talk about why people are angry, why people, when asked the \nquestion by pollsters: Do you think America is moving in the right \ndirection, and overwhelmingly they think not, let me tell you why they \nthink not. This is just during the Presidency of President Bush from \n2001 through 2008. During that period alone--and by the way, the pain \nis certainly continuing right now. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. \nDuring those 8 years of Bush, over 8 million Americans slipped out of \nthe middle class and into poverty. Today, nearly 40 million Americans \nare living in poverty; 7.8 million Americans lost their health \ninsurance, and that is continuing.\n  A recent study came out and suggests that the uninsured now are about \n50 million Americans. Fifty million Americans have no health insurance \nnow. We hope health insurance reform will make a dent on that. I think \nit will. But as of today, without the major provisions of health care \nreform being implemented, 50 million Americans are without any health \ninsurance.\n  During that period--and we have not talked about this a whole lot--\nthere is another thing going on in the economy for the working class. \nYears and years ago, if you worked in a manufacturing plant, you had a \nunion, you stood a reasonable chance of having a pension--a pension. \nDuring the Bush years, 3.2 million workers lost their pensions, and \nabout half of American workers in the private sector have no pension \ncoverage whatsoever. The idea today of having a defined pension plan \nsignificantly paid for by your employer is going the way of the \ndinosaur. That is just not there anymore.\n  Workers are more and more dependent on Social Security, which has \nbeen there for 75 years, which we have to protect and demand that it \nwill be there another 75 years because right now millions of workers \nare losing their pensions. I mean, I am throwing these statistics out, \nand the reason I am doing that is I want people to appreciate that if \nyou are hurting now, stop being ashamed. It is not, yeah, we can all do \nbetter. Every one of us can do better. But you are in an economy which \nis contracting, especially for the middle class and working families.\n  According to an article in USA Today, from the year 2,000 to 2007, \nmiddle-class men--women have done better--middle-class men experienced \nan 11.2-percent drop in their incomes--a reduction of $7,700 after \nadjusting for inflation. Middle-class women in this age group saw a \n4.8-percent decline in their incomes as well. So they did pretty badly, \nbut the men did even worse. So what we are seeing is an understanding \nof why people are angry and why people think this country is moving in \nthe wrong direction.\n  I think most people understand that today our country is experiencing \nthe worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It \nis important to say that because, again, it is hard enough when you do \nnot have a job, when you do not have income, when your dignity and \nself-respect are declining, but I don't want people to be banging their \nown heads against the wall blaming themselves for all of the problems. \nSomething has gone on in the Nation as a whole. You are not in this \nalone. When we talk about working-class families all across the country \nseeing a decline in their income, it is not because people are lazy, it \nis not because people do not work hard, it is not because people are \nnot trying to find jobs. What we have is an economy which is rotting in \nthe middle, and we have to change the economy.\n  If there is anything we can say about the American people, we work \nhard. We, in fact, work longer hours than do the people of any other \ncountry, industrialized country, on Earth. We are not a lazy people. We \nare a hard-working people. If the jobs are there, people will take \nthem. If people have to work 60 hours a week or 70 hours a week, that \nis what they will do. But we have to rebuild this economy. We do not \nneed tax breaks for billionaires. We need to create jobs for the middle \nclass of this country so that we can put people back to work.\n  Let me take a few minutes to discuss how we got to where we are today \nand, in my view, what policies we need to move this country forward to \ncreate the kinds of jobs we desperately need.\n  Let's take a quick look back to where we were in January of 2009--it \nseems like a long time ago but just a couple of years ago. That was the \nlast month of the administration of President Bush. In that month, we \nlost over 700,000 jobs. That is an absolutely incredible number. In \nfact, during the last 6 months of the Bush Presidency, we lost over \n3\\1/2\\ million jobs, all of which was caused by the greed and \nrecklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.\n  Our gross domestic product, which is the total sum of all our economy \nproduces, had gone down by nearly 7 percent during the fourth quarter \nof 2008. That was the biggest decline in more than a quarter century. \nSome $5 trillion of America's wealth evaporated in a 12-week period, as \nthe people in Vermont and all over this country saw the value of their \nhomes, retirement savings, and stocks plummet.\n  I want to say just one word again about Wall Street greed because I \nthink for a variety of reasons we just do not talk about it enough. \nWhat you had was a situation in which a small number of folks at the \nhead of huge financial institutions, through their greed, through the \ndevelopment of very reckless policies, through illegal behavior, \nthrough pushing out financial instruments which turned out in some \ncases to be worthless--as a result of all of that, they plunged this \ncountry into the worst recession we have seen since the Great \nDepression--from January. That is at the end of the Bush \nAdministration.\n  It is very important to understand that the Wall Street crisis took \nus over the wall in terms of precipitating the severe recession we are \nin, but we have to remember that during those 8 years, as I mentioned \nearlier, the middle class was also shrinking. So it was not: Oh my \ngoodness, everything is going great. Then you got the Wall Street \ndisaster, and now we are in the midst of a terrible recession. This \ntrend of a middle-class collapse went on long before Bush--precipitated \nsignificantly during the Bush years, but it went on before as well, not \njust during the Bush years.\n  Over the 8-year period of President Bush, from 2001 to 2009, we lost \n600,000 private sector jobs. We lost 600,000 private sector jobs, and \nonly 1 million net new jobs were created, all of them in the government \nsector. So for my friends, my Republican colleagues, to tell us that we \nneed more tax breaks for the very rich because that is going to create \njobs--that is what trickle-down economics is all about--I would say to \nthem: You had your chance. It failed. In case you don't know, losing \n600,000 private sector jobs in 8 years is not good. That is very, very \nbad. That is an economic policy that has failed. We don't need to look \nat that movie again. We saw it. It stunk. It was a bad movie. Bad \neconomic policy. More tax breaks for the rich is not what our economy \nneeds. In fact, what every economist will tell you is that is the least \neffective way to create jobs.\n  During the Bush era, median income dropped by nearly $2,200. That \nmeans that a family in the middle, over an 8-year period, saw their \nincome drop by $2,200 during the 8 years of Bush.\n  I say all of these things just to tell you that we are not where we \nare today just because of the Wall Street crisis. That took us over the \ncliff. That made a very bad situation much, much worse. But it has been \ngoing on for a long time. It has gone on before Bush. It has gone on \nafter Bush.\n  During the 8 years of Bush, over 8 million Americans slipped out of \nthe middle class and into poverty. We don't talk about poverty in \nAmerica anymore. We don't talk about the homelessness in America very \nmuch anymore. Trust me, it is there. It is three\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nblocks away from where I am speaking right now, a very large homeless \nshelter. It is in small towns in Vermont where people tell me that for \nthe first time they are seeing more and more families with kids needing \nemergency shelter because they can't afford housing. In Vermont, a lot \nof people have low-wage jobs making 10 bucks an hour, and it is hard to \nfind a decent apartment or pay a mortgage on $10 an hour. That is true \ncertainly all over this country. Homelessness is going up.\n  During the Bush years, nearly 8 million Americans lost their health \ninsurance. One of the issues I will talk about in a little while is \nhealth care. It is related to everything. We are the only country in \nthe industrialized world that does not guarantee health care to all \npeople as a right of citizenship. According to Harvard University, \n45,000 Americans will die this year because they lack health insurance \nand are not getting to a doctor when they should.\n  During the Bush administration, 5 million manufacturing jobs \ndisappeared, as companies shut down plants in the United States and \nmoved to China, Mexico, Vietnam, and other low-wage countries. As I \nmentioned earlier, it is profoundly important to understand what is \ngoing on in America. In 2000, we had over 17,000 manufacturing jobs in \nthis country. By 2008, we had less than 12,000. That is 17,000 to \n12,000 in 8 years. That is the loss of 5 million manufacturing jobs--a \n29-percent reduction--and the fewest number of manufacturing jobs since \nthe beginning of World War II.\n  Under President Bush, our trade deficit with China more than tripled \nand the overall trade deficit nearly doubled.\n  Again, the point I am making now in the context of this agreement is \nthat we need agreements now that do not give tax breaks to millionaires \nor billionaires, that do not lower the tax rates or the estate tax, \nwhich is applicable only to the top three-tenths of 1 percent. We need \nan agreement that rebuilds our infrastructure, rebuilds our \nmanufacturing base, and creates the millions of good-paying jobs the \nAmerican people desperately want.\n  Again, I think the point has to be made--and I have to make it over \nand over--that when you look at the economy, it is one thing to say \neverybody is hurting. You know, sometimes that happens. A terrible \nhurricane comes through and knocks down everybody's home. Well, the \nhurricane that has hit America for the last 10, 20 years has not \nimpacted everybody; it has impacted the working class, it has impacted \nthe middle class. The people on top are doing better than they ever \nwere. Our friends on Wall Street whose greed and illegal behavior \ncaused this recession are now making more money than they ever did, \nafter being bailed out by the middle class of this country.\n  During the Bush years, the wealthiest 400 Americans saw their incomes \nmore than double. Do you really think that after seeing a doubling of \ntheir incomes under the Bush years, these people are in desperate need \nof another million-dollar-a-year tax break? In 2007, the 400 top income \nearners in this country made an average of $345 million in 1 year. That \nis a pretty piece of change. That is the average, $345 million. In \nterms of wealth, as opposed to income, the wealthiest 400 Americans saw \nan increase in their wealth of some $400 billion during the Bush years. \nImagine that. During an 8-year period, the top 400 wealthiest people \neach saw an increase, on average, of $1 billion apiece. Together, these \n400 families have a collective net of $1.27 trillion. Does anybody in \nAmerica really believe these guys need another tax break so that our \nkids and our grandchildren can pay more in taxes because the national \ndebt has gone up? I do not think most Americans believe that. That is \nwhy, in my view, most Americans are not supporting this agreement.\n  Let me also say that when we look at what is going on around the rest \nof the world, what we have to appreciate is that in the United States \ntoday--again, this is not something we can be proud of; it is something \nwe have to address--we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and \nincome of any other country on Earth.\n  I remember talking not so long ago to somebody from Scandinavia. I \nthink it was Finland. He was saying: Of course, we have rich people in \nour country, but there is a level at which they would become \nembarrassed.\n  America now has a situation where the CEOs of large corporations make \n300 times more than their workers. In many other countries, everybody \nwants to be rich, but there is a limit. You can't become a billionaire \nstepping over children sleeping on the street. That is not what this \ncountry is supposed to be about. Enough should be enough.\n  The top 1 percent today earns 23.5 percent of all income. In the \n1970s, that number was 8 percent. In the 1990s, it was approximately 16 \npercent. Now it is 23.5 percent. So the people on top are getting a \nbigger and bigger chunk of all income. Furthermore, it is not only the \ntop 1 percent, there are economists who ask: You think the top 1 \npercent are doing well? It is really the top one-tenth of 1 percent. If \nyou can believe this, the top one-tenth of 1 percent--and I don't know \nhow many people that is, you can do the arithmetic, 300 million into \none-tenth of 1 percent--took in 11 percent of total income, according \nto the latest data. One-tenth of 1 percent earned 11 percent of all \nincome in America.\n  In the 1970s, the top 1 percent only made something like 8 percent of \ntotal income. In the 1980s it rose to 10 to 14 percent. In the late \n1990s, it was 15 percent to 19 percent. In 2005 it passed 21 percent. \nAnd in 2010, the top 1 percent receive 23 percent of all the income \nearned in this country.\n  People should be mindful of this fact: The last time that type of \nincome disparity took place was in 1928. I think we all know what \nhappened in 1929. That is the point Senator Landrieu was making a while \nback. What she understands, quite correctly, is if working people, the \nvast majority of the people, don't have the income to spend money to \nbuy products and goods and services, we can't create the jobs. If all \nof the money or a big chunk of the money ends up with a few people on \ntop, there is a limit to how many limousines you can have and how many \nhomes you can have and how many yachts you can have. So when we hit a \nsituation where so few have so much, it is not only a moral issue, it \nis also an economic issue.\n  A strong and growing middle class goes out, spends money, and creates \njobs. Grossly unequal distribution of income and wealth creates more \neconomic shrinkage and loss of jobs because people just don't have the \ndisposable income to go out and buy and create jobs.\n  To add insult to injury in terms of this agreement negotiated by the \nPresident and Republicans, while the very wealthiest people became much \nwealthier and the deficit soared--and under President Bush the national \ndebt almost doubled--what else happened? The tax rates for the very \nrich went down. The rich got richer; tax rates went down. This was a \nresult not only of the tax breaks for the rich initiated during the \nBush administration but also, quite frankly, tax policy that took place \nbefore President Bush. The result is that from 1992 to 2007, from the \nlatest statistics we have, the effective Federal tax rate--what people \nreally pay--for the top 400 income earners was cut almost in half. So \nthese cry babies, these multimillionaires and billionaires, these \npeople who are making out like bandits, they are crying and crying and \ncrying, but the effective tax rate for the top 400 income earners was \ncut almost in half from 1992 to 2007.\n  The point that needs to be made is, when is enough enough? That is \nthe essence of what we are talking about. Greed, in my view, is like a \nsickness. It is like an addiction. We know people who are on heroin. \nThey can't stop. They destroy their lives. They need more and more \nheroin. There are people who can't stop smoking. They have problems \nwith nicotine. They get addicted to cigarettes. It costs them their \nhealth. People have problems with food. We all have our share of \naddictions. But I would hope that these people who are worth hundreds \nof millions of dollars will look around them and say: There is \nsomething more important in life than the richest people becoming \nricher when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the \nindustrialized world. Maybe they will understand that they are \nAmericans, part of a great nation which is in trouble today. Maybe they \nhave to go back to\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\nthe Bible, whatever they believe in, and understand there is virtue in \nsharing, in reaching out; that you can't get it all.\n  I think this is an issue we have to stay on and stay on and stay on. \nThis greed, this reckless, uncontrollable greed is almost like a \ndisease which is hurting this country terribly. How can anybody be \nproud to say they are a multimillionaire and are getting a huge tax \nbreak and one-quarter of the kids in this country are on food stamps? \nHow can one be proud of that? I don't know.\n  It is not only income, it is wealth. The top 1 percent owns more \nwealth than the bottom 90 percent. During the Bush years, the \nwealthiest 400 Americans saw their wealth increase by some $400 \nbillion. How much is enough?\n  All of these things are related to the agreement the President and \nRepublicans worked out because we are all concerned about the national \ndebt and deficit. In terms of the Federal budget, when President Bush \nfirst took office, he inherited a $236 billion surplus in 2001 and a \nprojected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. That is what Senator \nLandrieu was discussing. But then some things happened. We all know \nthat 9/11 was not his fault, but what happened is, we went to war in \nAfghanistan. We went to war in Iraq. The war in Iraq was the fault of \nPresident Bush, something I certainly did not support, nor do I think \nmost Americans supported. The war in Iraq, by the time our last veteran \nis taken care of, will probably end up costing us something like $3 \ntrillion, adding enormously to our national debt.\n  So when we talk about Iraq, it is not only the terrible loss of life \nthat our soldiers and the Iraqi people have experienced, let's not \nforget what it has done to the deficit and the national debt. We did \nnot pay for the war in Iraq. We just put it on the credit card.\n  President Bush gave out $700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 \npercent of Americans. Where was the offset? There was none. He gave \nthem tax breaks. That is it. It adds to the national debt.\n  The President and Republicans supported a $400 billion Medicare Part \nD prescription drug program. I have always believed we need a strong \nprescription drug program for seniors. But the program that was passed \nwas written by the pharmaceutical industry, written by the insurance \ncompanies, and is nowhere near as cost-effective as it could be. As the \nPresident undoubtedly knows, we are not even negotiating prescription \ndrug prices with the drug companies, a great expense and great cost to \nthe American people, where drug prices are now much more expensive \nunder Medicare Part D than they are in terms of what the Veterans' \nAdministration or the Department of Defense purchases. So we passed \nthat, unpaid for. Great idea. Just another $400 billion prescription \ndrug program unpaid for.\n  Then we bailed out Wall Street. The original cost was $700 billion. A \nlot of that has been paid back, but there is expense there as well.\n  So we add all these things together, normal governmental growth, and \nit turns out that the Bush administration turned a $236-billion-a-year \nsurplus into a $1.3-trillion-a-year deficit. More or less, that is \nwhere we are right now. In fact, the national debt nearly doubled under \nPresident Bush, going from $5.7 trillion to $10.6 trillion in 2009 and \nnow we are at $13.7 trillion, borrowing huge sums of money from China \nand other countries in order to maintain our existence. That is where \nwe are.\n  Have we been seeing in recent years some improvements in the economy? \nWe sure have. There has been some job growth. Nowhere near enough. But \nwe are surely not losing 700,000 jobs a year. We are seeing some \ngrowth. But we need to do much better.\n  That takes me back to an issue I feel strongly about and one on which \nI want to say a few words. In this agreement the President negotiated \nwith Republicans, there is a substantial sum of money going into \nvarious types of business tax breaks. The theory, which has certainly \nsome validity, is that these business tax breaks will create jobs. The \nproblem is that right now, businesses, the large corporations at least, \nare sitting on a huge bundle of money already that they are not \nspending. The reason they are not investing that money is they perceive \nthat working families don't have the money to buy their products and \nservices.\n  In saying this, I am not alone. I think most economists agree there \nis a far more effective way we can create jobs rather than just a \nnumber of tax breaks going to businesses. I touched on this point \nbefore. I want to get into a little bit more detail.\n  For this I am indebted to a very fine book written by an old friend \nof mine, Arianna Huffington. The title of her book is ``Third World \nAmerica.'' She used that word because basically the theme of her book \nis, if we do not get our act together in terms of infrastructure, in \nterms of education, in terms of health care, that is where we are \nheaded. We are headed in the direction of being a Third World nation.\n  She has an interesting chapter which deals with one very important \npart of what is going on in America, and that is the crumbling of our \ninfrastructure. She writes:\n\n       From 1980 to 2005, the miles traveled by automobiles \n     increased 94 percent--for trucks mileage increased 105 \n     percent--yet there was only a 3.5 percent increase in highway \n     lane miles.\n\n  More and more cars, more and more traveling. We are not building \nroads.\n\n       But you don't need these numbers to know that our roads are \n     badly congested.\n\n  Anybody who lives around Washington knows our roads are congested. It \ntakes hours to get to work sometimes.\n  You see it and experience it every day.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers infrastructure \nreport card--and this is where we should be investing, not tax breaks \nfor the rich--Americans spend 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in \ntraffic. Think about that, 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic, \nat a cost of $78 billion a year. Think about all of the pollution, all \nof the greenhouse gas emissions, all of the frustration, all of the \nanxiety, all of the road rage. People are stuck on roads because our \ntransportation system is totally inadequate, our roads, our public \ntransportation.\n  She then makes another interesting point. When we talk about \nautomobile accidents, what do we usually think? We think somebody is \ndriving recklessly, maybe they are drunk. Those are serious issues. But \nshe writes: In studying car crashes across the country, the \nTransportation Construction Coalition determined that badly maintained \nor managed roads are responsible for $217 billion a year in car \ncrashes, far more than headline-grabbing, alcohol-related accidents or \nspeed-related pileups.\n  In other words, if you want to know why we are seeing automobile \ncrashes, the issue of bad roads is even more significant than drunk \ndrivers or people who are reckless drivers. I can remember--I think \neverybody has the same story--I was driving on a road in Vermont, and, \nwhoops, there was a huge pothole, and the car went into it. It cost a \nfew hundred dollars to repair the car. So we are spending as a nation \nbillions of dollars repairing our cars because our roads are not in \ngood shape. When there is a traffic jam, people are emitting all kinds \nof greenhouse gas emissions. You are wasting gas. You are wasting \nmoney. If we invested in our transportation system, we could go a long \nway to addressing that.\n  When we talk about transportation--and, by the way, again, I bring \nthis issue up because, in the bill agreed to by the President and the \nRepublican leadership, to the best of my knowledge, not one penny--not \none penny--is going into infrastructure, which, to me, does not make \nany sense at all.\n  Again, Arianna Huffington writes:\n\n       America's railway system is speeding down the tracks in \n     reverse. It is one of the few technologies that has actually \n     regressed over the past 80 years.\n\n  Regressed. I am not talking about China, where they are building all \nthese high-speed rail lines. Our rail situation in terms of the amount \nof time it takes to go from location one to location two has actually \ngotten longer.\n  She writes:\n\n       Tom Vanderbilt of Slate.com--\n\n  Which is a very good Web site--\n\n     came across some pre-World War II train timetables and made a \n     startling discovery. Many train rides in the 1930s, 40s, and \n     50s took less time than those journeys would take today.\n\n  Can you imagine that? In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, people were \nable to get on a train and get to their destination in less time than \nis the case today.\n\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\n\n       For instance, in 1934, the Burlington Zephyr would get you \n     from Chicago to Denver--\n\n  From Chicago to Denver--\n\n     in around 13 hours. The same trip takes 18 hours today.\n\n  I do not know if the Presiding Office is familiar with the Burlington \nZephyr, which is a train that goes from Chicago to Denver, but what \nthis writer is pointing out is that in 1934 it took 13 hours to make \nthat trip. Do you know how long it takes today? It takes 18 hours. So \nwe are moving in the wrong direction.\n  I know in Vermont--I do not have any statistics right in front of me \nbut I can tell you--I believe very strongly--it takes longer to get \nfrom the southern part of the State to the northern part of the State \nthan it used to, and the frequency of the trips is less than they used \nto be.\n\n       The trip from Chicago to Minneapolis via the Olympian \n     Hiawatha, in the 1950s, took about 4\\1/2\\ hours. Today, via \n     Amtrak's train, the journey takes more than 8 hours.\n\n  It used to be 4\\1/2\\. So in terms of our public transportation, not \nonly are we neglecting, not only are we not moving forward, we are \nactually moving backwards.\n\n       At the moment, the only high-speed train in the United \n     States is Amtrak's Acela, which travels the Washington, New \n     York, Boston line.\n\n  And she writes:\n\n       And I use the term ``high-speed'' very loosely. While in \n     theory the trains have a peak speed of 150 miles per hour, \n     the average speed on that train is just about 71 miles per \n     hour.\n\n  Once again, I read some statistics before, pointing out that China is \nbuilding thousands and thousands of miles of high-speed rail. And here \nin the United States we are moving backwards. It is taking us a longer \ntime for various train rides than used to be the case.\n  But it is not just trains. It is not just our roads. It is not just \nour bridges.\n  Well, it is also our bridges. Let me say a word on bridges. I think \nwe all remember 4 years ago, I think it was, the terrible tragedy in \nthe Minneapolis area, when one of their major bridges collapsed and a \nnumber of people lost their lives. That got the front-page headlines \nall over this country. I know in Vermont we closed down bridges. They \nare not safe to travel.\n\n       According to the Department of Transportation, 1 in 4 of \n     America's bridges is either structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete. The numbers are even worse when it \n     comes to bridges in urban areas, where 1 in 3 bridges is \n     deficient--no small matter given the high levels of \n     passengers and freight traffic in our Nation's cities.\n\n  So a huge amount of traffic--in urban areas one in three bridges is \ndeficient, and in rural areas such as Vermont, one in four.\n  How are these bridges going to be rebuilt? It is likely not going to \nbe done by local and State governments that right now are experiencing \nenormous economic crises. If it is going to be done, it is going to \nhave to be done here at the Federal level.\n  I have to say that in Vermont we saw some significant improvements as \na result of the stimulus package. In fact, in Vermont, recently, we \nhave put more money in rebuilding our roads and bridges with very good \nsuccess. I think the people of Vermont see the difference. In the last \ncouple years, directly as a result of the stimulus package, we have \nmade significant improvements on a number of bridges but nowhere near \nenough.\n  The point I want to make is that with our infrastructure collapsing, \nwith the American Society of Civil Engineers suggesting we need to \nspend $2.2 trillion in the next 5 years just to maintain where we are, \nwe have an agreement before us which puts zero dollars in \ninfrastructure. According to this book:\n\n       We need to invest $850 billion over the next 50 years to \n     get all of America's bridges into good shape.\n\n  Trust me, we are not coming anywhere near that right now.\n\n       But it is not just our roads. It is not just our public \n     transportation. It is not just our bridges. When we talk \n     about infrastructure, we also have to talk about dams.\n       On March 16, 2006, the Ka Loko Dam in Kilauea, Hawaii, \n     collapsed, and seven people died when the Ka Loko Dam \n     breached after weeks of heavy rain, sending 1.6 million tons \n     of water downstream.\n       Dams are a vital part of America's infrastructure. They \n     help provide for drinking, irrigation, and agriculture, and \n     generate much needed power, and often offer protection from \n     floods. Yet our dams are growing old. There are more than \n     85,000 dams in America, and the average age is 51 years. At \n     the same time, more and more people are moving into \n     developments located below dams that require significantly \n     greater safety standards. But we have had a hard time keeping \n     up with the increase in the so-called high-hazard dams. \n     Indeed, we are falling further and further behind.\n\n  So the point here is, we have a major agreement. People are concerned \nabout creating jobs. We are investing zero in our infrastructure, and \ndams are a very important part of our infrastructure, as are levees. \nAnd I suspect Senator Landrieu, who was here a little while ago, would \nhave something to say about levees.\n  All right. So we are talking about an infrastructure which is \ncollapsing. We are talking about China investing far more in terms of \ntheir GDP into infrastructure improvement than we are. We are talking \nabout being in the midst of a major recession, where we desperately \nwant to grow jobs, and yet this proposal does not add one cent into our \ninfrastructure.\n  Now, again, I am going back to the very good book written by Arianna \nHuffington called ``Third World America.'' She writes:\n\n       As bad as America's sewers, roads, bridges, dams, and water \n     power systems are, they pale in comparison to the crisis we \n     are facing in our schools. I am not talking about the \n     physical state of our dilapidated public school buildings, \n     although the National Education Association estimates that it \n     would take $322 billion to bring America's school buildings \n     into good repair.\n\n  I have been in schools in Vermont and elsewhere which were old and \ncrumbling, and I have been in schools which are new and state of the \nart. I think anyone who has seen the contrast in terms of the attitude \nof the students in those types of schools will understand it is \nimportant to give these kids good places in which to learn and to grow. \nIt means a lot to them when they see a building that is new that has \nstate-of-the-art equipment, as opposed to one that is crumbling. It \nsuggests to them what we as a society feel about them.\n  Arianna Huffington writes:\n\n       Nothing is quickening our descent into Third World status \n     faster than our resounding failure to properly educate our \n     children. This failure has profound consequences for our \n     future, both at home and as we look to compete with the rest \n     of the world in the global economy.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       Historically, education has been the great equalizer.\n\n  That is certainly the case.\n\n       That has been the incredible virtue of our public school \n     system--\n\n  What we have taken as kids, who spent--my father did not graduate \nfrom high school. My mother did. That was it.\n\n     --and given millions of young people the opportunity to get a \n     good education in school and be able to go to college and use \n     their potential. The springboard to the middle class and \n     beyond has been education. It was a promise we made to all of \n     our people.\n\n  What we as a nation said is, regardless of your income, we are going \nto provide you with the best possible education in order to succeed in \nlife. That is something extraordinary, that no matter what your income \nis, we are going to provide you with a great education. As a kid, I \nwent to public schools, and I did have a very good education.\n\n       But something has gone in recent years terribly wrong, and \n     we have slipped further and further behind many other \n     countries. Among 30 developed countries ranked by the \n     Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development--\n\n  That is the OECD--\n\n     the United States ranked 25th in math and 21st in science.\n\n  So 25th in math, 21st in science.\n\n       Even the top 10 percent of the American students--our best \n     and brightest--ranked only 24th in the world in math \n     literacy.\n\n  There was another study, I think probably just a more updated OECD \nstudy, that came out just the other day, reported in the New York \nTimes, where kids in Shanghai were leading the world in these types of \ntests as compared to our own students. They are studied. They have \nbetter schools, better teachers, more investments in their education. \nAnd there is a culture there. There is a culture. It is not fair to \nblame the kids.\n  Does anyone seriously believe in the United States of America we take \nintellectual development seriously? I was\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\nreading today--I do not remember the guy's name, who it was--a \nbasketball player or a baseball player just signing a contract for \nuntold tens of millions of dollars. Yet you have teachers starting off \nat $30,000, $32,000. Is anyone going to suggest in a serious way we \nreward people who become childcare workers or teachers?\n  We have childcare workers taking care of little kids--which may be \nthe most important job in our society because there is the brain \ndevelopment that takes place between zero and 3 that has a large part \nto do with what a human being becomes--people leaving early childhood \neducation in order to move up the economic ladder and get a job at \nMcDonald's because pay is so low, benefits are so low. What are we \ndoing as a nation?\n  She writes:\n\n       A National Assessment of Educational Progress report found \n     that just 33 percent of U.S. fourth graders and 32 percent \n     eighth graders were proficient in reading.\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n  So I think her point is that if we are not going to become a Third \nWorld nation, we have to start investing in this country--in our \nphysical infrastructure, in our human infrastructure, and in our \neducational infrastructure.\n  Let me give you some examples of what this means in real terms. \nToday, unemployment in our country--the official unemployment rate is \n9.8 percent. For those without a high school diploma, it is 15.6 \npercent, compared to 5.6 percent for college graduates. Mr. President, \n67 percent of high school graduates do not have enough of the skills \nrequired for success in college and the 21st century workforce.\n  As many as 170,000 high school graduates each year are prepared to go \non to college but cannot afford that. Let me repeat that. About 170,000 \nyoung people in this country, who graduate high school, who want to go \nto college, are unable to do it because they cannot afford it.\n  Are we nuts? What are we doing in wasting the extraordinary \nintellectual potential of all of these young people? What we are saying \nto them is because you don't have the money and because college is so \nexpensive, and because our Federal Government is more busy giving tax \nbreaks to billionaires and fighting two wars, we are not investing in \nyou.\n\n  That makes no sense at all. When you invest in your kids, you are \ninvesting in the future of America. They are America. And if they are \nnot well educated, how are they going to become productive members of \nsociety? How are we going to compete against China and Europe and other \ncountries around the world that are investing in education?\n  Here is something we don't talk about enough: The fastest growing \noccupations are those that require higher levels of education and \ngreater technical competency. So we have a problem--it is true in \nVermont and it is true all over the country--which is we have jobs out \nthere, good jobs, and those jobs cannot be filled because our young \npeople don't have the job skills to fill them. How absurd is that?\n  I remember there was a piece in one of the papers, I think it was in \nOhio, where after the worst of the recession, a lot of layoffs--I think \nit was Ohio--they were beginning to hire workers and these were for \nsophisticated, high-tech jobs. They brought workers in and brought them \nin and brought them in, and they couldn't come up with the number of \nworkers they needed to fill the jobs they had. What does that say about \nour educational system?\n  Data from Alliance for Excellent Education, 2009: 1,800 Vermont \ndropouts cost the State $459 million of lost lifetime earnings for the \nState and $19.4 million in health care costs. In other words, what \neverybody understands is if you don't invest in your young people, they \nare not going to become productive, tax-paying workers. As often as \nnot, they will get involved in self-destructive activity--drugs, crime, \nwhatever. They will end up in jail, and we end up spending tens of \nthousands of dollars keeping them in jail rather than seeing them out \nthere as productive members of society contributing their fair share in \ntaxes.\n  The Urban Institute says we can reduce child poverty--which I \nmentioned earlier is the highest in the industrialized world--by 35 \npercent if we provide childcare subsidies to families with income less \nthan 50 percent of State median.\n  This is an issue I feel very strongly about. It is, to me, beyond \ncomprehension that in Vermont and throughout this country, it is \nextremely difficult for working-class families to find affordable, good \nquality childcare. We are not back in the 1950s where daddy went to \nwork and mommy stayed home taking care of the kids. Mom is at work as \nwell. And we have families all over this country--middle-class, \nworking-class families--saying, I cannot find quality childcare. We are \nuncomfortable leaving our 2-year-old or 3-year-old. We can't find \nchildcare at a rate we can afford.\n  In this area, again, we are far behind many other countries around \nthe world. Kids who do not get intellectually challenging early \nchildhood education, kids who do not get the emotional support they \nneed from zero to 3 to 4, will enter school already quite behind other \nkids. Then, 5 years later, 10 years later, they will be dropping out of \nschool and they will be doing drugs and they will be ending up in jail \nat great expense. How long does it take us to understand that investing \nin our children, our youngest children, is enormously important for our \ncountry? It is a good investment. It is much better to invest in \nchildcare than in keeping people locked up in jails.\n  Seventy-five percent of American youth who apply to the military are \nineligible to serve because of low cognitive capacities, criminal \nrecords, or obesity. This is quite unbelievable. Now we are not only \ntalking about not being able to compete internationally because we are \nnot bringing forth the kind of educated people we need, because of the \ninadequacies of our schools and childcare and so forth--this almost \nbecomes a national security issue, if you like. Seventy-five percent of \nAmerican youth who apply to the military are ineligible to serve \nbecause of low cognitive capacities, criminal records, or obesity. It \ngives me no pride, no happiness, to bring forth these statistics. But \nas a nation, we are going to have to grasp these things. Either we can \nignore these things, either we can run away from reality, put our heads \nunderneath the carpet, or we can say we are not going to allow America \nto become a Third World nation, that we are going to turn this country \naround.\n  But we are not going to turn the country around unless we rethink our \npriorities. One of our priorities cannot be more tax breaks for the \nrichest people in this country.\n  From the 1960s to 2006, the United States fell from first to 18th out \nof 24 industrialized nations in high school graduation rates. What \nhappens in today's economy if a kid does not graduate high school? If \nmy memory is correct, about 30 percent of our kids--and I know these \nfigures are fuzzy because it is hard to determine who is dropping out \nand who is not, but my understanding is about 30 percent of our kids \ndrop out of high school. What happens to those kids? Where do they go? \nHow many of them end up in jail? How many of them do drugs? As a \nnation, I think we can do a lot better than that. We should not have \ngone from first to 18th out of 24 industrialized nations in high school \ngraduation rates. Dropouts are eight times more likely to be \nincarcerated. In other words, when kids fail in school, they are going \nto end up in jail--eight times more likely. Eighty-two percent of those \nin prison are high school dropouts.\n  I will tell my colleagues a funny experience. I was in Burlington \nlast week. I met this fellow. He came up and was chatting with me. He \nsaid, I just got out of jail. What struck me is he was a well educated \nyoung man. He was very articulate. I suspect he had gone to college. \nWhat struck me is how rare that is, as the statistics aptly \ndemonstrate. The people who end up in jail overwhelmingly are high \nschool dropouts, people who don't have the education to make it in the \nworld.\n  When we talk about the need to substantially increase funding for \nearly childhood education, we should understand that State-funded, pre-\nK programs currently serve 24 percent of 4-year-olds and 4 percent of \n3-year-olds. In other words, there are millions of families who would \nlike to see their kids be able to access good quality childcare but \ncan't find that in their States--again, in contrast to giving tax\n\n[[Page S8761]]\n\nbreaks to billionaires who don't need it and in some cases are not even \nasking for it. The younger the age of investment in human capital, the \nhigher the rate of return on that investment. If society invests early \nenough, it can raise cognitive and socio-emotional levels and the \nhealth of disadvantaged kids. One doesn't need to be a psychologist to \nunderstand that. If kids get off to a good start in life, if they have \nthe intellectual support, the intellectual development, and the \nemotional support, those kids are much more likely to do well in \nschool, much less likely to drop out, much less likely to be a burden \non society, much less likely to end up in jail, much less likely to do \ndrugs, et cetera. This is an investment we should be making.\n  I wish to get back for a moment to the agreement the President made \nwith the Republican leadership and why I think it is a bad agreement \nand why I believe we can do much better. The way we are going to \nimprove this agreement is when millions of people all over this country \nsay, wait a second. Wait a second. This was an agreement reached behind \nclosed doors. There are Members in the House and the Senate who didn't \nknow about the agreement. What about the average American out there? I \nwonder how many people believe it makes a lot of sense, with a $13.7 \ntrillion national debt, to be giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest \npeople in this country?\n  I have to tell my colleagues, the calls in my office are coming 98, \n99 percent to 1 against these agreements. People think we can do better \nand our job is to do better. The way we do better is when people all \nover this country stand up and say, Wait a minute, Congress. Your job \nis to represent the middle class, to represent our kids, and not to \nrepresent the wealthiest people in this country.\n  I mentioned earlier, I think certainly one of the major objections to \nthis agreement is that it provides tens of billions of dollars to the \nwealthiest people in this country at a time when the rich are already \ndoing phenomenally well and at a time when the wealthiest people have \nalready experienced huge tax breaks. I think most people think that \ndoes not make sense. Let me give an example, not to pick on particular \nindividuals--that is not my goal--but so we know this.\n  According to the Citizens for Tax Justice, if the Bush tax breaks for \nthe top 2 percent are extended, these are some of the people who will \nbenefit and what kind of benefits they will receive: Rupert Murdoch, \nthe CEO of News Corporation, would receive a $1.3 million tax break \nnext year. Mr. Murdoch is a billionaire. Do we really think he needs \nthat? Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, whose bank got a $29 \nbillion bailout from the Federal Reserve, will receive a $1.1 million \ntax break. Trust me, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, is doing \njust fine. Vikram Pandit, the CEO of Citigroup, the bank that got a $50 \nbillion bailout, would receive $785,000 in tax breaks. Ken Lewis, the \nformer CEO of Bank of America--a bank that got a $45 billion bailout--\nthe guy is already fabulously wealthy--would receive a $713,000 tax \nbreak. The CEO of Wells Fargo--these are the largest banks in America; \nthe CEOs of these banks are already making huge compensation. John \nStumpf, who is the CEO of Wells Fargo, would receive a $318,000 tax \nbreak every single year. The CEO of Morgan Stanley, John Mack, whose \nbank got a $10 billion bailout, would receive a $926,000 a year tax \nbreak. The CEO of Aetna, Ronald Williams, would receive a tax break \nworth $875,000.\n  I contrast that, as I did earlier, to the fact that 2 days ago, the \nPresiding Officer and I and a total of 53 Members of the Senate said, \nYou know, maybe we should provide a $250 check this year to seniors on \nSocial Security and to disabled vets because they haven't gotten a COLA \nfor 2 years--a $250 check. People making $14,000, $15,000 a year \ndesperately need a little bit of help. We couldn't get one Republican \nvote. But when it comes to the CEO of a major bank who is already a \nmultimillionaire--we are talking about $6 million, $7 million, $8 \nmillion a year in tax breaks--that is not what we should be doing as a \nnation.\n  Furthermore, I know President Obama and others have said, Well, let's \nnot worry, because these tax breaks are just temporary--just temporary. \nThey are only going to be given for 2 years. I have been in Washington \nlong enough to know that when you give a temporary tax break for 2 \nyears, you are, in fact, giving a long-term tax break or maybe even a \npermanent tax break. Because 2 years from now, the exact same arguments \nwill be made: if you do away with those tax breaks for the rich, you \nare raising taxes. Do you want to raise taxes, a terrible thing to do? \nThat same argument will be made. But there is one difference. The \ndifference is that when President Obama ran for President and since he \nhas been President, he has time and time again come out against those \ntax breaks. He does not believe in them. I believe him, and I know that \nhe doesn't. But if he is the Democratic candidate for President and he \nsays: Reelect me to be President because in the future I am going to \nreally get rid of these tax breaks, I am afraid his credibility is not \nvery high because that is what he said last time. I guess there is a \nlimit as to how many times you can cry wolf.\n\n  (Mr. LEVIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SANDERS. If these tax breaks for the wealthiest people are \nextended for 2 years, there is a strong likelihood they will be \nextended for many years beyond those 2 and perhaps even permanently. \nThat brings us back to the Bush-era nonsense of believing that tax \nbreaks for the rich and trickle-down economics are going to help the \nmiddle-class and working families of this country.\n  While the personal income tax issue and extending them for the top 2 \npercent has received a lot of national attention, what has not gotten a \nwhole lot of discussion is that that is not the only unfair and absurd \ntax proposal out there. The agreement struck between the President and \nthe Republican leadership continues the Bush era 15 percent tax rate on \ncapital gains and dividends, meaning those people who make their living \noff of their investments will continue to pay a substantially lower tax \nrate than firemen, teachers, and nurses. So if you are a wealthy person \nand you earn money from dividends--I believe the overwhelming majority \nof those capital gains accrue to the top 1 percent--you are going to be \npaying a tax on that income of 15 percent, which is less than you pay \nif you are a fireman, a police officer, a teacher, or a nurse. So what \nwe are doing there is extending not only the personal income tax breaks \nfor the very rich but a host of other taxes as well.\n  On top of all of that--and I know many of my colleagues have picked \nup on this and are extremely upset, and I think that is one of the \nreasons the Democrats in the House just yesterday said they don't want \nto bring this proposal to the floor for a vote--this agreement includes \na horrendous proposal regarding the estate tax.\n  The estate tax is a proposal Teddy Roosevelt talked about in the year \n1906. It was eventually enacted in 1916. Here is what Teddy Roosevelt \nsaid about this issue in August of 1906--and it is worth repeating this \nbecause what the proposal struck between the President and the \nRepublican leadership does is lower the estate tax substantially. Here \nis what Teddy Roosevelt said in 1906:\n\n       The absence of effective State, and, especially, national, \n     restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a \n     small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful \n     men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power. \n     . . .\n\n  This is Teddy Roosevelt, who by then had served as President of the \nUnited States.\n  He continued:\n\n       No man should receive a dollar unless that dollar has been \n     fairly earned. Every dollar received should represent a \n     dollar's worth of service rendered--not gambling in stocks, \n     but service rendered.\n\n  This guy was pretty prophetic back in 1910.\n  He continues:\n\n       The really big fortune, the swollen fortune, by the mere \n     fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiated in \n     kind as well as in degree from what is passed by men of \n     relatively small means. Therefore, I believe in a graduated \n     inheritance tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against \n     evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the \n     estate.\n\n  Wow, Teddy Roosevelt hit the nail on the head. That was 100 years \nago. He was worried that a small group of people with incredible money \nwould be able to pass that money on, and what you would create would be \nan oligarchic form of government with a small\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\nnumber of people not just holding economic power but significant \npolitical power.\n  It is ironic that, right now, as a result of the disastrous Citizens \nUnited decision, what Roosevelt foretold, predicted, is exactly what is \nhappening. You have a handful of billionaires now sitting around \ndeciding how much of their fortune they are going to invest in \npolitical campaigns all over this country to defeat people like me who \nare opposed to their agenda and support other people who are in \nagreement with it. That is what Roosevelt talked about. That is exactly \nwhat is happening.\n  So what we are looking at in this proposal is a situation where the \nestate tax rate, which was 55 percent under President Clinton, will \ndecline to 35 percent, with an exemption on the first $5 million of an \nindividual's estate, $10 million per couple. Here is the important \npoint that has to be made. I think a lot of people don't understand \nthis. Certainly, our Republican friends have done a very good job in \ndistorting reality on this one. There are millions of Americans who \nbelieve that when they die, their children will have to pay an estate \ntax. That is absolutely and categorically incorrect. As this chart \nshows, only a tiny fraction of estates from deaths in 2009 owed any \nestate tax. That number is about .24 percent. Less than three-tenths of \n1 percent of American families paid any tax on the estates they were \nleft. So 99.7 percent of American families did not pay one cent in \nestate taxes. That is the simple truth. The so-called death tax our \nRepublican friends talk about a whole lot is the estate tax, and 99.7 \npercent of families don't pay a nickel on it. The people who do pay are \nnot the rich; they are the very, very rich.\n  Let me give you one example of the absurdity of lowering the tax rate \nor, even worse, ending the estate tax, as some of our Republican \ncolleagues would like to do. Here is this chart. One example of what--\nwell, this agreement doesn't do that; it lowers the rates. If they were \nto wipe it out completely, as Republicans want to do, Walmart owners, \nSam Walton's family, the heirs to the Walmart fortune, which is worth--\nwell, it may be more or less now, but it is about $86 billion. One \nfamily is worth $86 billion. They are doing pretty good. If we abolish \nthe estate tax, as our Republican friends would have us do, the Walton \nfamily alone would receive an estimated $32.7 billion tax break, if the \nestate tax was completely repealed--one family, $32.7 billion. This is \npatently insane. This is insane. Insane.\n  We have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized \nworld. We have massive unemployment. I am trying to get seniors--50-\nplus million people--a $250 check, by the way, because we have not seen \na COLA for the last 2 years for seniors and disabled vets. That would \ncost, in 1 year, about $14 billion. The Walton family itself would get \nmore than double in a tax break what some of us are fighting for for \nover 50 million seniors and disabled vets. We can't afford to give $14 \nbillion to help some of the people in this country who are struggling \nthe hardest. We cannot do that, but somehow we can afford to give $32.7 \nbillion in tax breaks to one of the richest families in this country. \nIf that makes sense to anybody, please call my office. It doesn't make \nsense to me, and I don't think it makes sense to the vast majority of \nthe American people.\n  Under this agreement, the estate tax rate, which was 55 percent under \nPresident Clinton, will decline to 35 percent, with an exemption on the \nfirst $5 million of an individual's estate, $10 million for couples. \nLet's remember again that this tax applies only to the top three-tenths \nof 1 percent of the families in this country. This is not just a tax \nbreak for the rich; it is a tax break for the very, very rich.\n  Again, this agreement says we are only going to extend this for 2 \nyears. Well, frankly, I doubt that very much. I suspect that 2 years \nfrom now the same argument will be made. They will be extending it. \nFrankly, our Republican colleagues, representing the richest people in \nthe world, are hell-bent on abolishing the estate tax completely.\n  Those are some of the reasons I think we should be voting against \nthis agreement.\n  Third--and this is an issue I have been talking about, and I am happy \nto hear there is more discussion about this in the last few days--is \nthe so-called payroll tax holiday. What that is about is that this \nwould cut $120 billion in Social Security payroll tax for workers. On \nthe surface, this sounds like a very good idea because the worker, \ninstead of paying 6.2 percent into Social Security, pays 4.2 percent. \nIf you think about it for 2 seconds, you really understand that it is \nnot a good idea because this is money being diverted from the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Social Security, in my view, has been the most successful Federal \nprogram in perhaps the history of our country. In the last 75 years, \nwhether in good or bad times, Social Security has paid out every nickel \nowed to every eligible American. Today, Social Security has a $2.6 \ntrillion surplus. Today, Social Security can pay out benefits for the \nnext 29 years. Our goal, and what we must do, is make sure we extend it \nbeyond 29 years, for the next 75 years. Well, if we divert $120 billion \nfrom the Social Security trust fund and give it to workers today, what \nyou are doing is cutting back the viability--the long-term viability--\nof Social Security.\n  That is not just Bernie Sanders raising this issue. There are many \npeople representing millions of senior citizens who are deeply \nconcerned about this proposal--this provision in the agreement between \nthe President and the Republican leadership.\n  The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare is \none of the very largest senior groups in America. They do a very good \njob. We have many seniors in Vermont who are members of this \norganization. Their job is to do what the title of the organization \nsuggests, which is to preserve Social Security and Medicare. Just the \nother day, they sent out a news release, and the title of the news \nrelease was ``Cutting Contributions to Social Security Signals the \nBeginning of the End; Payroll Tax Holiday is Anything But.''\n  Let me quote from Barbara Kennelly, a former member of Congress, who \nis the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n\n       Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the \n     current economic crisis, it has been bartered in a deal that \n     provides deficit-busting tax cuts for the wealthy. Diverting \n     $120 billion in Social Security contributions for a so-\n     called tax holiday may sound like a good deal for workers \n     now, but it is bad business for the program that a \n     majority of middle-class seniors will rely upon in the \n     future.\n\n  That, again, is a quote from Barbara Kennelly, President and CEO of \nthe National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I think many of us should understand where this \nconcept originated. This is not a progressive idea. This is an idea \nthat came from Republicans and conservatives who want to end Social \nSecurity. I want to read an interesting quote from a gentleman named \nBruce Bartlett. Mr. Bartlett was a former top adviser to Presidents \nReagan and George H.W. Bush. This is what he wrote in opposition to \nthis payroll tax cut.\n\n       What are the odds that Republicans will ever allow this 1-\n     year tax holiday to expire? They wrote the Bush tax cuts with \n     explicit expiration dates. Then, when it came time for the \n     law they wrote to take effect, exactly as they wrote it, they \n     said any failure to extend them permanently would constitute \n     the biggest tax increase in history.\n\n  So what Mr. Bartlett is saying--and I will go back to his quote in a \nsecond--is what we all know to be true; that around here, in Congress, \nif you provide a tax break for 1 year--in this case a payroll tax \nholiday--a year from now, if you restore the old rates--which are 6.2 \npercent--our Republican friends are going to say Democrats are raising \nyour taxes. It ``ain't'' gonna happen.\n  This 1-year extension could well become a permanent extension, and if \nit becomes a permanent extension, you are diverting a huge amount of \nmoney from Social Security and you are weakening the entire financial \nstructure of Social Security in this country, which I expect is exactly \nwhat some would like to do.\n  President Obama says: Well, not to worry. It is only 1 year. Don't \nworry, that 1 year is going to be covered by the Federal Government.\n  So for the very first time, out of the Treasury Department, money is \ngoing\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\nto come into Social Security, which has always been 100 percent \ndependent, as it should be, on payroll taxes. For the first time, we \nare breaking that. Around here you do it once and it is going to \ncontinue.\n  Barbara Kennelly, the President of the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare, says:\n\n       Cutting these contributions to Social Security signals the \n     beginning of the end.\n\n  So we should be very, very, very mindful of that. We should not \nsupport this payroll tax. It is one of the more dangerous provisions in \nthis agreement.\n  But let me get back now, if I might, to what Bruce Bartlett--a former \ntop adviser for Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush--recently wrote:\n\n       If allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire is the biggest tax \n     increase in history--one that Republicans claim would \n     decimate a still fragile economy--then surely the expiration \n     of a payroll tax holiday would also constitute a massive tax \n     increase on the working people of America. Republicans would \n     prefer to destroy Social Security's finances or permanently \n     fund it with general revenues than allow a once-suspended \n     payroll tax to be reimposed. Arch Social Security hater Peter \n     Ferrara once told me that funding it with general revenues \n     was part of his plan to destroy it by converting Social \n     Security into a welfare program rather than an earned \n     benefit.\n\n  Once again, that is a quote from Bruce Bartlett, a former adviser to \nPresident Reagan and the first President Bush. So what he is saying \nis--and this is maybe one of the sleeping issues in this agreement \nbetween the President and the Republican leadership--we may be taking a \nhuge step forward in destroying the most important program in this \ncountry--which is Social Security--by diverting now $120 billion, and \nin the future hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars from this \nprogram so that, in fact, it will not be there for our kids and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, the fourth point I want to make in opposition to this \nagreement--and one that I have made before and read a little bit \nabout--is that while some of the business taxes in this agreement may \nwork to create jobs, some of them won't. The more important point is \nthat economists on both ends of the political spectrum believe the \nbetter way to spur the economy and to create the millions and millions \nof jobs we must create is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.\n  Just a few minutes ago I read excerpts from a very good book by a \nfriend of mine, Arianna Huffington, entitled ``Third World America.'' \nThe purpose of her book was to give us a warning that if we as a nation \ndo not get our act together in a variety of ways, including our \nphysical infrastructure, we are headed down the pike to be a Third \nWorld nation.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, we as a nation \nneed to spend $2.2 trillion in the next 5 years alone in order to take \ncare of our infrastructure needs.\n  Unfortunately, this agreement, signed by the President and the \nRepublicans, doesn't put one penny into infrastructure. So if we are \nserious about creating jobs, if we are serious about making sure our \neconomy can be competitive in the global economy, we have to be \nwatching what other countries are doing, and they are investing far \nmore than we are.\n  The stimulus package, by the way, will help us very much in Vermont \nin this area. Right now, if you were to drive around the State of \nVermont--and I think in many other places in this country--and you took \nout your cell phone, you would find it very hard to make calls in a \nnumber of areas of the State. A few months ago, I was literally a mile \nand a half away from our State capital in Montpelier, near Northfield, \nVT. I could not make a telephone call with my cell phone. That is true \nin many parts of Vermont and in many areas of America. We are lagging \nbehind many other countries in terms of the accessibility of cell phone \nservice and broadband--and broadband.\n  So I am happy to say that in Vermont we received a very generous \ngrant through the stimulus package that will help us, and other States \ndid the same. But those are areas where we have to invest. You have to \ninvest in broadband and make sure cell phone service is available in \nrural America--all over America. I talked a moment ago about our train \nservices. There are train services today which are worse than they were \n30 or 40 years ago. It takes longer to get from destination A to \ndestination B. China is investing huge sums of money building high-\nspeed rail at a rate that we could not even dream about.\n  So while in this agreement we do have money for business tax cuts, I \ndo not think that is the best way to invest taxpayer money if we are \nserious about creating the jobs that we need. Corporate America already \nis sitting on close to $2 trillion cash on hand. I don't know that more \ntax breaks are going to help them very much. I think that it is a lot \nsmarter--and I think most economists agree with me--to be investing in \nour infrastructure, both to create jobs now and to improve our \ncompetitiveness in years to come.\n  Further, Mr. President, I want to say a word on this--I mentioned \nthis earlier today: President Obama talks about this being a compromise \nagreement; you can't get everything you want. I certainly understand \nthat. But one of the aspects of the compromise he points to is an \nextension of unemployment benefits for 13 months. Well, let me be very \nclear. I think at a time when 2 million of our fellow Americans are \nabout to lose their unemployment, at a time when unemployment is \nextraordinarily high--long-term unemployment is, I think, higher than \nat any point on record, with people looking for work month after month \nafter month and not finding it--it would be morally unacceptable if \nthis country did not extend unemployment benefits for those workers for \n13 months. Yet the President sees this as a great sign of compromise.\n  I would argue the contrary. I would suggest to you that for the past \n40 years, under both Democratic and Republican administrations and \nunder Democratic and Republican leadership in the Senate or in the \nHouse, whenever the unemployment rate has been above 7.2 \npercent, unemployment insurance has always been extended. In other \nwords, this has been a bipartisan policy for 40 years. I don't want to \nsee us seeing and accepting as a really great give on the part of \nRepublicans--something that they are giving us as part of a \ncompromise--when it has been bipartisan policy for 40 years under \nDemocratic and Republican leadership. So I don't accept this as a great \ngift. I think the American people understand you don't turn your backs \non unemployed workers--people who have been unemployed for long periods \nof time. You don't allow those people to lose their homes. You don't \nforce these people out into the streets. You don't take away what \nshreds of dignity they have remaining. That is not what you do. That \nhas always been Republican philosophy as well as Democratic philosophy. \nThis is not a great gift. So I do not accept this is a compromise.\n\n  Let me be very clear. As I said earlier, I do believe there are \npositive parts of this agreement that must be maintained as we move \nforward toward a better agreement. Let me cite some of them that make a \nlot of sense to me and that I believe we have to retain and build on.\n  The obvious one, in addition to extending unemployment benefits, is \nwe have to extend middle-class tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans. As \nI have been documenting over and over again today, we are looking at a \nsituation where the middle class in this country is collapsing. Under \nPresident Bush, the median family income went down by $2,200. People \nare losing their health care. It would be asinine, it would be \nunacceptable if the middle class did not continue to receive the tax \nbreaks that were developed in 2001 and 2003. That, to a large degree, \nis what this fight is about. We have to extend those tax breaks to the \nmiddle class but not tax breaks to the millionaires and billionaires.\n  Further, there are some other good provisions in this agreement--the \nearned-income tax credit for working Americans and the child and \ncollege tax credits--and they are very important. They will keep \nmillions of our fellow Americans from slipping out of the middle class \nand into poverty, and they will allow millions of our fellow citizens \nto send their kids to college.\n  I just talked a moment ago about the fact that we have over 100,000 \nfamilies in this country where kids graduate high school wanting to go \nto college but can't afford to do so. This proposal will help them do \nthat, and that is right.\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\n  But despite the fact there are some good and important provisions in \nthis proposal, when we look at the overall package, when we look at a \n$13.7 trillion national debt and a declining middle class, I think what \nwe have to say is this package just doesn't do it. It is just not good \nenough.\n  The President says he knows how to count votes. I understand that. He \nsays: Well, you had a couple of votes here to make sure that we would \nnot give tax breaks to millionaires. And the President has been very \nclear he does not want to do that. I understand that. But he says: What \nchoice do I have?\n  I think the answer is that we have to fight this issue. In my view, \nthe solution ultimately will not be resolved inside the beltway, in the \nSenate or in the House. It will be resolved when millions of Americans \nget on their telephones, get on their computers, and let their Senators \nand their Members of the House of Representatives know they are \nprofoundly outraged that at a time when the rich never had it so good, \nand when we have a huge national debt, this agreement contains huge tax \nbreaks for those people who don't need it. That is how we defeat this.\n  I am not sure that all alone here in the debate I am going to turn \nany of my Republican or even some Democratic colleagues around. But I \ndo believe that, if people all over this country stand up and say: Wait \na minute, how much do the richest people in this country want? I just \ndocumented a few moments ago that the top 400 wealthiest people in this \ncountry saw a doubling of their income under President Bush--a doubling \nof their income--and tax rates went down. When is enough enough? How \nmuch do they need?\n\n  I think and I would hope, by the way, that this is certainly not just \na progressive issue. I am a progressive. This is a conservative issue. \nYear after year, I have heard our conservative friends telling us: My \ngoodness, we just cannot continue to raise the national debt; we have \nto do something about this unsustainable deficit. This agreement grows, \nincreases the national debt. What kind of honest conservative can vote \nto increase the national debt? And if they do, please, no more lectures \nhere on the floor of the Senate. Your hypocrisy will be known to \neverybody. Don't tell us you are concerned about the national debt and \ngive tax breaks to billionaires and raise the national debt so our kids \nand grandchildren in the middle class will have to pay higher taxes in \norder to pay off the debt that was caused by you giving tax breaks to \nmillionaires. Please, no more lectures on that issue. Just say: OK, \nrich people contributed to my campaign; I have to do what they want. \nThat will be honest. Please, no more lectures about your concern about \nthe national debt.\n  Again, I want to reiterate this point. Everybody says: Don't worry, \nthese are only 2 years. These are not, in my view, 2 years. If you do \nthem for 2 years, the same old argument will be back 2 years from now, \nand we will be in the midst of a Presidential election. What our \nRepublican friends will say, as sure as I am standing here--and I am \nglad we have a gentleman putting this in the Congressional Record. I \nwant people to go back to the Congressional Record. I am sure I will be \nproven right that 2 years from now our Republican friends will come \nback and they will say: Oh, my word, if you repeal these tax breaks, \nyou are going to be raising taxes. We can't do that.\n  What will make the situation even more difficult 2 years from now \nthan today is you have President Obama--if he is the Democratic \ncandidate 2 years from now, he will say: I don't believe in these tax \nbreaks for the rich, and I will do my best to repeal them. But his \ncredibility has been damaged because that is what he said in the last \ncampaign. That is what he has been saying all along. The President does \nnot believe in extending these tax breaks for the wealthy. I know that. \nEverybody knows that. But if he caves in now, who is going to believe \nhe is not going to do the same thing 2 years from now? That is the \ndamage.\n  Then I think what is even more troublesome is that once we move down \nthe path of more tax breaks for the very wealthy, we are accepting the \nheart and soul of trickle-down economics, which has been, to my mind, a \nproven disaster, a failure. I remind the listeners and my colleagues \nthat these tax breaks have been in existence since 2001. They were in \nexistence throughout almost all of President Bush's tenure. The end \nresult was that we lost 600,000 private sector jobs--lost 600,000 \nprivate sector jobs, the worst job performance record maybe in the \nhistory of this country. Trickle-down economics does not work.\n  Giving tax breaks to billionaires does not stimulate the economy. \nHelping working families and the middle class get decent jobs and tax \nbreaks for people who need the money and are going to spend the money \nis what creates jobs, not giving tax breaks to billionaires who do not \nneed it and who are not going to spend it.\n  Again, the point I want to make here is that if people think, oh, \nthis is just temporary, this is just 2 years, I believe they are \nkidding themselves. I believe that 2 years from now, the debate will be \nabout extending them or perhaps even making them permanent.\n  At a time, as I mentioned earlier, where the top 1 percent has seen a \nhuge increase in the percentage of income they earn in this country--\ngoing from 8 percent in the 1970s to 23.5 percent now--and where the \ntop 1 percent now earns more income than the bottom 50 percent, it is \ntotally absurd to be giving tax breaks to people who do not need them, \nand it is not good economics, as well.\n  Here is the other irony, as I also mentioned earlier--I guess by this \ntime, I am going to be doing a little repetition here. But as I \nmentioned earlier, you have a number of millionaires and some of the \nrichest people in this country who will benefit from these tax breaks. \nDo you know what they are saying? Do you know what Warren Buffett is \nsaying? Do you know what Bill Gates is saying? Do you know what Ben \nCohen from Ben & Jerry's is saying? Do you know what many other wealthy \npeople are saying? Hey, thanks very much; I don't need it. It is more \nimportant that you invest in our children. It is more important that we \nprotect working families. We are doing just fine, thanks. Our incomes \nhave soared, our tax rates have gone down, and we don't need it. In \nother words, we have this absurd situation that not only is this bad \npublic policy, we are actually forcing tax breaks on people who don't \nneed them and don't even want them. The richest people in this \ncountry--Bill Gates, Warren Buffett--we don't want it.\n  Here is something else. Here is something else that needs to be \nunderstood. What the Republicans are doing in this agreement is driving \nup the national debt. You may think that is not what the Republicans \nreally believe in. They are supposed to be conservatives. They don't \nwant a high national debt. Why would they be giving tax breaks to the \nrich and driving up the national debt? There is a rationale. These guys \nare not dumb, and I think they know what they are doing. Here is what \nthe argument is. If you drive up the national debt and the deficit, you \nthen come back to the floor of the Senate and you say: You know what, \nthis national debt and deficit is unsustainable. The only way we can \ndeal with it now is by cutting, cutting, cutting. We are already \nbeginning to hear how some of those thoughts are going to develop.\n  There was, as you know, a deficit reduction commission appointed by \nthe President. When I heard who was going to be chairing that \ncommission and cochairing it--Alan Simpson, a very nice gentleman but a \nvery conservative gentleman who has attacked Social Security for a very \nlong period of time, and Erskine Bowles, a conservative Democrat--I had \nserious doubts about what was going to come out of that commission. The \ngood news is, they needed 14 votes to pass their recommendations and \nthey didn't get the 14. But a lot of the ideas that Senator Simpson and \nMr. Bowles developed are going to be filtering around this institution.\n  What the Republicans will say is that when you have a huge debt--\nwhich they helped create--we are going to have to cut. What are we \ngoing to have to do? As you recall, that deficit reduction commission \nrecommended a savage cut--over 20 percent--in Social Security benefits \nfor young workers--major cuts. There was talk about raising the Social \nSecurity age up to, I think, 69. They are talking about cuts in \nMedicare, cuts in Medicaid, cuts in education.\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\n  Right now--I think I have documented it a dozen times--it is a \nhorrendous situation when so many of our young people cannot afford to \ngo to college, and the others who do go to college and graduate end up \non average something like $25,000 in debt. These guys on the deficit \nreduction commission were recommending that the interest on that debt \nbe accrued while students are in college.\n  Here we have us slipping behind the rest of the world in terms of our \npercentage of college graduates, and this recommendation is on young \npeople, who do not have a lot of money, who were borrowing money, that \nthey will have to pay more to go to college. You are going to see it.\n  Here is the argument--good, it is going to be in the Congressional \nRecord. Check it out, see if I am right. The argument will be: The \ndeficit is going up, the national debt is going up. We have to attack \nand cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans programs.\n  This year--Senator Landrieu from Louisiana made this point a little \nwhile ago--and I think this is roughly right--our soldiers, men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces, are going to get a 1.8-percent increase in \ntheir salaries this year, 1.8 percent for people putting their lives on \nthe line to defend this country. A $250 check for 50-plus million \nseniors and disabled vets--we couldn't pass it; too much money--$14 \nbillion. They are going to come back and cut and cut in the name of \ntrying to deal with the high deficit which they are now increasing. \nThat is an issue we must be addressing.\n\n  In my view, while there are some good parts of the proposal, it is \ncertainly one that should be significantly improved. I believe the way \nit can be improved is by the American people beginning to get involved \nin the process.\n  I can tell you, as I said earlier, I don't know how the calls are \ngoing today in my office because I have been here, but for the last 3 \ndays, we have received thousands of phone calls and e-mails, and over \n98 percent of them have been against this proposal. The American people \nbelieve, the people in Vermont believe we can do a lot better job in \ncrafting a proposal that represents the middle class and our kids and \nnot just the wealthiest people in this country.\n  When we talk about this proposal negotiated by the White House and \nRepublican leadership, again, it has to be put within the broad context \nof what is going on in America. That context is not a pretty picture. \nThat context requires us to understand that the middle class, which has \nbeen the backbone of this country for so very long, is in the process \nof disappearing. That context makes us understand that millions of \nfamilies in this country are worried, parents are worried, not just \nabout their own lives--they are prepared to work 50 or 60 hours a week; \nthey are prepared to cut back on their own needs. I think what is \nhurting them more deeply is the kind of future they are contemplating \nfor their children. They are worried that, for the first time in the \nmodern history of America, their kids will get jobs that will pay them \nlower salaries than what the parents have earned. They are worried that \nunemployment will be much more likely for their kids than for \nthemselves. They are worried that while they were able to scrape \nthrough--in my case, I was able to scrape through college. I borrowed \nsome money, did some jobs, and made it like millions of other people. \nThey are worried that with the high cost of a college education and the \nreduction in their real earnings, they are not going to be able to send \ntheir kids to college. I have received e-mails--and I am sure you have, \nMr. President--the saddest thing in the world, where you have parents \nwho are saying: We have saved all of our lives for the thing we wanted \nthe most, which was to be able to send our son or daughter to college, \nand we can't do that now. That is the overall context this agreement \nhas to be placed within.\n  The issue is, again and again, the richest people in this country do \nnot need tax breaks. They are doing phenomenally well. They have \nalready been given huge amounts of tax breaks. It is the middle class, \nit is the working families, it is the lower income people we have to be \nworrying about and not just the wealthy and the powerful.\n  When we talk about why the middle class is declining, that is a tough \nissue. I am not here to suggest I know all of the answers. I surely \ndon't. It is a complicated issue. Honest people have differences of \nopinion. But let me touch on a few areas that I think will explain why \npoverty is going up and the middle class is going down. One of them \ndeals with our trade policies.\n  I can remember a number of years ago I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I can remember the lobbyists and the big money \ninterests coming around and saying: If you guys only pass NAFTA, this \nwould create a whole lot of jobs in the United States because we would \nbe able to ship products made in America to Mexico. In fact, as I \nrecall--it seems almost humorous now--what they said is: If we pass \nNAFTA, it would solve the problem of illegal immigration because the \neconomy of Mexico would be so strong that people would stay in their \nown country and not try to sneak across the border. That is, as we look \nback on it, somewhat humorous, that that issue was even discussed.\n  But one of the areas that, unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, \nwe have not dealt with is our disastrous trade policy. That is NAFTA; \nthat is permanent normal trade relations; that is trade policies which \nhave encouraged large corporations in this country to send jobs abroad \nbecause they can find workers in other countries, in low-wage \ncountries, who are prepared to work for pennies an hour.\n  I think not only have we not addressed this issue from an economic \nperspective the way we should, I have to tell you, I know that during \ncampaigns, a lot of Members of Congress put their 30-second ads on the \nair saying how concerned they are about outsourcing and our trade \npolicy. But somehow, the day after the election, I didn't hear that \ndiscussion resume on the floor of the House or the Senate. I want to \nsay this is true not just of Republicans but of Democrats as well.\n  A lot of Democrats campaign on the need for trade reform, but it does \nnot happen. In fact, I have been here in the Senate now for almost 4 \nyears. I have not heard one serious--underline ``serious''--discussion \nto explain how in recent years we have lost millions and millions of \nmanufacturing jobs, when those jobs were the backbone of the working \nclass of this country, not providing only decent wages but decent \nbenefits, decent health care, decent pensions.\n  There was once a time in this country when a manufacturing job was a \nticket to the middle class. I have to say something because I remember \nnot so many years ago, there were national leaders saying: Well--to the \nyoung people--you do not have to worry about that factory work anymore. \nYou do not have to be involved in production because, you know what. \nAll of the jobs in the future are going to be nice and clean in offices \nand on computers.\n  I think we demeaned and insulted the people who built the products we \nconsumed. There is nothing wrong with a factory job if workers there \nearn a decent wage and have a decent benefit. Those are the jobs that \nbuilt America. I remember, and we should never forget--and we now have \ncelebrated the anniversary of Pearl Harbor. There was a speech that \nPresident Roosevelt gave a day after Pearl Harbor, in a joint session \nto the Congress, when he declared war on Japan.\n  I saw a video of that speech. It was a remarkable speech because, at \nthat moment, at that moment, the United States was not only fighting \nJapan, and we knew the fight with Germany and Nazism was right around \nthe corner, at that point we were having to fight a war on two fronts: \nin Asia and in Europe. Hitler was on the march; the Japanese were in \nChina. The Japanese had just attacked Pearl Harbor. Here we were, just \nabout to enter the war. How could we possibly win that war?\n  Yet because of the manufacturing capabilities that we had at that \ntime, and this is an amazing story, literally in 2\\1/2\\ years the war \nwas essentially won, obviously not completed until 1945. But because of \nthe incredible industrial capabilities in this country, the ability to \ntransform our manufacturing sector from a consumer-oriented sector, \nfrom automobiles into tanks; from shirts into uniforms; from hunting \nrifles into machine guns, within 2 or 3 years we had essentially won \nthat war. It was an\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nincredible effort on the part of workers in this country who \ntransformed our economy into an industrial force that was able to \nsupply our soldiers with the weapons that they needed to defeat Hitler \nand the Japanese.\n  Where are we today in terms of our manufacturing capabilities? As I \nmentioned earlier, a couple of weeks ago, my wife and I went shopping \nfor Christmas presents, literally, in just a plain old department \nstore. It is literally very hard to find a product not manufactured in \nChina. It is very hard to find a product, a gift that we could buy that \nwas manufactured in the United States of America.\n  I think people understand instinctively that this country will not be \na major economic player in years to come if we allow our manufacturing \nbase to continue to decline. Again, just under Bush, we went from 17 \nmillion manufacturing jobs down to 12 million jobs, in 8 years of Bush. \nHow do we survive as a strong industrial power if our manufacturing \njobs disappear?\n  Today there are fewer manufacturing jobs in this country than there \nwere in April of 1941, about 8 months before the attack on Pearl \nHarbor; fewer manufacturing jobs today than in April of 1941. Those \nmanufacturing jobs that are left--that are left--in many cases pay \nlower wages, with fewer benefits, than they did a generation ago.\n  In other words, we are moving not only in a decline in our \nmanufacturing jobs but in the wages our workers earn and the benefits \nthey receive.\n  I raise all of these issues to put this agreement between the \nPresident and the Republican leadership in a broader context. Today--\nand this is just an incredible fact, and it is absolutely frightening \nto the future of the middle class in this country--today, entry level \nautomobile workers at General Motors and Chrysler now earn half as \nmuch, half as much as their peers made just 1 year ago. Instead of \nmaking $28 an hour, a middle-class wage, they are now making $14 an \nhour. This is in the automobile industry which has always been the gold \nstandard for manufacturing jobs in America. If workers with a union in \nthe automobile industry are making $14 an hour, what do you think \nworkers in New Mexico are going to be making without a strong union?\n  So what you are seeing is a dissolution of the middle class, wages \nare going down, and in this remarkable example, a 50-percent reduction; \nthe older workers making good wages, new workers half the wages.\n  Is this the future of America? Is this what our kids have to look \nforward to, that they are going to be earning half the wages their \nfathers made, that their mothers made? Is that the future? In the midst \nof all of that, we run up a huge national debt, send our jobs to China, \nand we give tax breaks to millionaires? Is that the future these kids \nhave to look forward to? I certainly hope not. We are going to have to \nbe tough, and we are going to have to take on some very powerful \nspecial interests to turn this whole thing around.\n  Today I have devoted a lot of time to our national debt, $13.7 \ntrillion, and to our deficit, which is $1.4 trillion. But we cannot \nignore our trade deficit. In 2008, our trade deficit was nearly $700 \nbillion. Last year our trade deficit with China alone was almost $227 \nbillion. In other words, we are purchasing a whole lot more products \nthan we are selling.\n  Sometimes I get a kick out of hearing the defenders of our trade \npolicy talk about all of the products we are exporting. Well, yeah, we \nare exporting a lot, but we are importing a heck of a lot more. So I \nthink what you have is a major economic issue. That economic issue is \nthat we are losing millions of good-paying jobs because of our \ndisastrous trade policy. Furthermore, the jobs we have, on those jobs, \nwe are seeing a decline in wages and in benefits.\n  I think the bottom line of this is not just an economic issue, it is \na moral issue as well, and that is when companies such as General \nElectric and all the rest--I do not mean to be picking a lot on General \nElectric, but I have a quote I want to make. This was a few years back. \nI think it is important because it applies not just to General \nElectric. But I want people to hear this. GE is, of course, one of our \nmajor corporations. The manufacturer's recent disclosure pointed out, \nthe taxpayers of this country, through the Fed, provided $16 billion in \nbailout to General Electric during the recent crisis. This is what the \nhead, the CEO of General Electric, Jeffrey Immelt, said in 2002, \nDecember 6:\n\n       When I am talking to GE managers, I talk China, China, \n     China, China, China. You need to be there. You need to change \n     the way people talk about it and how they get there. I am a \n     nut on China. Outsourcing from China is going to grow to 5 \n     billion. We are building a tech center in China. Every \n     discussion today has to center on China. The cost basis is \n     extremely attractive. You can take an 18-cubic-foot \n     refrigerator, make it in China, land it in the United States, \n     and land it for less than we can make an 18-cubic-foot \n     refrigerator today ourselves.\n\n  Gee. A couple of years ago when GE had some difficult economic times, \nand they needed $16 billion to bail them out, I did not hear Mr. Immelt \ngoing to China, China, China, China, China. I did not hear that. I \nheard Mr. Immelt going to the taxpayers of the United States for his \nwelfare check.\n  So I say to Mr. Immelt, and I say to all of those CEOs who have been \nso quick to run to China, that maybe it is time to start reinvesting in \nthe United States of America. But it is not just Mr. Immelt. I do not \nmean to just pick on him. It is all of them. They all see the future in \nChina, in Vietnam, in countries where people work for pennies an hour.\n  Mr. Immelt came to his decision in the footsteps of the former CEO of \nGE, Jack Welsh. What Jack Welsh was famously quoted as saying:\n\n       Ideally--\n\n  This is the guy who was head of General Electric before Immelt. He \nsaid:\n\n       Ideally, we would have every plant we own on a barge.\n\n  Do you remember that quote? He said:\n\n       Ideally, we would have every plant we own on a barge.\n\n  What did he mean by that? What he meant by that, if you are on a \nbarge, you can move your plant to any part of the world where the labor \nis cheapest. So if it gets too expensive in China, and you have to pay \npeople 75 cents an hour, you go to Vietnam. If it gets too expensive in \nVietnam, maybe you can go to North Korea and have people work under \nmarshal law. I do not know.\n  But what he was saying is, his goal was to make sure that GE would \ncreate jobs in those countries in the world where workers were paid the \nlowest possible wage.\n  Former GE executive vice president Frank Doyle said:\n\n       We did a lot of violence to the expectations of the \n     American workforce. We downsized, we delayered, and we \n     outsourced.\n\n  He was honest enough to admit that. But, again, I do not mean to just \npick on Jeff Immelt or General Electric. It is a history of \ncorporations all over America.\n  Let me just mention that the CEO of Cisco, John Chambers--and this is \nwhat he says. You know, we tell the young people: The future is in \ninformation technology. We want you guys to be smart. Learn how to use \nthe computers. You are not going to work in factories.\n  This is what the CEO of Cisco, certainly one of the large IT \ncompanies in the United States, said:\n\n       China will become the IT center of the world. And we can \n     have a healthy discussion about whether that's in 2020 or \n     2040. What we are trying to do is outline an entire strategy \n     of becoming a Chinese company.\n\n  This was in 2004.\n\n       Furthermore--\n\n  He says, October 15, 2004--this is Cisco:\n\n     we believe in giving something back and truly becoming a \n     Chinese company.\n\n  Meanwhile, when Cisco needs tax breaks, they get it from the \ntaxpayers of the United States of America. Boy, are they taking us for \ndummies. They outsource their jobs to China and so forth.\n  In the last campaign, one of the folks who ended up getting a lot \nmore publicity than he usually does is the president and CEO of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, a gentleman named Tom Donohue.\n  (Mr. UDALL of New Mexico assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SANDERS. Again, my point is not to just pick on individuals. \nEvery quote I am giving can be multiplied 50, 100 times over. This is \nwhat corporate America believes. They believe it is totally appropriate \nto throw American workers out on the street, move to low-\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\nwage countries, China and other countries, pay people a few cents an \nhour, and bring their products back into the United States.\n  Mr. Tom Donohue is the president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. He got a lot of publicity during the last election because \nthe Chamber of Commerce became the funnel for a lot of money that went \ninto campaigns around the country. They raised tens of millions of \ndollars, a lot of the money, that was undisclosed. All the rich folks \nand billionaires gave money to the Chamber of Commerce, and they were \nable to elect candidates who were sympathetic to their point of view.\n  Let's find out what their point of view is. This is a quote going \nback to 2004:\n\n       One job sent overseas, if it happens to be my job, is one \n     too many. But the benefit of offshoring jobs outweighs the \n     cost.\n\n  That was Tom Donohue, president and CEO of the largest business \norganization in America. They are in favor of offshoring American jobs. \nThey think it is a good idea. They understand that if corporations \nthrow American workers out on the street and go to China and pay people \nthere pennies an hour, it will make more profits. Give them credit. \nThey are upfront about it. We don't care about the United States of \nAmerica. We don't care about young people. We don't care about the \nfuture of this country. The future of the world is in China.\n  Here is a quote that appeared in one of the papers:\n\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue \n     urged American companies to send jobs overseas.\n\n  That was in 2004. This is an AP story.\n\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue--\n\n  This is the head of the largest business organization in America. \nThat is where all these businesses come together to develop policy, to \nlobby us, to provide campaign contributions--\n\n     urged American companies to send jobs overseas.\n\n  That is really patriotic. That is standing up for the United States.\n\n       Donohue said Wednesday that exporting high-paid tech jobs \n     to low-cost countries such as India, China, and Russia saves \n     companies money. It's no surprise that Donohue, who tripled \n     the Chamber of Commerce's lobbying team since 1997 and \n     aggressively promotes pro-business policies, endorses \n     offshoring. The 3 million member organization, the Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business consortium, champions \n     tax cuts, free trade, workers compensation reform, and more \n     liberal trade policies with China.\n\n  What more do we need to understand why we have lost millions of good-\npaying manufacturing jobs, why wages are going down? What more do we \nneed when the president of the Chamber of Commerce tells us he thinks \nit is good public policy to send jobs to China? I don't think there is \nmuch we have to discover. They are telling us this.\n  In a moment what I will be talking about is how these ideas from the \nbig-moneyed people become implemented in policy which has to do a lot \nwith lobbying and campaign contributions. Before I go there, I wish to \ngive some more examples about how business leaders feel about the \nworkers of this country and the young people.\n  This, again, is a quote. I apologize. It is a few years old, from \n2004, January 19. This is from Alan Lacy, the CEO of Sears Roebuck and \nCompany at the time:\n\n       There are four or five times as many smart, driven people \n     in China than there are in the United States. And there are \n     another four or five, three or four times as many people in \n     India that are smarter or as smart or have more drive. And if \n     technology is now going to basically reduce location as a \n     barrier to competition--\n\n  I.e., you have a World Wide Web and you can do your work in China or \nIndia--\n\n     then essentially you have something like, whatever that was, \n     seven or nine times more smart, committed people than are now \n     competing in this marketplace against certain activities.\n\n  So we are going to see, I think, a huge incentive to ship some of \nthese more commoditylike knowledge workers' jobs offshore.\n  So here we have our blue-collar jobs decimated, and we told the kids \nnot to worry. You didn't want to work in the factory anyhow. We have \ngood information technology, computer-based jobs for you. But then you \nhave the heads of large corporations saying: Why do I want American \nyoung people to do this? I can have Indian young people do it who will \nwork for a fraction of the wages. We all see this. It is nothing new. \nYou try to get a plane reservation and you are talking to somebody in \nIndia. Please, do not hear me as being anti-Indian or anti-Chinese. \nThat is the furthest thing I would want anyone to think. We want to \nwork with people all over the world. But we don't have to destroy the \nmiddle class of this country to help people around the world. You don't \nhave to be a corporate CEO to sell out your own people who built your \ncompany to run abroad. This Senator is not anti-Chinese, far from it, \nanti-Indian, anti-Vietnamese. I guess I plead guilty to being pro-\nAmerican. Maybe that is suspect here.\n  The former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Carly Fiorina, ran for Senator. \nThis is what she said when she was the CEO of Hewlett-Packard in 2004:\n\n       There is no job that is America's God-given right anymore.\n\n  I could go on and on and on, but I think we have the point. The point \nis that when things get rough for corporate America, as they did \nrecently for General Electric, they run to the taxpayers in order to be \nbailed out. But their overall philosophy is that their goal in life is \nto make as much money as they can in any way they can, and, therefore, \nyou run to those countries where wages are low.\n  We are seeing it all the time. It is not just blue collar; it is \nincreasingly white color. We have radiologists who are reading X-rays \nin India. People behind the computer can do work in India as well as \nhere, and these corporate folks have taken advantage of that and sold \nout the young people of this country and the working class.\n  It is virtually impossible to find anything in a Walmart or other \nstores such as that that is made in America today. This is essentially \ntrue for clothing. An increasing amount of clothing comes from \nBangladesh. Today, there are 4,000 garment factories in Bangladesh \nmaking clothing for Walmart, Gap, JC Penney, Levi Strauss, Tommy \nHilfiger, and many others. Garment workers in Bangladesh, some 3.5 \nmillion of them--and the number is growing--are among the lowest paid \nworkers in the world. They have difficulty buying enough food and \nshelter for their own needs.\n  The good news is the minimum wage in Bangladesh was doubled. It went \nfrom 11.5 cents an hour to 23 cents an hour. So when you buy your shirt \nmade in Bangladesh, you have young women there coming in from the \ncountryside who are now paid, because of a doubling of the minimum \nwage, 23 cents an hour. Is that something our people should be asked to \ncompete against? Should we say to the American worker: We can get you \njobs. We are prepared to invest in the United States. We are an \nAmerican company. You helped make us great. Thank you for the work you \nhave done over the years. Thank you for purchasing our products. Thank \nyou for making go us strong. If you are prepared to work for $1 an \nhour, $2 an hour, $3 an hour, we will come back.\n  By the way, in the last campaign, what did we hear rumblings of? \nAbolishing the minimum wage. The minimum wage is now $7.25 an hour. \nThere are people out there who say: Look, if I can hire somebody in \nChina for $2 or $3 an hour and you want a job in America and I have to \npay you $7.25 an hour, why would I want to do that? If we abolish the \nminimum wage, I may hire you.\n  What a wonderful prospect for our young people to think about, \nworking for $4 or $5 an hour.\n  If we want to understand why the middle class is collapsing, why \nunemployment is high, why our manufacturing base has been decimated, \nwhy it is hard to purchase a product made in the United States, it has \na lot to do with our trade policies, which were pushed by people such \nas Mr. Donohue of the Chamber of Commerce and many others.\n  But it is not just a disastrous trade policy that has brought us to \nwhere we are today. The immediate cause of this crisis is--and this \ngets me sick thinking about it--what the crooks on Wall Street have \ndone to the American people. These people fought for a period of years \nto deregulate the banking industry. These people said to us: Well, if \nyou just would do away with Glass-\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\nSteagall, if you will just allow financial institutions, commercial \nbanks, investor banks, insurance companies, if you allow them to merge, \ndo away with these walls which Glass-Steagall, since the Great \nDepression, established, my God, it will be just terrific. It will be \ngood for the economy, good for the American people, good for our \ninternational competitiveness.\n  I remember those debates because I was at that point in the House of \nRepresentatives. I was a member of the Financial Institutions Committee \nat that point. I was on the committee that dealt with that. I remember \nall the times Alan Greenspan came before the committee and Robert \nRubin. We had Republicans, Democrats coming before the committee and \nsaying: This is what you have to do. You have to deregulate. You have \nto let these guys merge. Bigger is better. Against my votes. Somewhere \non the Internet there is a discussion I had with Alan Greenspan when he \ncame before our committee. I made it very clear to the people of \nVermont, to him and everybody else, that I did not think deregulation \nwas a good idea, that I thought it would lead to disaster. Someplace in \nthis world there is a quote of mine which pretty much predicts what was \ngoing to happen. But needless to say, I was one vote. The majority of \nthe Members in the House and Senate voted to deregulate. The rest is, \nunfortunately, history.\n  What we saw is people on Wall Street operating from a business model \nbased on fraud, based on dishonesty, understanding that the likelihood \nof them ever getting caught was small, that if things got very bad, \nthey would be bailed out by the taxpayers, understanding that they are \ntoo powerful to ever be put in jail, to be indicted, understanding that \nin this country when you are a CEO on Wall Street, you have so much \nwealth and so much power and so many lawyers and so many friends in \nCongress, you could do pretty much anything you want and not much is \ngoing to happen to you--and they did it. Their greed and recklessness \nand their illegal behavior destroyed this economy.\n  What they did to the American people is so horrible. Here we had a \nmiddle class which was already being battered as a result of trade \nagreements, loss of manufacturing jobs, health care costs going up, \ncouldn't afford to send their children to college--that had gone on for \nyears--and then these guys started pushing worthless and complicated \nfinancial instruments and the whole thing explodes. And they come \ncrying to the taxpayers of America to bail them out.\n\n  I will never forget--never forget--Hank Paulson coming before the \nDemocratic caucus--I am an Independent and have long been serving as an \nIndependent in Congress--saying that within a few days he needed $700 \nbillion or the entire world's financial system would collapse. My \nsuggestion to him at that meeting was: If you need the money, why don't \nyou go to your friends and get the money? Why don't you go to all your \nbanker friends and millionaire friends and billionaires friends and get \nsome of that money, and don't go to the middle class of this country \nthat has already been harmed.\n  In fact, we brought an amendment to the floor of the Senate, which \nwas one of the first amendments I brought as a Senator, which said that \nthe top 2 percent should pay for the bailout, not the American people. \nIt got defeated on a voice vote.\n  So what happens on Wall Street is we have seen a tremendous \nconcentration of ownership there, another issue we do not talk enough \nabout. I know Senator Brown and Senator Kaufman and I worked on a \nproposal to try to break up these large financial institutions. I think \nwe got 30-some-odd votes on that. We could not do it.\n  So what the American people should know now is, while we bailed out \nWall Street, because they were too big to fail, three out of the four \nlargest financial institutions--all of whom were bailed out very \nsignificantly--are now larger today than they were before the bailout.\n  Incredibly, since the start of the financial crisis, Wells Fargo has \ngrown 43 percent bigger, JPMorgan Chase has grown 51 percent bigger, \nand Bank of America is now 138 percent larger than before the financial \ncrisis began.\n  Can you imagine that? We bailed these guys out because they were too \nbig to fail, and now three out of the four largest ones are much larger \nthan they were. How did that happen? Well, in 2008, Bank of America--\nthe largest commercial bank in this country--which received a $45 \nbillion taxpayer bailout, purchased Countrywide, the largest mortgage \nlender in this country, and Merrill Lynch, the largest stock brokerage \nfirm in the country. That is how Bank of America expanded. They were \ntoo big to fail. Today they are much bigger.\n  In 2008, JPMorgan Chase, which received a $25 billion bailout from \nthe Bush Treasury Department and a $29 billion bridge loan from the \nFederal Reserve, acquired Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, the \nlargest savings and loan in the country. That is how JPMorgan Chase, a \nhuge bank, became even bigger.\n  In 2008, the Treasury Department provided an $18 billion tax break to \nWells Fargo to purchase Wachovia, allowing that bank to control 11 \npercent of all bank deposits in this country.\n  Hear this because this is quite unbelievable: When we try to \nunderstand what is going on in the economy today--the rich getting \nricher, the poor getting poorer, the middle class collapsing--today, \nafter we bailed out all these large banks, three out of four of them \nare now much larger than they were before. Today, Bank of America, \nJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo--the four largest financial \ninstitutions in this country--hold about $7.4 trillion in assets, and \nthat is equal to over half the Nation's estimated total output last \nyear. Four financial institutions have assets worth more than 52 \npercent of our total output last year.\n  Instead of breaking up these folks, these large institutions, we let \nthem get bigger. In fact, according to Simon Johnson, the former chief \neconomist of the International Monetary Fund:\n\n       As a result of the crisis and various government rescue \n     efforts, the largest 6 banks in our economy now have total \n     assets in excess [he claims] of 63 percent of GDP. . . . This \n     is a significant increase from even 2006, when the same \n     banks' assets were around 55 percent of GDP. . . .\n\n  Do you understand what this is about? Four financial institutions \nowning over half the assets of America. You talk about economic power, \nyou talk about political power, that is what we are talking about.\n  Simon Johnson continues: This is ``a complete transformation compared \nwith the situation in the U.S. just 15 years ago--when the 6 largest \nbanks had combined assets of only around 17 percent of GDP.''\n  So 15 years ago, 17 percent, six banks; today, four banks, and, he \nclaims, 63 percent of GDP. In other words, over the last 15 years, the \nlargest banks in this country have more than tripled in size.\n  Not only are too-big-to-fail financial institutions bad for \ntaxpayers, the enormous concentration of ownership in the financial \nsector has led to higher bank fees, usurious interest rates on credit \ncards, and fewer choices for consumers. What do you think happens when \nyou have a few institutions, a handful of institutions, controlling \nmortgage lending or where people get their credit cards?\n  Today, these huge financial institutions have become so big that \naccording to the Washington Post: The four largest banks in America now \nissue one out of every two mortgages, two out of three credit cards, \nand hold $4 out of every $10 in bank deposits in the entire country.\n  If any of these financial institutions were to get into major trouble \nagain, taxpayers would be on the hook for another substantial bailout. \nWe cannot allow that to happen. So the whole reason for the bailout was \nthat if any of these financial institutions collapsed, it would take \ndown a significant part of the economy and millions of jobs. We had to \nprop them up. We had to bail them out. It turns out that since we \nbailed them out, these handful of financial institutions are now even \nlarger than they were before and we now know they are enjoying very \nstrong profits and they are paying their CEOs even more in compensation \nthan they did before the breakdown.\n  In my view, if we are serious about understanding why the middle \nclass is collapsing, if we are serious about getting this economy \nmoving again long term, we have to have the courage to\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\ndo exactly what Teddy Roosevelt did back in the trust-busting days and \nbreak up these banks. The point Roosevelt was making was, it is bad for \nthe economy when a handful of entities control industry after industry. \nThey have a stranglehold on the economy. You have to break them up. Yet \nI have heard very little discussion--I know there was an amendment from \nSherrod Brown and Ted Kaufman, and I introduced legislation on this \nissue to start breaking them up. But, frankly, their lobbyists and \ntheir money are such that it becomes very difficult to do that. But \nthat is exactly what we should be doing.\n  The legislation I introduced last year, S. 2746, the Too Big to Fail, \nToo Big to Exist Act, would break up these large financial \ninstitutions. That legislation would require the Secretary of Treasury \nto identify every single financial institution and insurance company in \nthis country that is too big to fail within 90 days; and after 1 year, \nthe Secretary of the Treasury would be required to break up these \ninstitutions so their failure would not lead to the collapse of the \nU.S. or global economies.\n  I think that is pretty obvious. We passed a financial reform bill, \nwhich I supported and got a major provision in there asking for \ndisclosure at the Fed, an investigation of conflicts of interest at the \nFed, and an audit of the Fed during the financial crisis. But overall, \nI, by no means, think that legislation went anywhere near far enough. I \nthink that is a modest piece of legislation and an issue we have to \nrevisit.\n  I worry very much about the future because I have a feeling in my \nstomach that day is going to come around again, when these huge \nfinancial institutions are tottering, when they are going to go running \nto Washington, and they are going to say: Hey, you have to bail us out. \nIn my view, if an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to \nexist. Let us break them up so we do not have to go through another \nbailout of Wall Street.\n  Furthermore, I believe when you have that kind of concentration of \nownership--when you have four large financial institutions holding half \nthe mortgages in this country, controlling two-thirds of the credit \ncards, and amassing 40 percent of all deposits--this is not good for a \ncompetitive economy.\n\n  We are supposed to be living in free market capitalism, real \ncompetition. This is not free market competition. This is a huge \nconcentration of ownership, where a few people have enormous power over \nthe economy, and with their wealth, the political life of this country.\n  No single financial institution should be so large that its failure \nwould cause catastrophic risk to millions of American jobs or to our \nNation's economic well-being. No single financial institution should \nhave holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world's \neconomy into crisis. We were there 2 years ago, and in many ways, \ndespite the passage of the financial reform bill, we are even more \nthere now. The big, huge financial institutions we bailed out are \nbigger, more huge today.\n  Interestingly enough, on that issue, it is not just progressives such \nas myself who hold that view. There are some pretty conservative folks \nwho are honest conservatives. The concentration of ownership in a \nhandful of entities; is that a conservative proposition? Not in terms \nof my understanding of what conservatives are about. I do not think so.\n  You have at least three Federal Reserve Bank presidents who support \nbreaking up too-big-to-fail banks. James Bullard, president and chief \nexecutive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis; Kansas City Fed \npresident Thomas M. Hoenig; and Dallas Fed president Richard W. \nFisher--these guys do not have my political views. I am a proud \nprogressive. My guess is they are conservatives. But anybody with an \nounce of brains in their head understands that four large financial \ninstitutions that have assets that are more than half the GDP of the \nUnited States of America places us, A, in a very dangerous position in \nterms of too big to fail, and, B, it is just bad for a competitive \neconomy.\n  Is there any wonder why people are paying 25 percent or 30 percent \ninterest rates on their credit cards? That is because these guys issue \ntwo-thirds of the credit cards in America. Is there any reason why they \nwere issuing fraudulent mortgage packages to people? Because there is \nnot the kind of competition that should be there.\n  But this is not just Bernie Sanders' point of view. Here is what \nKansas City Fed President Hoenig said. I am sorry I do not have a date \non that, but I think it was fairly recently--last year. This is Kansas \nCity Fed President Hoenig:\n\n       I think they should be broken up. I think there's no reason \n     why as we've done in other instances of [sic] finding the \n     right mechanism to break them into their components. . . .\n       And in doing so, I think you'll make the financial system \n     itself more stable. I think you will make it more \n     competitive, and I think you will have long-run benefits over \n     our current system, [which] mixes it and therefore leads to \n     bailouts when crises occur.\n\n  This is Thomas Hoenig, the head of the Kansas City Fed. A very simple \nstatement. He is absolutely right. But--and I am going to get to the \nreason why in a little while--we have not been able to do this. We have \nnot been able to do this because Wall Street sends their lobbyists down \nhere in droves and Wall Street provides zillions of dollars in campaign \ncontributions and Wall Street fights like the dickens to make sure that \nany strong provisions that some of us might bring up are defeated. Here \nis what the President of the Dallas Fed, Mr. Fisher, said:\n\n       [B]ased on my experience at the Fed . . . the marginal \n     costs of too-big-to-fail financial institutions easily dwarf \n     their purported social and macroeconomic benefits.\n       The risk posed by coddling too big to fail banks is simply \n     too great.\n\n  Winston Churchill said that. He is quoting Mr. Churchill:\n\n       In finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and \n     everything that is sound is disagreeable.\n\n  That is from Churchill.\n  Mr. Fisher continues:\n\n       I think the disagreeable but sound thing to do regarding \n     institutions that are too big to fail is to dismantle them \n     over time into institutions that can be prudently managed and \n     regulated across borders. This should be done before the next \n     financial crisis because we now know it surely cannot be done \n     in the middle of a crisis.\n\n  That is Dallas Fed president Mr. Fisher.\n  They are already in the process of breaking up big banks in England. \nAccording to the Washington Post:\n\n       The British government announced Tuesday--\n\n  Not this Tuesday, way back last year--\n\n     that it will break up parts of major financial institutions \n     bailed out by taxpayers. The British government, spurred on \n     by European regulators, is forcing the Royal Bank of \n     Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, and Northern Rock to sell off \n     parts of their operations. Europeans are calling for more and \n     smaller banks to increase competition and to eliminate banks \n     so large that they must be rescued by taxpayers, no matter \n     how they conducted their business, in order to avoid damaging \n     the global financial system.\n\n  A very interesting development occurred on October 15 of last year. \nOn October 15--as I mentioned earlier, Alan Greenspan, who was the \nchairman of the Fed before Mr. Bernanke, and I have had our run-ins. \nMr. Greenspan, along with Mr. Rubin and others, were the chief \nproponents--Larry Summers in there--were the chief proponents of \nderegulation of financial institutions, and Mr. Greenspan and I had \nmore than a few arguments. But on October 15 of last year, Alan \nGreenspan, who admitted his views on deregulation were wrong--and I \ngive the man courage for at least admitting he was wrong. He did a \nheck-of-a-lot of damage, but at least he had the courage to admit he \nwas wrong. He was quoted in Bloomberg News as saying:\n\n       If they are too big to fail, they are too big. In 1911, we \n     broke up Standard Oil. So what happened? The individual parts \n     became more valuable than the whole.\n\n  Maybe that's what we need to do.\n  Alan Greenspan, the architect of deregulation, citing the fact that \nin 1911 we broke up Standard Oil. So here we have Greenspan, who helped \ncause this crisis, at least having the courage to understand that now \nis the time to begin breaking up these big financial institutions. They \nhave enormous power over our economy. They have enormous power over our \npolitical life. Their lobbyists are all over this place. You can't walk \ndown the hall without bumping into some of their lobbyists. So we have \nto start breaking them up\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\nand the American people have to be prepared for a major fight to take \non these huge financial institutions.\n  Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who has advised the Obama \nadministration, supports breaking up big banks so they no longer pose \nsystemic risk to the entire economy.\n  According to a recent article in the New York Times, Volcker said:\n\n       People say I'm old-fashioned and banks can no longer be \n     separated from nonbank activity. That argument brought us to \n     where we are today.\n\n  Paul Volcker. I couldn't agree more. That is what I am talking about. \nWe have to start breaking up four financial institutions which led us \ninto the economic disaster we are in right now that remain much too big \nto fail, that we are going to have to bail out again and again and \nagain, and that today have a stranglehold on our economy.\n  The New York Times says under Volcker's plan:\n\n       JPMorganChase would have to give up their trading \n     operations acquired from Bear Stearns. Bank of America and \n     Merrill Lynch would go back to being separate companies. \n     Goldman Sachs could no longer be a bank holding company.\n\n  That is exactly what needs to be happening.\n  I come from a small State. We have community banks. Here is the \nirony: The banks in Vermont, in the midst of all of this financial \ndisaster, did just fine. They are small, locally owned banks. They know \nthe people they lend money to. The CEOs are not making hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in profit. They know their community. They know \nwhat loans made sense. Now, I may be old-fashioned like Mr. Volcker, \nbut I think that is what banking is about: to lend out money to people \nin the productive economy, to the business community, who can use the \nmoney to expand and create jobs; to homeowners who need that money to \nbuy a home, not to be living in your own world engaged in a huge \ngambling casino producing and selling worthless products nobody \nunderstands.\n  The function of a bank is to be a middleman between people who need \nmoney and are producing real products and helping them get that money \nand people who are investing in the banks. It is not supposed to be an \nisland to itself. But in recent years what we have seen, incredibly, is \nthat 40 percent of all profit in America went to the financial \ninstitutions with a small number of people working there, relatively \nsmall. They got 40 percent of the profits because they live in a world \nthat is a huge gambling casino.\n  We need financial institutions to go back to the way banking used to \nbe, where the job of banks was to provide affordable loans to the \nproductive economy so we can produce real products, real goods, and we \ncan create real jobs when we do that.\n  Robert Reich, President Clinton's former Labor Secretary, said:\n\n       No important public interest is served by allowing giant \n     banks to grow too big to fail. Wall Street banks should be \n     split up, and soon.\n\n  We have a lot of people, some conservatives, some progressives, who \nare saying the same thing. If we are going to rebuild the middle class, \nthe way to do that is, among other things, to change our disastrous \ntrade policies, to make it clear to corporate America that they cannot \ncontinue to sell out the workers of this country by moving to China and \nother low-wage countries. We also have to have a much more competitive \neconomy, one in which all large financial institutions do not own \nassets of more than half of the GDP of this country.\n  On that point, I find it very interesting that it is not just \nprogressives such as myself or Robert Reich, but we have some \nconservative bankers--people who are heading Fed banks around this \ncountry--who are saying pretty much the same thing.\n  Also, when we talk about banks, I wish to get back to a point I \nraised earlier. This is an issue I have been working on for years and \nyears, and this is the issue of usury. I mentioned earlier, if you read \nthe religious tenents of the major religions throughout history, \nwhether it is Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and others, what you find \nis almost universal objection and disgust and a feeling of immorality \nin terms of usury. When we talked about usury in the United States, \nwhat we usually talked about were thugs, gangsters working on street \ncorners who lent out money at outrageously high interest rates to \nworkers, and when that money was not repaid back at the interest rates \nasked for, the thugs would beat up the workers.\n  In fact, I am thinking now about the first movie of Rocky. I don't \nknow if the Presiding Officer saw the first movie of Rocky with \nSylvester Stallone, but before he became a successful fighter and the \nheavyweight champion of the world, that is what he was: a big tough guy \nwho beat up people who did not pay back the gangsters the high interest \nrates they were asking for.\n  Well, the world has changed. Now the people who are committing usury \nare not the gangsters on street corners all over America. Their place \nhas been taken by the CEOs of Wall Street financial institutions who \nare lending out money to desperate Americans at 25 or 30 percent \ninterest rates. That, my friends, is called usury, and according to \nevery religion on Earth, that is immoral. What you are doing is going \nup to people who are desperate, people who are hurting, and you are \nsaying: You desperately need money, we are going to give you money, but \nthere is a string attached. You are going to be charged an outrageous \namount of interest on that money.\n  So here is the irony: The people who are hurting the most pay the \nhighest interest rates. The people who need the money the least are \npaying the lowest interest rates.\n  So the Fed lent out billions and billions of dollars to the largest \nfinancial institutions and offered it at less than 1 percent. That is \nAmerican taxpayer money--large corporations, less than 1 percent.\n  But if you are a worker today and you are having hard times--maybe \nyou are unemployed--you are going to pay 25 or 30 percent interest \nrates on your credit card, and sometimes more. You have this Payday \nLending where people are paying outrageous sums of money. I think that \nis immoral. I think we have to stop it, and it disturbs me very much \nthat especially at a time when we bailed out these large financial \ninstitutions they are still able to charge our people 25 or 30 percent. \nPeople who have bailed them out get hit the second time around by \nhaving to pay 25 to 30 percent interest rates.\n  Right now, it is not even 25 or 30 percent. As a matter of fact, the \ntenth largest credit card issuer in this country, an entity called \nPremier Bank, is now offering a credit card with a 79.9-percent \ninterest rate and a $300 credit limit. What do we make of that? The \ntenth largest credit card issuer in this country is charging 79 percent \ninterest rates, and we allow that to go on. These are crooks. These are \nno different than the gangsters who beat up people on street corners \nwhen they didn't get payment back, except now the gangsters are wearing \nthree-piece suits and sitting in some fancy suite on Wall Street.\n  Today, over one-quarter of all credit card holders in this country \nare now paying interest rates above 20 percent and, as I indicated, as \nhigh as 79 percent. Let's be clear. When credit card companies charge \nover 20 percent interest on credit cards, they are not engaged in the \nbusiness of making credit available. What they are involved in is \nextortion and loan sharking--nothing essentially different than \ngangsters, except they dress a lot better. That is all it is. It is \nthievery and we tolerate it, and we bail them out.\n  It is interesting in terms of these high interest rates because for \nmany years we have had States, including the State of Vermont, saying: \nYou are not going to charge outrageously high interest rates. For \nexample, establishing a usury law is not a radical concept, which is \nwhat we have to move toward. We have to put a cap on interest rates. In \nfact, between 1978 and today, over 20 States in America had laws \ncapping credit card interest rates.\n  In Alabama, the legal maximum amount of interest is 8 percent; in \nAlaska, it is 10.5 percent; in Arizona, it is 10 percent; in Idaho, 12 \npercent; Kansas, 15 percent; the State of Vermont, my own State, the \nlegal maximum interest rate is 12 percent. But what happened is all of \nthose State interest rate caps disappeared under the 1978 U.S. Supreme \nCourt decision known as the Marquette case, which allowed banks to \ncharge whatever interest rates they\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\nwanted if they moved to a State without an interest rate law such as \nSouth Dakota or Delaware.\n  So all of these companies moved to South Dakota. They moved to \nDelaware. No interest rates. And they charged the people in Vermont or \nHawaii or anyplace else 35 percent interest rates.\n  So getting back to the original agreement--which I strongly disagree \nwith--that the President and the Republican leadership agreed to, I \nthink that agreement significantly helps the upper income people by \nlowering the tax rates for millionaires and billionaires, by lowering \nthe interest rate on the estate tax, and by providing some business \nloans which are not the kinds of investments that can best create jobs.\n  (The PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the chair.)\n  One of the things we have to do to protect the middle class today is \nhave a cap on interest rates because otherwise people are getting a \npaycheck and then going into debt and paying 25, 30 percent on their \ninterest rates, with the money going to a handful of banks on Wall \nStreet.\n  I have introduced legislation to put a cap on interest rates, and it \nis not a radical idea. Right now, credit unions in this country, by \nlaw, are not allowed to charge more than 15 percent, except under \nextraordinary circumstances. By and large, that has worked for about 30 \nyears. So if you get a credit card through a credit union, you are \ngoing to be paying in almost every case no more than 15 percent. That \nwas developed by Federal law.\n  Do you know what. I have talked to the credit union people in Vermont \nand all over the country. Credit unions are doing just fine. They are \nnot the ones that came begging the American taxpayer for a huge \nbailout. So for 30 years they have survived just fine on a 15-percent \ncap. But our friends on Wall Street who caused this recession, our \nfriends on Wall Street who needed a welfare check from the American \npeople in order to survive, who today are earning more money than they \ndid before the bailout--we don't have any cap on the interest rates \nthey can charge.\n  In my view, if the credit unions have survived and survived well with \na 15-percent maximum interest rate cap--the most they can charge--and \nit worked for credit unions, it can work for the private banks as well. \nThat is what we have to do.\n  According to a recent article--this is a year ago--in the Los Angeles \nTimes:\n\n       Chris Collver, legislative and regulatory analyst for the \n     California Credit Union League, said that a rate cap hasn't \n     hurt business for nearly 400 credit unions represented by his \n     organization. ``It hasn't been an issue,'' he said. ``Credit \n     unions are still able to thrive.''\n\n  Here is my point. The middle class is hurting. Unemployment is \noutrageously high, poverty is increasing, there are 50 million people \nwith no health insurance, there is a gap between the rich and everybody \nelse, manufacturing is collapsing, and jobs are going all over the \nworld--China, Mexico, India. We have to start protecting the middle \nclass of this country.\n  There are a number of things we have to do. I think one simple thing \nwe have to do is tell the crooks on Wall Street--and I use that word \nadvisedly--history will prove that they knew what they were doing. They \nwere dishonest. The business model is fraudulent. There are honest \npeople who occasionally make a mistake, but there are other businesses \nthat are based on fraud and assume they are never going to get caught. \nWhen they do get caught, the penalty they have to pay is so little that \nit is worth it because they end up getting caught 1 out of 10 times, \nbut they make a whole lot of money, and then they pay a fine and \nsomebody goes to jail--very rarely, though--for a year. That is what \nyou are seeing on Wall Street.\n  I think if it has worked very well for the credit unions, it can work \nfor the private banks as well.\n  Mr. President, in the financial reform bill, did we address this \nissue? Yes, we did, and no, we didn't. We said the credit card \ncompanies have to be clearer and more honest about their interest rates \nand how much borrowing money will actually cost because before they \nwould say: You will get a zero interest rate or a 2-percent interest \nrate, but most people didn't read the small print on page 4 that said \nthey could raise interest rates at any time.\n  We have made some progress on at least them being honest with the \nAmerican people about what their credit card costs will be, but that is \nnot enough. What we have to do is put a cap on interest rates. It has \nworked for the credit unions. I believe it can and should work for the \nbig banks as well.\n  Mr. President, what I want to do now is just give you some examples \nabout--you know, sometimes here--and I am guilty of it as well--we talk \nin big numbers--a billion here and a trillion there--and it adds up. \nBut I think it is also important to look at the flesh and blood that is \nout there, the real suffering people are experiencing.\n  A while back, what I did was I sent an e-mail out to people in \nVermont. It was a very simple e-mail. It said: Tell me in your own \nwords what is going on in your family. What is going on in your lives, \nin the midst of this terrible recession?\n  Again, it is important. Yes, we know unemployment is 9.8 percent and \nthe real unemployment is 16 percent, 50 million people don't have any \nhealth insurance, median family income has gone down, poverty has gone \nup, and 25 percent of our kids are on food stamps. It is important to \nknow that stuff. But behind all of those statistics is flesh and blood \nand good people who are doing everything they can to survive with a \nshred of dignity in their lives.\n  I did this last year. I sent that e-mail out to my constituents in \nVermont, and I said: Write back to me. Tell me in your own words what \nis going on in your lives. I cannot remember how many we received, but \nthere were hundreds and hundreds of responses. It quite amazed me. \nFrankly, it was hard to read these letters from decent, good people \nabout what was happening in their lives.\n  What I said to them was this: If it is OK with you, we will publish \nwhat you have written. We won't use your names, of course. I don't want \nto embarrass anybody. We will read some of these stories on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  That is what I did. I didn't read them all, but I read some of them \nbecause it is important for us sitting here inside the beltway not to \nforget what is going on in the real world, whether it is Hawaii, \nVermont, California, or anyplace.\n  Here are letters from two mothers in Vermont. First is from a woman \nin a rural area. The second is from a single mother in a small city. In \nVermont, frankly, we don't have too many big cities. In my very \nbeautiful State, where I expect the weather is very cold today, our \nlargest city is all of 40,000 people. That is Burlington, VT, and I was \nhonored to have been the mayor of that city for 8 years. Certainly, the \nvast majority of our people live in towns of less than 1,000, and there \nare towns of 500. For a while, I lived in a town called Stanton, up in \nthe Northeast Kingdom of Vermont, which has probably 150 people in it, \nand that is not uncommon in Vermont. There are a lot of small towns.\n  Here are the two letters.\n  A woman in the rural area says:\n\n       My husband and I have lived in Vermont our whole lives. We \n     have two small children, a baby and a toddler, and have felt \n     fortunate to own our own house and land. But due to the \n     increasing fuel prices, we have at times had to choose \n     between baby food and diapers and heating fuel.\n\n  In Vermont, heating fuel gets up there when the weather gets 20 below \nzero. It is an expensive proposition.\n  Continuing:\n\n       We have run out of heating fuel three times so far, and the \n     baby has ended up in the hospital with pneumonia two of the \n     times. We tried to keep the kids warm with an electric space \n     heater on those nights, but that just doesn't do the trick. \n     My husband does what he can just to scrape enough money for \n     car fuel each week, and we have gone from three vehicles to \n     one just to try to get by without going further into debt. We \n     were going to sell the house and rent, but the rent around \n     here is higher than what we pay for our mortgage and property \n     taxes combined. Please help.\n\n  That is what she asked of me and her government--``Please help.'' She \ndidn't ask me to lower taxes for billionaires. She is speaking for tens \nof millions of people in this country who are in desperate need of \nhelp.\n  Here is another letter that came from a woman who lives in a larger \ntown:\n\n       I am a single mother with a 9-year-old boy. We lived this \n     past winter without any heat at all.\n\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\n\n  That is not a good position to be in in Vermont in the winter.\n\n       Fortunately, someone gave me an old wood stove. I had to \n     hook it up to an old unused chimney we had in the kitchen. I \n     couldn't even afford a chimney liner. The price of liners \n     went up with the price of fuel. To stay warm at night, my son \n     and I would pull off all the pillows from the couch and pile \n     them on the kitchen floor. I would hang a blanket from the \n     kitchen doorway, and we would sleep right there on the \n     floor. By February, we ran out of wood, and I burned my \n     mother's dining room furniture. I have no oil for hot \n     water. We boil our water on the stove and pour it into the \n     tub. I would like to order one of your flags and hang it \n     upside down at the Capitol building. We are certainly a \n     country in distress.\n\n  Mr. President, what I will without doubt assure you is that those \nstories, in different forms--and I know it is different in big cities \nthan in a rural State such as Vermont, and I know it is different in \nHawaii, where the Chair comes from, than in Boston, MA. But I am \nabsolutely sure that millions of people in one way or another are \ntelling the same story. These are great Americans, people who want to \nwork and do the best they can by their kids. They are simply not making \nit right now.\n  This is the United States of America, in 2010, and people are going \ncold. People don't have enough food. People are homeless. My friends \nhere are talking about huge tax breaks for billionaires. My friends \nhere are talking about lowering rates on the estate tax for the top \nthree-tenths of 1 percent of the American people. What are we talking \nabout? What kinds of priorities are those?\n  Here is another letter from Vermont. This is not a woman in \ndesperation. Those folks I just read from are. This woman says:\n\n       As a couple with one child, earning about $55,000 a year \n     [which is, in Vermont, fairly decent] we have been able to \n     eat out a bit, buy groceries and health insurance, contribute \n     to our retirement funds, and live a relatively comfortable \n     life financially. We have never accumulated a lot of savings, \n     but our bills were always paid on time, and we never had any \n     interest on our credit card. Over the last year, even though \n     we have tightened our belts, not eating out much, watching \n     purchases at the grocery store, not buying extras like a new \n     TV, and repairing the washer instead of buying a new one--\n     doing all those things, we find ourselves with over $7,000 of \n     credit card debt and are trying to figure out how to pay for \n     braces for our son. I work 50 hours per week to help earn \n     extra money to catch up. But that also takes a toll on the \n     family life. Not spending those 10 hours at home with my \n     husband and son makes a big difference for all of us. My \n     husband hasn't had a raise in 3 years and his employer is \n     looking to cut out any extra benefits they can to lower their \n     expenses, which will increase ours.\n\n  How many millions of Americans do you think are saying exactly the \nsame thing?\n  Let me read another story that comes from Vermont.\n\n       My 90-year-old father in Connecticut has recently become \n     ill and asked me to visit him. I want to drop everything I am \n     doing and go visit him. However, I am finding it hard to save \n     enough money to add to the extra gas I will need to get \n     there. I am self-employed with my own commercial cleaning \n     service and money is tight, not only with gas prices but with \n     everything. I make more than I did a year ago, and I don't \n     have enough to pay my property taxes this quarter for the \n     first time in many years. They are due tomorrow.\n\n  Here is another letter that I think deserves to be read. Mr. \nPresident, I think it would not hurt this body if every Member of the \nSenate--I know we all get letters like this--came down here and spent a \ncouple of days talking about what is going on with working families in \nthis country. Spouting statistics is good, and dealing with tax deals \nof $900 billion is fine, but I think we should reacquaint ourselves \nwith the reality of life in America today.\n  This is what another constituent of mine writes:\n\n       My husband and I are retired and 65 years of age. We would \n     have liked to work longer, but because of injuries caused at \n     work and the closing of our factory to go to Canada, we chose \n     to retire early. Now, with oil prices the way they are, we \n     cannot afford to heat our home unless my husband cuts and \n     splits wood, which is a real hardship as he has had his back \n     fused and should not be working most of the day to keep up \n     with the wood. Not only that, he has to get up two or three \n     times each night to keep the fire going.\n\n  In other words, what she is talking about, is that in Vermont a lot \nof people heat with wood--increasingly with pellets, an important \nsource of fuel in the State of Vermont. What she is talking about is \nher husband, who is 65, with a bad back, has to go out and cut wood, \nand in their case, his being old, he has to get up two or three times a \nnight to stoke the furnace that is keeping the house warm. Again, I \nwould remind people that in Vermont it occasionally gets 20 or 30 below \nzero.\n  She continues:\n\n       We also have a 2003 car that we only get to drive to get \n     groceries or go to the doctor or to visit my mother in the \n     nursing home three miles away. It now costs us $80 a month to \n     go nowhere. We have 42,000 miles on a 5-year-old car.\n\n  They can't afford to even use the car. I don't know what the price of \ngas is in Hawaii, Mr. President, but in Vermont it is now over $3 a \ngallon. A lot of people in my State have to travel long distances to \nget to work. Their cars need repairs. Cars break down. Cars require, in \nVermont, compulsory insurance. They have to spend a whole lot of money \njust getting to work. I think we forget about that here. We don't need \ntax breaks for billionaires, we need to pay attention to these people.\n  She continues and concludes:\n\n       I have Medicare, but I can't afford prescription coverage \n     unless I take my money out of an annuity, which is supposed \n     to cover the house payment when my husband's pension is gone. \n     We only eat two meals a day to conserve.\n\n  This is not some Third World country. This is the United States of \nVermont--the United States of America, my State of Vermont, and Vermont \nis better off today than a number of States around this country. You \nhave these stories, and multiply them by 10 in every area of this \ncountry.\n  Here is another story:\n\n       Yesterday, I paid for our latest home heating fuel \n     delivery--\n\n  Again, I am focusing now on the cost of fuel because in Vermont, \nwhere I come from, it is a big deal. So she writes:\n\n       Yesterday, I paid for our latest home fuel heating \n     delivery--$1,100. I also paid my $2,000-plus credit card \n     balance, much of which bought gas and groceries for the \n     month.\n\n  The point here, and then I will continue her letter, is that a lot of \npeople use their credit cards not just as a nice and convenient way of \nnot having to use cash--when I go shopping, I am going to use my credit \ncard and I will pay it off at the end of the month. What a nice thing. \nNo, people are using their credit cards to buy food, to buy gas, and to \nbuy the basic necessities of life. It is their only line of credit \nopen. And then, as I mentioned earlier, they are charged 25 or 30 \npercent interest rates on what they owe.\n  She continues:\n\n       My husband and I are very nervous about what will happen to \n     us when we are old. Although we have three jobs between us \n     and participate in 403(b) retirement plans, we have not saved \n     enough for a realistic post worklife if we survive to our \n     life expectancy. As we approach the traditional retirement \n     age, we are slowly paying off our daughter's college tuition \n     loan and trying to keep our heads above water. We have always \n     lived frugally. We buy used cars and store brand groceries, \n     recycle everything, walk or car pool, when possible, and \n     plastic our windows each fall.\n\n  What that means is that, in Vermont, if you don't have good storm \nwindows, you put up plastic. It is a way to keep the wind out and keep \nthe home warm. I know about that because I used to do that.\n\n       Even so, if and when our son decides to attend college, we \n     will be in deep debt at age 65. Please--\n\n  And here she ends this.\n\n       P.S. Please don't use my name. I live in a small town, and \n     this is so embarrassing.\n\n  So embarrassing. We should be embarrassed, not her. We should be \nembarrassed that we are for one second talking about a proposal which \ngives tax breaks to billionaires while we are ignoring the needs of \nworking families, low-income people, and the middle class. We should be \nembarrassed that we are not investing in our infrastructure, that we \nare not breaking up these large financial institutions, that we are not \nputting a cap on interest rates, that we are the only country in the \nworld that does not have health care for all of our people--of major \ncountries. We should be embarrassed, not this wonderful woman who is \ntrying to maintain her dignity.\n  Another letter from the State of Vermont.\n\n       I too have been struggling to overcome the increasing cost \n     of gas, heating oil, food,\n\n[[Page S8773]]\n\n     taxes, et cetera. I have to say that this is the toughest \n     year financially that I have ever experienced in my 41 years \n     on this Earth. I have what used to be considered a decent \n     job. I work hard, pinch my pennies, but the pennies have all \n     but dried up. I am thankful that my employer understands that \n     many of us cannot afford to drive to work 5 days a week. \n     Instead, I work 3 15-hour days. I have taken odd jobs to try \n     to make ends meet. This winter, after keeping the heat just \n     high enough to keep my pipes from bursting--\n\n  One of the problems you have, when you live in a rural State and it \ngets cold, your pipes can burst, and then you have to spend a fortune \ngetting them repaired.\n  She continues:\n\n       The bedrooms are not heated and never go above 30 degrees.\n\n  What happens in Vermont, if you have a home, in the wintertime, and \nyou don't have a whole lot of money, you kind of close off rooms in the \nhouse because you can't afford to heat the whole house. So people live \nin a smaller area.\n  She continues:\n\n       I began selling off my woodworking tools, snow blower, \n     pennies on the dollar, and furniture that had been handed \n     down in my family from the early 1800s just to keep the heat \n     on. Today, I am sad, broken and very discouraged. I am \n     thankful the winter cold is behind us for a while but now gas \n     prices are arising yet again. I just can't keep up.\n\n  That is the story from one person in Vermont. But that is the story \nfor millions and millions of Americans.\n  Another story. And the reason I am reading these stories--and I \nappreciate my staff bringing this booklet down here--is this puts flesh \nand blood and real life into the statistics. The statistics are \nfrightening enough, but this tells us what happens when the middle \nclass of this country collapses. It tells us what happens when people \nlose decent-paying jobs. It tells us what happens when the government \ndoes not provide the kind of basic support system that it should for \npeople in need.\n  Here is another letter:\n\n       As a single parent, I am struggling every day to put food \n     on the table.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the United States of America and people are \ntalking, in my State of Vermont and all over the country, about \nstruggling to put food on the table. What comes to my mind now--and I \ndon't know if you saw them, Mr. President--are some articles in the \npaper that talked about because of the bailing out of Wall Street, and \nthe fact that Wall Street is now again profitable, these executives \nthere are now making more money than they made before the bailout, and \nthey go into restaurants and they pay thousands of dollars for a bottle \nof wine, pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for some fancy dinner. \nYet in my State and all over this country there are people who are \nwondering where their next meal is coming from.\n  She continues:\n\n       Our clothing all comes from thrift stores. I have a 5-year-\n     old car that needs work. My son is gifted and talented. I \n     tried to sell my house to enroll him in a school that had \n     curriculum available for his special needs. After 2 years on \n     the market, my house never sold. The property taxes have \n     nearly doubled in 10 years.\n\n  Let me pick up on that point. We don't deal with property taxes \nhere--I did when I was a mayor--but if we are not adequately funding \neducation, if we do not adequately help cities and towns all over this \ncountry in terms of fire protection and in terms of police protection \nand housing, a lot of that burden falls on the very regressive property \ntax, which in my State of Vermont is very high. And you find it \nreferred to time and time again that property taxes are going up. \nProperty taxes are going up.\n  She writes:\n\n       Property taxes have nearly doubled in 10 years. And the oil \n     to heat is prohibitive. To meet the needs of my son, I have \n     left the house sit and moved into an apartment near his high \n     school. I don't go to church many Sundays because the \n     gasoline is too expensive to drive there.\n\n  Imagine: She doesn't go to church on Sundays because the gasoline is \ntoo expensive to drive there.\n\n       Every thought of an activity is dependent upon the cost. I \n     can only purchase food from dented can stores.\n\n  Does anybody in this Congress know what a dented can store is? Do you \nknow that many people buy their groceries and they get them cheaper \nbecause the cans are dented? Most Members of the Senate and the House, \nmost Governors do not get their meals from dented cans, but huge \nnumbers of Americans do.\n  She then concludes:\n\n       I am stretched to the breaking point with no help in sight.\n\n  By the way, the letters that I received, when I asked for letters, \ncame not just from the State of Vermont--most came from Vermont but \nsome came from other areas. I will read another from Vermont and then \none from rural Pennsylvania.\n  This one from Vermont:\n\n       Due to illness, my ability to work has been severely \n     limited. I am making $10 an hour, and if I am lucky, I get 35 \n     hours a week of work.\n\n  Let me pull away from the letter. That is not an unusual wage in the \nState of Vermont. That is not an unusual wage all over America. That is \nwhat people earn, $10 an hour, times 40 hours. He doesn't get 40 hours. \nHe makes $350 a week. Ten times 40, 400, times 50, $21,000 a year. \nShock of all shocks, that is reality. That is what people are trying to \nlive on. Those are the people that we should be helping, not the CEOs \non Wall Street who will get $1 million a year in a tax break if this \ndeal goes through. Not the people who are in the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent, who our Republican friends want to help by repealing the \nestate tax, which will cost us $1 trillion in 10 years. Maybe we should \nconcentrate on helping people who are trying to get by eating food from \ndented cans or people who can't afford to drive to church on Sunday \nbecause they can't afford the price of a gallon of gas. Maybe we should \nremember who sent us here and who made this country.\n  She writes:\n\n       I am making $10 an hour, and if I am lucky I get 35 hours a \n     week of work. At this time, I am only getting 20 hours, as it \n     is off season in Stowe.\n\n  Stowe, VT, is a beautiful town. I hope everybody comes to visit us up \nthere. There is great skiing, but it is a resort town. Big time in the \nwinter. We are doing better in the summer, but it is a resort town. \nResorts get more business in the winter than summer and less time \nelsewhere.\n  So what she is talking about is that it is off season up there and \nshe is only getting 20 hours a week of work at $10 an hour.\n  She writes:\n\n       It does not take a mathematician to do the figures.\n\n  I am sorry, this is a man, not a woman.\n\n       How are my wife and I supposed to live on a monthly take-\n     home income of less than $800 a month? We do it by spending \n     our hard-earned retirement savings. I am 50 and my wife is \n     49. At the rate we are going, we will be destitute in just a \n     few years. The situation is so dire it is all that I can \n     think about. Soon I will have to start walking to work--an 8-\n     mile round trip--because the price of energy is so high that \n     it is either that or going without heat.\n\n  This is a 50-year-old guy, making $10 an hour, 20 or 30 hours a week, \nand his choice is either walking 8 miles to and from his job in Stowe \nor else not heating his home. And this happens in Vermont all of the \ntime. It is quite unbelievable. He says:\n\n       As bad as our situation is, I know many in worse shape. We \n     try to donate food when we do our weekly shopping, but now we \n     are not able to even afford to help our neighbors eat. What \n     has this country come to?\n\n  I don't know about other parts of the country. I am sure it is the \nsame. But if you go to a grocery store, there is often a bin out there \nin front where people buy food and they drop a can of peas or a can of \ncorn or something into it. Here is a guy who is now faced with the \nreality of having to walk 8 miles to and from work and he is upset at \nhimself that he does not have the money to buy food for his neighbors \nwho he thinks are even worse off than he is. That is the good people of \nVermont and America. They are all over this country, good and decent \npeople who do worry about their neighbors.\n  Then you have the lobbyists here representing the largest \ncorporations in the world where the CEOs make tens of millions of \ndollars a year and their job is to squeeze the middle class and these \nfamilies harder and harder, cut back on their benefits in order to give \ntax breaks to the richest people in this country. What a difference in \nattitude: A poor man faced with the choice of either walking 8 miles to \nand from his job or losing his heat, worried about his neighbors, and \nyou have the lobbyists here worrying about the richest\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\npeople in the world--and winning. And winning.\n  Then I got a letter that comes not from Vermont, it comes from rural \nPennsylvania:\n\n       I am 55 years old and worse off than my adult children. I \n     have worked since age 16. I don't live from paycheck to \n     paycheck, I live day to day. I can only afford to fill my gas \n     tank on my payday. Thereafter I put $5, $10, whatever that I \n     can. I cannot afford to buy the food items that I would. I am \n     riding around daily, to and from work, with a quarter of a \n     tank of gas. This is very scary. I can see myself working \n     until the day that I die.\n\n  Trust me, the gentleman is talking about getting older, worrying \nabout working until the day he dies. We are already seeing this. You go \nto grocery stores in Vermont and you see old people, who should be \nsitting home with their grandchildren. Do you know what they are doing? \nThey are packing groceries. Then we have some geniuses on this deficit \nreduction commission, people who made their money on Wall Street, they \nhave a brilliant idea: Let's raise the Social Security age to 68, 69 \nyears old so that people like this will have to work, in fact, to the \nday they die.\n  He continues. This is not from Vermont. This is from Pennsylvania:\n\n       I do not have savings, no credit cards and my only \n     resources are through my employment. I have to drive to work \n     as there are no buses from my residence to work. I don't know \n     how much longer I can do this. I am concerned as gas prices \n     climb daily. I am just tired. The harder that I work the \n     harder it gets. I work 12 to 14 hours daily and it just \n     doesn't help.\n\n  I am not saying every person in America is experiencing these \nstories. They are not. A lot of people are doing fine. They have good \njobs. Their kids are doing well. They are taking care of their parents. \nA lot of people are doing just fine. But we would be fools and \ndishonest not to understand the reality of what is going on in this \ncountry. It breaks my heart, and I know it breaks the hearts of \nmillions of people in this country, to see what is going on in this \ngreat Nation of ours: that so many people are hurting, that so many \nparents--I don't know if I have that letter or if it is in another \nbooklet. I will never forget one letter I received, and that is these \npeople--my parents never went to college. My father never graduated \nhigh school. They wanted their kids to get an education; that is what \nthey wanted--and we did. It was very important, and how proud my mother \nwas of that.\n  We get letters from people who say: You know, I dreamed that my kid, \nmy daughter, would go to college, and she is not going to go to college \nnow. She is not going to go to college.\n  It is just painful to even talk about and think about, the direction \nin which this country is moving. So I want to now take a break from \nreading these letters. Actually, the truth is, when these letters came \nin a year ago I could not read more than a half dozen at a time. They \ntook too much out of me. They take something out of you to hear people \nyou know, good people, honest people--I hear from some of my colleagues \nhere that people are lazy. My God, people work so hard in the State of \nVermont. We have I don't know how many thousands of people are not \nworking just two or three jobs, they work four jobs. It is all over \nthis country. Whatever you say about the United States of America, the \npeople of our country are not lazy. That is one thing you can say about \nthem.\n  In fact, according to all of the bloodless statistics, our people \ntoday work longer hours than do the people of any other major country \non Earth. Did you know that? I don't know that a lot of Americans know \nthat. It used to be Japan. The Japanese are a very hard-working people. \nNow it turns out that our people work harder, longer hours than do the \npeople of any other country in the industrialized world.\n  When you think about that, when I think about the books that I read \nwhen I was in elementary school--I remember there were pictures up \nthere. I don't know if you remember these pictures. There were pictures \nwhere workers were demonstrating, and they said: We want a 40-hour \nworkweek. Do you remember seeing those pictures? We want a 40-hour \nworkweek. That was back in the early 1900s.\n  Today, 100 years later, people still want a 40-hour workweek because \nthey are forced to work 50 or 60 hours a week. They are working two \njobs. They are working three jobs.\n  What I want to do now, before I get back to why I am on the Senate \nfloor today, and why I have been here for a few hours--which is to say \nthe agreement negotiated by the President and the Republican leadership \nis not a good agreement. It is an agreement that we can improve upon. \nIt is an agreement the American people can improve upon. But what I am \nasking the American people to do is to stand up, let your Senators, let \nyour Congressman know how you feel.\n  Do you really believe millionaires and billionaires who have done \nphenomenally well in recent years need an extended tax cut at a time \nwhen their taxes have been lowered substantially in recent years? Do we \nreally need to give tax breaks to the rich in order to drive up the \nnational debt so our kids and grandchildren will pay higher taxes in \norder to pay off that national debt caused by tax breaks for the rich?\n  If you do not believe that, if you do not think that is right, let \nthe President of the United States know about it. Let your Senator know \nabout it. Let your Congressman know about it. We need a handful, seven \nor eight Members of the Senate to hear from their people, to say: Wait \na minute. Don't hold my kids hostage. Don't force them to pay higher \ntaxes in order to give tax breaks to the very rich.\n  If the American people stand up and by the millions let their \nSenators and Congressmen and the President know, we can win this thing. \nWe can win this battle. It is not too late yet. That is what I hope \nwill happen.\n  When we talk about why things go on the way they are here in \nWashington, and why so many people back home--whether they are \nDemocrats, Republicans, Independent--whether they are conservatives, \nprogressives, moderates, whatever they are--there is a huge feeling of \nanger and frustration and, in fact, disgust at what goes on here in \nWashington.\n  I have just read some letters from people. You can multiply those \nletters by 1 million. People are saying: Don't you hear us? Don't you \nknow what is going on in our lives? Don't you know the worries we have \nfor our kids, for our parents? Aren't you listening to us?\n  In many ways I am afraid the Senate is not listening to them, nor is \nthe House, nor is our Government. What worries me so much about this \ngrowing concentration of wealth and income in this country is that when \nthe rich get richer, they don't just simply put their money under the \nmattress. They don't simply go out and buy yachts and planes and 18 \nhomes and all the things rich people do. They do that, but they do \nsomething else.\n  They say: I am not rich enough. I need to be richer. What motivates \nsome of these people is greed and greed and more greed. There is no end \nto it. So what they do is they do things like hire lobbyists--who are \nall over Capitol Hill. These lobbyists, sometimes former leaders of the \nRepublican Party, former leaders of the Democratic Party, former \nhotshot lawyers, bright people, their job is to make sure the \nlegislation we pass--such as this major tax bill--that this legislation \nbenefits not ordinary Americans, not the people whose letters I have \njust read, not those people, but the wealthiest people in this country \nand the largest corporations.\n  I want to just mention something. A very good friend of mine and I do \na radio show every Friday afternoon--I am afraid I missed it today--Tom \nHartman. Tom is the author of a number of wonderful books.\n  In his latest book, which is called ``Rebooting the American Dream, \n11 Ways to Rebuild Our Country,'' Tom writes and he talks about \nlobbying, which is an issue we have to deal with in this country. He \nsays, on page 104:\n\n       Given how lucrative lobbying is as an investment, it has \n     become a huge business.\n\n  In other words, what he is talking about is, if you have a good \nlobbyist and the lobbyist changes a few words in a bill, your company \nor you as an individual can end up with huge amounts of money just by \nchanging a few words. In this case, language that we are working on now \nis whether we extend the Bush tax breaks for the top 2 percent, for \nmany millionaires and billionaires. Some lobbyists, representing the \nrich and the powerful, are determined to keep that language in there.\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\n  So it is an investment. So you spend a few million dollars, an \norganization spends a few million dollars on a lobbyist, but if you end \nup getting back hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and \ncorporate loopholes or other benefits, it is a very good investment. \nThat is what Tom Hartman is writing. He says:\n\n       Given how lucrative lobbying is as an investment it has \n     become a huge business. In February, 2010, the Center for \n     Responsive Politics laid out which industries had invested \n     how much in Congress the previous year. Overall, it found \n     that in 2009 the number of registered lobbyists who actively \n     lobby Congress was 13,694 and the total lobbying spending--\n\n  Get this. Total lobbying spending in 2009 was $3.47 billion, a 240-\npercent increase since 1999, 10 years, more than tripling it, I guess. \nIn 2009 companies spent $3.47 billion in lobbying. We have 100 Members \nof the Senate, 435 Members of the House. Listeners or viewers can get \nout their calculating machine and divide it up, how much money the big \nmoney interests are spending trying to influence Senator Inouye or \nmyself or the other 98 Members of the Senate or 435 Members of the \nHouse. They are flooding this institution with money.\n  Let me give you just a breakdown of where that money is coming from. \nWhat they call miscellaneous business, that is retail and \nmanufacturing, et cetera, $558 million in one year, 2009; health care, \n$543 million.\n  By the way, that was before health care reform. My strong guess--I \nwill be very surprised if that number did not double. If you were a \nhealth care lobbyist this year, trust me, you are doing very well. They \nwere all over this place, making sure we did not pass a strong health \ncare bill, for example, in Medicare for all, a single-payer program, \nwhich I support. On top of that, you have the finance, insurance and \nreal estate industries combined that spent $465 million.\n  And, again, that was before we dealt with financial reform. I suppose \nthe recent legislation we dealt with, health care reform and financial \nreform, was a real boon to the lobbyists around here, because they can \ngo out and earn their money. But that was before this. Finance, \ninsurance, real estate, only spent $465 million in 1 year to influence \n100 Members of the Senate and 435 Members of the House.\n  Energy and natural resources. Well, as I mentioned earlier today, \nExxonMobil last year made $19 billion, paid nothing in taxes, got a \n$156 million refund. ExxonMobil and other companies are putting all \nkinds of money into phony organizations telling us that global warming \nis not real, we do not have to transform our energy system; costs a lot \nof money to do that. The energy and natural resources companies spent \n$408 million in 2009 alone. This is 1 year, folks, 1 year.\n  Communications, electronics. Right now I am working on an issue which \ndeals with the merger of Comcast and NBC. I think it is a bad idea. \nComcast is the largest provider of cable services in America, huge role \nin the Internet, and NBC is one of the largest media conglomerates in \nAmerica. What they are trying to do right now is to merge, these two \nhuge companies.\n  I think the problem in America is we have too few companies \ncontrolling what goes on. We have too much of a concentration of \nownership, and that merger is bad. Well, I can assure you for a fact, \nthey have all of these lobbyists in the media industry, from \ncommunications, right here rallying, trying to do their best to make \nsure this merger and other type mergers take place--$360 million from \nthe communication and electronics industry.\n  Then we have other types of organizations as well. Bottom line, in \nthe year 2009, they spent $3.47 billion, almost 3\\1/2\\ billion, on \nlobbying. And you know what, you get what you pay for.\n  That is just lobbying. We are not talking about campaign \ncontributions. We are not talking about the huge sums of money it now \ntakes to run for office in the United States, and we are not talking \nabout where that money comes from. We are not talking about the \nCitizens United horrendous decision reached by the Supreme Court which \nallows billionaires and all of these companies and their executives to \nput money into campaigns and not even have to be identified. We are not \neven talking about that. This is just lobbying.\n  So if you wonder why we are having a serious discussion about whether \nwe should give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while the \nmiddle class is collapsing, and tens of millions of people have no \nhealth insurance, and we have the highest rate of children in poverty, \nand we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any \ncountry, if you wonder how we would consider for 1 minute talking about \nmore tax breaks for the rich, then you do not know much about what goes \non here in Washington and you do not know about campaign contributions \nand the degree to which big money buys and sells politicians.\n  I want to review again--the reason I am down here today, and I have \nbeen here for a few hours--and voice my very strong opposition to the \nagreement that was reached between the Republican leadership and \nPresident Obama. I think the American people do not like this \nagreement. All I can tell you--I do not know what is going on in your \noffice, coming from Alaska, Mr. President, but I can tell you in the \nlast 3 days, between phone calls and e-mails, I probably have gotten \n5,000. We have heard from about 5,000 people, many from Vermont, some \nfrom out of State as well.\n  The opposition to this agreement is probably 99 percent. People \ncannot understand why in a million years, with a $13.7 trillion \nnational debt, and a $1.4 trillion yearly deficit, we would be thinking \nfor one second, for one second, about giving tax breaks to the richest \npeople in this country who are already doing fabulously well.\n  I am down here today, and have been for a few hours, to urge my \ncolleagues and, more importantly, the American people, to say no to \nthis agreement. If we stand together, if the American people write or \ne-mail or call their Senators and their Congress people, I think we can \nturn this thing around. I think we can come up with an agreement that \nmakes us all proud, rather than one that we have to be ashamed for.\n  I know there was an editorial back in the State of Vermont which I \nsaw. I do not remember the exact title, but something to the effect of: \nThis agreement stinks, it is odious, but it is better than nothing. \nWell, I do not think that has to be the choice, awful or better than \nnothing. I think the choice can actually be a good agreement. And I \nthink if the American people stand with those of us who are opposing \nthis agreement, we can pull this off. We can defeat this agreement and \ncome up with a much better one, one that does not cause our kids and \ngrandchildren to pay higher taxes in order to provide huge tax breaks \nfor the richest people in this country.\n  In talking about the reasons I am opposed to this agreement, one of \nthe other reasons is that while the President and the Republican \nleadership say, well, you know, this is just a temporary extension, it \nis going to be for 2 years, just temporary, you know and I know that \nwhen you talk about temporary here, it becomes long term and then \nperhaps becomes permanent.\n  If we extend these tax breaks for the top 2 percent now, my strong \nguess--I hope I am wrong. I certainly hope this proposal is defeated, \nbut if we extend them for 2 years, my strong guess is they will be, 2 \nyears from now, extended again. And depending upon the politics of what \ngoes on here, they can be extended permanently.\n  Our Republican colleagues, as you well know, wanted to extend them \nfor 10 years at a cost of $700 billion. An increase in our national \ndebt. Our Republican friends are fighting hard to completely repeal the \nestate tax, which would cost us $1 trillion, $1 trillion in 10 years in \nincreased national debt.\n  So the point I have got to make--I want to emphasize this point, that \nwhen people talk about these things being short term, being temporary, \ntake those thoughts with a grain of salt. Maybe that is the case. I do \nnot think it is. I think once you move over the cliff and make that \ndecision to extend these tax breaks, they are going to be extended long \nterm. Here is the reason why. Right now the dynamic here is the \nPresident campaigned against these tax breaks. The President does not \nbelieve in extending these tax breaks for the rich. But he felt he had \nto make the compromise. I thought he made a bad compromise.\n  But our Republican friends are saying over and over that if you \nrescind, end these tax breaks to the rich, you\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\nare raising taxes 2 years from now in the midst of a Presidential \ncampaign, when President Obama, if he is the Democratic candidate, \nsays: Do not worry, I am going to oppose these extensions of tax breaks \nfor the rich, his credibility has been severely damaged, and the \nAmerican people know it. Can they trust him? That is what he told them \nthen. That is what he will tell them in 2 years. Is he going to be \nbelieved? I do not think so. So these tax breaks, while ostensibly for \n2 years may, in fact, be for a lot longer than that.\n  I would also say that while we have talked about--primarily the \ndiscussion has centered around extending the tax breaks, personal \nincome tax breaks to the very rich, there are other tax breaks in this \nproposal which are equally odious.\n  What this agreement between the President and the Republican \nleadership does is it extends the Bush era 15-percent tax rates on \ncapital gains and dividends, meaning that those people who make their \nliving off of their investments will continue to pay a substantially \nlower tax rate than firemen, teachers, and nurses.\n  Think about that. You are a big-time investor. You make most of your \nincome off of capital gains or dividends, and you are paying a 15-\npercent tax rate. But if you are a worker doing something with your \nhands or you are a teacher or a fireman or you are a cop or nurse, a \ndoctor, you are paying tax rates that are higher than that. We are \nextending those 15-percent tax rates on capital gains and dividends.\n  Then, on top of that, this agreement includes a horrendous proposal \nregarding the estate tax. The estate tax was enacted in 1916, and it \nwas a proposal strongly supported by Teddy Roosevelt, who believed very \nstrongly that it was not healthy for America to have an ongoing and \nevolving concentration of ownership. Here is what Teddy Roosevelt said \nin 1910:\n\n       The absence of effective State, and, especially, national, \n     restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a \n     small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful \n     men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power. \n     The prime need is to change the conditions which enable these \n     men to accumulate power which is not for the general welfare \n     that they should hold or exercise . . . No man should receive \n     a dollar unless that dollar has been fairly earned. Every \n     dollar received should represent a dollar's worth of service \n     rendered--not gambling in stocks, but service rendered. The \n     really big fortune, the swollen fortune, by the mere fact of \n     its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in kind as \n     well as in degree from what is passed by men of relatively \n     small means. Therefore, I believe in a graduated income tax \n     on big fortunes, and in another tax which is far more easily \n     collected and far more effective--a graduated inheritance tax \n     on big fortunes, properly safeguarded against evasion and \n     increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate.\n\n  How is that? One hundred years ago. That is what he said. I would say \nhe got it right when he said that. It is even more true today, hence \nthe estate tax.\n  Unfortunately, under the agreement reached by the President and the \nRepublicans, the estate tax rate, which was 55 percent under President \nClinton when the economy, by the way, was a heck of a lot stronger than \nit is today, will decline to 35 percent with an exemption on the first \n$5 million of an individual's estate and $10 million for a couple.\n  I made this point earlier, but I think it has got to be made over and \nover. Our Republican friends have renamed the estate tax the death tax. \nThe implication of what they are saying, and what many Americans \nbelieve, is that if I have $100,000 in the bank or $50,000 in the bank \nand I die, my kids are going to have to pay a heavy estate tax on what \nI left them. But that is absolutely and categorically not the case. The \nestate tax applies only to the top three-tenths of 1 percent. This is \nnot a tax on the rich. This is a tax on the very, very, very rich. And \nunder this proposal, which benefits only the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent, the President and the Republicans agreed to lower the tax rate \non the estate tax to 35 percent, with an exemption on the first $5 \nmillion.\n  That is wrong. Let me give you an example of who the folks are who \nwill benefit from doing this. Many of my Republican colleagues have \nbeen pushing very hard, not just to lower the tax rate--by the way, \nthis 35 percent is lower, I think, than they ever dreamed they would \nget, with a $5 million exemption, but what they wanted ultimately, and \nI suspect will continue to fight for, is the complete repeal of the \nestate tax.\n  To give one example--and I don't mean to pick on the Walton family, \nbut just as a flesh-and-blood example--Sam Walton's family, the heirs \nto the Walmart fortune, are worth, give or take, $86 billion. That is a \nlot of money. The Walton family would receive an estimated $32.7 \nbillion tax break if the estate tax was completely repealed. Does \nanybody in their right mind believe that when this country has a \nnational debt of $13.7 trillion and when we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty in the industrialized world and our unemployment rate \nis 9.8 percent, can anybody for one second fathom Members of the Senate \nsaying they want to give a $32 billion tax break to one family?\n  In terms of the estate tax, what we have done is made it even more \nregressive. We have given substantial help to exactly the people who \nneed it the least. That is not what we should be doing. Our job--and I \nknow it is a radical idea--should be to represent the vast majority of \nthe people, the middle class, the working families, and not just the \ntop 1 or 2 percent. This proposal, this lowering of the estate tax, \nwhich will cost our government substantial sums of money because the \nrevenue is not going to come in, will benefit only the top three-tenths \nof 1 percent.\n  Again, if some of my Republican colleagues are successful in their \ndesire--and they are moving down the path--if we repeal the estate tax \nentirely, which is what they want to do--it is hard to believe, and \nsome of the listeners out there think I am kidding, but I am deadly \nserious--it will drive up the national debt by $1 trillion over a 10-\nyear period. Lowering the estate tax rate and raising the exemption is \nclearly an onerous provision.\n  It is not only the Walton family of Walmart who will benefit. \nAccording to Forbes magazine, there are 403 billionaires living in this \ncountry with a combined net worth of $1.3 trillion. That is not shabby. \nThat is pretty good. Anyone lucky enough to inherit this extraordinary \nwealth would benefit the most from repealing the estate tax.\n  As Robert Frank wrote in his book ``Richistan'':\n\n       The wealthiest people in this country accumulated so much \n     wealth that they have been competing to see who could own the \n     largest private yacht, who could own the most private jets, \n     who could own the most expensive cars, jewelry, artwork, et \n     cetera. In 1997, for example, Leslie Wexner, chairman of \n     Limited Brands, the company that owns Victoria's Secret--\n\n  And none of us know what Victoria's Secret is--\n\n     paid a German shipmaker to build what was then the largest \n     private yacht in the United States. It is called The \n     Limitless.\n\n  There is a photo. It is a nice boat. It stretches 315 feet and has \n3,000 square feet of teakwood and a gym.\n  According to Forbes magazine, Mr. Wexner is one of the wealthiest 400 \npeople in this country, worth an estimated $2.3 billion. Permanently \nrepealing the estate tax would allow Mr. Wexner's two children to \ninherit all of his wealth without paying a nickel to help this country \ndeal with the enormous problems we have.\n  I wish Mr. Wexner--I don't know him; I hope he is alive and well--a \nlong life. But I believe strongly that in this country, if we are going \nto see the middle class survive and our kids do well, we cannot repeal \nthe estate tax and we cannot lower estate tax rates.\n  I wish to address another issue which I talked about earlier. I think \nthere is some misunderstanding. The Presiding Officer raised this issue \nat a recent meeting we had. All over the country, people say: Isn't it \ngreat that we are going to lower the payroll tax on workers? We are \ngoing to go from 6.2 percent, which workers now pay, down to 4.2 \npercent. People are going to have more money in their pocket, which \ncertainly is a good thing. It is going to cost $120 billion in Social \nSecurity payroll taxes.\n  Here is the point. Yes, we do want to put more money in workers' \npockets. That is why many of us in the stimulus package supported a \n$400-a-year tax break for virtually every worker in America. That is \nwhat we said. We\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\nwant people in these difficult times to have the money to take care of \ntheir families. When they have that money, they go out and spend it. \nWhen they spend it, it creates other jobs because people have to \nprovide goods and services for them. It has a good, stimulative impact. \nWe do want workers to have more money in their pockets.\n  While this idea of lowering the payroll tax sounds like a good idea, \nin truth, it really is not a good idea. This idea originated from very \nconservative Republicans whose intention from the beginning was to \ndestroy Social Security by choking off the funds that go to it. This is \nnot just Bernie Sanders' analysis. There was recently--I distributed it \nrecently at a meeting we held--a news release that came from the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The \nheadline on that press release is ``Cutting Contributions to Social \nSecurity Signals the Beginning of the End. Payroll Tax Holiday is \nAnything But.'' What the National Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare, which is one of the largest senior groups in America, \nwell understands is that there are people out there who want to destroy \nSocial Security. And one way to do that is to divert funds into the \nSocial Security trust fund and they don't get there.\n  What the President and others have said is not to worry, this is just \na 1-year program--just 1 year. In fact, they say, the General Treasury \nwill pay the difference. So the Social Security trust fund is not going \nto lose funding.\n  The reason we have a $2.6 trillion surplus today in Social Security \nand the reason Social Security is good for the next 29 years to pay out \nall benefits is because it comes from the payroll tax. It is not \ndependent upon the whims of the Congress and the Treasury.\n  The President and Republicans said: This is just a 1-year program. \nDon't worry.\n  I do worry. I worry that once we establish this 1-year payroll tax \nholiday, next year our Republican friends will say: Do you want to end \nthat? You are going to be raising taxes on workers. And enough people \nwill support that concept, and this 1-year payroll tax holiday will \nbecome permanent. And when we do that, we will be choking off, over a \nperiod of years, trillions of dollars that we need to make sure Social \nSecurity is viable and is there for our children and grandchildren.\n  But don't listen to me. Listen to somebody who knows a lot more about \nthis issue than I do. Barbara Kennelly is a former Congresswoman from \nConnecticut. She is the president and CEO of the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare. This is what Barbara Kennelly \nsays:\n\n       Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the \n     current economic crisis, it has been bartered in a deal that \n     provides deficit busting tax cuts for the wealthy. Diverting \n     $120 billion in Social Security contributions for a so-called \n     tax holiday may sound like a good deal for workers now, but \n     it is bad business for a program that a majority of middle \n     class seniors will rely upon in the future.\n\n  The headline is ``Cutting Contributions to Social Security Signals \nthe Beginning of the End.''\n  This is not a good approach. Providing and figuring out a way that we \ncan get more money into the hands of working people, as we did in the \nstimulus package, does make a lot of sense. Going forward with a \npayroll tax holiday is a backdoor method to end up breaking Social \nSecurity. It is not anything we should support.\n  Let me mention a quote from a gentleman who understands this issue \nvery well. He understands the politics of what is going on here. His \nname Bruce Bartlett, former adviser for Presidents Reagan and George \nH.W. Bush. He recently wrote the following in opposition to this \npayroll tax cut. This is what Mr. Bartlett wrote:\n\n       What are the odds that Republicans will ever allow this \n     one-year tax holiday to expire? They wrote the Bush tax cuts \n     with explicit expiration dates and then when it came time for \n     the law they wrote to take effect exactly as they wrote it, \n     they said any failure to extend them permanently would \n     constitute the biggest tax increase in history. . . . if \n     allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire is the biggest tax \n     increase in history, one that Republicans claim would \n     decimate a still-fragile economy, then surely expiration of a \n     payroll tax holiday would also constitute a massive tax \n     increase on the working people of America. Republicans would \n     prefer to destroy Social Security's finances or permanently \n     fund it with general revenues--\n\n  Switch the revenue base from the payroll tax to general revenues--\n\n     than allow a once-suspended payroll tax to be reimposed. Arch \n     Social Security hater Peter Ferrara once told me that funding \n     it with general revenues was part of his plan to destroy it \n     by converting Social Security into a welfare program, rather \n     than an earned benefit. He was right.\n\n  In other words, what this issue is about is breaking the bonds we \nhave had since the inception of Social Security where Social Security \nwas paid for by workers. You pay for it when you are working, and you \nget the benefits when you are old. That is the deal. There is no \nFederal money coming in from the General Treasury.\n  This gentleman, Mr. Bartlett, former adviser to Presidents Reagan and \nGeorge H.W. Bush, thinks--and I suspect he is quite right--this is the \nbeginning of an effort to destroy Social Security.\n  The real debate about Social Security is not one about finances.\n  There has been a lot of misinformation and disinformation out there. \nI hear from some of my friends on the Republican side that Social \nSecurity is going bankrupt; it is not going to be there for our kids. \nThat is absolutely not true. Social Security today has a $2.6 trillion \nsurplus. Social Security can pay out every benefit owed to every \neligible American, if we do not start diverting funds, for the next 29 \nyears, at which point it pays out about 78 percent of benefits. So our \nchallenge in 29 years is to fill that 22-percent gap. That it is. Can \nwe do it? Sure we can.\n  President Obama, when he was campaigning, and I think he has repeated \nsince, the very good suggestion that instead of having a cap in terms \nof which people contribute into the fund at $106,000, what we should do \nis do a bubble, and people who make $250,000 or more should contribute \ninto the Social Security trust fund. If you did that and nothing else, \nyou have essentially solved the Social Security problem for the next 75 \nyears. Very easy. It is done.\n  So what this payroll tax holiday is doing, in my view, is pretty \ndangerous. I do not think enough people understand that. I think that \nis one of the strong reasons this agreement should be opposed.\n  Another reason I believe this agreement is not as good an agreement \nas we can get is that it provides tens and tens of billions of dollars \nin tax cuts for various types of businesses. I am not here to say these \ntax cuts cannot do some good. I suspect they can. But I think there is \na lot better way to create the jobs we need than providing these \nparticular business tax cuts.\n  Frankly, I think economists from almost all political spectrums--\nconservative to progressive--understand that if we are serious about \ncreating the kinds of jobs this economy desperately needs and if we \nwant to do that as rapidly and as cost-effectively as we possibly can, \nthe way to do that is not to provide business tax cuts because right \nnow--right now--corporate America is sitting on close to $2 trillion \ncash on hand. They have a ton of money. The problem is the products \nthey are creating are not being bought by the American people because \nthe American people do not have the money to buy those goods and \nservices.\n  So if we are serious about creating the jobs we need, I think what we \nhave to do is start making significant investments in our crumbling \ninfrastructure; that is, rebuilding our bridges, our roads, our water \nsystems, broadband, cell phone service, public transportation, our rail \nsystem, dams. In every single one of these areas, we are seeing our \ninfrastructure crumbling.\n  The point is, if you simply ignore a crumbling infrastructure--and I \nsay this as a former mayor who dealt with this issue--if you simply \nignore a crumbling infrastructure, do you know what, it does not get \nbetter all by itself.\n  I know many mayors and Governors would very much like to think they \ncould turn their backs on the infrastructure because it is not a sexy \ninvestment. It is not a sexy investment. But the reality is, if you do \nnot pay attention to it today, it only gets worse and it costs you more \nmoney. It is like having a cavity. You can get your cavity filled. If \nyou neglect it, as I have,\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\nand you end up doing a root canal, it is far more painful, far more \nexpensive. That is what it is about. Do we maintain our infrastructure? \nClearly, we have not. According to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, we should be spending about $2.2 trillion in the next 5 \nyears in order to maintain our infrastructure.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I do not know about Alaska--I spent a \nvery brief time in the Presiding Officer's beautiful State--but I do \nknow in Vermont we have bridges all over our State that are in \ndesperate need of repair. It is fair to say that the stimulus package \nhas been very positive for my State. We are spending more money on \nroads and bridges. But we have a long way to go. So we are putting \nmoney into our roads and bridges. We are hiring people to do that work. \nThat is what we should be doing all over the country.\n  But it is not just roads and bridges. It is water systems. I told \nthis story, I guess a few hours ago now, about a mayor, the mayor of \nRutland, VT, which is the second largest city in the State. I was in \nhis office and he showed me a pipe, and the pipe was in pretty bad \nshape. He said: You know, this pipe was laid by an engineer who then, \nafter he did this, went off to war. And he said: What war do you think \nhe went off to fight? And he said it was the Civil War--the Civil War. \nSo this was pipe laid in Rutland, VT, which is still being used, which \nwas laid, I am guessing, in the 1850s, maybe 1860s. And it is not just \nRutland, VT.\n  When I was mayor of Burlington, we had to spend $50 million, back \nthen, 20 years ago, I think, rebuilding our wastewater plants and \nmaking sure that a lot of pollution and filthy water did not get into \nour beautiful lake, Lake Champlain. It was an expensive proposition. \nBut right now, we are going to have to invest in that. It is our water \nsystems, our dams, our levees, our roads, our bridges.\n  I mentioned earlier and contrasted what was going on in \ninfrastructure in the United States as opposed to China, and I quoted \nfrom a book called ``Third World America,'' written by Arianna \nHuffington, who tells us, essentially, if we do not get our act \ntogether, that is what we will become--a third world country.\n  She points out that compared to countries such as China, our \ninvestments in rail are absolutely pathetic and inadequate. In China, \nright now, that country is investing billions and billions of dollars \nin high-speed rail, building thousands and thousands of miles of high-\nspeed rail. They are building over 100 new airports. And what are we \ndoing?\n  So one of my many objections to the proposal struck between the \nPresident and the Republican leadership is I think we can do better in \njob creation than in business tax cuts. There is a time and a place for \nbusiness tax cuts, and I am not against them. But I would say that at \nthis particular moment in American history, at this particular moment, \nit makes a lot more sense to create, over a period of years, millions \nof jobs rebuilding our rail system, our subways, our roads, our \nbridges, and our water systems, and many other aspects of our \ninfrastructure.\n  There are places in Vermont and throughout this country where people \ncannot today get decent-quality broadband service, cannot get cell \nphone service. In that area, we are behind many other countries, not \nwealthy countries around the world. When we make those investments in \ninfrastructure, we not only create jobs, but we make our country \nstronger and more productive, and we enable ourselves to compete \neffectively in the international economy.\n  Another one of my objections to this proposal and why I think we can \ndo a lot better is that I was really quite disturbed to hear the \nPresident and others, who defend this proposal, talk about that one of \nthe ``compromises'' that was struck was to extend unemployment benefits \nfor 13 months.\n  To my mind, as I have said earlier, at a time of deep recession, at a \ntime of terribly high unemployment, it would be absolutely wrong and \nimmoral for us to turn our backs on the millions of workers who are \nabout to lose their unemployment benefits. If we do that, it is hard to \nimagine what happens to those families, for many of whom this is their \nonly source of income. What do they do? Do they lose their homes? Do \nthey move out onto the streets? How do they take care of their kids? I \ndo not know. There are parts of this country where it is very hard to \nget a job. Extended unemployment is at the highest level I think we \nhave ever seen. You cannot turn your backs on those families.\n  But I get upset when I hear that the Republican's willingness to \nsupport an extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months is a major \ncompromise. I will tell you--I think a lot of the American people do \nnot know this--that for the past 40 years--40 years, four decades--\nunder both Democratic and Republican administrations, whenever the \nunemployment rate has been above 7.2 percent--and today we are at 9.8 \npercent unemployment--always, whether the Democrats were in control, \nthe Republicans were in control, the President was Democrat, the \nPresident was Republican, what people did was say: We have to extend \nunemployment benefits. It is kind of common sense. It is not partisan. \nSo when you have a program that has existed for 40 years in a \nbipartisan effort, it sounds to me that it is not much of a compromise \nfor the Republicans to say: OK, we will do what Democrats and \nRepublicans have done for 40 years. What a major compromise. It is not \na compromise. It is just continuing existing bipartisan policy, which \nis sensible. It is sensible from a moral perspective. You cannot leave \nfellow American families out high and dry.\n\n  It is good economics because what the economists tell us is the \npeople who will spend that money quickest are people who receive \nunemployment compensation because that is all they have. They are going \nto go out and buy, and when they buy from the neighborhood store, they \ncreate jobs. So it is good economics, and it is the moral thing to do.\n  But, frankly, in my view, this is not much of a compromise. This is \njust continuing four decades of existing policies.\n  As I said earlier, there are very clearly positive parts of this \nagreement, no question about it. I think almost every American will \ntell you that it would be totally absurd--I know there are some who \ndisagree, but I think the vast majority of Americans believe that in a \ntime when the middle class is collapsing, when median family income has \ngone down, when unemployment is high, that it would be a real horror \nshow if we did not extend the Bush tax breaks for the middle class, for \n98 percent of the American people--98 percent. That is what we want.\n  We could have crafted it much tighter, couldn't we have? We could \nhave said: Nobody above $100,000, nobody above $150,000. That is pretty \ngenerous. We said a family earning up to $250,000 should get an \nextension of these tax breaks. That is 98 percent of the American \npeople, and that is not good enough for our Republican friends. They \nare fighting tooth and nail to make sure the top 2 percent--the \nmillionaires and billionaires, the CEOs who earn tens of millions a \nyear--they are fighting--it is as if they are at war. They are so \nengaged to make sure these fabulously wealthy people receive at least \n$1 million, in some cases. For people who are making $1 million a year, \nthey are going to receive, on average, $100,000 a year in tax breaks. \nFor the very, very wealthiest, it could be over $1 million a year.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I know you joined me just 2 days ago \nin saying that at a time when senior citizens in this country and \ndisabled vets, for 2 years in a row, had not received any COLA, that \nmaybe it was the right thing to do--because we know that health care \ncosts and prescription drug costs are soaring--that maybe we should \nprovide a $250 check for those seniors and disabled veterans one time--\none time. I could not get one Republican vote in support of that \nproposition. We won 53 to 45, but around here it does not take 50 votes \nto win; it does not take a majority to win; it takes 60 votes. We could \nnot get one Republican vote. So here you have every Republican voting \nagainst a $250 check for a disabled vet or a senior citizen who is \nliving on $15,000, $16,000 a year. Cannot afford it. But we can afford \na million-dollar-a-year tax break for somebody who is worth hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. Now, somebody may understand that rationale. I \ndon't. I really\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\ndon't. I can't understand it. I can't understand asking our kids and \ngrandchildren to pay more in taxes, and the national debt goes up in \norder to provide tax breaks for the richest people in this country.\n\n  So while there are some good provisions in this bill--certainly \nextending the tax breaks for 98 percent of our people, for the very \nbroad middle class; I think if the American people demand it, in our \ndemocracy we can do better. I don't know if the Presiding Officer or I \nalone will be able to convince some of our Republican friends or maybe \nsome of our Democratic friends to make this into the kind of proposal \nwe need for the working families of this country, and for our children, \nfor our next generation. I don't know if we can do it inside this \nbeltway.\n  As I said earlier, I think the way we win this battle, the way we \ndefeat this proposal and come back with a much better proposal is when \nmillions of Americans start writing and e-mailing and calling their \nSenators, their Congress people, and say: Wait a second. Are you nuts? \nDo you really think millionaires and billionaires need a huge tax break \nat a time when this country has a $13.7 trillion national debt? What \nare you smoking? How could you for one second think that makes any \nsense whatsoever?\n  I will tell the Presiding Officer something. I don't know what my \nphones are doing today in my office right now. But in the last 3 days \nwe have gotten, I am guessing, 5,000 phone calls and e-mails, and about \n99 percent of them are in disagreement with this proposal.\n  I am looking at a chart. We have gotten 2,100 calls that just came in \ntoday. I don't know what kind of calls other Members of the Senate are \ngetting, but certainly those are the calls I am getting.\n  This point cannot be made strongly enough: What our Republican \nfriends want to do--and they have been pretty honest and up front about \nit, especially some of the extreme, rightwing people who have been \nrunning for office and, in some cases, have won--they have been honest \nenough to say they want to bring this country back to where we were in \nthe 1920s. Their ultimate aim is the basic repeal of almost all of the \nprovisions that have been passed in the last 70 years to protect \nworking people, the elderly, and children. They believe in a Darwinian-\nstyle society in which you have the survival of the fittest; that we \nare not a society which comes together to take care of all of us. You \ntake care of me in need and I take care of you and your family; that we \nare one people. Their strategy is pretty clear. They want to ultimately \ndestroy Social Security.\n  What we are beginning to hear more and more of is why don't we raise \nthe retirement age to 68 or 69. That deficit reduction commission, \nwhich I thought was--the people on that commission were bad appointees \nby the President. We could have put together some good economists to \nsay how do we in a fair way--in a fair way--address the deficit and \nnational debt crisis. That wasn't what that commission did. So these \nfolks are talking about major cuts in Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid.\n  At a time when it is so hard for young people to afford to go to \ncollege, they want to raise the costs by asking our young people while \nthey are in college to be accruing the interest on their loans.\n  So I think if the President believes that if this agreement is \npassed, the Republicans are going to come to the table and we are all \ngoing to live happily in the future, we are all going to work together \nin a nonpartisan way, I think he is not understanding the reality. \nThese people are going to come back and they are going to come back \nvery aggressively for major cuts in Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, environmental protection, education, childcare, Pell grants, \nyou name it, because their belief is--I don't quite understand it--that \nit is somehow good public policy to give tax breaks for the wealthiest \npeople in this country who, in many ways, have never had it so good, \nwhile you cut programs that the middle class and working families of \nthis country desperately depend upon.\n  So I would suggest that this big debate we are having right now on \nwhether we should accept the proposal agreed to by the President and \nthe Republicans is just the beginning of what is coming down the pike. \nIf we surrender now on this issue, we can expect next month and the \nfollowing month another governmental crisis, another threat of a \nshutdown, unless they get their way. So I think rather than asking the \nworking families of this country to have to compromise, instead of \nasking our kids to pay more in taxes to bail out billionaires, maybe--I \nknow this is a radical idea--but maybe we should ask a handful of our \nRepublican friends to join us. Maybe a handful of honest conservatives \nover there who have been telling us for years their great concerns \nabout deficit spending and a huge national debt, maybe they should be \nprepared to vote against the proposal which raises the national debt \nand our deficit by giving tax breaks to some of the richest people in \nthe world.\n  Quite frankly, I don't think I am going to be able to convince them. \nI don't know that the Presiding Officer is going to be able to convince \nthem. But I think their constituents can convince them. I think the \nAmerican people can convince them. I think, as I said earlier, if the \nAmerican people stand up, we can defeat this proposal and we can create \na much better proposal.\n  Clearly, we must extend tax breaks for the middle class. Clearly, we \nmust make sure unemployed workers continue to get the benefits they \ndesperately need. But equally, clearly, we must make sure we are not \nraising the national debt which, as sure as I am standing here, will \nresult in cuts in Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and \neducation and other programs if this proposal is passed.\n  So this is not only an important proposal unto itself: $900 billion \nplus even in Washington is nothing to sneeze at. But it is an important \nproposal in terms of the direction in which our country goes into the \nfuture. If we accept this proposal of a 2-year extension for the \nrichest people in America, I believe it will eventually become either a \nlong-term extension or a permanent extension. If we accept the proposal \nthat lowers the rates on the estate tax which benefits only the top \nthree-tenths of 1 percent--99.7 percent of Americans get nothing--but \nif we give them what they want, I believe over a period of years it \nwill lead to the complete abolishment and ending of the estate tax \nwhich will cost us over $1 trillion over a 10-year period.\n  So I hope this issue is not one just progressives or moderates feel \nstrongly about. I hope honest conservatives, who in their heart of \nhearts believe this country is seriously in danger when we have \nunsustainable deficits and a huge national debt, will tell their \nelected officials here in Washington not to pass a piece of legislation \nwhich increases the national debt significantly and, in fact, will \nallow for the permanent--over years, in my view--extension of these tax \nbreaks.\n  So that is what this debate is about. It is about fundamentally \nwhether we continue the process by which the richest people in this \ncountry become richer, at a time when we have the most unequal \ndistribution of income and wealth of any major country on Earth.\n  As I have said earlier, this is not an issue that is discussed--I \ndon't know--well, I do know why. It is just not an issue that people \nfeel comfortable talking about because they don't want to give affront \nto their wealthy campaign contributors or take on the lobbyists who are \nout there. But that is the reality. Throughout the entire world, the \nUnited States has the most unequal distribution of income. The top 1 \npercent is earning 23.5 percent of all income. That is more than the \nbottom 50 percent. That is not just immoral, it is bad economics \nbecause if the middle class gets crushed entirely, who is going to be \nbuying the goods and services produced in this economy?\n  So this piece of legislation, as important as it is unto itself--and \nit is very important--is equally important in terms of what it says \nabout where we are going into the future. Are we going to protect the \nmiddle class and working families of our country? Are we going to make \nsure every young person in America, regardless of income, has the \nability to go to college, or are we going to allow college to become \nunaffordable for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of bright, young \npeople, or else force them to leave school deeply in debt?\n\n  Are we going to create a health care system which guarantees health \ncare\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\nto all of our people--high-quality health care--or are we going to \ncontinue a situation where 45,000 Americans die each year because they \ndon't have access to a doctor? Are we going to invest in our energy \nsystem so we break our dependence on foreign oil? We spend about $350 \nbillion a year importing oil from Saudi Arabia and other foreign \ncountries--almost $1 billion a day--which should be used to make this \ncountry energy independent, which should be used to transform our \nenergy system away from fossil fuel into energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy, technologies such as wind, solar, geothermal, and \nbiomass.\n  By the way, none of that has been addressed, as I understand it, in \nthis proposal.\n  So my point is not just that this proposal is a bad proposal as it \nstands before us now, but it is going to move us in the future in a \ndirection that I do not believe this country should be going.\n  I mentioned earlier my own personal family's history is the history \nof millions and millions of Americans. My father, as it happened, came \nto this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket. He \nworked hard his whole life. He never made very much money, but he and \nmy mom--my mom graduated high school; she never went to college--had \nthe satisfaction, the very significant satisfaction, of knowing their \nkids got a college education. My older brother Larry went to law \nschool, and I graduated from the University of Chicago.\n  I think what is going on in this country and why the anxiety level is \nso high is not just that people are worried about themselves--parents \nworry more about their kids than they do about themselves. But what \nparents are sitting around and worrying about now is they are saying: \nWill, for the first time in the modern history of this country, my kids \nhave a lower standard of living than their parents?\n  Will my kids earn less income? Will my kids not have the education I \nhave? Will my kids not have the opportunity to travel and learn and \ngrow as I have done? Are the best days of America behind us? That is \nreally the question. I don't think that has to be the case.\n  But I will tell my colleagues, as I mentioned earlier, if we are \ngoing to change the national priorities in this country, if we are \ngoing to start devoting our energy and our attention to the needs of \nworking families and the middle class, we have to defeat this proposal \nand we have to defeat similar types of proposals which come down the \npike. When this country has a $13.7 trillion national debt, it is \ninsane--nothing less than insane--to be talking about huge tax breaks \nfor people who don't need them. Again, as I mentioned earlier, \nironically, we have a lot of these millionaires out there who \napparently love their country more than some of the people in this \nChamber.\n  You have some of the richest people in America--Bill Gates and all \nthe good, charitable work he does, and Warren Buffet and many others--\nwho are saying: I am doing just fine. I am a billionaire or a \nmultimillionaire. I don't need your tax breaks. I am worried about the \nfact that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty; invest in our \nchildren. I am worried that our infrastructure is crumbling; invest in \nour infrastructure. I am worried that 45,000 Americans are dying this \nyear who don't have access to health care; invest in health care. I am \nworried about global warming; invest in transforming our energy system. \nThese are patriotic Americans. They love their country. They are saying \nto us: We don't even want it.\n  So we are giving money to people who, in some cases, don't even want \nit. I do know there are others out there who do want it. I think if \nthere is one issue that we as a Congress and a government have to \naddress, it is the extraordinary level of greed in this country. We \nhave to stand tall and draw a line in the sand and simply say: Enough \nis enough. How much do you want? How much do you need? How many yachts \ncan you own? How many homes can you have? Isn't it enough that the top \n1 percent now earns 23.5 percent of the income in this country? How \nmuch more do they want? Do they want 30 percent, 35 percent? Isn't it \nenough that the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent? How much more do they need?\n  I mentioned earlier, when I talked about the situation that got us \ninto this horrendous recession--and that is the collapse of Wall \nStreet--I talked about what I think most Americans understand very \nwell; that is, the incredible greed and recklessness and dishonesty \nthat exists on Wall Street. We must not allow ourselves to encourage \nand continue the kind of greed we have seen in recent years. It is an \nabomination that the people who caused this economic crisis--the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression--that the people on Wall Street \nwho caused it are now earning more money than they did before we bailed \nthem out.\n  Earlier today, I was reading some e-mails that came to my office from \nVermonters who were struggling to keep their heads above water. They \nwere terribly painful and poignant stories about honest, good, decent \npeople who are now choosing whether they should put gas in their car or \nbuy the food or prescription drugs they need. It is not just a Vermont \nstory; it is an American story. It is a reality out there for tens of \nmillions of Americans.\n  In my view, we can negotiate a much better agreement than the one \nPresident Obama and the Republican leadership did. There are some good \nparts of that agreement, which obviously should be retained and perhaps \neven strengthened. Those include, of course, making sure we extend \nunemployment benefits to those who need it and, of course, that we \nextend tax breaks for the middle class. There are some very good other \nprovisions in there which I think are worthwhile.\n  I think if the American people stand and agree with those of us who \nsay no more tax breaks for the very wealthiest people in this country, \nwe can defeat this proposal, and we can come up with a much better one \nthat is fairer to the middle class of this country and is fairer to our \nyoung children.\n  I do not want to see our young kids--my children and grandchildren--\nhave a lower standard of living than their parents. That is not what \nAmerica is about. What I think we have to do is defeat this proposal. I \nthink we have to urge our fellow Americans to stand and say no to tax \nbreaks for those who don't need it. I think we have to work in a very \nserious way about creating the millions and millions of good-paying \njobs that this country desperately needs. I personally believe that is \na far more effective approach than giving the variety of business taxes \nthat were in this proposal at a time when corporate America is sitting \non $2 million of unused cash. They have the money. I think a much \nbetter approach, as I said earlier, is investing in our crumbling \ninfrastructure. I think that makes us healthier and stronger as a \nnation for the future and in the global economy.\n  I think it creates jobs quicker and in a more cost-effective way than \nthese tax cuts. I also think it is high time the American people move--\nthey want us to move in an entirely new direction in terms of trade. I \nam always amazed how Republicans and Democrats alike--and I speak as \nthe longest serving Independent in Congress--come election time, have \nads on television saying: Oh, we have to do something about outsourcing \nand about our trade policy. But somehow, the day after the election, \nwhen corporate America continues to throw American workers out on the \nstreet and moves to China, moves to other low-wage countries, that \ndiscussion ceases to exist and that legislation never seems to appear.\n  So it seems to me we have to defeat this proposal, and that in \ndefeating this, we are going to tell the American people there are at \nleast some of us here who understand what our jobs and obligations are; \nthat is, that we are supposed to represent them, the middle class of \nthe country, and not just wealthy campaign contributors or bow to the \ninterests of the lobbyists who are all over this place.\n  When I talked a moment ago about the need to invest in our \ninfrastructure as a way to create jobs, being more cost-effective than \nsome of these business tax breaks, I am looking now at a Wall Street \nJournal article of December 9, 2010. Here is the headline: ``Companies \nClinging to Cash; Coffers Swell to 51-year High as Cautious Firms Put \nOff Investing in Growth.''\n  That is a story by Justin Lahart. Here is the story. It makes the \npoint I have been trying to express:\n\n       Corporate America's cash pile has hit its highest level in \n     half a century. Rather than\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\n     pouring their money into building plants or hiring workers, \n     nonfinancial companies in the United States are sitting on \n     $1.93 trillion in cash--\n\n  I said $2 trillion, but it is $1.93 trillion in cash.\n\n     --and other liquid assets at the end of September, up from \n     $1.8 trillion at the end of June, the Federal Reserve said \n     Thursday. Cash accounted for 7.4 percent of the companies' \n     total assets, the largest share since 1959. The cash buildup \n     shows the deep caution many companies feel about investing in \n     expansion, while the economic recovery remains painfully \n     slow, and high unemployment and battered household finances \n     continue to limit consumers' ability to spend.\n\n  What have we been talking about? The Wall Street Journal is not my \nfavorite paper, but they are saying that the way you are going to get \nthe economy moving again is to put money in the hands of working \npeople, who will then go out and buy the goods and services these \ncompanies produce. I have my doubts about whether these tax rates will, \nin fact, have the desired result.\n  As I said earlier, and will say again, I think the most effective way \nto create jobs, and the most important way, is to rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure. That is our roads, bridges, rail system, water system, \nwastewater plants, our dams, levees, and the need to improve broadband \nto make sure every community in America has access to good-quality \nbroadband and access to cell phone service. Unfortunately, as best as I \ncan understand, there has not been one nickel appropriated in this \nproposed legislation that would go to infrastructure improvements.\n  I think this proposal should be defeated because it is not a strong \nproposal for the middle class. It is a proposal that gives much too \nmuch to people who don't need it, and it is a proposal that I think \nsets the stage for similar-type proposals down the pike. I apologize to \nanybody who has been listening for any length of time. I know I have \nbeen, to say the least, a bit repetitious.\n  But the concern is that when the President and some of my Republican \ncolleagues talk about some of these tax breaks being temporary, we are \njust going to extend them for 2 years, talking about this payroll tax \nholiday being just 1 year, I have been in Washington long enough to \nknow that assertion doesn't fly; that what is temporary today is long-\nterm tomorrow and is permanent the next day. I fear very much that this \nproposal is bad on the surface. I fear very much that this proposal \nwill lead us down a very bad track in terms of more trickle-down \neconomics, which benefits the tricklers and not the ordinary Americans. \nI think it is a proposal that should be defeated.\n  The point I wish to make is that is not just my point of view. I \nthink it should be defeated. I think we can do a lot better. I have to \ntell you the calls that are coming into my office are--here is what we \ngot today: 2,122 calls oppose the deal, and I think 100 calls are \nsupportive of the deal. You can do the arithmetic on it. At least 95 \npercent of the calls I got today are saying this is not a good deal. We \ncan do better.\n  I know that in the last 3 or 4 days we have gotten probably 6,000 or \n7,000 calls that say this. This is not just Vermont--many of those \ncalls come from out of State, by the way. But I think that is true all \nover this country.\n  Let me conclude. It has been a long day. Let me simply say I believe \nthe proposal that was developed by the President and the Republicans is \nnowhere near as good as we can achieve. I don't know that we are able \nourselves to get the handful of Republicans we need to say no to this \nagreement. I do believe that if the American people stand--by the way, \nit may not just be Republicans. There may be some Democrats as well. If \nthe American people stand and say: We can do better than this; we don't \nneed to drive up the national debt by giving tax breaks to millionaires \nand billionaires, that if the American people are prepared to stand and \nwe are prepared to follow them, I think we can defeat this proposal and \ncome up with a better proposal which reflects the needs of working-\nclass and middle-class families of our country and, to me, most \nimportantly, the children of our country.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8781-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RECOGNIZING WYMT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the employees \nand friends of WYMT-TV as they celebrate 25 years as a news station in \nHazard, KY. WYMT is much more than a media outlet; rather, it is a \nsuccess story. In 1985, when talk of starting WYMT first sparked, many \npeople were opposed to the idea, as it was thought that the station \nwould not be prosperous or competitive. However, thanks to a few who \nsaw what this news station could bring to eastern Kentucky, WYMT was \nborn.\n  My good friend Neil Middleton is currently the news director at WYMT \nand has been there for most of its existence. From a time where two-way \nradios were used in lieu of cell phones, and 75 pound cameras were used \nfor filming, to the age of the Internet and acquiring footage on cell \nphones, Neil has seen many drastic changes.\n  The dawn of the Internet allowed WYMT to connect more personally with \nits viewers, as well as unify eastern Kentucky, which has been the \nstation's mission from the first day on the air. The birth and \nexistence of WYMT have given the people of Prestonsburg, Harlan, \nPineville and other cities in the eastern Kentucky region knowledge of \nhow their neighbors in surrounding towns are doing. WYMT has also \nstrived to balance the positive and negative news stories that it \ncovers in the region, which has added to their success over the years.\n  I would like to personally thank WYMT for the hard work they have put \nin over the years in covering current events in our Commonwealth in an \nhonest and unbiased manner. The effort they have put forth to unify the \nentire region of eastern Kentucky is appreciated by many. I ask my \ncolleagues to rise and join me in congratulating them on this 25-year \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8781-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8781-S8782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for five terms, longer than anyone in his \nState's proud history, Arlen Specter has represented the State of \nPennsylvania in the U.S. Senate. Over that time, he distinguished \nhimself greatly, from his commendable work on the Judiciary Committee \nto his recent efforts to reestablish legal protections against fraud. \nWe saw from the beginning of his Senate service his impressive grasp of \nissues. But as he prepares to leave the Senate, I would like to focus \non two examples from his time here that I believe speak to his \nformidable character.\n  In early 2008, our Nation faced its most daunting economic situation \nin decades. It was clear that private demand in the economy was fading \nin the face of a devastating financial crisis. Economists across the \npolitical spectrum were convinced that Federal fiscal stimulus was \ndesperately needed as part of a strategy to keep recession from turning \ninto depression. And yet there was significant doubt as to whether \nCongress could summon the political will to do what was necessary. \nWithout at least a handful of Republican supporters in the Senate, the \ndesperately needed economic rescue package would not pass.\n  At that moment, under immense political pressure, Senator Specter was \none of just three Republicans willing to vote for the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act. Thanks to the foresight of these Senators, \nmillions of Americans have jobs today who otherwise would be \nunemployed. We should all be grateful for Senator Specter's \ndetermination to do what the country needed.\n  Senator Specter has faced down more dire circumstances than those \nsurrounding the stimulus vote. In 1993, he was diagnosed with a brain \ntumor--one neurosurgeon told him he had just weeks to live. In 2005 and \nagain in 2008, he coped with Hodgkin's disease.\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\n  In each of these cases, Senator Specter not only faced down a deadly \ndisease, but he pushed the limits of physical and mental endurance to \nremain deeply engaged in his Senate work. Work, for him, was integral \nto recovery. As he wrote in an inspirational book on his health \nexperiences, ``Good health is a precious possession that is often taken \nfor granted. The same is true of the time we have been given to \ncontribute to the world around us. Poor health may limit our time and \ncapacity for achievement, but I firmly believe that vigorous work \nprovides the best way to overcome a health challenge.''\n  Senator Specter, thank you for the inspiring example of your \ndetermination. Thank you for a long and productive career in this body, \na career that has meant much to the Senate, to Pennsylvania, and to the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8782-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PORTEOUS IMPEACHMENT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, one of the most solemn obligations of \nSenators is try impeachments. The Constitution provides that the Senate \nshall have the ``sole power to try all impeachments,'' and that ``all \ncivil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on \nimpeachment'' for various offenses. Senators also take a special oath \nwhen hearing an impeachment case before the Senate holds an impeachment \ntrial.\n  I recently heard evidence in the case of Judge Porteous, who would \nhave lifetime tenure under the Constitution unless he resigns or is \nremoved by the Senate. The House of Representatives impeached Judge \nPorteous on four different articles. After deliberation, I voted to \nconvict Judge Porteous of three of the four articles, but voted against \nconviction on one of the articles. I rise to explain my not guilty vote \non one of the articles.\n  Article I stated that Judge Porteous engaged in a pattern of conduct \nthat is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a \nFederal judge. The Senate voted that Judge Porteous was guilty on this \ncount by a unanimous vote of 96 to 0.\n  Article IV stated that Judge Porteous knowingly made material false \nstatements about his past both to the U.S. Senate and to the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, in order to obtain the office of U.S. district \ncourt judge. The Senate voted to convict Judge Porteous on this count \nby a vote of 90 to 6.\n  I voted against article IV because, in my view, it was duplicative of \narticle I.\n  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I regularly review the \nquestionnaire and nomination materials for Federal judicial nominees \nwho are nominated for lifetime appointments. One question we ask \nnominees on our committee questionnaire--under oath--is whether there \nwas ``any unfavorable information that may affect your nomination.'' \nJudicial nominees also fill out SF-86 personnel forms as part of the \nexecutive branch's review of a potential nomination. One question on \nthe form asks--under oath--whether:\n\n       There [is] anything in your personal life that could be \n     used by someone to coerce or blackmail you? Is there anything \n     in your life that could cause an embarrassment to you or to \n     the President if publicly known? If so, please provide full \n     details . . .\n\n  The FBI also asks potential nominees whether they are concealing any \nactivity or conduct that could be used to influence, pressure, coerce \nor compromise them in any way or that would impact negatively on their \ncharacter, reputation, judgment or discretion. Judge Porteous answered \nno to all of these questions.\n  I am concerned about the vagueness and catchall nature of these \nquestions and its responses being the basis of an Article of \nImpeachment. I could understand an Article of Impeachment based on a \nresponse that hides information that if discovered later would be the \nbasis of impeachment and where a separate Article of Impeachment using \nthese specific facts was not presented to the Senate by the House of \nRepresentatives. Also, I would have understood if the statements in \narticle IV were included as part of article I. Such was not the case \nhere.\n  For this reason, I voted not guilty on article IV.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8782-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8782-S8784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been urging Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Senate to come together and take action to begin to \nend the vacancy crisis that is threatening the administration of \njustice by our Federal courts. I asked only that Senators follow the \nGolden Rule. Regrettably that has not happened. Now 38 judicial \nnominees whose qualifications are well established are being delayed. \nThey should be confirmed before we adjourn.\n  Adherence to the Golden Rule, a simple step, would help us return to \nour Senate traditions, and allow the Senate to better fulfill its \nresponsibilities to the American people and the Federal judiciary.\n  I was encouraged last week when Senator Sessions, the Judiciary \nCommittee's ranking Republican, provided assurance that the many \njudicial nominees who have been stalled for months and months without \nSenate action will be confirmed before we adjourn. He is in a position \nto know. As the Republican leader on the committee, he works directly \nwith the Republican leadership that continues to hold up virtually all \njudicial nominees, just as it has for months and months. At our \nJudiciary Committee business meeting on December 1, Senator Sessions \nsaid: ``The truth is except for a few nominees, the overwhelming \nmajority have moved with bipartisan unanimous support and will be \nconfirmed on the floor.'' He went on to predict that a number ``will \nclear before the session is over.'' I hope this assurance is true. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Sessions to ensure that the Senate \nacts before adjourning.\n  He is right: The overwhelming majority of the judicial nominees \nawaiting final action have strong bipartisan support. This makes the \nRepublican obstruction of their confirmation all the more mystifying. \nTwenty-nine of the judicial nominees whose confirmations are being \nstonewalled were not opposed by any Senator, Republican or Democrat, \nduring Judiciary Committee consideration. Two others had only one or \ntwo votes in opposition. Committee Republicans voted in lockstep to \noppose only 4 of the 38 pending nominations. I believe that if debated \nby the Senate, those nominations, too, would be confirmed.\n  Had we adhered to the Golden Rule, the judicial nominees who have \nbeen delayed for weeks and months would already be confirmed. That had \nbeen our practice and tradition. Democratic Senators did not stall the \nnominees of President Bush in this way. Senate Republicans should end \ntheir across the board blockade of noncontroversial judicial nominees. \nWith 111 vacancies--a historically high number--plaguing our Federal \ncourts today, the American people cannot afford this gamesmanship.\n  Despite these skyrocketing vacancies, the Senate has not been \npermitted by Republicans to consider a single judicial nomination since \nSeptember 13, when we confirmed Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth \nCircuit. Only after 10 months of delay was the Senate permitted to act. \nThe Stranch nomination was the only nomination we were permitted to \nconsider that entire work period. In fact, the Republican blockade of \njudicial nominations has been so complete that the Senate has been \npermitted to confirm only five Federal circuit and district court \nnominations since the fourth of July recess. While one in eight Federal \njudgeships remains vacant, Senate Republicans consented to confirm only \na single judicial nomination in July. They consented to consider only \nfour judicial nominations before the August recess, despite 21 \nnominations then on the calendar. We have considered only the Stranch \nnomination since returning from that recess. I do not recall a time \nwhen one party so thoroughly prevented the Senate from acting on \nconsensus nominees with bipartisan support.\n  I have been trying to end this obstruction, yet it continues. \nDemocratic Senators have sought agreement on the floor to debate and \nconsider nominations, but the Republican leadership has objected time \nand time again. The Democratic cloakroom has sought consent from the \nRepublican cloakroom to move nominations, but there has been no \nconsent.\n  The Judiciary Committee has favorably reported 80 of President \nObama's\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\nFederal circuit and district court nominees. Due to Republican \nobstruction we have been able to consider only 41 of these. That is \nbarely half. This is in sharp contrast to the first 2 years of \nPresident Bush's first term when I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate confirmed all 100 of the judicial nominations \nreported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate. In 2002, we \nproceeded in the lameduck session after the election to confirm 20 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees.This year by contrast none have been \nconsidered since the November elections.\n  I have also urged for many months that the Senate debate and vote on \nthose few nominees that some Republican Senators decided to oppose in \ncommittee. These nominees include Benita Pearson of Ohio, William \nMartinez of Colorado, Louis Butler of Wisconsin, Edward Chen of \nCalifornia, John McConnell of Rhode Island, and Goodwin Liu of \nCalifornia. I have reviewed their records and considered their \ncharacter, background and qualifications. I have heard the criticisms \nof the Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee as they have \nvoted against this handful of nominees. I disagree, and believe the \nSenate would vote, as I have, to confirm them. Each of these nominees \nhas been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, several of them \ntwo or three times, and each deserves an up or down vote. That they \nwill not be conservative activist judges should not disqualify them \nfrom serving.\n  But that is not what is happening. We are not debating the merits of \nthose nominations, as Democratic Senators did when we opposed the most \nextreme handful of nominees of President Bush. What is new and \nparticularly damaging about this Republican strategy of obstruction is \nthat dozens of nominees reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, without Republican opposition, are still being delayed.\n  The Senate has received letters from Chief Judges of the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals and the United States District Courts in \nCalifornia, Colorado, Illinois and the District of Columbia. They have \nall pleaded with us to end the blockade and confirm judges nominated to \nfill vacancies in their courts.\n  The vacancies on the Federal courts around the country have doubled \nover the last 2 years and now are at the historically high level of \n111. Fifty-one of these vacancies have been deemed judicial emergency \nvacancies by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. \nDue to the Republicans' obstruction, we have not been able to keep up \nwith attrition over the last 2 years.\n  No one can accuse this President of selecting nominees to meet an \nideological agenda. Senator Sessions has acknowledged that a vast \nmajority of these nominees are consensus nominees. These are well-\nqualified nominees with the support of their home State Senators, both \nRepublicans and Democrats. The Judiciary Committee has not proceeded \nwith a single nominee who was not supported by both home State \nSenators, and I have worked with all Republican Senators to ensure that \nthey were included in the process. Democrats have worked to restore \ncomity to the process.\n  Regrettably, despite these efforts and the outstanding nominees \nbefore us, the Senate is not promptly considering judicial nominations. \nTo the contrary, as the President has pointed out, nominees are being \nstalled who, if allowed to be considered, would receive unanimous or \nnear unanimous support, be confirmed, and be serving in the \nadministration of justice throughout the country.\n  The North Carolina Bar Association recently urged the Senate to \nconsider one of the nominees who was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee in a unanimous rollcall vote--19 to zero. Republicans have \nobjected to his consideration since January 28. For more than 10 \nmonths, Judge Albert Diaz, a respected and experienced jurist who \nserved in the Armed Forces, has been prevented from serving the people \nof North Carolina and the Fourth Circuit. He is nominated to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the Fourth Circuit. He has the support of \nboth his home state Senators, one a Democrat and one a Republican. \nSenator Burr asked nearly a year ago that the Judiciary Committee \n``look for an expedited review and referral to the full Senate so that \nthat deficiency on the fourth circuit can be filled.'' The Senators who \nserve on the Judiciary Committee from South Carolina and Maryland, \nstates also within the Fourth Circuit, also support him. The American \nBar Association rated him well qualified. The North Carolina Bar \nAssociation describes him as ``very qualified and highly regarded.'' \nWhen will the blockade be lifted so that the Senate can confirm Judge \nAlbert Diaz of North Carolina?\n  Judge Diaz and six other consensus nominees to the circuit courts are \nstalled on the Senate Executive Calendar. Judge Ray Lohier of New York \nwould fill one of the four current vacancies on the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit. He is another former prosecutor with \nsupport from both sides of the aisle. His confirmation has been stalled \nfor no good reason for more than 6 months. Scott Matheson is a nominee \nfrom Utah supported by Senator Hatch; he was reported without \nopposition. Mary Murguia, a nominee from Arizona supported by Senator \nKyl, was reported without opposition. Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio \nis nominated to the Federal Circuit and was reported without \nopposition. Susan Carney of Connecticut was reported with the \nbipartisan support of 17 of the 19 Senators on the Judiciary Committee \nto serve on the Second Circuit. Justice James Graves of Mississippi was \nreported unanimously to serve on the Fifth Circuit. These are not \nnominees whose judicial philosophy Republicans even question.\n  The President noted in his September letter to Senate leaders that \nthe ``real harm of this political game-playing falls on the American \npeople, who turn to the courts for justice'' and that the unnecessary \ndelay in considering these noncontroversial nominations ``is \nundermining the ability of our courts to deliver justice to those in \nneed . . . from working mothers seeking timely compensation for their \nemployment discrimination claims to communities hoping for swift \npunishment for perpetrators of crimes to small business owners seeking \nprotection from unfair and anticompetitive practices.''\n  If the Senate were allowed to consider the 38 judicial nominees that \nare currently on the Senate's Executive Calendar, their confirmations \nwould raise the total from the historically low level of 41, where it \ncurrently stands, to almost 80. That would be in the range of judicial \nconfirmations during President George H.W. Bush's first 2 years, 70, \nwhile resting below President Reagan's first 2 years, 87, and pale in \ncomparison to the 100 confirmed in the first 2 years of the George W. \nBush administration or those confirmed during President Clinton's first \n2 years, 127.\n  In the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during President \nBush's first 2 years in office, I scheduled 26 hearings for the \njudicial nominees of a Republican President and the Judiciary Committee \nworked diligently to consider them. During the 2 years of the Obama \nadministration, I have tried to maintain that same approach. The \ncommittee held 25 hearings for President Obama's Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees this Congress. I have not altered my approach \nand neither have Senate Democrats. What has changed is that Senate \nRepublicans, who used to contend that every judicial nominee reported \nby the Judiciary Committee is entitled to a vote, have reversed \nthemselves and reverted to the practices they followed in obstructing \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees. The bottom line is that the \nSenate has been allowed to consider and confirm just 41 Federal circuit \nand district court nominees. That is less than half of the 100 such \nnominees we proceeded to confirm during President Bush's first 2 years.\n  When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee midway through \nPresident Bush's first tumultuous year in office, I worked very hard to \nmake sure Senate Democrats did not perpetuate the ``judge wars'' as \ntit-for-tat. By refusing to proceed on President Clinton's nominations \nwhile judicial vacancies skyrocketed during the 6 years they controlled \nthe pace of nominations, Senate Republicans allowed judicial vacancies \nto rise to 110 by the end of the Clinton administration. As a result of \ntheir strategy, Federal circuit\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\ncourt vacancies doubled. When Democrats regained the Senate majority \nhalfway into President Bush's first year in office, we turned away from \nthese bad practices. As a result, overall judicial vacancies were \nreduced during the Bush years from more than 10 percent to less than 4 \npercent. During the Bush years, the Federal court vacancies were \nreduced from 110 to 34 and Federal circuit court vacancies were reduced \nfrom a high of 32 down to single digits.\n  This progress has not continued with a Democratic President back in \noffice. Instead, Senate Republicans have returned to the strategy they \nused during the Clinton administration of blocking the nominations of a \nDemocratic President, again leading to skyrocketing vacancies. Last \nyear the Senate confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and district court \njudges, the lowest total in 50 years. This year we have yet to confirm \n30 Federal circuit and district judges. We are not even keeping up with \nretirements and attrition. As a result, judicial vacancies are now at \n111, again more than 10 percent.\n  Regrettably, the Senate is not being allowed to consider the \nconsensus, mainstream judicial nominees favorably reported from the \nJudiciary Committee. It has taken nearly five times as long to consider \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations as it did to consider President \nBush's during his first 2 years in office. During the first 2 years of \nthe Bush administration, the 100 judges confirmed were considered by \nthe Senate an average of 25 days from being reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. The average time for confirmed circuit court nominees was 26 \ndays. By contrast, if the Senate were allowed to consider the 34 \njudicial nominees being stalled by Republican objection and they were \nall confirmed this week, the average time Federal circuit and district \nand circuit court judges have been forced to wait after being \nconsidered and favorably recommended by the Judiciary Committee since \nPresident Obama took office would be five times that of those confirmed \nduring the first 2 years of the Bush administration.\n  Time is running out in this Congress for Republicans to turn away \nfrom the disastrous strategy of blocking nominations across the board. \nThe Senate's longstanding traditions demand that we reject this \npractice of obstruction. The Federal courts are suffering from rising \nvacancies and crushing caseloads. The victims are the American people \nwho depend on the courts for justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8784-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING JUDGE VINCENT MICELI\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to recognize \nthe extraordinary legacy of the late retired Riverside Superior Court \nJudge Victor Miceli, who passed away on September 16, 2010. He was a \nchampion of justice, leader of city restoration projects, and preserver \nof the history of the city of Riverside, CA--his adopted hometown for \nwhich he worked diligently for nearly half a century.\n  After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh Law School in 1952 \nand serving as the judge advocate general in the U.S. Army, Vincent \nMiceli relocated to Riverside in 1961. He opened a private civil \npractice, which he maintained until he was appointed by Governor George \nDeukmejian to the Superior Court in 1986. Throughout his tenure, during \nwhich he served as a presiding judge, he rendered decisions in many \nhigh-profile cases, including those involving local politics, city \ngrowth, and environmental issues.\n  Judge Miceli's civic involvement included establishing Federal and \nState appellate courthouses in downtown Riverside, shaping this area as \na justice center enhanced by $100 million in new construction.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Charles \nCarr, who passed away on December 2, 2010, following a life dedicated \nto service, family, and his community. He was a personal friend and, \nalong with his family, I mourn his passing.\n  A native of Blount County, AL, Charles was a graduate of Oneonta High \nSchool and Snead State Junior College. After earning his bachelor's and \nmaster's degree in education from Auburn University, Charles began his \ndistinguished career as an educator in the Blount County public \nschools. Later, he taught at Snead State Junior College and Wallace \nState Community College. Charles was a well-liked and admired educator \nby his former colleagues and students.\n  After serving 13 years in the classroom, his love of teaching and \npublic service led him to Alabama's State capitol where he served on \nthe staff and in the cabinet for Governors George Wallace and Guy Hunt \nas the director of postsecondary education. There, he also served as a \nmentor to many of those who would cross his path and give a helping \nhand to those who felt they did not have a voice. In doing so, he built \na wide network of friends across the State.\n  After leaving the government to work as a private consultant, Charles \njoined Community Bank. Later, in 2002, he became the executive director \nof the Blount County-Oneonta Chamber of Commerce, a position that \nbrought him joy and satisfaction. He was deeply committed to his \ncommunity and I know that he enjoyed promoting it through his position \nwith the chamber.\n  While Charles had great success in his career, he was first and \nforemost a family man. He was devoted to his cherished wife and son and \nenjoyed spending time with his extended family. He is survived by his \nwife Brenda Maynor Carr of Union Grove; son Jonathan Elliott Carr of \nWashington, DC; and two brothers, Jim Carr of Oneonta and Ken Carr of \nHouston, TX.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring the life \nof my friend, Charles Carr. He will be greatly missed by all who knew \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8784-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3998.

A bill to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for \nMedicare beneficiaries and to guarantee access to comprehensive \nprescription drug coverage under part D of the Medicare program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to reintroduce the \nMedicare Enhancements for Needed Drugs Act, the MEND Act, with my \ncolleague, Senator Olympia Snowe. One of the most important promises of \nthe original Medicare Part D debate, and from the more recent health \nreform debate, is to drive cost containment in the field of \nprescription drugs. Allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices \nwould be a groundbreaking cost containment measure for a senior who \nmight otherwise be bankrupted by their prescription drug costs. The \nlegislation introduced today clearly prohibits price setting or the \ncreation of a uniform formulary. It simply allows the Medicare program \nto be a smart shopper by allowing Medicare to go into the market and \nuse its clout just like any other big purchaser.\n  Certainly, there is a significant group of special interests in this \ntown that do not want the Federal Government to be a smart shopper. The \nnumber of lobbyists that have worked against this legislation over the \nyears has been just staggering. For example, the Center for Responsive \nPolitics estimated that last year the pharmaceutical industry spent \nover $250 million for lobbying to squash initiatives such as this. And \nmake no mistake about what the special interests who oppose this \nlegislation want to do. They would rather soak senior citizens and the \ntaxpayers and add to the budget deficit than to have to negotiate with \nthe Federal Government.\n  According to CMS actuaries, the Medicare Part D drug benefit is \nalready funded with over $50 billion a year in taxpayer dollars and \nwill cost the country substantially more in the future. To be good \nstewards of taxpayer dollars, to be able to strengthen the program and \nto help seniors truly save, Congress must look toward using every \nlogical tool to lower costs. The Congressional Budget Office has \nindicated that the type of targeted approach to negotiating drug \npricing in the MEND Act could potentially generate cost savings for the \nMedicare program and for beneficiaries. It would be irresponsible for \nthe Congress not to try and potentially achieve savings for a program \nthat so many Americans rely on.\n  The legislation that Senator Snowe and I put forward today is a \ncommonsense proposal. Having the Secretary negotiate for more \ncompetitive drug pricing is an idea that has broad public support. An \nAARP poll reported that 87 percent of United States adult residents \nsupport government negotiation of prescription drug prices for the \nMedicare benefit. Young, old, rich, poor, Democrat, Republican--our \ncitizens strongly support this approach and probably wonder why it has \ntaken so long to implement it.\n  Under the MEND Act, the Secretary could negotiate in any \ncircumstance, but must negotiate in several instances: for single \nsource drugs for which there is no therapeutic equivalent; drugs for \nwhich taxpayer funding was substantial in its research and development; \nand for any fallback prescription plan that Medicare must provide. In \naddition, this legislation requires the Secretary to provide a fallback \nplan if there is not comprehensive coverage, including coverage for the \nso-called ``doughnut hole'', available in a region.\n  I have always believed that negotiating is not a one-size-fits-all \nproposition. That is why my good friend, Senator Snowe, and I have \nrepeatedly proposed language that includes no uniform formulary. This \nlegislation emphasizes the concept of ``bargaining power''--not price \ncontrols, not rules set in Washington, DC, not a one-size-fits-all \napproach, nothing that would discourage innovation among pharmaceutical \ncompanies, but simply ``bargaining power.''\n  All Americans are affected by prescription drug costs. Particularly \nhard hit are older people, particularly low-income older people, and \npeople with large prescription drug bills. AARP publishes an annual Rx \nWatchdog report. They note that for the nearly 200 brand-name \nmedications most commonly used by older people, the costs of those \nmedicines had gone up by 9.7 percent over a recent 12-month period, \neven though the general inflation rate was below 1 percent. This \nsituation is unreasonable and unsustainable, and it is hurting our most \nvulnerable citizens. As noted by AARP, seniors are affected more than \nany other segment of the U.S. population by prescription drug cost. \nEvery dollar we can save for a senior citizen is also a dollar saved \nfor the taxpayers, and when you are talking about nearly 30 million \nseniors enrolled in Part D coverage, that starts to add up to real \nmoney for the Medicare program.\n  If we can save even a little bit we owe it to seniors to do just \nthat. There are seniors who have to pay thousands of dollars for a \ncancer drug when there are no other options for treatment. \nInterestingly, some of these life-saving drugs have been developed with \nour tax dollars, through research sponsored by Federal agencies such as \nthe NIH. Whenever I am in Oregon at a town hall meeting, I am always \nasked, ``How many times do we have to pay for drugs? Our tax dollars go \ntoward research and development, and then taxpayers have to pay again \nwhen the drug is patented and put on the open market.'' In cases where \nsubstantial Federal research dollars went into creating the drug, I \nbelieve the Secretary ought to step in and see what kind of a better \ndeal can be garnered on behalf of seniors.\n  I would like to acknowledge Senator Snowe's efforts on behalf of our \nMedicare beneficiaries and taxpayers. She and I have worked on this \nparticular issue for a number of years. This bipartisan proposal is an \neffort to follow up on the promise she and I made to our citizens back \nhome to improve the Part D drug benefit. I thank Senator Snowe, who is \nalways trying to find common,\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\nbipartisan ground, which is, of course, the only way you get important \nwork done in the Senate. This legislation certainly qualifies as \nimportant work. I urge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this \nbipartisan legislation to contain prescription drug costs for our \nNation's seniors.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I join with my colleague and friend. \nSenator Ron Wyden, to introduce legislation which we have sponsored \nsince 2004 to ensure the sound fiscal management of the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Unquestionably, this new benefit marks a milestone for Medicare. \nToday millions of American seniors are at last receiving assistance \nwith the high cost of prescription drugs. For so many, that will make a \ndifference between choosing whether to take needed medications and \nproviding the other necessities of life. We have indeed come a very \nlong way. We look forward to realizing the many benefits of this \ncoverage as we see the results of more affordable access to \nprescription drugs--better health for our seniors and substantial \nhealth care savings.\n  At the same time, there is no doubt that this benefit can be \nimproved. We have heard estimates that the average senior is saving an \naverage of $1,000 per year, but we should ask how that saving is being \nachieved. The discovery by many seniors--when they reached the doughnot \nhole--that their cost of medications was the same or even higher than \nwhat they paid prior to enrolling in Part D--that should be a red flag \nthat we may not be seeing the purchasing power of seniors harnessed for \nthe savings they deserve.\n  Our system is working well in terms of subsidy, but certainly needs \nto improve in terms of negotiating substantial discounts. As Senator \nWyden and I learned from GAO reports we have received, the prices of \ndrugs used by seniors have inexorably increased since 2000 at two to \nthree times the inflation rate. According to the New York Times, last \nyear's brand drug price increase average of over 9 percent represents \nthe highest annual rate of inflation for drug prices since 1992.\n  So the costs of this program will remain a concern. Most of us \nenvisioned that not only would the taxpayer contribute to helping \nseniors with drug expenses, but we also would realize substantial \nsavings from lower prices on prescription drugs.\n  That is why Senator Wyden and I proposed to achieve some balance in \nthe public-private partnership which is Part D today, and it is why \ntoday we are again introducing the Medicare Enhancements for Needed \nDrugs Act--the MEND Act. In this drug benefit the HHS Secretary should \nhave a proper role in negotiation--negotiation, not price setting.\n  It is clear that what the Congress intended to do was to create a \ntrue public-private partnership, utilizing competitive forces to bring \nmore choices to seniors--in drugs, benefit plan designs, pharmacies, \nand more. So seniors can vote with their pocketbooks, and we can see \ntheir choices in the market influence the kind of benefit they receive. \nThat is not the same as a system in which the government sets prices, \nand that is why our legislation specifically bans such a practice. \nUnder our legislation, the Federal Government cannot set either prices \nor formularies--that is absolutely clear.\n  What I believe most of us desire to do is give the current system the \nbest tools to achieve success. That means that the Secretary must have \nan oversight role. Our legislation rescinds the noninterference clause \nand directs the Secretary to negotiate for any necessary fallback plan, \nand in addition, to respond to requests for help from plans which \ncannot obtain reasonable negotiation.\n  We have also added two areas in which the Secretary must negotiate. \nFirst, as the CBO has stated that negotiation of single-source drugs \ncould yield savings, our legislation directs the Secretary to engage in \nnegotiation regarding those unique products. We also know that some \ndrugs exist because the taxpayer provides substantial support to see \nthem developed. The public deserves a fair price on those products it \nmade possible, so the Secretary should weigh-in in those cases.\n  Finally, our bill protects beneficiaries by assuring that seniors \nwill have access to a comprehensive coverage option--at least one plan \nin each region must provide the option to avoid the coverage gap, \ndreaded doughnut hole. Today, 47 percent of plans offer no coverage, 30 \npercent only cover generics, and 23 percent cover generics and some \nbrand name drugs.\n  The bottom line is that our bill protects both beneficiaries and \ntaxpayers within the public-private partnership on which this benefit \nrests. I call on my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "10", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/10/senate-section/article/S8788-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8788-S8793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 700--TO PROVIDE FOR THE APPROVAL OF FINAL REGULATIONS \nISSUED BY THE OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE TO IMPLEMENT THE VETERANS EMPLOYMENT \nOPPORTUNITIES ACT OF 1998 THAT APPLY TO THE SENATE AND EMPLOYEES OF THE \n                                 SENATE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Bennett) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE.\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to certain covered employees \n     within the Legislative branch.\n       (b) Purpose of regulations. The regulations set forth \n     herein are the substantive regulations that the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance with \n     the rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384). The purpose of subparts B, C and D of \n     these regulations is to define veterans' preference and the \n     administration of veterans' preference as applicable to \n     Federal employment in the Legislative branch. (5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108, as applied by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E \n     of these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws are integrated into the existing \n     employment and retention policies and processes of those \n     employing offices with employees covered by the VEOA, and to \n     provide for transparency in the application of veterans' \n     preference in covered appointment and retention decisions. \n     Provided, nothing in these regulations shall be construed so \n     as to require an employing office to reduce any existing \n     veterans' preference rights and protections that it may \n     afford to preference eligible individuals.\n       H Regs:   (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress within an employing office, as \n     defined by Sec. 101 (9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301 \n     (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (4) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n       S Regs:  (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made or directed by a Member of Congress within an employing \n     office, as defined by Sec. 101(9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1301 (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a \n     committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress or a \n     joint committee of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate; (4) who is appointed pursuant to 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 43d(a); or (5) who is appointed to a position, the \n     duties of which are equivalent to those of a Senior Executive \n     Service position (within the meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of \n     title 5, United States Code). Accordingly, these regulations \n     shall not apply to any employing office that only employs \n     individuals excluded from the definition of covered employee.\n       C Reg:  (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress or by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (3) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n\n     SEC. 1.102.

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are \n     ``the same as the most relevant substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory \n     provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and \n     subchapter I of chapter 35, of title 5, United States Code. \n     The regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters \n     for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA requires a \n     regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment based on the information available to it \n     at the time of promulgation of these regulations, that, with \n     the exception of the regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA that need be \n     adopted.\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive \n     branch)'', section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the \n     Board to ``determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under'' section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist \n     in the employing offices subject to this regulation. \n     Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create \n     detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce \n     that does not exist in the Legislative branch, while \n     providing no VEOA protections to the covered Legislative \n     branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially \n     tailored regulations, rather than simply to adopt those \n     promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate Congress' \n     intent in extending the principles of the veterans' \n     preference laws to the Legislative branch through the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.104. COORDINATION WITH SECTION 225 OF THE \n                   CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.\n\n       Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(C) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of \n     section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule \n     of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws \n     made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and \n     subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be \n     considered to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the \n     Executive branch.\n\n          Subpart B--Veterans' Preference--General Provisions\n\nSec.\n1.105 Responsibility for administration of veterans' preference.\n1.106 Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.105.

VETERANS' PREFERENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO \n                   RESTRICTED POSITIONS.\n\n       In each appointment action for the positions of custodian, \n     elevator operator, guard, and messenger (as defined below and \n     collectively referred to in these regulations as restricted \n     covered positions) employing offices shall restrict \n     competition to preference eligible applicants as long as \n     qualified preference eligible applicants are available. The \n     provisions of sections 1.109 and 1.110 below shall apply to \n     the appointment of a preference eligible applicant to a \n     restricted covered position. The provisions of section 1.108 \n     shall apply to the appointment of a preference eligible \n     applicant to a restricted covered position, in the event that \n     there is more than one preference eligible applicant for the \n     position.\n       Custodian--One whose primary duty is the performance of \n     cleaning or other ordinary routine maintenance duties in or \n     about a government building or a building under Federal \n     control, park, monument, or other Federal reservation.\n       Elevator operator--One whose primary duty is the running of \n     freight or passenger elevators.

VETERANS' PREFERENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO NON-\n                   RESTRICTED COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Where an employing office has duly adopted a policy \n     requiring the numerical scoring or rating of applicants for \n     covered positions, the employing office shall add points to \n     the earned ratings of those preference eligible applicants \n     who receive passing scores in an entrance examination, in a \n     manner that is proportionately comparable to the points \n     prescribed in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309. For example, five \n     preference points shall be granted to preference eligible \n     applicants in a 100-point system, one point shall be granted \n     in a 20-point system, and so on.\n       (b) In all other situations involving appointment to a \n     covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' \n     preference eligibility as an affirmative factor in the \n     employing office's determination of who will be appointed \n     from among qualified applicants.\n\n     SEC. 1.109. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO COVERED \n                   POSITIONS.\n\n       When considering applicants for covered positions in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, employing offices \n     shall provide preference eligible applicants with credit:\n       (a) for time spent in the military service (1) as an \n     extension of time spent in the position in which the \n     applicant was employed immediately before his/her entrance \n     into the military service, or (2) on the basis of actual \n     duties performed in the military service, or (3) as a \n     combination of both methods. Employing offices shall credit \n     time spent in the military service according to the method \n     that will be of most benefit to the preference eligible \n     applicant.\n       (b) for all experience material to the position for which \n     the applicant is being considered, including experience \n     gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and \n     organizational activities, regardless of whether he/she \n     received pay therefor.\n\n     SEC. 1.110. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN APPOINTMENTS \n                   TO COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Subject to (c) below, in determining qualifications of \n     a preference eligible for appointment, an employing office \n     shall waive:\n       (1) with respect to a preference eligible applicant, \n     requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) with respect to a preference eligible applicant to whom \n     it has made a conditional offer of employment, physical \n     requirements if, in the opinion of the employing office, on \n     the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation \n     of an accredited physician submitted by the preference \n     eligible applicant, the preference eligible applicant is \n     physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position;\n       (b) Subject to (c) below, if an employing office \n     determines, on the basis of evidence before it, including any \n     recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the \n     preference eligible applicant, that an applicant to whom it \n     has made a conditional offer of employment is preference \n     eligible as a disabled veteran as described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108(3)(c) and who has a compensable service-connected \n     disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the \n     physical requirements of the covered position, the employing \n     office shall notify the preference eligible applicant of the \n     reasons for the determination and of the right to respond and \n     to submit additional information to the employing office, \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. The director \n     of the employing office may, by providing written notice to \n     the preference eligible applicant, shorten the period for \n     submitting a response with respect to an appointment to a \n     particular covered position, if necessary because of a need \n     to fill the covered position immediately. Should the \n     preference eligible applicant make a timely response, the \n     highest ranking individual or group of individuals with \n     authority to make employment decisions on behalf of the \n     employing office shall render a final determination of the \n     physical ability of the preference eligible applicant to \n     perform the duties of the position, taking into account the \n     response and any additional information provided by the \n     preference eligible applicant. When the employing office has \n     completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the \n     basis of physical disability, it shall send its findings to \n     the preference eligible applicant.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligations it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n         Subpart D--Veterans' preference in reductions in force\n\nSec.\n1.111.

DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       (a) Competing covered employees are the covered employees \n     within a particular position or job classification, at or \n     within a particular competitive area, as those terms are \n     defined below.\n       (b) Competitive area is that portion of the employing \n     office's organizational structure, as determined by the \n     employing office, in which covered employees compete for \n     retention. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms \n     of the employing office's organizational unit(s) and \n     geographical location, and it must include all employees \n     within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area \n     may consist of all or part of an employing office. The \n     minimum competitive area is a department or subdivision of \n     the employing office within the local commuting area.\n       (c) Position classifications or job classifications are \n     determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all \n     covered positions within a competitive area that are in the \n     same grade, occupational level or classification, and which \n     are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay \n     schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working \n     conditions so that an employing office may reassign the \n     incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in \n     the position classification without undue interruption.\n       (d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if\n       (A) his/her retirement was based on disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he/she \n     continued to be so employed without a break in service of \n     more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C Sec. 2108 and section 1.102(o) of these regulations \n     shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in \n     determining an employee's qualifications for retention under \n     section 1.114 of these regulations.\n       H Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis, or (3) attributable to \n     a change in party leadership or majority party status within \n     the House of Congress where the employee is employed.\n       C Reg:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, work generally would \n     not be considered to be unduly interrupted if a covered \n     employee needs more than 90 days after the reduction in force \n     to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-\n     day standard may be extended if placement is made under this \n     part to a program accorded low priority by the employing \n     office, or to a vacant position.\n\n     SEC. 1.112. APPLICATION OF PREFERENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans'\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\n     preference as the controlling factor in retention decisions \n     among such competing covered employees, regardless of length \n     of service or performance, provided that the preference \n     eligible employee's performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable. Provided, a preference eligible employee who is \n     a ``disabled veteran'' under section 1.102(h) above who has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more and whose performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable by an employing office is entitled to be \n     retained in preference to other preference eligible \n     employees. Provided, this section does not relieve an \n     employing office of any greater obligation it may be subject \n     to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(9).\n\n     SEC. 1.113. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       In computing length of service in connection with a \n     reduction in force, the employing office shall provide credit \n     to preference eligible covered employees as follows:\n       (a) a preference eligible covered employee who is not a \n     retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit \n     for the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces;\n       (b) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit for:\n       (1) the length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which \n     a campaign badge has been authorized; or\n       (2) the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces if he is included under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501(a)(3)(A), \n     (B), or (C); and\n       (c) a preference eligible covered employee is entitled to \n     credit for:\n       (1) service rendered as an employee of a county committee \n     established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation \n     and Allotment Act or of a committee or association of \n     producers described in section 10(b) of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act; and\n       (2) service rendered as an employee described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c) if such employee moves or has moved, on or after \n     January 1, 1966, without a break in service of more than 3 \n     days, from a position in a nonappropriated fund \n     instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard, respectively, that is not described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c).\n\n     SEC. 1.114. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN REDUCTIONS IN \n                   FORCE.\n\n       (a) If an employing office determines, on the basis of \n     evidence before it, that a covered employee is preference \n     eligible, the employing office shall waive, in determining \n     the covered employee's retention status in a reduction in \n     force:\n       (1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) physical requirements if, in the opinion of the \n     employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, \n     including any recommendation of an accredited physician \n     submitted by the employee, the preference eligible covered \n     employee is physically able to perform efficiently the duties \n     of the position.\n       (b) If an employing office determines that a covered \n     employee who is a preference eligible as a disabled veteran \n     as described in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3)(c) and has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of the \n     covered position, the employing office shall notify the \n     preference eligible covered employee of the reasons for the \n     determination and of the right to respond and to submit \n     additional information to the employing office within 15 days \n     of the date of the notification. Should the preference \n     eligible covered employee make a timely response, the highest \n     ranking individual or group of individuals with authority to \n     make employment decisions on behalf of the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \n     the preference eligible covered employee to perform the \n     duties of the covered position, taking into account the \n     evidence before it, including the response and any additional \n     information provided by the preference eligible. When the \n     employing office has completed its review of the proposed \n     disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it \n     shall send its findings to the preference eligible covered \n     employee.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligation it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 1.115. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS.\n\n       (a) When a function is transferred from one employing \n     office to another employing office, each covered employee in \n     the affected position classifications or job classifications \n     in the function that is to be transferred shall be \n     transferred to the receiving employing office for employment \n     in a covered position for which he/she is qualified before \n     the receiving employing office may make an appointment from \n     another source to that position.\n       (b) When one employing office is replaced by another \n     employing office, each covered employee in the affected \n     position classifications or job classifications in the \n     employing office to be replaced shall be transferred to the \n     replacing employing office for employment in a covered \n     position for which he/she is qualified before the replacing \n     employing office may make an appointment from another source \n     to that position.\n\n Subpart E--Adoption of Veterans' preference policies, recordkeeping & \n                      informational requirements.\n\nSec.\n1.116.

ADOPTION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICY.\n\n       No later than 120 calendar days following Congressional \n     approval of this regulation, each employing office that \n     employs one or more covered employees or that seeks \n     applicants for a covered position shall adopt its written \n     policy specifying how it has integrated the veterans' \n     preference requirements of the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act of 1998 and these regulations into its \n     employment and retention processes. Upon timely request and \n     the demonstration of good cause, the Executive Director, in \n     his/her discretion, may grant such an employing office \n     additional time for preparing its policy. Each such employing \n     office will make its policies available to applicants for \n     appointment to a covered position and to covered employees in \n     accordance with these regulations. The act of adopting a \n     veterans' preference policy shall not relieve any employing \n     office of any other responsibility or requirement of the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 or these \n     regulations. An employing office may amend or replace its \n     veterans' preference policies as it deems necessary or \n     appropriate, so long as the resulting policies are consistent \n     with the VEOA and these regulations.\n\n     SEC. 1.117. PRESERVATION OF RECORDS MADE OR KEPT.\n\n       An employing office that employs one or more covered \n     employees or that seeks applicants for a covered position \n     shall maintain any records relating to the application of its \n     veterans' preference policy to applicants for covered \n     positions and to workforce adjustment decisions affecting \n     covered employees for a period of at least one year from the \n     date of the making of the record or the date of the personnel \n     action involved or, if later, one year from the date on which \n     the applicant or covered employee is notified of the \n     personnel action. Where a claim has been brought under \n     section 401 of the CAA against an employing office under the \n     VEOA, the respondent employing office shall preserve all \n     personnel records relevant to the claim until final \n     disposition of the claim. The term ``personnel records \n     relevant to the claim'', for example, would include records \n     relating to the veterans' preference determination regarding \n     the person bringing the claim and records relating to any \n     veterans' preference determinations regarding other \n     applicants for the covered position the person sought, or \n     records relating to the veterans' preference determinations \n     regarding other covered employees in the person's position or \n     job classification. The date of final disposition of the \n     charge or the action means the latest of the date of \n     expiration of the statutory period within which the aggrieved \n     person may file a complaint with the Office or in a U.S. \n     District Court or, where an action is brought against an \n     employing office by the aggrieved person, the date on which \n     such litigation is terminated.\n\n     SEC. 1.118. DISSEMINATION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICIES TO \n                   APPLICANTS FOR COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) An employing office shall state in any announcements \n     and advertisements it makes concerning vacancies in covered \n     positions that the staffing action is governed by the VEOA.\n       (b) An employing office shall invite applicants for a \n     covered position to identify themselves as veterans' \n     preference eligible applicants, provided that in doing so:\n       (1) the employing office shall state clearly on any written \n     application or questionnaire used for this purpose or make \n     clear orally, if a written application or questionnaire is \n     not used, that the requested information is intended for use \n     solely in connection with the employing office's obligations \n     and efforts to provide veterans' preference to preference \n     eligible applicants in accordance with the VEOA; and\n       (2) the employing office shall state clearly that disabled \n     veteran status is requested on a voluntary basis, that it \n     will be kept confidential in accordance with the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE.\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to certain covered employees \n     within the Legislative branch.\n       (b) Purpose of regulations. The regulations set forth \n     herein are the substantive regulations that the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance with \n     the rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384). The purpose of subparts B, C and D of \n     these regulations is to define veterans' preference and the \n     administration of veterans' preference as applicable to \n     Federal employment in the Legislative branch. (5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108, as applied by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E \n     of these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws are integrated into the existing \n     employment and retention policies and processes of those \n     employing offices with employees covered by the VEOA, and to \n     provide for transparency in the application of veterans' \n     preference in covered appointment and retention decisions. \n     Provided, nothing in these regulations shall be construed so \n     as to require an employing office to reduce any existing \n     veterans' preference rights and protections that it may \n     afford to preference eligible individuals.\n       H Regs:   (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress within an employing office, as \n     defined by Sec. 101 (9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301 \n     (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (4) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n       S Regs:  (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made or directed by a Member of Congress within an employing \n     office, as defined by Sec. 101(9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1301 (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a \n     committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress or a \n     joint committee of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate; (4) who is appointed pursuant to 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 43d(a); or (5) who is appointed to a position, the \n     duties of which are equivalent to those of a Senior Executive \n     Service position (within the meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of \n     title 5, United States Code). Accordingly, these regulations \n     shall not apply to any employing office that only employs \n     individuals excluded from the definition of covered employee.\n       C Reg:  (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress or by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (3) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n\n     SEC. 1.102.

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are \n     ``the same as the most relevant substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory \n     provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and \n     subchapter I of chapter 35, of title 5, United States Code. \n     The regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters \n     for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA requires a \n     regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment based on the information available to it \n     at the time of promulgation of these regulations, that, with \n     the exception of the regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA that need be \n     adopted.\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive \n     branch)'', section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the \n     Board to ``determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under'' section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist \n     in the employing offices subject to this regulation. \n     Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create \n     detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce \n     that does not exist in the Legislative branch, while \n     providing no VEOA protections to the covered Legislative \n     branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially \n     tailored regulations, rather than simply to adopt those \n     promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate Congress' \n     intent in extending the principles of the veterans' \n     preference laws to the Legislative branch through the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.104. COORDINATION WITH SECTION 225 OF THE \n                   CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.\n\n       Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(C) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of \n     section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule \n     of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws \n     made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and \n     subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be \n     considered to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the \n     Executive branch.\n\n          Subpart B--Veterans' Preference--General Provisions\n\nSec.\n1.105 Responsibility for administration of veterans' preference.\n1.106 Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.105.

The \n     provisions of sections 1.109 and 1.110 below shall apply to \n     the appointment of a preference eligible applicant to a \n     restricted covered position. The provisions of section 1.108 \n     shall apply to the appointment of a preference eligible \n     applicant to a restricted covered position, in the event that \n     there is more than one preference eligible applicant for the \n     position.\n       Custodian--One whose primary duty is the performance of \n     cleaning or other ordinary routine maintenance duties in or \n     about a government building or a building under Federal \n     control, park, monument, or other Federal reservation.\n       Elevator operator--One whose primary duty is the running of \n     freight or passenger elevators.

VETERANS' PREFERENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO NON-\n                   RESTRICTED COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Where an employing office has duly adopted a policy \n     requiring the numerical scoring or rating of applicants for \n     covered positions, the employing office shall add points to \n     the earned ratings of those preference eligible applicants \n     who receive passing scores in an entrance examination, in a \n     manner that is proportionately comparable to the points \n     prescribed in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309. For example, five \n     preference points shall be granted to preference eligible \n     applicants in a 100-point system, one point shall be granted \n     in a 20-point system, and so on.\n       (b) In all other situations involving appointment to a \n     covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' \n     preference eligibility as an affirmative factor in the \n     employing office's determination of who will be appointed \n     from among qualified applicants.\n\n     SEC. 1.109. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO COVERED \n                   POSITIONS.\n\n       When considering applicants for covered positions in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, employing offices \n     shall provide preference eligible applicants with credit:\n       (a) for time spent in the military service (1) as an \n     extension of time spent in the position in which the \n     applicant was employed immediately before his/her entrance \n     into the military service, or (2) on the basis of actual \n     duties performed in the military service, or (3) as a \n     combination of both methods.

WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN APPOINTMENTS \n                   TO COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Subject to (c) below, in determining qualifications of \n     a preference eligible for appointment, an employing office \n     shall waive:\n       (1) with respect to a preference eligible applicant, \n     requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) with respect to a preference eligible applicant to whom \n     it has made a conditional offer of employment, physical \n     requirements if, in the opinion of the employing office, on \n     the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation \n     of an accredited physician submitted by the preference \n     eligible applicant, the preference eligible applicant is \n     physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position;\n       (b) Subject to (c) below, if an employing office \n     determines, on the basis of evidence before it, including any \n     recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the \n     preference eligible applicant, that an applicant to whom it \n     has made a conditional offer of employment is preference \n     eligible as a disabled veteran as described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108(3)(c) and who has a compensable service-connected \n     disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the \n     physical requirements of the covered position, the employing \n     office shall notify the preference eligible applicant of the \n     reasons for the determination and of the right to respond and \n     to submit additional information to the employing office, \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. The director \n     of the employing office may, by providing written notice to \n     the preference eligible applicant, shorten the period for \n     submitting a response with respect to an appointment to a \n     particular covered position, if necessary because of a need \n     to fill the covered position immediately. Should the \n     preference eligible applicant make a timely response, the \n     highest ranking individual or group of individuals with \n     authority to make employment decisions on behalf of the \n     employing office shall render a final determination of the \n     physical ability of the preference eligible applicant to \n     perform the duties of the position, taking into account the \n     response and any additional information provided by the \n     preference eligible applicant. When the employing office has \n     completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the \n     basis of physical disability, it shall send its findings to \n     the preference eligible applicant.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligations it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.

DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       (a) Competing covered employees are the covered employees \n     within a particular position or job classification, at or \n     within a particular competitive area, as those terms are \n     defined below.\n       (b) Competitive area is that portion of the employing \n     office's organizational structure, as determined by the \n     employing office, in which covered employees compete for \n     retention. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms \n     of the employing office's organizational unit(s) and \n     geographical location, and it must include all employees \n     within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area \n     may consist of all or part of an employing office. The \n     minimum competitive area is a department or subdivision of \n     the employing office within the local commuting area.\n       (c) Position classifications or job classifications are \n     determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all \n     covered positions within a competitive area that are in the \n     same grade, occupational level or classification, and which \n     are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay \n     schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working \n     conditions so that an employing office may reassign the \n     incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in \n     the position classification without undue interruption.\n       (d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if\n       (A) his/her retirement was based on disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he/she \n     continued to be so employed without a break in service of \n     more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C Sec. 2108 and section 1.102(o) of these regulations \n     shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in \n     determining an employee's qualifications for retention under \n     section 1.114 of these regulations.\n       H Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis, or (3) attributable to \n     a change in party leadership or majority party status within \n     the House of Congress where the employee is employed.\n       C Reg:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, work generally would \n     not be considered to be unduly interrupted if a covered \n     employee needs more than 90 days after the reduction in force \n     to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-\n     day standard may be extended if placement is made under this \n     part to a program accorded low priority by the employing \n     office, or to a vacant position.\n\n     SEC. 1.112. APPLICATION OF PREFERENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference \n     as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such \n     competing covered employees, regardless of length of service \n     or performance, provided that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance has\n\n[[Page S8797]]\n\n     not been determined to be unacceptable. Provided, a \n     preference eligible employee who is a ``disabled veteran'' \n     under section 1.102(h) above who has a compensable service-\n     connected disability of 30 percent or more and whose \n     performance has not been determined to be unacceptable by an \n     employing office is entitled to be retained in preference to \n     other preference eligible employees. Provided, this section \n     does not relieve an employing office of any greater \n     obligation it may be subject to pursuant to the Worker \n     Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(9) of the \n     CAA, 2 U.S.C.

Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate a message from the House of Representatives with respect to S. \n3817.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives.\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 3817) entitled \n     ``An Act to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment \n     Act, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, the \n     Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act \n     of 1978, and the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 to \n     reauthorize the Acts, and for other purposes'', do pass with \n     an amendment.\n\n  The amendment is printed in the Record of December 8, 2010, at page H \n8114.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my friend and \ncolleague Senator Dodd. Throughout his career in the Senate, he has \nalways made it a priority to protect and support America's children and \nfamilies. I am delighted to reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment Act, Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, the \nAdoption Opportunity Act and the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act as we \ncelebrate the congressional legacy of the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut. Children and families will benefit from these and \nimprovements in the system designed to prevent and serve victims of \nchild abuse and neglect, as well as family, domestic, and dating \nviolence.\n\n[[Page S8808]]\n\n  I would also like to thank the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, and \nthe Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for working with us and \nshowing a true commitment to getting this done. The efforts of the \nSenators and their staff were invaluable.\n  The legislation that was just passed and is being sent to the \nPresident is a step forward in improving child safety and strengthening \ncritical services for children and families. At a time when there is \nlittle talk of successful bipartisan effort in Congress, this \nlegislation is a reflection of changes we are able to make on behalf of \nAmerican citizens when we work together, to do better for our Nation's \nchildren and families.\n  The need for this reauthorization is real. In my home State of Iowa, \nafter a 2-year drop, the rates of child abuse rose 11 percent in 2009. \nThe CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010 will help communities better meet \nthe needs of our children. This reauthorization encourages states to \nprovide high-quality prevention services to reduce abuse and neglect, \nensures that investigations of allegations protect children and reduce \ntrauma, and directs vital resources to communities that need them most. \nEach of these enhancements should ultimately result in improved systems \nfor training and supporting adults charged with identifying, \npreventing, and responding to reports of abuse, neglect, and \nmaltreatment; stronger coordination among service providers; and a \nrenewed focus on the need to respond to the conditions that lead to \nabuse, neglect, and maltreatment in order to prevent them from \noccurring.\n  These are important steps, but we still have a lot of work to do. \nRates of child abuse and neglect are still far too high across the \ncountry. Each year, an estimated 794,000 children are victims of child \nabuse or neglect. In its Child Maltreatment 2008 Report on Child Abuse \nand Neglect, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported \nthat, each year, 141,700 children are seriously injured, 18,000 are \nseverely disabled, and 1,760 children die as a result of abuse or \nneglect. Children younger than 6 years of age accounted for 76 percent \nof child fatalities. Babies younger than one year of age accounted for \n42 percent of child fatalities. Each of these children is one too many \nchildren who have suffered.\n  Similarly, we cannot ignore the 1.5 million women and 900,000 men who \nare raped or physically assaulted by a partner every year in the United \nStates. Last year over 247,000 victims and their children were turned \naway because shelters were full or programs lacked resources. The \nservices provided for through this reauthorization are essential. In \none day alone in 2009, more than 65,000 victims of domestic violence \nand their children received life-saving services from local domestic \nviolence programs because of the services provided through FVPSA. By \npassing this reauthorization we have taken steps toward providing a \nbetter system.\n  I want to take a moment to mention those who have worked so hard on \nmy staff. I would like to thank Dan Smith and Pam Smith, who do a great \njob on all of the undertakings of our committee. I would like to thank \nBethany Little, David Johns, and Ashley Eden of my staff. David has \nbeen working on this for over 3 years; I especially appreciate his \ndiligence and effort. I would also like to thank Senator Dodd's staff \nJim Fenton and Averi Pakulis. Also, as I mentioned, this has been a \nbipartisan effort, and I would also like to thank Senator Enzi's staff, \nBeth Buehlmann and Kelly Hastings as well as David Cleary from Senator \nAlexander's staff. I am also grateful to Chairman Miller and Ranking \nMember John Kline of the House Committee on Education and Labor and \ntheir excellent staff for the impressive work they did moving this bill \nquickly through the House. I appreciate the assistance of Lynn \nRosenthal, the White House Adviser on Violence Against Women, in \nimproving the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act. Vice \nPresident Biden has long been, and continues to be, a leader in this \narea and Lynn assisted him ably in this effort. This is a major \nundertaking, and to be able to get this kind of joint effort at time \nlike this is a great tribute to all of those who have worked so hard. \nAs always, we could not work without the excellent services of the \nSenate Office of Legislative Counsel, especially Liz King.\n  This is a critical step forward to ensuring the safety of America's \nchildren, youth and adults--let's keep walking forward together.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the CAPTA \nReauthorization Act of 2010, S. 3817, and cleared it for the \nPresident's signature. This bill reauthorizes several important \nstatutes--the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, CAPTA, and the \nFamily Violence Prevention and Services Act, FVPSA, the Adoption \nOpportunities Act, and the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act. I would \nlike to thank Chairman Harkin for his work on this reauthorization, and \nfor his tireless efforts on behalf of abused and neglected children and \nvictims of domestic and dating violence. I would also like to thank the \nranking member of our committee, Senator Enzi, and the ranking member \nof my Subcommittee on Children and Families, Senator Alexander. They \nhave been good partners in this process. I also thank Chairman Miller, \nwho brought this bill to the House floor this week and worked hard to \nensure that we passed it before adjourning for the year.\n  I would also like to thank the great work of the advocate communities \nthat work constantly to protect children and victims of domestic and \ndating violence, including the National Child Abuse Coalition and the \nNational Task Force to End Violence Against Women. Work on this \nreauthorization would not have been possible without the expertise and \non-the-ground knowledge that these groups possess.\n  The numbers of children abused or neglected and individuals affected \nby domestic and dating violence are astounding and intolerable. In \nfiscal year 2008, 772,000 children were victims of abuse and neglect, \n1,740 children died due to abuse or neglect, and 38 percent of victims \nof abuse did not receive postinvestigative services. Nearly one in four \nwomen is abused by a partner in her adult life, three women are killed \nby a partner each day in this country, and 15.5 million children are \nexposed to domestic violence each year. We cannot be complacent on \nthese issues with numbers like this.\n  The programs authorized under CAPTA and FVPSA provide vital direct \nservices and prevention efforts to the victims they target. I am \npleased with some of the improvements we were able to make to these \nprograms in this reauthorization bill.\n  CAPTA funds State and discretionary grants designed to help States \nstrengthen their child protective service agencies to prevent and treat \nchild abuse and neglect, including research, home visitation, outreach, \nand education. It also funds community-based efforts to develop, \noperate, expand, enhance, and coordinate initiatives aimed at \nstrengthening and supporting families in the prevention of child \nmaltreatment, and to foster an understanding of diverse populations to \nmore effectively prevent and treat child abuse and neglect.\n  For CAPTA, our bill encourages States to adopt a differential \nresponse model in working with at-risk families to improve their \noutcomes and prevent child abuse and neglect from ever occurring; \naddresses the co-occurrence of child abuse and neglect along with \ndomestic violence, mental health problems, and substance abuse \ndisorders; strengthens data collection regarding our child protection \nservice systems in States; and increases parental involvement in the \nplanning and implementation of programs under these grants, to better \nmeet the needs of children.\n  FVPSA is the primary Federal funding stream for domestic violence \nshelters and direct services to victims of domestic violence and their \nchildren. Over 2,000 shelters and programs receive grant funding under \nFVPSA, which provide emergency shelters, hotlines, counseling and \nadvocacy, and primary and secondary prevention for victims of domestic \nviolence. For FVPSA, our bill recognizes dating violence victims as \nrecipients of FVPSA services, and acknowledges that women between the \nages of 16 and 24 are at greatest risk for being victims of domestic \nviolence; addresses the needs of underserved populations that find it \nchallenging to access FVPSA services; and codifies a program to provide \nservices for children exposed to violence in their homes and \ncommunities.\n  The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act provides assistance to abandoned\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\ninfants by supporting recruitment of and training for foster families. \nThe Adoption Opportunities program is designed to promote adoption, \neliminate barriers to adoption, and provide permanent, loving homes for \nchildren, especially children with special needs. Adoption promotion \nand post-adoption support are both critical components in successfully \nachieving the goals of the program and I am pleased that our bill \nreauthorizes these two programs as well.\n  We have an enormous responsibility to provide for some of our most \nvulnerable citizens--children who have been abused or neglected, \nvictims of domestic violence and their children, children who have been \nabandoned, and those awaiting adoption.

Mr. President, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement \nAct, S. 372, will strengthen and modernize protections for Federal \nwhistleblowers. May I ask the Senator from Hawaii to clarify the intent \nof the provision providing relief for the consequences of retaliatory \ninvestigations? Am I correct that this provision does not in any way \nreduce or eliminate current protections against retaliatory \ninvestigations?\n  Mr. AKAKA. The Senator from Iowa is correct. Remedies in S. 372 \nprovide relief for the consequences of preliminary retaliatory \ninvestigations when an employee prevails in litigation against a \nprohibited personnel practice. This provision does not in any way \nreduce or eliminate jurisdiction to challenge a retaliatory \ninvestigation before a formal personnel action occurs.\n  In legislative history for 1994 amendments to the Whistleblower \nProtection Act, Representative McCloskey stated that alleged harassment \ncan be a threatened personnel action if it ``is discriminatory, or \ncould have a chilling effect on merit system duties and \nresponsibilities.'' Congress specifically included retaliatory \ninvestigations initiated because of protected activity among the \nillustrations for ``threatened personnel actions,'' because they can be \n``preludes or preconditions to'' the entire list of formal personnel \nactions in section 2302(a)(2) of title 5. Jurisdiction to challenge \nretaliatory investigations as threatened personnel actions has been \nupheld repeatedly. The Office of Special Counsel also has used this \nauthority to avoid the need for prolonged, costly litigation while \nemployees are off the job from subsequent termination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will finally pass the \nbipartisan Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010, S. 372. I \nthank Senator Akaka and Senator Collins for their dedication to this \nlegislation and for working with me and Senator Grassley on key changes \nto make the bill even stronger in its protection of whistleblowers. I \nhave worked for years to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, \nwhether by government or corporate employers, and this bill is an \nimportant step forward in that ongoing process.\n  Whistleblowers are instrumental in alerting the public and Congress \nto wrongdoing in Federal agencies. In many cases, their willingness to \nstep forward has resulted in important governmental reform, and has \neven saved lives. Congress must encourage Federal employees with \nreasonable beliefs about government misconduct to report such fraud or \nabuse by offering meaningful protection to those who blow the whistle, \nrather than leaving them vulnerable to reprisals.\n  Unfortunately, whistleblower laws have been weakened by many court \ndecisions that have ignored congressional intent and eroded employee \nprotections. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act will help \nrestore and expand the protections for Federal employees envisioned by \nthe original Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.\n  Key provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act will \noffer additional methods to appeal whistleblower cases and provide \nadditional protections to intelligence community employees and officers \nof the Transportation Security Administration. It will also correct the \nFederal circuit court's repeated misinterpretations of the \nwhistleblower law and suspend that court's sole jurisdiction over \nFederal employee whistleblower cases for 5 years.\n  Whistleblowers have proven to be important catalysts for much needed \ngovernment change over the years. From corporate fraud to governmental \nmisconduct to media integrity, whistleblowers have played an integral \nrole in galvanizing reform. In these difficult financial times, we must \nbe especially vigilant to ensure that public resources are not lost to \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. Restoring credibility to our whistleblower \nlaws is an important part of that work. Before Congress adjourns, I \nhope the House of Representatives will quickly consider this \nlegislation, and send it to the President to be signed into law.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask consent the committee-reported substitute \namendment be considered, the Akaka amendment at the desk be agreed to \nand the committee-reported substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed \nto, and the bill as amended be read a third time and passed, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE.\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to certain covered employees \n     within the Legislative branch.\n       (b) Purpose of regulations. The regulations set forth \n     herein are the substantive regulations that the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance with \n     the rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384). The purpose of subparts B, C and D of \n     these regulations is to define veterans' preference and the \n     administration of veterans' preference as applicable to \n     Federal employment in the Legislative branch. (5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108, as applied by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E \n     of these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws are integrated into the existing \n     employment and retention policies and processes of those \n     employing offices with employees covered by the VEOA, and to \n     provide for transparency in the application of veterans' \n     preference in covered appointment and retention decisions. \n     Provided, nothing in these regulations shall be construed so \n     as to require an employing office to reduce any existing \n     veterans' preference rights and protections that it may \n     afford to preference eligible individuals.\n       H Regs:   (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress within an employing office, as \n     defined by Sec. 101 (9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301 \n     (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (4) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n       S Regs:  (c) Scope of Regulations.

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are \n     ``the same as the most relevant substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory \n     provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and \n     subchapter I of chapter 35, of title 5, United States Code. \n     The regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters \n     for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA requires a \n     regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment based on the information available to it \n     at the time of promulgation of these regulations, that, with \n     the exception of the regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA that need be \n     adopted.\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the\n\n[[Page S8827]]\n\n     same as the most substantive regulations (applicable with \n     respect to the Executive branch)'', section 4(c)(4)(B) of the \n     VEOA authorizes the Board to ``determine, for good cause \n     shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under'' \n     section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist \n     in the employing offices subject to this regulation. \n     Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create \n     detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce \n     that does not exist in the Legislative branch, while \n     providing no VEOA protections to the covered Legislative \n     branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially \n     tailored regulations, rather than simply to adopt those \n     promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate Congress' \n     intent in extending the principles of the veterans' \n     preference laws to the Legislative branch through the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.104. COORDINATION WITH SECTION 225 OF THE \n                   CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.\n\n       Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(C) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of \n     section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule \n     of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws \n     made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and \n     subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be \n     considered to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the \n     Executive branch.\n\n          Subpart B--Veterans' Preference--General Provisions\n\nSec.\n1.105 Responsibility for administration of veterans' preference.\n1.106 Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.105.

Sec. 3309. For example, five \n     preference points shall be granted to preference eligible \n     applicants in a 100-point system, one point shall be granted \n     in a 20-point system, and so on.\n       (b) In all other situations involving appointment to a \n     covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' \n     preference eligibility as an affirmative factor in the \n     employing office's determination of who will be appointed \n     from among qualified applicants.\n\n     SEC. 1.109. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO COVERED \n                   POSITIONS.\n\n       When considering applicants for covered positions in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, employing offices \n     shall provide preference eligible applicants with credit:\n       (a) for time spent in the military service (1) as an \n     extension of time spent in the position in which the \n     applicant was employed immediately before his/her entrance \n     into the military service, or (2) on the basis of actual \n     duties performed in the military service, or (3) as a \n     combination of both methods.

WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN APPOINTMENTS \n                   TO COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Subject to (c) below, in determining qualifications of \n     a preference eligible for appointment, an employing office \n     shall waive:\n       (1) with respect to a preference eligible applicant, \n     requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) with respect to a preference eligible applicant to whom \n     it has made a conditional offer of employment, physical \n     requirements if, in the opinion of the employing office, on \n     the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation \n     of an accredited physician submitted by the preference \n     eligible applicant, the preference eligible applicant is \n     physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position;\n       (b) Subject to (c) below, if an employing office \n     determines, on the basis of evidence before it, including any \n     recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the \n     preference eligible applicant, that an applicant to whom it \n     has made a conditional offer of employment is preference \n     eligible as a disabled veteran as described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108(3)(c) and who has a compensable service-connected \n     disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the \n     physical requirements of the covered position, the employing \n     office shall notify the preference eligible applicant of the \n     reasons for the determination and of the right to respond and \n     to submit additional information to the employing office, \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. The director \n     of the employing office may, by providing written notice to \n     the preference eligible applicant, shorten the period for \n     submitting a response with respect to an appointment to a \n     particular covered position, if necessary because of a need \n     to fill the covered position immediately. Should the \n     preference eligible applicant make a timely response, the \n     highest ranking individual or group of individuals with \n     authority to make employment decisions on behalf of the \n     employing office shall render a final determination of the \n     physical ability of the preference eligible applicant to \n     perform the duties of the position, taking into account the \n     response and any additional information provided by the \n     preference eligible applicant. When the employing office has \n     completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the \n     basis of physical disability, it shall send its findings to \n     the preference eligible applicant.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligations it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n         Subpart D--Veterans' preference in reductions in force\n\nSec.\n1.111.

The \n     minimum competitive area is a department or subdivision of \n     the employing office within the local commuting area.\n       (c) Position classifications or job classifications are \n     determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all \n     covered positions within a competitive area that are in the \n     same grade, occupational level or classification, and which \n     are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay \n     schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working \n     conditions so that an employing office may reassign the \n     incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in \n     the position classification without undue interruption.\n       (d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if\n       (A) his/her retirement was based on disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he/she \n     continued to be so employed without a break in service of \n     more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C Sec. 2108 and section 1.102(o) of these regulations \n     shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in \n     determining an employee's qualifications for retention under \n     section 1.114 of these regulations.\n       H Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis, or (3) attributable to \n     a change in party leadership or majority party status within \n     the House of Congress where the employee is employed.\n       C Reg:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, work generally would \n     not be considered to be unduly interrupted if a covered \n     employee needs more than 90 days after the reduction in force \n     to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-\n     day standard may be extended if placement is made under this \n     part to a program accorded low priority by the employing \n     office, or to a vacant position.\n\n     SEC. 1.112. APPLICATION OF PREFERENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference \n     as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such \n     competing covered employees, regardless of length of service \n     or performance, provided that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable. Provided, a preference eligible employee who is \n     a ``disabled veteran'' under section 1.102(h) above who has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more and whose performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable by an employing office is entitled to be \n     retained in preference to other preference eligible \n     employees. Provided, this section does not relieve an \n     employing office of any greater obligation it may be subject \n     to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(9).\n\n     SEC. 1.113. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       In computing length of service in connection with a \n     reduction in force, the employing office shall provide credit \n     to preference eligible covered employees as follows:\n       (a) a preference eligible covered employee who is not a \n     retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit \n     for the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces;\n       (b) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit for:\n       (1) the length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which \n     a campaign badge has been authorized; or\n       (2) the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces if he is included under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501(a)(3)(A), \n     (B), or (C); and\n       (c) a preference eligible covered employee is entitled to \n     credit for:\n       (1) service rendered as an employee of a county committee \n     established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation \n     and Allotment Act or of a committee or association of \n     producers described in section 10(b) of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act; and\n       (2) service rendered as an employee described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c) if such employee moves or has moved, on or after \n     January 1, 1966, without a break in service of more than 3 \n     days, from a position in a nonappropriated fund \n     instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard, respectively, that is not described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c).\n\n     SEC. 1.114. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN REDUCTIONS IN \n                   FORCE.\n\n       (a) If an employing office determines, on the basis of \n     evidence before it, that a covered employee is preference \n     eligible, the employing office shall waive, in determining \n     the covered employee's retention status in a reduction in \n     force:\n       (1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) physical requirements if, in the opinion of the \n     employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, \n     including any recommendation of an accredited physician \n     submitted by the employee, the preference eligible covered \n     employee is physically able to perform efficiently the duties \n     of the position.\n       (b) If an employing office determines that a covered \n     employee who is a preference eligible as a disabled veteran \n     as described in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3)(c) and has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of the \n     covered position, the employing office shall notify the \n     preference eligible covered employee of the reasons for the \n     determination and of the right to respond and to submit \n     additional information to the employing office within 15 days \n     of the date of the notification. Should the preference \n     eligible covered employee make a timely response, the highest \n     ranking individual or group of individuals with authority to \n     make employment decisions on behalf of the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \n     the preference eligible covered employee to perform the \n     duties of the covered position, taking into account the \n     evidence before it, including the response and any additional \n     information provided by the preference eligible. When the \n     employing office has completed its review of the proposed \n     disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it \n     shall send its findings to the preference eligible covered \n     employee.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligation it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 1.115. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS.\n\n       (a) When a function is transferred from one employing \n     office to another employing office, each covered employee in \n     the affected position classifications or job classifications \n     in the function that is to be transferred shall be \n     transferred to the receiving employing office for employment \n     in a covered position for which he/she is qualified before \n     the receiving employing office may make an appointment from \n     another source to that position.\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\n       (b) When one employing office is replaced by another \n     employing office, each covered employee in the affected \n     position classifications or job classifications in the \n     employing office to be replaced shall be transferred to the \n     replacing employing office for employment in a covered \n     position for which he/she is qualified before the replacing \n     employing office may make an appointment from another source \n     to that position.\n\n Subpart E--Adoption of Veterans' preference policies, recordkeeping & \n                      informational requirements.\n\nSec.\n1.116.

Written notice prior to a reduction in force.\n\n     SEC. 1.116. ADOPTION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICY.\n\n       No later than 120 calendar days following Congressional \n     approval of this regulation, each employing office that \n     employs one or more covered employees or that seeks \n     applicants for a covered position shall adopt its written \n     policy specifying how it has integrated the veterans' \n     preference requirements of the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act of 1998 and these regulations into its \n     employment and retention processes. Upon timely request and \n     the demonstration of good cause, the Executive Director, in \n     his/her discretion, may grant such an employing office \n     additional time for preparing its policy. Each such employing \n     office will make its policies available to applicants for \n     appointment to a covered position and to covered employees in \n     accordance with these regulations. The act of adopting a \n     veterans' preference policy shall not relieve any employing \n     office of any other responsibility or requirement of the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 or these \n     regulations. An employing office may amend or replace its \n     veterans' preference policies as it deems necessary or \n     appropriate, so long as the resulting policies are consistent \n     with the VEOA and these regulations.\n\n     SEC. 1.117. PRESERVATION OF RECORDS MADE OR KEPT.\n\n       An employing office that employs one or more covered \n     employees or that seeks applicants for a covered position \n     shall maintain any records relating to the application of its \n     veterans' preference policy to applicants for covered \n     positions and to workforce adjustment decisions affecting \n     covered employees for a period of at least one year from the \n     date of the making of the record or the date of the personnel \n     action involved or, if later, one year from the date on which \n     the applicant or covered employee is notified of the \n     personnel action. Where a claim has been brought under \n     section 401 of the CAA against an employing office under the \n     VEOA, the respondent employing office shall preserve all \n     personnel records relevant to the claim until final \n     disposition of the claim. The term ``personnel records \n     relevant to the claim'', for example, would include records \n     relating to the veterans' preference determination regarding \n     the person bringing the claim and records relating to any \n     veterans' preference determinations regarding other \n     applicants for the covered position the person sought, or \n     records relating to the veterans' preference determinations \n     regarding other covered employees in the person's position or \n     job classification. The date of final disposition of the \n     charge or the action means the latest of the date of \n     expiration of the statutory period within which the aggrieved \n     person may file a complaint with the Office or in a U.S. \n     District Court or, where an action is brought against an \n     employing office by the aggrieved person, the date on which \n     such litigation is terminated.\n\n     SEC. 1.118. DISSEMINATION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICIES TO \n                   APPLICANTS FOR COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) An employing office shall state in any announcements \n     and advertisements it makes concerning vacancies in covered \n     positions that the staffing action is governed by the VEOA.\n       (b) An employing office shall invite applicants for a \n     covered position to identify themselves as veterans' \n     preference eligible applicants, provided that in doing so:\n       (1) the employing office shall state clearly on any written \n     application or questionnaire used for this purpose or make \n     clear orally, if a written application or questionnaire is \n     not used, that the requested information is intended for use \n     solely in connection with the employing office's obligations \n     and efforts to provide veterans' preference to preference \n     eligible applicants in accordance with the VEOA; and\n       (2) the employing office shall state clearly that disabled \n     veteran status is requested on a voluntary basis, that it \n     will be kept confidential in accordance with the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.

Sec. 2108 or any \n     superseding legislation, providing the actual, current \n     definition in a manner designed to be understood by \n     applicants, along with the statutory citation;\n       (2) the employing office's veterans' preference policy or a \n     summary description of the employing office's veterans' \n     preference policy as it relates to appointments to covered \n     positions, including any procedures the employing office \n     shall use to identify preference eligible employees;\n       (3) the employing office may provide other information to \n     applicants regarding its veterans' preference policies and \n     practices, but is not required to do so by these regulations.\n       (d) Employing offices are also expected to answer questions \n     from applicants for covered positions that are relevant and \n     non-confidential concerning the employing office's veterans' \n     preference policies and practices.\n\n     SEC. 1.119. INFORMATION REGARDING VETERANS' PREFERENCE \n                   DETERMINATIONS IN APPOINTMENTS.\n\n       Upon written request by an applicant for a covered \n     position, the employing office shall promptly provide a \n     written explanation of the manner in which veterans' \n     preference was applied in the employing office's appointment \n     decision regarding that applicant. Such explanation shall \n     include at a minimum:\n       (a) the employing office's veterans' preference policy or a \n     summary description of the employing office's veterans' \n     preference policy as it relates to appointments to covered \n     positions; and\n       (b) a statement as to whether the applicant is preference \n     eligible and, if not, a brief statement of the reasons for \n     the employing office's determination that the applicant is \n     not preference eligible.\n\n     SEC. 1.120. DISSEMINATION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICIES TO \n                   COVERED EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) If an employing office that employs one or more covered \n     employees provides any written guidance to such employees \n     concerning employee rights generally or reductions in force \n     more specifically, such as in a written employee policy, \n     manual or handbook, such guidance must include information \n     concerning veterans' preference under the VEOA, as set forth \n     in subsection (b) of this regulation.\n       (b) Written guidances described in subsection (a) above \n     shall include, at a minimum:\n       (1) the VEOA definition of veterans' ``preference \n     eligible'' as set forth in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108 or any \n     superseding legislation, providing the actual, current \n     definition along with the statutory citation;\n       (2) the employing office's veterans' preference policy or a \n     summary description of the employing office's veterans' \n     preference policy as it relates to reductions in force, \n     including the procedures the employing office shall take to \n     identify preference eligible employees.\n       (3) the employing office may provide other information in \n     its guidances regarding its veterans' preference policies and \n     practices, but is not required to do so by these regulations.\n       (c) Employing offices are also expected to answer questions \n     from covered employees that are relevant and non-confidential \n     concerning the employing office's veterans' preference \n     policies and practices.\n\n     SEC. 1.121.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE.\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to certain covered employees \n     within the Legislative branch.\n       (b) Purpose of regulations. The regulations set forth \n     herein are the substantive regulations that the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance with \n     the rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384). The purpose of subparts B, C and D of \n     these regulations is to define veterans' preference and the \n     administration of veterans' preference as applicable to \n     Federal employment in the Legislative branch. (5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108, as applied by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E \n     of these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws are integrated into the existing \n     employment and retention policies and processes of those \n     employing offices with employees covered by the VEOA, and to \n     provide for transparency in the application of veterans' \n     preference in covered appointment and retention decisions. \n     Provided, nothing in these regulations shall be construed so \n     as to require an employing office to reduce any existing \n     veterans' preference rights and protections that it may \n     afford to preference eligible individuals.\n       H Regs:   (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress within an employing office, as \n     defined by Sec. 101 (9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301 \n     (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (4) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\n     to any employing office that only employs individuals \n     excluded from the definition of covered employee.\n       S Regs:  (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made or directed by a Member of Congress within an employing \n     office, as defined by Sec. 101(9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1301 (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a \n     committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress or a \n     joint committee of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate; (4) who is appointed pursuant to 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 43d(a); or (5) who is appointed to a position, the \n     duties of which are equivalent to those of a Senior Executive \n     Service position (within the meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of \n     title 5, United States Code). Accordingly, these regulations \n     shall not apply to any employing office that only employs \n     individuals excluded from the definition of covered employee.\n       C Reg:  (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress or by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (3) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n\n     SEC. 1.102.

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are \n     ``the same as the most relevant substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory \n     provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and \n     subchapter I of chapter 35, of title 5,\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\n     United States Code. The regulations issued by the Board \n     herein are on all matters for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of the \n     VEOA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is \n     the Board's considered judgment based on the information \n     available to it at the time of promulgation of these \n     regulations, that, with the exception of the regulations \n     adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations (applicable with respect to the \n     Executive branch) promulgated to implement the statutory \n     provisions referred to in paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of \n     the VEOA that need be adopted.\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive \n     branch)'', section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the \n     Board to ``determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under'' section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist \n     in the employing offices subject to this regulation. \n     Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create \n     detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce \n     that does not exist in the Legislative branch, while \n     providing no VEOA protections to the covered Legislative \n     branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially \n     tailored regulations, rather than simply to adopt those \n     promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate Congress' \n     intent in extending the principles of the veterans' \n     preference laws to the Legislative branch through the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.104. COORDINATION WITH SECTION 225 OF THE \n                   CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.\n\n       Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(C) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of \n     section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule \n     of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws \n     made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and \n     subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be \n     considered to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the \n     Executive branch.\n\n          Subpart B--Veterans' Preference--General Provisions\n\nSec.\n1.105 Responsibility for administration of veterans' preference.\n1.106 Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.105.

VETERANS' PREFERENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO \n                   RESTRICTED POSITIONS.\n\n       In each appointment action for the positions of custodian, \n     elevator operator, guard, and messenger (as defined below and \n     collectively referred to in these regulations as restricted \n     covered positions) employing offices shall restrict \n     competition to preference eligible applicants as long as \n     qualified preference eligible applicants are available. The \n     provisions of sections 1.109 and 1.110 below shall apply to \n     the appointment of a preference eligible applicant to a \n     restricted covered position. The provisions of section 1.108 \n     shall apply to the appointment of a preference eligible \n     applicant to a restricted covered position, in the event that \n     there is more than one preference eligible applicant for the \n     position.\n       Custodian--One whose primary duty is the performance of \n     cleaning or other ordinary routine maintenance duties in or \n     about a government building or a building under Federal \n     control, park, monument, or other Federal reservation.\n       Elevator operator--One whose primary duty is the running of \n     freight or passenger elevators.

VETERANS' PREFERENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO NON-\n                   RESTRICTED COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Where an employing office has duly adopted a policy \n     requiring the numerical scoring or rating of applicants for \n     covered positions, the employing office shall add points to \n     the earned ratings of those preference eligible applicants \n     who receive passing scores in an entrance examination, in a \n     manner that is proportionately comparable to the points \n     prescribed in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309. For example, five \n     preference points shall be granted to preference eligible \n     applicants in a 100-point system, one point shall be granted \n     in a 20-point system, and so on.\n       (b) In all other situations involving appointment to a \n     covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' \n     preference eligibility as an affirmative factor in the \n     employing office's determination of who will be appointed \n     from among qualified applicants.\n\n     SEC. 1.109. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO COVERED \n                   POSITIONS.\n\n       When considering applicants for covered positions in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, employing offices \n     shall provide preference eligible applicants with credit:\n       (a) for time spent in the military service (1) as an \n     extension of time spent in the position in which the \n     applicant was employed immediately before his/her entrance \n     into the military service, or (2) on the basis of actual \n     duties performed in the military service, or (3) as a \n     combination of both methods. Employing offices shall credit \n     time spent in the military service according to the method \n     that will be of most benefit to the preference eligible \n     applicant.\n       (b) for all experience material to the position for which \n     the applicant is being considered, including experience \n     gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and \n     organizational activities, regardless of whether he/she \n     received pay therefor.\n\n     SEC. 1.110. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN APPOINTMENTS \n                   TO COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Subject to (c) below, in determining qualifications of \n     a preference eligible for appointment, an employing office \n     shall waive:\n       (1) with respect to a preference eligible applicant, \n     requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) with respect to a preference eligible applicant to whom \n     it has made a conditional offer of employment, physical \n     requirements if, in the opinion of the employing office, on \n     the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation \n     of an accredited physician submitted by the preference \n     eligible applicant, the preference eligible applicant is \n     physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position;\n       (b) Subject to (c) below, if an employing office \n     determines, on the basis of evidence before it, including any \n     recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the \n     preference eligible applicant, that an applicant to whom it \n     has made a conditional offer of employment is preference \n     eligible as a disabled veteran as described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108(3)(c) and who has a compensable service-connected \n     disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the \n     physical requirements of the covered position, the employing \n     office shall notify the preference eligible applicant of the \n     reasons for the determination and of the right to respond and \n     to submit additional information to the employing office, \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. The director \n     of the employing office may, by providing written notice to \n     the preference eligible applicant, shorten the period for \n     submitting a response with respect to an appointment to a \n     particular covered position, if necessary because of a need \n     to fill the covered position immediately. Should the \n     preference eligible applicant make a timely response, the \n     highest ranking individual or group of individuals with \n     authority to make employment decisions on behalf of the \n     employing office shall render a final determination of the \n     physical ability of the preference eligible applicant to \n     perform the duties of the position, taking into account the \n     response and any additional information provided by the \n     preference eligible applicant. When the employing office has\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\n     completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the \n     basis of physical disability, it shall send its findings to \n     the preference eligible applicant.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligations it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n         Subpart D--Veterans' preference in reductions in force\n\nSec.\n1.111.

DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       (a) Competing covered employees are the covered employees \n     within a particular position or job classification, at or \n     within a particular competitive area, as those terms are \n     defined below.\n       (b) Competitive area is that portion of the employing \n     office's organizational structure, as determined by the \n     employing office, in which covered employees compete for \n     retention. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms \n     of the employing office's organizational unit(s) and \n     geographical location, and it must include all employees \n     within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area \n     may consist of all or part of an employing office. The \n     minimum competitive area is a department or subdivision of \n     the employing office within the local commuting area.\n       (c) Position classifications or job classifications are \n     determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all \n     covered positions within a competitive area that are in the \n     same grade, occupational level or classification, and which \n     are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay \n     schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working \n     conditions so that an employing office may reassign the \n     incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in \n     the position classification without undue interruption.\n       (d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if\n       (A) his/her retirement was based on disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he/she \n     continued to be so employed without a break in service of \n     more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C Sec. 2108 and section 1.102(o) of these regulations \n     shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in \n     determining an employee's qualifications for retention under \n     section 1.114 of these regulations.\n       H Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis, or (3) attributable to \n     a change in party leadership or majority party status within \n     the House of Congress where the employee is employed.\n       C Reg:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, work generally would \n     not be considered to be unduly interrupted if a covered \n     employee needs more than 90 days after the reduction in force \n     to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-\n     day standard may be extended if placement is made under this \n     part to a program accorded low priority by the employing \n     office, or to a vacant position.\n\n     SEC. 1.112. APPLICATION OF PREFERENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference \n     as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such \n     competing covered employees, regardless of length of service \n     or performance, provided that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable. Provided, a preference eligible employee who is \n     a ``disabled veteran'' under section 1.102(h) above who has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more and whose performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable by an employing office is entitled to be \n     retained in preference to other preference eligible \n     employees. Provided, this section does not relieve an \n     employing office of any greater obligation it may be subject \n     to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(9).\n\n     SEC. 1.113. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       In computing length of service in connection with a \n     reduction in force, the employing office shall provide credit \n     to preference eligible covered employees as follows:\n       (a) a preference eligible covered employee who is not a \n     retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit \n     for the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces;\n       (b) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit for:\n       (1) the length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which \n     a campaign badge has been authorized; or\n       (2) the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces if he is included under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501(a)(3)(A), \n     (B), or (C); and\n       (c) a preference eligible covered employee is entitled to \n     credit for:\n       (1) service rendered as an employee of a county committee \n     established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation \n     and Allotment Act or of a committee or association of \n     producers described in section 10(b) of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act; and\n       (2) service rendered as an employee described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c) if such employee moves or has moved, on or after \n     January 1, 1966, without a break in service of more than 3 \n     days, from a position in a nonappropriated fund \n     instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard, respectively, that is not described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c).\n\n     SEC. 1.114. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN REDUCTIONS IN \n                   FORCE.\n\n       (a) If an employing office determines, on the basis of \n     evidence before it, that a covered employee is preference \n     eligible, the employing office shall waive, in determining \n     the covered employee's retention status in a reduction in \n     force:\n       (1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) physical requirements if, in the opinion of the \n     employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, \n     including any recommendation of an accredited physician \n     submitted by the employee, the preference eligible covered \n     employee is physically able to perform efficiently the duties \n     of the position.\n       (b) If an employing office determines that a covered \n     employee who is a preference eligible as a disabled veteran \n     as described in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3)(c) and has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of the \n     covered position, the employing office shall notify the \n     preference eligible covered employee of the reasons for the \n     determination and of the right to respond and to submit \n     additional information to the employing office within 15 days \n     of the date of the notification. Should the preference \n     eligible covered employee make a timely response, the highest \n     ranking individual or group of individuals with authority to \n     make employment decisions on behalf of the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \n     the preference eligible covered employee to perform the \n     duties of the covered position, taking into account the \n     evidence before it, including the response and any additional \n     information provided by the preference eligible. When the \n     employing office has completed its review of the proposed \n     disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it \n     shall send\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\n     its findings to the preference eligible covered employee.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligation it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 1.115. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS.\n\n       (a) When a function is transferred from one employing \n     office to another employing office, each covered employee in \n     the affected position classifications or job classifications \n     in the function that is to be transferred shall be \n     transferred to the receiving employing office for employment \n     in a covered position for which he/she is qualified before \n     the receiving employing office may make an appointment from \n     another source to that position.\n       (b) When one employing office is replaced by another \n     employing office, each covered employee in the affected \n     position classifications or job classifications in the \n     employing office to be replaced shall be transferred to the \n     replacing employing office for employment in a covered \n     position for which he/she is qualified before the replacing \n     employing office may make an appointment from another source \n     to that position.\n\n Subpart E--Adoption of Veterans' preference policies, recordkeeping & \n                      informational requirements.\n\nSec.\n1.116.

ADOPTION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICY.\n\n       No later than 120 calendar days following Congressional \n     approval of this regulation, each employing office that \n     employs one or more covered employees or that seeks \n     applicants for a covered position shall adopt its written \n     policy specifying how it has integrated the veterans' \n     preference requirements of the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act of 1998 and these regulations into its \n     employment and retention processes. Upon timely request and \n     the demonstration of good cause, the Executive Director, in \n     his/her discretion, may grant such an employing office \n     additional time for preparing its policy. Each such employing \n     office will make its policies available to applicants for \n     appointment to a covered position and to covered employees in \n     accordance with these regulations. The act of adopting a \n     veterans' preference policy shall not relieve any employing \n     office of any other responsibility or requirement of the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 or these \n     regulations. An employing office may amend or replace its \n     veterans' preference policies as it deems necessary or \n     appropriate, so long as the resulting policies are consistent \n     with the VEOA and these regulations.\n\n     SEC. 1.117. PRESERVATION OF RECORDS MADE OR KEPT.\n\n       An employing office that employs one or more covered \n     employees or that seeks applicants for a covered position \n     shall maintain any records relating to the application of its \n     veterans' preference policy to applicants for covered \n     positions and to workforce adjustment decisions affecting \n     covered employees for a period of at least one year from the \n     date of the making of the record or the date of the personnel \n     action involved or, if later, one year from the date on which \n     the applicant or covered employee is notified of the \n     personnel action. Where a claim has been brought under \n     section 401 of the CAA against an employing office under the \n     VEOA, the respondent employing office shall preserve all \n     personnel records relevant to the claim until final \n     disposition of the claim. The term ``personnel records \n     relevant to the claim'', for example, would include records \n     relating to the veterans' preference determination regarding \n     the person bringing the claim and records relating to any \n     veterans' preference determinations regarding other \n     applicants for the covered position the person sought, or \n     records relating to the veterans' preference determinations \n     regarding other covered employees in the person's position or \n     job classification. The date of final disposition of the \n     charge or the action means the latest of the date of \n     expiration of the statutory period within which the aggrieved \n     person may file a complaint with the Office or in a U.S. \n     District Court or, where an action is brought against an \n     employing office by the aggrieved person, the date on which \n     such litigation is terminated.\n\n     SEC. 1.118. DISSEMINATION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICIES TO \n                   APPLICANTS FOR COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) An employing office shall state in any announcements \n     and advertisements it makes concerning vacancies in covered \n     positions that the staffing action is governed by the VEOA.\n       (b) An employing office shall invite applicants for a \n     covered position to identify themselves as veterans' \n     preference eligible applicants, provided that in doing so:\n       (1) the employing office shall state clearly on any written \n     application or questionnaire used for this purpose or make \n     clear orally, if a written application or questionnaire is \n     not used, that the requested information is intended for use \n     solely in connection with the employing office's obligations \n     and efforts to provide veterans' preference to preference \n     eligible applicants in accordance with the VEOA; and\n       (2) the employing office shall state clearly that disabled \n     veteran status is requested on a voluntary basis, that it \n     will be kept confidential in accordance with the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.
