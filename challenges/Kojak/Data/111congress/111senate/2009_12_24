Under the previous order, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of H.R. 3590 which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3590) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the case \n     of members of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal \n     employees, and for other purposes.\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first let me take a minute to express my \nappreciation on behalf of the entire Senate to a number of people, not \nthe least of which is ADM Barry Black who every morning leads this \ninstitution in prayer. His prayers are meaningful. They are beautiful. \nHe is a brilliant man and adds so much to the Senate family.\n  I wish to offer my appreciation to the Parliamentarians who have been \nthrough a very intense, difficult decisionmaking time the last several \nmonths. Alan Frumin, Elizabeth MacDonough, Peter Robinson, and Leigh \nHildebrand, we all appreciate you very much.\n  To the journal clerks led by Scott Sanborn, we appreciate your work. \nThe legislative clerk, Kathie Alvarez, and all of her assistants; very \ndifficult, tense times, and we appreciate what you do for us every day.\n  I also wish to express my appreciation to the court reporters, the \ndoorkeepers, and the Sergeant at Arms. Chief Gainer is a good person. \nHe does a wonderful job with the many responsibilities he has. But I do \nsay this--and there is a lot of personal pride in this--as good as he \nis, he is better as a result of one of my former staffers, Drew \nWillison, who we all know is the Assistant Sergeant at Arms and does a \nremarkable job at protecting this institution.\n  Nancy Erickson, a wonderful person, is the Secretary of the Senate. \nShe is someone I have great admiration and respect for. But again, with \nsome personal pride, I suggest that one reason she has done such a good \njob is because of her assistant, the Assistant Secretary of the Senate, \nSheila Dwyer, who again is one of my proteges.\n  I say with pride the tremendous, terrific, powerful work that has \nbeen done by Lula Davis, the Secretary of the Majority. There have \nbeen, as with all of us, a lot of difficult times, and she has held up \nremarkably well, giving me and the entire Senate the information they \nask for constantly. She is assisted by Tim Mitchell. Of course, this \nplace would not run as well without her working with the Secretary of \nthe Minority, David Schiappa and his entire crew. They are wonderful \npeople to work with. Even though sometimes this place becomes very \npartisan, the work done by Lula Davis and David Schiappa is never \npartisan as it appears to the American public.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wish to say a word about the people who \nwork in the cloakrooms. They are the people who are unseen but \ninstrumental to the operation of the Senate. I say finally, but I have \nto say with a lot of pride, having been one of them, how much I \nappreciate and acknowledge the attention and the protection of the \nCapitol Police. They are throughout this building. Some are in uniform, \nsome aren't. But with all of the evil in the world, they have a very \ndifficult job and they do extremely well.\n  Mr. President, we are happy to see the Vice President of the United \nStates here in his capacity as President of the U.S. Senate. For 36 \nyears you have graced these halls with your brilliance and I think it \nis fair to say that we miss you very much, but we are glad you are \nwhere you are.\n  Mr. President, following any leader remarks, the time until we finish \nour remarks will be divided between my counterpart and my friend from \nKentucky, the senior Senator from Kentucky, and after we complete our \nremarks, we will proceed to a series of two rollcall votes in relation \nto the following items: passage of H.R. 3590, the health care reform \nlegislation; and passage of H.R. 4314, an act to permit continued \nfinancing of government operations.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nentirely appropriate remarks the majority leader has made about all of \nthe people who work here at the Capitol at this difficult and intense \ntime that we have been through. We thank you very much for your \noutstanding service.\n  It is early and I will be brief. The most obvious problem with the \nbill before us is that it doesn't do what it was supposed to do. The \none test for any bill is whether it will lower costs. This bill fails \nthat test. It is also clear that even many of the people on this side \nwho are going to support this bill don't like it; otherwise, the \nDemocratic leaders wouldn't have had such a tough time rounding up the \nvotes; otherwise, Democratic leaders would not have had to have votes \nin the middle of the night or at the crack of dawn or over the weekend \nor even during a blizzard; otherwise, they wouldn't be rushing it \nthrough Congress on Christmas Eve, the first time this body has had a \nvote the day before Christmas in more than a century.\n  This debate was supposed to produce a bill that reformed health care \nin America. Instead, we are left with party-line votes in the middle of \nthe night, a couple of sweetheart deals to get it over the finish line, \nand a truly outraged public. A problem they were told would be fixed \nwasn't. I guarantee you that the people who voted for this bill are \ngoing to get an earful when they finally get home for the first time \nsince Thanksgiving. They know there is widespread opposition to this \nmonstrosity.\n  I want to assure you, Mr. President, this fight isn't over. In fact, \nthis fight is long from over. My colleagues and I will work to stop \nthis bill from becoming law. That is the clear will of the American \npeople and we are going to continue to fight on their behalf.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, like so many endeavors that have benefited \nso many Americans, making health insurance more affordable and health \ninsurance companies more accountable is a process. It is one that has \nrequired us to find common ground, as we should. That is why we have a \npiece of legislation that over the next decade will reduce the deficit \nby $132 billion and, over the next decade, as much as $1.3 trillion.\n  Everyone knows we have had votes in the middle of the night and on \nChristmas Eve because the Republicans wouldn't allow us to have votes \nat any other hour. It is true when we go home we are going to hear an \nearful. I am going to hear an earful I bet from young Caleb, a boy who \nwas born with legs that stopped here, right above his knees, who has \nneeded a set of new prosthetic devices because the rest of his body is \ngrowing, but the insurance company says no because he had a preexisting \ndisability. I will get an earful from Caleb and especially his \nparents--an earful of joy and happiness. Because, you see, from this \nday forward, insurance companies will not be able to deny coverage \nbecause of a preexisting disability. For people such as Caleb and \nparents who have children with diabetes and other problems, it is over. \nSo, yes, we will hear an earful, but it is going to be an earful of \nwonderment and happiness that people have waited for for a long time.\n  This morning is not the end of the process. It is merely the \nbeginning. We will continue to build on this success to improve our \nhealth system even more and to further ease the terrible burdens on \nAmerican families and businesses.\n  But that process cannot begin unless we start today. The American \npeople and the American economy cannot afford for us to wait for the \nnext time because, you see, there may not be a next time.\n  Nearly 65 years ago, Harry Truman condemned a system that condemns \nits citizens to the devastating economic side effects of sickness. \nNearly 65 years later, we still suffer from the same. Just months after \nWorld War II came to a close, President Harry S. Truman wrote in a \nletter to Congress to this body:\n\n       We should resolve now that the health of this Nation is a \n     national concern; that financial barriers in the way of \n     attaining health\n\n[[Page S13891]]\n\n     shall be removed; that the health of all of its citizens \n     deserves the help of all the Nation.\n\n  Decades have passed and these financial barriers have grown taller, \nbut we will never solve the problem unless we find the resolve which we \nhaven't found until today.\n  This is how long we have waited. Think of those who were 1 year old \nin 1945, the day Truman issued his call to this body for action, of \nthose--and there are many, far too many--who have lived their entire \nlives without the ability to afford any type of health care--any type \nof health care. Coverage got more and more expensive each year. \nInsurance companies found more and more excuses to leave them out in \nthe cold. For those who worked in a small business or owned one or \nmoved from job to job, the peace of mind health care can provide was \nmerely a dream.\n  Today, on the verge of the year 2010, those Americans are finally \njust months away from qualifying for Medicare. That is a long time for \na citizen to wait for health care in the greatest and richest Nation \nthe world has ever known. How much longer? How much longer can we \nafford to put this off or ask the uninsured for their patience? Until \nhealth care costs consume not just a sixth of our economy, but a third, \nor a half? Until premiums consume more than half of a family's income?\n  We certainly don't have the luxury of waiting until America becomes \nthe only developed Nation on Earth where you can die for lack of health \ninsurance. We already bear that blemish. That is why we are bringing \nsecurity and stability to millions who have health insurance and \nbringing health insurance to millions who have none.\n  What we will do is ensure consumers have more choices and insurance \ncompanies face more competition.\n  We will stand up to those greedy insurance companies that deny health \ncare to the sick and drive millions into bankruptcy, foreclosure, and \nsometimes even worse.\n  We will add years to the life of Medicare, which will add years to \nthe life of our seniors.\n  We will trade a system that demands you pay more and get less for one \nin which you will pay less and get more.\n  As we do all this, we will slash our children's deficit in dramatic \nfashion. We may not completely cure this crisis today or tomorrow, but \nwe must start toward that end. We must strive for progress and not \nsurrender for want of purity. Our charge is to move forward. This is a \ntradition as old as this Republic, one that has always comprised \ninterests and opinions as diverse as the people who populate it. Our \nFounding Fathers did not promise to form an infallible new Nation; they \npromised instead to promote the general welfare as we move toward a \nmore perfect Union. They valued progress.\n  Our Nation's earliest leaders promised not absolute happiness but \nonly the pursuit of that goal. They valued opportunity. Similar to \nother new programs that improve the lives of many and were since \nstrengthened to improve even more--programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security--progress and opportunity are what this historic \nbill represents.\n  To those who so admirably care so much for their fellow man that they \ndemand more, I say: This is just the beginning. With Senator Ted \nKennedy's voice booming in our ears--with his passion in our hearts--we \nsay as he said: The work goes on, the cause endures.\n  Opponents of this bill have used every trick in the book to delay \nthis day, this moment. Yet here we are, minutes away from doing what \nmany have tried but none have ever achieved.\n  We are here because facts will always defeat fear. Although one might \nslow the progress, they can't stop it, and although one might slow the \nspeed of progress, its force cannot be stopped.\n  I am sorry to say that, for the first time in American history, a \npolitical party has chosen to stand on the sidelines rather than \nparticipate in great--and greatly needed--social change.\n  I am sorry to see that many on the other side have resorted to myths \nand misinformation and continue to rely on them long after they were \ndebunked.\n  It is regrettable they view our citizens' health care crisis through \na political lens, because affording to live a healthy life isn't about \npolitics or partisanship or polling.\n  It is about people. It is about life and death in America. It is a \nquestion of morality, of right and wrong. It is about human suffering. \nGiven the chance to relieve this suffering, we must take this chance \nand deliver on a promise the American people have deserved for six and \na half decades.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read the \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 396 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Bunning\n       \n  The bill (H.R. 3590), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3590\n\n       In the Senate of the United States, December 24, 2009.\n           Resolved, That the bill from the House of \n     Representatives (H.R. 3590) entitled ``An Act to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the first-time \n     homebuyers credit in the case of members of the Armed Forces \n     and certain other Federal employees, and for other \n     purposes.'', do pass with the following amendments:\nStrike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Essential Health Benefits Package.--In this title, the \n     term ``essential health benefits package'' means, with \n     respect to any health plan, coverage that--\n       (1) provides for the essential health benefits defined by \n     the Secretary under subsection (b);\n       (2) limits cost-sharing for such coverage in accordance \n     with subsection (c); and\n       (3) subject to subsection (e), provides either the bronze, \n     silver, gold, or platinum level of coverage described in \n     subsection (d).\n       (b) Essential Health Benefits.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     shall define the essential health benefits, except that such \n     benefits shall include at least the following general \n     categories and the items and services covered within the \n     categories:\n       (A) Ambulatory patient services.\n       (B) Emergency services.\n       (C) Hospitalization.\n       (D) Maternity and newborn care.\n       (E) Mental health and substance use disorder services, \n     including behavioral health treatment.\n       (F) Prescription drugs.\n       (G) Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices.\n\n[[Page S13905]]\n\n       (H) Laboratory services.\n       (I) Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease \n     management.\n       (J) Pediatric services, including oral and vision care.\n       (2) Limitation.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall ensure that the scope \n     of the essential health benefits under paragraph (1) is equal \n     to the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer \n     plan, as determined by the Secretary. To inform this \n     determination, the Secretary of Labor shall conduct a survey \n     of employer-sponsored coverage to determine the benefits \n     typically covered by employers, including multiemployer \n     plans, and provide a report on such survey to the Secretary.\n       (B) Certification.--In defining the essential health \n     benefits described in paragraph (1), and in revising the \n     benefits under paragraph (4)(H), the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to the appropriate committees of Congress containing a \n     certification from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services that such essential health \n     benefits meet the limitation described in paragraph (2).\n       (3) Notice and hearing.--In defining the essential health \n     benefits described in paragraph (1), and in revising the \n     benefits under paragraph (4)(H), the Secretary shall provide \n     notice and an opportunity for public comment.\n       (4) Required elements for consideration.--In defining the \n     essential health benefits under paragraph (1), the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (A) ensure that such essential health benefits reflect an \n     appropriate balance among the categories described in such \n     subsection, so that benefits are not unduly weighted toward \n     any category;\n       (B) not make coverage decisions, determine reimbursement \n     rates, establish incentive programs, or design benefits in \n     ways that discriminate against individuals because of their \n     age, disability, or expected length of life;\n       (C) take into account the health care needs of diverse \n     segments of the population, including women, children, \n     persons with disabilities, and other groups;\n       (D) ensure that health benefits established as essential \n     not be subject to denial to individuals against their wishes \n     on the basis of the individuals' age or expected length of \n     life or of the individuals' present or predicted disability, \n     degree of medical dependency, or quality of life;\n       (E) provide that a qualified health plan shall not be \n     treated as providing coverage for the essential health \n     benefits described in paragraph (1) unless the plan provides \n     that--\n       (i) coverage for emergency department services will be \n     provided without imposing any requirement under the plan for \n     prior authorization of services or any limitation on coverage \n     where the provider of services does not have a contractual \n     relationship with the plan for the providing of services that \n     is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that \n     apply to emergency department services received from \n     providers who do have such a contractual relationship with \n     the plan; and\n       (ii) if such services are provided out-of-network, the \n     cost-sharing requirement (expressed as a copayment amount or \n     coinsurance rate) is the same requirement that would apply if \n     such services were provided in-network;\n       (F) provide that if a plan described in section \n     1311(b)(2)(B)(ii) (relating to stand-alone dental benefits \n     plans) is offered through an Exchange, another health plan \n     offered through such Exchange shall not fail to be treated as \n     a qualified health plan solely because the plan does not \n     offer coverage of benefits offered through the stand-alone \n     plan that are otherwise required under paragraph (1)(J); and\n       (G) periodically review the essential health benefits under \n     paragraph (1), and provide a report to Congress and the \n     public that contains--\n       (i) an assessment of whether enrollees are facing any \n     difficulty accessing needed services for reasons of coverage \n     or cost;\n       (ii) an assessment of whether the essential health benefits \n     needs to be modified or updated to account for changes in \n     medical evidence or scientific advancement;\n       (iii) information on how the essential health benefits will \n     be modified to address any such gaps in access or changes in \n     the evidence base;\n       (iv) an assessment of the potential of additional or \n     expanded benefits to increase costs and the interactions \n     between the addition or expansion of benefits and reductions \n     in existing benefits to meet actuarial limitations described \n     in paragraph (2);

and\n       (ii) in the case of other coverage, twice the amount in \n     effect under clause (i).\n\n     If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a \n     multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next \n     lowest multiple of $50.\n       (2) Annual limitation on deductibles for employer-sponsored \n     plans.--\n       (A) In general.--In the case of a health plan offered in \n     the small group market, the deductible under the plan shall \n     not exceed--\n       (i) $2,000 in the case of a plan covering a single \n     individual; and\n       (ii) $4,000 in the case of any other plan.\n\n     The amounts under clauses (i) and (ii) may be increased by \n     the maximum amount of reimbursement which is reasonably \n     available to a participant under a flexible spending \n     arrangement described in section 106(c)(2) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (determined without regard to any salary \n     reduction arrangement).\n       (B) Indexing of limits.--In the case of any plan year \n     beginning in a calendar year after 2014--\n       (i) the dollar amount under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be \n     increased by an amount equal to the product of that amount \n     and the premium adjustment percentage under paragraph (4) for \n     the calendar year; and\n       (ii) the dollar amount under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be \n     increased to an amount equal to twice the amount in effect \n     under subparagraph (A)(i) for plan years beginning in the \n     calendar year, determined after application of clause (i).\n\n     If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a \n     multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next \n     lowest multiple of $50.\n       (C) Actuarial value.--The limitation under this paragraph \n     shall be applied in such a manner so as to not affect the \n     actuarial value of any health plan, including a plan in the \n     bronze level.\n       (D) Coordination with preventive limits.--Nothing in this \n     paragraph shall be construed to allow a plan to have a \n     deductible under the plan apply to benefits described in \n     section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act.\n       (3) Cost-sharing.--In this title--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``cost-sharing'' includes--\n       (i) deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or similar \n     charges;

Private health insurance spending is projected to be \n     $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, \n     drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. \n     Since most health insurance is sold by national or regional \n     health insurance companies, health insurance is sold in \n     interstate commerce and claims payments flow through \n     interstate commerce.\n       (C) The requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     this Act, will add millions of new consumers to the health \n     insurance market, increasing the supply of, and demand for, \n     health care services. According to the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the requirement will increase the number and share of \n     Americans who are insured.\n       (D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by \n     building upon and strengthening the private employer-based \n     health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans \n     nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar requirement has \n     strengthened private employer-based coverage: despite the \n     economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-\n     based coverage has actually increased.\n       (E) Half of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by \n     medical expenses. By significantly increasing health \n     insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other \n     provisions of this Act, will improve financial security for \n     families.\n       (F) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government \n     has a significant role in regulating health insurance which \n     is in interstate commerce.\n       (G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there \n     were no requirement, many individuals would wait to purchase \n     health insurance until they needed care. By significantly \n     increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, \n     together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize \n     this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk \n     pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health \n     insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating \n     effective health insurance markets in which improved health \n     insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not \n     exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.\n       (H) Administrative costs for private health insurance, \n     which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of \n     premiums in the current individual and small group markets. \n     By significantly increasing health insurance coverage and the \n     size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of \n     scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and \n     lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential \n     to creating effective health insurance markets that do not \n     require underwriting and eliminate its associated \n     administrative costs.\n       (3) Supreme court ruling.--In United States v. South-\n     Eastern Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the \n     Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance is \n     interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation.\n       (b) In General.--Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     chapter:\n\n        ``CHAPTER 48--MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE\n\n``Sec. 5000A.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LONG-TERM CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly 2 decades have passed since Congress seriously \n     considered long-term care reform. The United States \n     Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, also know \n     as the ``Pepper Commission'', released its ``Call for \n     Action'' blueprint for health reform in September 1990. In \n     the 20 years since those recommendations were made, Congress \n     has never acted on the report.\n       (2) In 1999, under the United States Supreme Court's \n     decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), \n     individuals with disabilities have the right to choose to \n     receive their long-term services and supports in the \n     community, rather than in an institutional setting.\n       (3) Despite the Pepper Commission and Olmstead decision, \n     the long-term care provided to our Nation's elderly and \n     disabled has not improved. In fact, for many, it has gotten \n     far worse.\n       (4) In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term care spending \n     for elderly individuals and adults with physical disabilities \n     paid for institutional services. Only 6 states spent 50 \n     percent or more of their Medicaid long-term care dollars on \n     home and community-based services for elderly individuals and \n     adults with physical disabilities while \\1/2\\ of the States \n     spent less than 25 percent. This disparity continues even \n     though, on average, it is estimated that Medicaid dollars can \n     support nearly 3 elderly individuals and adults with physical \n     disabilities in home and community-based services for every \n     individual in a nursing home. Although every State has chosen \n     to provide certain services under home and community-based \n     waivers, these services are unevenly available within and \n     across States, and reach a small percentage of eligible \n     individuals.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) during the 111th session of Congress, Congress should \n     address long-term services and supports in a comprehensive \n     way that guarantees elderly and disabled individuals the care \n     they need; and\n       (2) long term services and supports should be made \n     available in the community in addition to in institutions.\n\n            Subtitle F--Medicaid Prescription Drug Coverage\n\n     SEC. 2501.

for American workers \n     and families, including the affordability tax credit and the \n     small business tax credit.\n       (f) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) \n

AMENDMENTS TO SUBTITLE F.\n\n       (a) Section 1501(a)(2) of this Act is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) Effects on the national economy and interstate \n     commerce.--The effects described in this paragraph are the \n     following:\n       ``(A) The requirement regulates activity that is commercial \n     and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions \n     about how and when health care is paid for, and when health \n     insurance is purchased. In the absence of the requirement, \n     some individuals would make an economic and financial \n     decision to forego health insurance coverage and attempt to \n     self-insure, which increases financial risks to households \n     and medical providers.\n       ``(B) Health insurance and health care services are a \n     significant part of the national economy. National health \n     spending is projected to increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or \n     17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in \n     2019. Private health insurance spending is projected to be \n     $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, \n     drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. \n     Since most health insurance is sold by national or regional \n     health insurance companies, health insurance is sold in \n     interstate commerce and claims payments flow through \n     interstate commerce.\n       ``(C) The requirement, together with the other provisions \n     of this Act, will add millions of new consumers to the health \n     insurance market, increasing the supply of, and demand for, \n     health care services, and will increase the number and share \n     of Americans who are insured.\n       ``(D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by \n     building upon and strengthening the private employer-based \n     health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans \n     nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar requirement has \n     strengthened private employer-based coverage: despite the \n     economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-\n     based coverage has actually increased.\n       ``(E) The economy loses up to $207,000,000,000 a year \n     because of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the \n     uninsured. By significantly reducing the number of the \n     uninsured, the requirement, together with the other \n     provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce this \n     economic cost.\n       ``(F) The cost of providing uncompensated care to the \n     uninsured was $43,000,000,000 in 2008. To pay for this cost, \n     health care providers pass on the cost to private insurers, \n     which pass on the cost to families. This cost-shifting \n     increases family premiums by on average over $1,000 a year. \n     By significantly reducing the number of the uninsured, the \n     requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, \n     will lower health insurance premiums.\n       ``(G) 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused in \n     part by medical expenses. By significantly increasing health \n     insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other \n     provisions of this Act, will improve financial security for \n     families.\n       ``(H) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government \n     has a significant role in regulating health insurance. The \n     requirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of \n     economic activity, and the absence of the requirement would \n     undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market.\n       ``(I) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there \n     were no requirement, many individuals would wait to purchase \n     health insurance until they needed care. By significantly \n     increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, \n     together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize \n     this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk \n     pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health \n     insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating \n     effective health insurance markets in which improved health \n     insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not \n     exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.\n       ``(J) Administrative costs for private health insurance, \n     which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of \n     premiums in the current individual and small group markets. \n     By significantly increasing health insurance coverage and the \n     size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of \n     scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and \n     lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential \n     to creating effective health insurance markets that do not \n     require underwriting and eliminate its associated \n     administrative costs.''.\n       (b)(1) Section 5000A(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986, as added by section 1501(b) of this Act, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) In general.--If a taxpayer who is an

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper \narticles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Flawed Aid for Long-Term Care--A Piece of Health Reform With Too Much \n                             Financial Risk\n\n       An estimated 10 million elderly and disabled Americans need \n     some sort of long-term care and help with the tasks of daily \n     living. That number will grow as America ages. But the only \n     federal program that pays for such services is Medicaid: \n     Individuals who need long-term care have to spend down their \n     assets to become poor enough to qualify. So does it make \n     sense to establish a federal program under which people could \n     buy long-term care insurance? Does it make sense to do this \n     within the context of health reform? The House and Senate \n     proposals contain such a program. We are sympathetic to the \n     need but have doubts about its advisability.\n       The program, known as the Community Living Assistance \n     Services and Supports ((CLASS) Act, would be an innovative, \n     voluntary insurance program run by the federal government. \n     Employers could choose to have workers automatically enrolled \n     unless they opt out, and premiums would be deducted from \n     their paychecks. After paying in for five years, they would \n     be entitled, if they become disabled, to a cash benefit--at \n     least $50 a day--to pay for the non-medical services they \n     need to remain at home rather than going to a nursing home. \n     The premiums and benefits are required to be set at a level \n     that will ensure the program is actuarially sound for 75 \n     years.\n       Sounds good, yet there are serious concerns about whether \n     the program will work--or whether, because of low \n     participation rates that would leave it mostly enrolling \n     sicker people, it will end up having to set premiums so high \n     or offer benefits so skimpy that lawmakers will be moved to \n     bail it out. The Obama administration says not. ``We're \n     entirely persuaded that reasonable premiums, solid \n     participation rates and financial solvency over the 75-year \n     period can be maintained.'' Richard Frank, deputy assistant \n     secretary for the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term \n     Care Policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     told a Kaiser Family Foundation conference.\n       But both the Congressional Budget Office and the chief \n     actuary for the Medicare program have expressed misgivings. \n     The Medicare actuary, Richard S. Foster, cited ``a very \n     serious risk'': Adverse selection--sicker people signing up \n     for the program and the healthier staying away--``would make \n     the CLASS program unsustainable.'' He said that even \n     beginning premiums would have to be $240 a month. Likewise, \n     CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf warned that ``the CLASS \n     program could be subject to considerable financial risk in \n     the future if it were unable to attract a sufficiently \n     healthy group of enrollees.''\n       There are already enough risks and uncertainties in health \n     reform. Long-term care is an important topic, but it is one \n     that deserves more careful scrutiny than has taken place in \n     the context of the broader health-reform debate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 23, 2009]\n\n                        Yes, It's All About Him\n\n                           (Robert Samuelson)\n\n       Barack Obama's quest for historic health-care legislation \n     has turned into a parody of leadership. We usually associate \n     presidential leadership with the pursuit of goals that, \n     though initially unpopular, serve America's long-term \n     interests. Obama has reversed this. He's championing \n     increasingly unpopular legislation that threatens the \n     country's long-term interests. ``This isn't about me,'' he \n     likes to say, ``I have great health insurance.'' But of \n     course, it is about him: about the legacy he covets as the \n     president who achieved ``universal'' health insurance. He'll \n     be disappointed.\n       Even if Congress passes legislation--a good bet--the \n     finished product will fall far short of Obama's extravagant \n     promises. It will not cover everyone. It will not control \n     costs. It will worsen the budget outlook. It will lead to \n     higher taxes. It will disrupt how, or whether, companies \n     provide insurance for their workers. As the real-life (as \n     opposed to rhetorical) consequences unfold, they will rebut \n     Obama's claim that he has ``solved'' the health-care problem. \n     His reputation will suffer.\n       It already has. Despite Obama's eloquence and command of \n     the airwaves, public suspicions are rising. In April, 57 \n     percent of Americans approved his ``handling of health care'' \n     and 29 percent disapproved, reports the Post-ABC News poll; \n     in the latest survey, 44 percent approved and 53 percent \n     disapproved. About half worried that their care would \n     deteriorate and that health costs would rise.\n       These fears are well-grounded. The various health-care \n     proposals represent atrocious legislation. To be sure, they \n     would provide insurance to 30 million or more Americans by \n     2019. People would enjoy more security. But even these gains \n     must be qualified. Some of the newly insured will get \n     healthier, but how many and by how much is unclear. The \n     uninsured now receive 50 to 70 percent as much care as the \n     insured. The administration argues that today's system has \n     massive waste. If so, greater participation in the waste by \n     the newly insured may not make them much better off.\n       The remaining uninsured may also exceed estimates. Under \n     the Senate bill, they would total 24 million in 2019, reckons \n     Richard Foster, chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services. But a wild card is immigration. From 1999 \n     to 2008, about 60 percent of the increase in the uninsured \n     occurred among Hispanics. That was related to immigrants and \n     their children (many American-born). Most illegal immigrants \n     aren't covered by Obama's proposal. If we don't curb \n     immigration of the poor and unskilled--people who can't \n     afford insurance--Obama's program will be less effective and \n     more expensive than estimated. Hardly anyone mentions \n     immigrants' impact, because it seems insensitive.\n       Meanwhile, the health-care proposals would impose \n     substantial costs. Remember: The country already faces huge \n     increases in federal spending and taxes or deficits because \n     an aging population will receive more Social Security and \n     Medicare. Projections the Congressional Budget Office made in \n     2007 suggested that federal spending might rise almost 50 \n     percent by 2030 as a share of the economy (gross domestic \n     product). Since that estimate, the recession and massive \n     deficits have further bloated the national debt.\n       Obama's plan might add almost an additional $1 trillion in \n     spending over a decade--and more later. Even if this is fully \n     covered, as Obama contends, by higher taxes and cuts in \n     Medicare reimbursements, this revenue could have been used to \n     cut the existing deficits. But the odds are that the new \n     spending isn't fully covered, because Congress might reverse \n     some Medicare reductions before they take effect. Projected \n     savings seem ``unrealistic'' says Foster. Similarly, the \n     legislation creates a voluntary long-term care\n\n[[Page S14125]]\n\n     insurance program that's supposedly paid by private premiums. \n     Foster suspects it's ``unsustainable,'' suggesting a need for \n     big federal subsidies.\n       Obama's overhaul would also change how private firms insure \n     workers. Perhaps 18 million workers could lose coverage and \n     16 million gain it, as companies adapt to new regulations and \n     subsidies, estimates the Levin Group, a consulting firm. \n     Private insurers argue that premiums in the individual and \n     small-group markets, where many workers would end up, might \n     rise an extra 25 to 50 percent over a decade. The \n     administration and the CBO disagree. The dispute underlines \n     the bills' immense uncertainties. As for cost control, even \n     generous estimates have health spending growing faster than \n     the economy. Changing that is the first imperative of \n     sensible policy.\n       So Obama's plan amounts to this: partial coverage of the \n     uninsured; modest improvements (possibly) in their health; \n     sizable budgetary costs worsening a bleak outlook; \n     significant, unpredictable changes in insurance markets; weak \n     spending control. This is a bad bargain. Health benefits are \n     overstated, long-term economic costs understated. The country \n     would be the worse for this legislation's passage. What it's \n     become is an exercise in political symbolism: Obama's self-\n     indulgent crusade to seize the liberal holy grail of \n     ``universal coverage.'' What it's not is leadership.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I really hoped that this day would not \ncome. I am not the only one. The American public is not behind the bill \nthat we voted on. For good reason. I fear that when this effort is \nwritten about in history books, it will represent a time when our \nNation took a turn for the worse--when we were presented with two \npaths, but the wrong path was chosen.\n  There is a term that originated with television critics called \n``jumping the shark.'' It refers to a plot or character twist that \npretty much throws off the balance of the show. The show is never the \nsame and usually heads downhill after that. I believe that this health \ncare bill will be seen as the moment the Democrats jumped the shark for \nour country.\n  There have been many pieces of bad legislation leading up to this--\nobscene amounts of taxpayer money being used to grow the government \nlike never before. But this bill, this health care reform bill, may be \nthe pinnacle vote when the Democratic agenda did itself in.\n  I don't deny that the motives of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are genuine. We all want to improve access to health \ninsurance for Americans, but this is not the way to do it. And the \nAmerican public sees that. They see it, and they are frustrated that \nthe majority in Congress is ignoring their pleas.\n  Over the past several months, I have talked to tens of thousands of \nNevadans about this bill. Nevadans have told me loud and clear that \nthis is not the cure for our broken health care system.\n  I have heard from small business owners, like Boyd Betteridge, in \nWinnemucca, NV. Boyd and his wife have worked hard to build a small \nbusiness over the past 15 years. They employ about 25 employees and \nfear that if this bill passes, they will have no choice but to fire \nemployees or even close shop.\n  Boyd says that government regulation makes it harder for him to \nsurvive. He is frustrated and upset that politicians in Washington, DC, \ndon't feel the pain of the small business owners working hard to make \nends meet and to create jobs. Boyd serves his community--he sits on the \nschool board, he is part of the engine of our economy, and he is in \nreal pain. This health care bill doesn't help Boyd Betteridge.\n  And it doesn't help Dan Grigsby. He is the controller at Renner \nEquipment Company in Yerington, NV. Dan works for a company that \nemploys about 25 to 30 people. The owners have committed over the years \nto provide health insurance to their employees. Because costs have \nincreased, they have taken advantage of health savings accounts as a \nway of providing for their employees in a more cost-effective way. \nHealth savings accounts have been very well received at Renner \nEquipment in Yerington and at similar businesses around the country. \nThey help patients become consumers in the health care marketplace. \nThat is an important step in reducing health care costs.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the minimum benefit standards in the \nbill before us today could take away the ability of Americans like Dan \nGrisby to keep an HSA. Prohibiting the use of HSA funds to purchase \nover-the-counter medications will further limit the options that \nemployers have to provide meaningful health care to their employees.\n  And it sure doesn't help the more than 100,000 Nevada seniors who \nchoose a Medicare Advantage plan. Their extra benefits will be reduced \nby more than half. While we are at it, this bill doesn't help the \ntypical Nevada family who purchases health insurance in the individual \nmarket. Their premiums will go up 10 to 13 percent.\n  This bill doesn't help middle-income union workers in Nevada either. \nOur hard-working hotel maids, casino restaurant workers, airline \nworkers, teachers, and police officers will share the burden of the \n$200 billion tax on health insurance holders. This bill doesn't help \nthe hospice community--they face about a $7.7 billion cut in payments.\n  Many of the hospices in Nevada--including the one where my \ngrandmother received care--may not be able to survive these \nreimbursement cuts.\n  In another hit for an integral part of our health care system, the \nhome health community will see cuts of approximately $40 billion in \nthis bill. For Nevada home health providers, that means about $264 \nmillion in cuts over 10 years, according to some estimates. This bill \nsurely doesn't help them.\n  So, let's see. So far, this bill doesn't help small business owners, \nAmericans with health savings accounts, families purchasing health \ninsurance, union workers, seniors, hospices, or home health. If you \naren't in one of these groups, don't breathe a sigh of relief just yet.\n  Fifteen million American workers will pay for new taxes and \n``penalties'' with reduced wages and lost jobs. And then there are \ntaxes on prescription drugs, clinical lab work, and medical devices--\nall passed on to consumers. An over 2,700-page bill full of new taxes \non Americans, funding cuts for programs they rely on, and raised \npremiums. That is why the Nevadans are not behind this bill, and that \nis why the American public is not behind this bill.\n  Beyond the financial impact of this bill, Democrats set a dangerous \nprecedent by requiring every American citizen to purchase health \ninsurance coverage. Americans who fail to buy health insurance that \nmeets the minimum requirements would be subject to financial penalties. \nIs it really constitutional for this body to tell all Americans that \nthey must buy health insurance coverage? And, if so what is next? What \npersonal liberty or property will the Congress seek to take away from \nAmericans next? Will we consider legislation in the future requiring \nevery American to buy a car? Will we consider legislation in the future \nrequiring every American to buy a house? Where do we draw the line or \nwill we even draw one at all?\n  I don't think Congress has ever required Americans to buy a product \nor service like health insurance under penalty of law. I doubt that \nCongress has that power in the first place. As the CBO explained in the \n1990s, ``A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health \ninsurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. The \ngovernment has never required people to buy any good or service as a \ncondition of lawful residence in the United States.''\n  There is no doubt that we need to change health care in this Nation. \nAmericans don't want billions in new taxes, they don't want to lose \ntheir current insurance coverage or the choice to decide their \ncoverage, and they don't want a bureaucrat coming between them and \ntheir doctor.\n  This vote isn't about voting for this bill or doing nothing. We can \ngo back to the drawing board, take the best ideas from each side, and \nput together health reform that will take us into the future.\n  Republicans have come up with many ideas on ways to fix our Nation's \nbroken health care system. The answer is not with unbearable taxes, \nunsustainable growth of the government, or paying for a brand new \nentitlement program. Those aren't the qualities of comprehensive health \ncare reform. They are the qualities of terrible policy that will lead \nto devastating results for Americans and our health care system. There \nis a better way. It will take time, but if we can change\n\n[[Page S14126]]\n\nthe way that Americans think about health care, than we can create a \nbetter system.\n  Imagine a system where Americans get to keep their choices in health \ncare and where they are allowed to buy insurance across State lines. \nImagine a system where there is transparency--where you know how much a \ndoctor's visit will cost and how much your surgery will be--where you \ncan shop around for the best value for your money. Imagine a system \nthat rewards individuals for engaging in healthy behaviors. Imagine a \nsystem where you are not punished for having a preexisting condition. \nImagine a system that allows small businesses to pool their purchasing \npower to provide health insurance to their employees through Small \nbusiness health plans. Imagine a system where doctors can practice \nmedicine to heal patients instead of practicing medicine with the goal \nof not being sued. And imagine a patient-centered health care system, \nnot an insurance-centered or government-centered health care system. \nThese are all standards that we should work toward. We shouldn't assume \nthat this bill before us is our last, best option for health care \nreform. We can't afford to settle for this bill.\n  The Democrats see how close they are with this bill, and they want a \nvictory so badly. They are working every possible angle to get the 60 \nvotes they need. They have literally given sweetheart deals to a few \njust to get their votes. They think this is the political victory that \nis going to help them win over the American people. Ant they are \nborrowing trillions of dollars from our children and grandchildren to \nget the job done--and that is just with this health care bill.\n  We simply cannot survive the Democratic agenda of taxing and spending \naway our future. We can't survive it, and we can't afford it.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am proud of the health care system that \nwe have in Hawaii. We have developed innovative approaches to provide \nhealth insurance coverage. Hawaii consistently is ranked amongst States \nwith the highest rates of health insurance coverage. An October article \nin the New York Times pointed out that Hawaii's health insurance \npremiums are tied with North Dakota for the lowest in the country and \nits Medicare cost per beneficiary is the lowest in the Nation. Our \nresidents also tend to live longer than individuals living elsewhere in \nthe country.\n  Our system is not perfect. An increase in unemployment has led to \nmore people losing their health insurance. Insurance premiums have been \nrising. Our health care providers are struggling to meet the increasing \nburdens imposed on them by greater numbers of uninsured patients and \nrising costs. There are substantial access issues in many areas of \nHawaii, especially on the neighbor islands. We have a significant \nshortage of health care professionals, particularly in certain \nspecialties.\n  I support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because it \nwill improve the Nation's health care system and help address many of \nthe problems in Hawaii. This legislation expands access to coverage, \nincludes policies aimed at improving the quality and availability of \nhealth care services, and attempts to slow increasing health care \ncosts. The legislation will also ensure that individuals with \npreexisting conditions will be able to get insurance. Additionally, the \nbill will prohibit unfair lifetime limits imposed by health insurance \ncompanies on individuals.\n  The bill strengthens the health workforce and primary care systems. \nImprovements to the National Health Service Corps, scholarship, and \nloan repayment programs will help train additional health care \nprofessionals. Additional investments in federally qualified community \nhealth centers will improve access to primary care services.\n  The act improves access to quality and affordable care nationally, \nwhile recognizing the unique health care needs of Hawaii. I appreciate \nthe inclusion of two provisions in the legislation of tremendous \nimportance to my home State. A significant contributing factor to \nHawaii having a high percentage of residents insured is our employer-\nmandated health care system. Our employer mandated health care system \ndepends on our longstanding exemption from the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act, ERISA. I appreciate the inclusion in the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act of a rule of construction that is \nintended to preserve our unique ERISA exemption and the employer-\nmandated insurance that the exemption enables. This rule of \nconstruction will ensure that the employer-provided insurance, as \nmandated by the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act, is maintained and that \nnothing in this act will be used to take away the health benefits \nprovided to workers in Hawaii or alter the responsibilities imposed on \nemployers. It is essential that as we try to expand access to health \ncare that we build upon the existing system of coverage in Hawaii \nrather than replace it.\n  The hospitals in Hawaii continue to have difficulties trying to care \nfor uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid disproportionate \nshare hospital, DSH, payments are intended to support hospitals that \ncare for significant numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. Hawaii \ndoes not have a permanent Medicaid DSH allotment.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created specific DSH allotments for \neach State based on their actual DSH expenditures for fiscal year 1995. \nIn 1994, Hawaii implemented the QUEST Medicaid demonstration program. \nThe prior Medicaid DSH program was incorporated into QUEST. As a result \nof the demonstration program, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in \n1995 and was not provided a DSH allotment. The Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 modified the DSH \nprogram, which included the establishment of a floor for DSH \nallotments. States without allotments were again left out. The Medicare \nPrescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 made \nmodifications to DSH program, which included an increase for low DSH \nStates. States without allotments were left out again.\n  The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 temporarily restored \nHawaii's allotment. Hawaii's temporary allotment was extended by the \nMedicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 and the CHIP \nReauthorization Act of 2009. However, Hawaii's temporary DSH allotment \nwill end after December 31, 2011.\n  This bill will permanently restore Hawaii's Medicaid DSH allotment. \nThis restoration authorizes the submission by the State of Hawaii of a \nState plan amendment covering a DSH payment methodology to hospitals \nthat is consistent with the requirements of existing law relating to \nDSH payments. The purpose of providing a DSH allotment for Hawaii is to \nprovide additional funding to the State of Hawaii to permit a greater \ncontribution toward the uncompensated costs of hospitals that are \nproviding indigent care. It is not meant to alter existing arrangements \nbetween the State of Hawaii and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, or to reduce in any way the level of federal funding for \nHawaii's QUEST program.\n  I look forward to continuing to work to further improve the \nlegislation and bring about the enactment of health care reform \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have reached a defining moment for the \nSenate and for the American people. The bill we have considered will \nrank alongside other major decisions such as the creation of Social \nSecurity and Medicare and the Civil Rights Act. Health insurance reform \nhas been talked about and attempted for seven decades. The American \npeople for years have named health insurance as among the greatest \nconcerns in their daily lives. Now, here at hand, is the opportunity to \nact.\n  This has been an arduous process. The President has rightly noted \nthat if health insurance reform were easy, it would have been done long \nago. The defenders of the status quo have spared no expense--nor have \nthey been sparing in their distortions--to keep the system that pays \nthem so handsomely. Health reform will benefit every American of \ntoday's generations. But let us especially think ahead one, two or \nthree generations. If we were to abandon our responsibility now, saying \nit was too difficult, that would be an excuse for doing nothing that \nour children and grandchildren would never accept.\n\n[[Page S14127]]\n\n  For many reasons, including the health of public discourse on the \nmost pressing issues we face as Americans, it is regrettable that the \ndefenders of the status quo, doing their utmost to influence this \ndebate from their comfortable perches outside the Senate, have stooped \nto new levels to obstruct health insurance reform. Friction is a \nbyproduct of reform, especially when well-funded and entrenched special \ninterests rally to protect the status quo. The heat of this debate is a \nmeasure of the cozy setups that these reforms will unsettle. This year \nalone Senate Democrats have been forced to contend with 101 filibusters \nby the minority Republicans. Even on an issue this important, health \ninsurance reform is still being subject to filibuster and parliamentary \ndelay to a level I have not seen in 35 years in the Senate.\n  Opponents of reform unfortunately have wasted much of the public's \ntime by provoking arguments over their distortions about what health \nreform really means. The country suffers when there is a failure to act \non serious challenges that millions of ordinary Americans face in their \ndaily lives.\n  The arguments that we hear today to prop up the status quo by \nknocking down challenges to the way things are seem eerily similar to \nthose made against creating Medicare nearly 45 years ago. Opponents \nthen tried to demonize the plan and claimed it would never work. During \nthe debate decades ago on Medicare, one Senator said: ``It would \nachieve little for those who need it, while subjecting the very fabric \nof American life to the strain of severe and unnecessary sacrifices.''\n  Eventually during that historic debate, Members from both sides of \nthe aisle worked together to pass a bill that is one of the most \nsuccessful, purposeful and popular programs today. The Medicare \nProgram, like Social Security, was not perfect when it began, but \nimprovements have been made over time. Vermonters can be proud that our \nState's congressional delegation, all Republican at the time, supported \npassage of that landmark legislation.\n  The Senate has overcome the stalling and delay tactics, the \nfilibusters and the roadblocks to the consideration of health care \nreform, and now we are closer than ever to passing comprehensive and \nmeaningful health insurance reform.\n  Is the Senate health care bill without any problems? No. Is the bill \nbefore us the one I would have drafted or the one that any other Member \nof the Senate would have drafted? Of course not. Extensive negotiations \nand refinement were needed to produce a bill of this scope and \nimportance, as it should be in the legislative process. The difficulty \nwas magnified by the minority's calculated decision to spend their \nefforts to undermine, instead of to constructively engage. Not only \nmajorities but supermajorities were required at several steps in the \nSenate's work on this bill. There are 100 Senators and 435 Members of \nthe other body who will have to stand up and be counted in this \nhistoric process. The votes of most, I believe, will be tallied on the \nright side of history and of the real-life, everyday needs of the \nAmerican people for real health insurance reform.\n  Some say the bill before us does not go far enough. Others say it \ngoes too far. What everyone can agree on is what will happen if we do \nnothing.\n  In the next decade, without reform, half of all nonelderly adults \nwill find themselves without coverage at some point. The number of \npeople without insurance will jump by more than 30 percent in 29 States \nand by at least 10 percent in every State. American families will \ncontinue to pay a hidden tax of $1,100 on their health insurance \npremiums to pay for the costs of care for the uninsured. The very same \ninsurance coverage a family has in 2008 is projected to nearly double \nto $24,291 by 2016, consuming a whopping 45 percent of projected median \nfamily incomes. Premiums will continue to double every several years, \nmaking health insurance vastly unaffordable for many Americans. \nEconomists project that if health insurance reform fails, the resulting \nlower gross domestic product, GDP, will reduce family incomes by \n$10,000 by 2030. Small businesses will continue to struggle and fewer \nand fewer will be able to offer coverage to their employees.\n  Furthermore, as our population ages, Medicare is projected to be \ninsolvent within 10 years, jeopardizing coverage for millions of \nAmerican seniors. Each day that passes without reform, 14,000 Americans \nlose health insurance coverage. These are not minor problems to be \nbrushed aside or kicked yet again down the road for another generation \nof Americans to tackle. These problems are on the Senate's doorstep, \nright here, right now. Keeping the status quo guarantees a struggling \neconomy in the future, with more Americans unable to afford lifesaving \ntreatments because of the rising cost of insurance.\n  In 2001, 46 percent of all bankruptcies were attributable to medical \ncosts. By 2007, that number had grown to 62 percent. While hard-working \nAmericans were losing their jobs, homes and savings simply because they \ngot sick, insurance and pharmaceutical company executives were making \nrecord profits. In 2000, the 10 largest publicly traded health \ninsurance companies had profits of $2.4 billion. By 2007, profits at \nthose firms had jumped to $12.9 billion, a 428-percent increase. In \n2007, CEO salaries at these firms were $118.6 million or $11.9 million \nfor each CEO. In 2007, prescription drug companies had a profit margin \nof 15.8 percent. The same year, profit margins at all Fortune 500 firms \nwere 5.7 percent.\n  Since the Nation's last attempt to pass health reform 16 years ago, \nmillions of Americans have lost their insurance and costs have \nskyrocketed. In the absence of a fair and sensible health insurance \nsystem, families, businesses and taxpayers have been dragged along by \nan inflationary curve that only worsens with time. Next year, small \nbusinesses--already suffering from skyrocketing medical costs--will see \ntheir premiums rise by an average of 15 percent--twice the rate of last \nyear's increases. Drug companies have boosted prices of brand-name \ndrugs by about 9 percent over the last year, the steepest increase in \nyears.\n  Even though Vermont has long recognized the importance of building a \nhealth care system that includes all Vermonters, individual States \nacting alone cannot make enough progress without comprehensive health \ninsurance reform. Tens of thousands of Vermonters still lack basic \nhealth insurance. Workers nationwide are losing insurance for their \nfamilies when they change or lose jobs. Insurance companies can and do \ndiscriminate against sick people.\n  I know so very many of these Vermonters. Many of them are my \nneighbors, my friends. Some of these Vermonters without health \ninsurance went to school with me. Some grew up as I did in Montpelier, \nVT. Some are people I have known all our lives. They are hard-working, \ngood, honest, decent people. It is a travesty that after working so \nhard and playing by the rules they still cannot begin to have the kind \nof health coverage that Federal employees--including those of us in \nthis Chamber--are able to have because of earlier reforms of the \nFederal workforce health insurance system.\n  Too many Vermont families live in the shadow of constant insecurity \nbecause they know that if they have an illness or if they lose a job, \nit might mean the end of their health insurance. Too many Vermonters \nare forced to sell their homes or file for bankruptcy to pay their \nhealth insurance bills. In no other modern society are families \nconfronted with such heartbreaking dilemmas.\n  Let me give a personal example. I heard recently from a Vermonter who \nonly periodically had health insurance throughout his life and now goes \nwithout prevention and screenings and pays for everything out of pocket \nbecause he cannot afford any health care that is not urgently needed. \nTragically, his wife was in a car accident, and even though the couple \npaid thousands in treatments, they ``had to stop short'' in giving her \nthe necessary physical therapy and medications her doctors recommended \nbecause of the costs involved.\n  Another Vermonter, who is lucky enough to have insurance, says her \nfamily pays almost $1,100 each month in premiums, and yet they have to \nreach a $3,000 deductible before the insurance company will pay a dime. \nShe told me that ``as the cost of health insurance continues to rise, \nit feels like we will be swallowed whole by it.''\n  These should not be stories heard in today's America. We remain the \nonly\n\n[[Page S14128]]\n\nindustrialized Nation in the world that lets its citizens fend for \nthemselves without health coverage.\n  The bill before us would make giant leaps toward reforming our health \ninsurance system. Under the Senate bill, 31 million more Americans \nwould have health insurance, bringing coverage to 94 percent--the \nhighest level of insured Americans ever in our history. More low-income \nAmericans will be able to access the State Medicaid Programs, and \nmiddle-income families will get enough help to be able to buy health \ninsurance through State-based health insurance exchanges, which will be \nclosely monitored. Insurance companies will never be able to drop your \ncoverage, charge you more, or deny you or your children coverage \nbecause of a preexisting health condition. This bill also sets \nstandards for qualifying health insurance so the insurance companies \ncan no longer sell you coverage that does not actually help when you \nare sick. The legislation also contains a Patient Bill of Rights, long \nchampioned by Senator Kennedy, which guarantees that patients have a \nright to appeal denials or decisions by their health insurance \ncompanies.\n  The insurance industry will no longer be allowed to pay excessive \nexecutive bonuses and salaries on the backs of their customers. All \ninsurance companies will be required to spend more of their premium \nrevenues on clinical services and quality activities, with less going \nto administrative costs and profits--or else they will have to pay \nrebates to policyholders. This change will improve quality of care and \nwill hold the insurance industry accountable for their spending.\n  Small businesses, which make up more than 80 percent of the \nbusinesses in Vermont, at long last will have access to affordable care \nunder this bill. This bill will make tax credits available to small \nbusinesses to help them offer health insurance to their employees. \nThese tax credits will make health insurance more affordable both for \nsmall businesses and for their workers.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed that the \nreforms in the bill--including lower administrative costs, increased \ncompetition, and better pooling for risk--will lower premiums for \nAmerican families. CBO estimates premiums for the overall population \nwill be reduced by 8.4 percent.\n  In addition to the consumer protections and industry accountability \nprovisions, this bill also takes significant strides to slow the growth \nof the spiraling health spending that has the potential to cripple our \neconomy in the years to come. A substantial portion of the Senate bill \nis devoted to testing ways to reduce health care costs while improving \nquality over time. The bill contains pilots for efforts like Vermont's \nBlueprint for Health, under which patient care is coordinated to reduce \nunnecessary hospital visits and to keep patients healthy. Other \nprograms will test various ways to pay doctors and hospitals that could \nbe more efficient than the current fee-for-service structure. A greater \nemphasis on prevention--long supported by Senators Kennedy and Harkin \nin the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--will reduce \npreventable deaths and hospitalizations.\n  While these improvements to our health care system are significant \nand noteworthy, I am disappointed that the bill no longer includes a \npublic insurance option to compete with private plans, nor does it \ninclude a provision I have proposed to repeal the antitrust exemption \nfor health and medical malpractice insurers. Though there are differing \nviews on the best ways to inject competition into the health insurance \nmarket, we can all agree that health and medical malpractice insurers \nshould not be allowed to engage in blatantly anticompetitive practices, \nsuch as colluding to set prices and allocating markets. My legislation \nwould ensure that basic rules of fair competition apply to insurers. I \nbelieve that repealing this antitrust exemption, combined with the \npublic option, would go far in providing fair competition and choice in \nthe health insurance marketplace.\n  With all the progress the Senate's health care bill makes in the area \nof women's health--such as prohibiting insurance companies from \ndiscriminating against women through higher premiums and by allowing \nwomen free access to vital preventative services--it is unfortunate the \nbill also threatens to chip away at women's reproductive choices. \nBefore a restrictive provision was added in the managers' amendment, \nthe bill would have maintained current law by restricting Federal funds \nfor abortions. The original Senate bill would have required insurance \ncompanies to segregate public and private funds to ensure no public \nfunds would go to abortion services. Now, instead, the Senate bill \nwould require women who purchase insurance on the exchanges to make two \npayments if they wish to have a wide range of choices. States could \nalso opt out of allowing abortion to be covered at all on their \nexchanges, leaving women with fewer choices than they have now on the \nindividual insurance market. While this language is far less \nrestrictive than the language in the House-passed legislation, there is \nlegitimate concern that despite the interest of women to have this \nchoice available in the marketplace, this language would prompt private \ninsurers to stop offering such options at all. I hope a better solution \ncomes in conference.\n  After one of the cliffhanger votes over the course of this long \nSenate debate, I spoke privately with Vicki Reggie Kennedy, the \ncourageous and insightful widow of our beloved friend, Senator Edward \nKennedy. This is a bittersweet time for her and for all who know how \nfully he was committed to winning this battle to lighten the load for \nthe ordinary Americans who are struggling so mightily today. Health \nreform was the first of the many causes of his life and of his work in \nthis body.\n  We talked about how he would have relished this moment, and we talked \nabout how he would have pressed his shoulder to the tiller to steer the \nSenate toward the right outcome for the American people. Though Senator \nKennedy strongly supported including a public option, as I have, along \nwith other reforms such as ending health insurers' antitrust exemption, \nVicki Kennedy knows, as I do, that he would be fighting to pass this \nbill. This is the Senate's opportunity to advance real reform. This is \na bill that reflects the core principles the President outlined in \nbeginning this debate early this year.\n  This is reform based on the existing system of employer-based \ninsurance, offered by private insurers with health services delivered \nlargely within the private sector. But any objective reading of this \nbill makes crystal clear that this is real reform. This is a bill that \nwill improve the lives of every American. This is a bill that is a \ncredit to this good and great Nation and its people.\n  At its best, the Senate through our history has been able to act as \nthe conscience of the Nation. Those moments were forged amid fervent \ndebate and with the purpose of advancing a pressing national interest. \nThis is such a time, and my hope and belief is that the Senate did rise \nto the occasion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the health care reform bill we voted on \ntoday in the U.S. Senate merited my support because it is a fiscally \nresponsible bill that will expand health care coverage to tens of \nmillions of Americans who are currently uninsured, reduce health care \ncosts for families and small businesses and strengthen our health care \nsystem in rural America.\n  While I recognize that this is a very controversial issue, I believe \nthat the status quo is unsustainable. Our country spends nearly twice \nas much on health care as most other countries in the world. And the \ncost of health care and its claim on our economy is increasing every \nsingle year.\n  There are some tens of millions of Americans who are not covered with \nhealth insurance and whose health care costs are then transferred to \nthe rest of the American people to pay. It is estimated that those with \ninsurance pay, on average, $1,000 per year in a hidden tax to cover the \nuncompensated care given to those who don't now have health insurance.\n  So, I think it is important for us to try to put the brakes on \nincreasing health care costs, and also to extend health care coverage \nto those who now don't have it.\n  I told citizens of North Dakota that I would not support a government \ntakeover of health care. This legislation is not a government takeover. \nI have said that I would not support public funding for abortion. This \nlegislation does not\n\n[[Page S14129]]\n\nprovide public funding for abortion. I have promised that I would not \nsupport legislation that provides health care for illegal immigrants. \nThis legislation does not.\n  But you wouldn't know those facts if you heard the negative \nadvertising about the bill. In North Dakota alone, nearly $2.2 million \nhas been spent on advertising that, in many cases, is just not honest. \nThese ads are paid for by out-of-State groups and big interests that \nhave a lot at stake and will do anything to defeat the health care \nreform bill. The first amendment allows these groups to do this but it \ndoes nothing to advance the debate since most of these attacks have \nbeen based on lies and scare tactics.\n  This health care bill includes important protections that will stop \ninsurance companies from taking advantage of patients. It begins to \nreform the delivery of health care in a way that would control costs \nand improve the quality of health care. It will increase competition in \nthe insurance market by allowing insurance companies to compete across \nState lines and by offering nationwide plans. It also establishes pilot \nprograms to support creative ways to deal with medical malpractice \nreform.\n  In addition to being paid for, the legislation also extends help to \nindividuals and small businesses that need assistance to afford health \ninsurance.\n  And the legislation contains important provisions to strengthen \nhealth care in rural America, including a provision I added called the \nFrontier Amendment, with Senator Conrad.\n  For the first time in many decades, this bill finally provides fair \nreimbursement to North Dakota and several other States who have the \nhighest quality health care, but the lowest reimbursements under \nMedicare. This new fair payment system will mean a strengthened health \ncare system for senior citizens on Medicare. It will also mean a better \nhealth care system for all North Dakotans because there will be less \ncost shifting among individuals with private policies in order to cover \nthe shortfall in Medicare reimbursement.\n  The bill guarantees that Medicare services to senior citizens will \nnot be cut or affected in any way. In fact, the bill improves the \nsolvency of Medicare.\n  The health care reform bill in the Senate is being supported by the \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons, AARP, the National Committee \nto Save Social Security and Medicare, American Hospital Association, \nAmerican Medical Association, and many, many consumer groups across the \ncountry.\n  So this bill is about a lot of things. It is about standing up for \nAmerican business and growth in our economy. It is about standing up \nfor senior citizens and Medicare. It is about creating a better health \ncare program for all Americans. For those reasons, I voted yes to move \nthis process along in the hope this bill will be further improved in \nthe weeks ahead.\n  This is not a perfect piece of legislation for sure. But voting for \nthis legislation in the Senate moves it along to a conference with the \nHouse of Representatives, which is another step in determining whether \nwe can write legislation that advances our country's interests.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President--I voted to support of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act of 2009, which will reform our \nNation's health care system.\n  This is our chance to fix a broken system. We tried in 1993 and 1994 \nand failed. Over 15 years have passed since our last effort. This may \nbe our last, best opportunity before we are forced to wait another 15 \nyears for real reform. And our country cannot afford to wait another 15 \nyears. Our system is simply unsustainable.\n  Now this bill is not perfect, and without question there are items I \nwould like to change. I believe it is a work in progress. However, it \naccomplishes several important objectives.\n  The bill is incremental. There will be time to make needed \nadjustments before it is fully effective.\n  It expands insurance coverage and provides new consumer protections \nfrom insurance company abuses.\n  It does all this in a fiscally responsible way, reducing the deficit \nand prolonging the solvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  Throughout this process, I have argued that health reform should be \nincremental. I believe that in many ways, this bill is incremental.\n  It leaves the best of our health care system in place. The majority \nof Americans with coverage continually say they are happy with their \ninsurance. Under this legislation, they can keep what they like.\n  The bill also will be phased in over the next several years. People \nin need of coverage will receive immediate help in many forms.\n  Beginning in 2010, next year, the Federal Government will spend $5 \nbillion to establish a high-risk pool, which will provide subsidized \ncoverage for those who have been denied private insurance on account of \na preexisting condition.\n  Young adults will be able to remain on their parents' health \ninsurance until age 26. Many young adults currently lose their coverage \nas soon as they graduate from college; this will allow them to maintain \ntheir coverage while they find a job.\n  Seniors enrolled in the Medicare prescription drug benefit will \nreceive an additional $500 in drug coverage before they encounter the \nso-called doughnut hole coverage gap. This is the coverage gap that \noccurs after seniors spend $2,830 on prescription drug costs. They are \nthen required to pay the full amount out of pocket, until their costs \ntotal $4,550. This additional $500 of coverage means that seniors will \nencounter a small gap in their drug coverage and pay less out of \npocket.\n  There will be new limits on the amount of premium dollars that can be \nspent on non-health care expenses by all health insurance companies. \nThis is very important--I have long worried that insurance companies \nspend too much on administrative expenses, like medical underwriting, \nclaims processing, overhead, and profits and salary, and not enough on \nactual medical care. Starting next year, plans sold in the individual \nand small group markets must devote at least 80 percent of premium \ndollars to health care expenses; and plans sold to large groups must \nspend at least 85 percent of the premium funds they collect on health \ncare services. This provision will give people the assurance that most \nof their premium dollars go to pay for care.\n  Also next year, small business can receive tax credits to help cover \nthe cost of covering their employees. These credits will be available \non a sliding scale to employers with 25 or fewer employees, with \naverage annual wages of $50,000 or under.\n  Expansion of community health centers. Beginning in 2011, the Federal \nprogram that supports community health centers will begin to receive \nsignificant additional funding, totaling $10 billion through 2015.\n  This expansion of community care helps guarantee that we are \nproviding not just coverage for medical care but also access. A health \ninsurance card does no good if no physician will accept it. These \nclinics provide care for all and in many places will be the backbone of \na reformed health care system.\n  Finally, in 2014, the full scope of the reform effort will come in \nplace. People will be able to compare their coverage options in newly \ncreated exchanges, and in many cases they will receive tax credits to \nhelp them purchase coverage.\n  This allows plenty of time to see how reforms are working and, if \nnecessary, for Congress, the administration, and States to make \nadjustments to ensure that health reform is effective.\n  The bill contains several critical insurance industry reforms that \nwill help cover 31 million additional Americans. I am convinced that \nour country's for-profit health insurance industry operates with \nprofits, not people, in mind. And this legislation will contain a \nnumber of new standards that this industry will need to meet.\n  They will not be allowed to discriminate based on gender.\n  They will not be able to take away coverage once a person gets sick.\n  They will not be able to charge more, or deny coverage entirely, \nbased on an individual's health history or preexisting conditions.\n  Insurance will be sold in regulated markets called exchanges, where \nconsumers can easily compare their different insurance options. Web \nsites allow Americans to easily compare prices when shopping for \nairline tickets, and this will extend the idea to health insurance.\n\n[[Page S14130]]\n\n  These exchanges will work on behalf of consumers to negotiate lower \nprices and to ensure that participating plans meet high standards. \nConsumers will receive clear information about what is covered and how \nmuch it will cost. They will have several different levels of coverage \nfrom which to choose.\n  Every exchange will also offer two national plans, overseen by the \nFederal Office of Personnel Management. This office ensures that \nFederal workers and Members of Congress have good health plan choices. \nOne of the included plans will be offered by a nonprofit company. For \nconsumers in highly concentrated markets with only a few choices, these \nnational plans will provide a new option for quality coverage.\n  Most importantly, these exchanges will consider the previous behavior \nof insurance plans. If a company raises rates unfairly over the next \nseveral years, exchanges will consider this and decide whether they \nshould be allowed to sell in these new markets.\n  This is a strong incentive for plans to treat consumers fairly.\n  All of this is accomplished in a fiscally responsible manner. The \nbill saves money, and it saves Medicare.\n  It is clear that we cannot afford to continue on our current path.\n  It expands coverage to an additional 31 million Americans while \nreducing the Federal budget deficit by $132 billion by 2019. Deficit \nreduction increases in the second 10-year period that the bill will be \nin effect.\n  Now, this is a major point of contention. I continue to hear the \nother side say that this bill will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years. \nEven the Republicans' own analysis shows that the bill will reduce the \nbudget deficit. The Budget Committee's minority staff released an \nanalysis that examines the bill's net cost and savings over the next \nseveral decades.\n  The Republican staff projects that the bill will reduce the deficit \nby $176 billion from 2014 to 2023.\n  This number grows to $1.032 trillion from 2020 to 2029.\n  The total net deficit reduction, according to Republicans, is $1.165 \ntrillion from 2010 to 2029.\n  Let me say it again. These are partisan estimates, produced by \nRepublican staff, and they show significant, meaningful deficit \nreduction.\n  The bill also takes a first step at prolonging the solvency of the \nMedicare Program. Without action, Medicare will be insolvent in 2017. \nThat is 9 short years from now.\n  This bill extends Medicare's solvency by approximately 4 to 5 years. \nMake no mistake, more must be done. The Chief Actuary at the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid estimates that it extends solvency to 2026. \nAnd I believe this bill lays the groundwork to help make Medicare more \nsustainable.\n  It contains a Medicare Commission, which will examine the program and \nmake recommendations to Congress on an expedited basis.\n  It creates accountable care organizations, in which physicians work \ntogether to provide more efficient care for patients, while sharing in \nsome of the savings they generate for the Medicare Program.\n  Controlling entitlement spending must be a priority, and I believe \nthis is an important step in the right direction.\n  Throughout the health reform process, I have emphasized the \nimportance of a health reform bill that meets the needs of large and \ncomplex States such as California.\n  My State, without question, has one of the largest and most complex \nhealth care systems. As a result, we face some of the most complex \nchallenges.\n  Over 6.6 million Californians are uninsured. The State is \nexperiencing an unprecedented budget crisis. And even after health \nreform, the State will still have as many as 2 million undocumented, \nwhich will continue to strain public hospitals, emergency rooms, \nclinics and other providers.\n  California's public hospitals play a key role in meeting these needs \nand care for the poorest of the poor. These hospitals rely on payments \ncalled Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, DSH, funding to cover \ntheir costs, both for the uninsured that they cover and the very low \nreimbursement rates their receive from the Medicaid Program. DSH \nfunding accounts for, on average, 40 percent of public hospitals' total \nfunding.\n  I am pleased that the managers' amendment has slightly reduced the \nannual cut to Medicaid DSH funding that California and other States \nthat use their full allotments will receive.\n  Under the original bill, California would have received a 50 percent \ncut in Medicaid DSH once the rate of the uninsured in the state dropped \nby 45 percent under this version, the state's allotment will only be \ncut by 35 percent. This reduces a $550 million cut to $385 million, for \na savings of approximately $165 million per year to California.\n  States are now guaranteed to keep at least 50 percent of their \ncurrent Medicaid DSH allotments, which will provide long-term stability \nto this critical program.\n  I am grateful to Senator Reid for making these adjustments, and I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues in the House to keep as much \nof this critical funding intact as possible as the process moves \nforward.\n  The cost to California from the expansion of Medicaid remains a \nserious concern.\n  The bill will cover the full cost through 2016 generated by opening \nthe program to all adults who earn less than $14,400 per year, which is \n133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, FPL. However, California will \nneed to maintain this expansion and will also have to find a sufficient \nnumber of doctors willing to take patients newly eligible for Medicaid.\n  This will cost money. Health reform should not bankrupt large States \nlike California. Ensuring that health reform works for my State will be \na top priority as this legislation moves to conference.\n  I am also concerned that the structure of the annual tax on the \nhealth insurance sector may have unintended consequences that will have \na disproportionate impact on California. This tax will generate roughly \n$60 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The impact of this provision would be disproportionate on States such \nas California, which have a high proportion of fully insured coverage. \nFor example, 77 percent of the commercially enrolled population in \nCalifornia is enrolled in fully insured health plans. This includes \npublic employee plans such as CalPERS and the city and county of San \nFrancisco.\n  The net result is that California would pay upwards of one-third more \nthan the average State on a per capita basis. Many integrated nonprofit \nhealth plans, some of which have been cited as models of efficiency, \nwould face additional expenses and consumers would be impacted through \nhigher premiums and limited choices.\n  Now, an exemption is provided for nonprofit insurers in the managers' \namendment--for example, nonprofits with an overall medical loss ratio \nof 90 percent or better or nonprofits in a State which regulates \npremium increases could be exempt from the tax.\n  But this would have a limited impact in California and our two \nlargest nonprofit insurers--Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross/Blue \nShield may not qualify for the exemption. Because California lacks an \nentity to regulate premium increases, the only way nonprofit insurers \nin our State will likely qualify for an exemption is by meeting the \nmedical loss ratio requirements, set at 90 percent overall in the bill. \nThis is a high hurdle to meet, and I worry these additional costs could \nappear in the premiums paid by Californians.\n  The most important component of successful health reform remains \ncontrolling health insurance premium increases. I remain concerned that \ncompanies will attempt to take advantage of the period of time between \nthe passage of legislation, and 2014, when exchanges are up and running \nwith new consumer protections. We have seen this with credit card \ncompanies since credit card reform legislation passed, and I fear \nhealth insurance will be no different.\n  I proposed an amendment to create a Medical Insurance Rate Authority \nand to ensure that all insurance companies are subject to some type of \nrate review.\n  The amendment asks the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners to produce a report, detailing the rate review laws and \ncapabilities in all 50 States. The Secretary of HHS will then use these \nfindings to determine which States are capable of doing sufficient rate \nreviews to protect consumers.\n\n[[Page S14131]]\n\n  In States where insurance commissioners have authority to review \nrates, they will continue to do so. In States without sufficient \nauthority or resources, the Secretary of HHS will review rates and take \nany appropriate action to deny unfair requests. This could mean \nblocking unjustified rate increases, or requiring rebates, if an unfair \nincrease is already in effect. This will provide all American consumers \nwith another layer of protection from an unfair premium increase.\n  The amendment would also require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to establish a Medical Insurance Rate Authority as part of the \nprocess in the bill that enables her to monitor premium costs.\n  The Rate Authority would advise the Secretary on insurance rate \nreview and would be composed of seven officials who represent the full \nscope of the health care system including at least two consumers, at \nleast one medical professional, and one representative of the medical \ninsurance industry. The remaining members would be experts in health \neconomics, actuarial science, or other sectors of the health care \nsystem.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment was not included, at the insistence of \none member of our caucus. I look forward to working with conferees to \nfind some way to ensure that more Americans are protected from unfair \npremium increases.\n  With all the debate over offsets, CBO projections, premiums, and \nmatching funds, it is easy to forget that at the end of the day, we are \ntalking about people. The bill we are debating, I believe, will save \nlives.\n  A lack of health insurance is more than an inconvenience; it can be \ndeadly. Americans age 64 and under who lack health insurance have a 40-\npercent higher risk of death than those who have coverage. This is Dr. \nDavid Himmelstein from a Harvard Medical School Study of September \n2009.\n  These are real people, who die earlier than they need to because of \nproblems getting coverage and problems with our health care system. \nExpanding health coverage is a moral issue, one that, I believe, \nreflects the character of our Nation. In the richest country in the \nworld, no one should die because they cannot afford health coverage.\n  For all of this bill's imperfections, I am convinced that it will \nmean the difference between life and death for some people. And it is \nnot every day that we can say that about a piece of legislation.\n  We could not pass up this opportunity.\n  I have joined my colleagues in supporting this bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today is a historic day. After decades \nof discussions and promises, we have taken a giant step forward in \nproviding universal access to health care. I was proud to vote for the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It extends coverage to 31 \nmillion Americans who don't have health insurance now.\n  Our bill is a step forward in achieving my four principles of health \ncare reform: saving and strengthening Medicare; ending punitive \ninsurance company practices that deny coverage based on preexisting \nhealth conditions, age and gender; providing universal access; and \nemphasizing quality, prevention and integrative health to save lives \nand save money.\n  I like the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because it \nsaves and strengthens Medicare. The bill extends Medicare solvency; \npromotes care based on value not volume; closes the prescription drug \ncoverage gap with a 50-percent discount on brand-name medications for \nseniors who fall into the gap; stops insurance companies from charging \nseniors four or five times more for insurance than young people; and \nremoves the cost barrier to preventive care by eliminating deductibles, \ncopayments and other cost sharing for seniors.\n  This bill helps the good guy businesses that want to provide \ninsurance, but can't because it costs too much. I come from a small \nbusiness family. My father was a grocer and my grandmother ran a small \nbakery. So I grew up in a family that knew what it was to face a weekly \npayroll.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act protects small \nbusinesses with fewer than 50 employees. It gives them tax credits to \nbe able to afford insurance for their employees. The Senate bill \ncreates new insurance exchanges for small businesses and individuals \nwho don't get insurance through work. It is like an online shopping \nmall for insurance. It provides individuals and businesses the same \nbargaining power as if they were a large group. It gives them the \nchoice and the opportunity to select the best plan they can afford with \nthe care that best meets their needs.\n  The Senate bill promotes cost savings and greater doctor-patient \nsatisfaction through administrative simplification. The bill creates \nsingle standards for electronic transactions that will mean less \npaperwork and more doctor-patient time.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will control costs \nthrough a new emphasis on integrative health, prevention, and quality. \nNew funding for wellness and prevention programs will support \ninnovative approaches. That includes local initiatives using grassroots \nstrategies to create healthier communities.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also improves the \nquality of care. As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, I was charged with establishing our bill's \nsection on improving quality and delivery systems in health care. This \nsection creates a national strategy to improve lives, save lives and \nreduce costs. This is achieved by promoting best practices like \nsimplifying drug labels, and promoting discharge planning and \nmedication management. These practices save money and improve patient \noutcomes through reduced hospital readmissions, improved patient \nsafety, and better care coordination.\n  For example, the Senate bill creates grants to identify, disseminate, \nand implement innovative best practices to local providers and \npatients. One such practice is the Pronovost Checklist from Dr. Peter \nPronovost at Johns Hopkins University. He developed simple steps to \nproperly insert a catheter and eliminate line infections. When used in \nMichigan for 1 year, it saved 2,000 lives and $200 million. We make his \nchecklist--and others like it--available to hospitals across the \ncountry\n  We also expand the use of medical homes by establishing community \nhealth teams. These teams include providers from the primary care \nphysician to specialists and nutritionists. In North Carolina, medical \nhomes save $175 million each year. Our bill makes medical homes \navailable across the country. These provisions--and more like them--not \nonly save lives, they save money.\n  I am particularly proud of my women's preventive health amendment \nincluded in this bill. Right now, women pay more and get less in health \ncare. For far too long, many insurance companies have treated simply \nbeing a woman as a pre-existing condition. They have used every trick \nin the book to deny coverage to women.\n  The Mikulski amendment guarantees access to preventive tests that \nsave money and save women's lives. It requires insurance companies to \ncover preventive care and screenings at no added cost to women.\n  Without my amendment, there would be no guarantee that women under 50 \nwould be covered for mammograms, no guarantee of an annual women's \nhealth exam that would include screenings for heart disease, and no \nguarantee that women would have access to this preventive care at no \ncost.\n  In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act I stood up for \nMaryland. I preserved the Maryland Medicare waiver, which I authored \nmore than 30 years ago. This Maryland waiver is crucial in allowing \nhospitals to provide uncompensated care without jeopardizing their own \nfinancial stability.\n  What else does this health care reform bill mean for Maryland? It \nmeans that more than 1 million Marylanders who aren't covered now will \nhave access to affordable insurance. It gives a helping hand to 50,000 \nsmall businesses in Maryland. It means lower costs for the 130,000 \nMarylanders who fall into Medicare's prescription drug coverage gap. It \nmeans that young adults in Maryland can stay on their parents' policies \nuntil they are 26 and that they'll have access to affordable coverage \nafter that.\n  It means that families who are just a layoff, a job switch or an \nillness away\n\n[[Page S14132]]\n\nfrom losing coverage will have health care stability and security. It \nmeans that if you like the insurance you have now, you can keep it. Or \nif you don't have it, you can get it.\n  And it means that health care reform will be affordable to families \nand to the nation. We can't let health care bankrupt our families or \nthe government. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says the \nSenate bill will reduce the deficit by $132 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  And while I support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, I \nhave some serious yellow flashing lights. I hope these issues will be \nresolved in a more favorable way in conference.\n  I am for a more robust and transparent public framework to ensure \ncompetition and choice in the marketplace. I like public options. Two \nof my favorite public options are Social Security and Medicare. The \nSenate bill creates a lot of new customers for insurance companies by \nmandating insurance coverage. But like big banks, insurance companies \ndon't show remorse for past transgressions. We can't simply trust them \nto do the right thing. The Senate bill relies heavily on regulation to \nachieve what could be done with a public framework. I prefer the House \npublic option.\n  I also continue to oppose the excise tax included in the Senate bill. \nI am not for taxing the health care benefits of retired public \nemployees and union members to pay for health reform. Some call them \nCadillac plans. I call it a ``Clunker Idea.'' The excise tax will just \nshift costs onto workers through higher deductibles, copayments, and \nless generous coverage. I am against this back-door tax on middle \nAmerica & retirees. Again, I prefer the House version on this.\n  So we have some work to do.\n  I will keep fighting for health care reform. Because it is absolutely \nterrible when you hear--I am sorry your insurance doesn't cover that. \nIt is horrifying when you have no insurance at all because you lost \nyour job or your benefits and you face losing your life savings to pay \nfor the care you need.\n  I can assure you I will be fighting on the side of Maryland and the \nAmerican people to complete health care reform in early 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/24/senate-section/article/S14132-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14132-S14134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONTINUED FINANCING OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are 39. \nUnder the previous order requiring 60 votes for the passage of this \nact, the act is passed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have debated whether to increase the \namount of money the Federal Government can borrow at the same time that \nwe created a massive new entitlement program that will cost the Federal \ntaxpayer trillions of dollars over the coming decade.\n  Sponsors of the Reid bill have claimed that their bill would reduce \nthe deficit and extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. We \nheard today from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that these \nclaims are false.\n  In reviewing the Reid bill, CBO stated that claims that the bill \nwould both improve the government's ability to pay future Medicare \nbenefits and financing new spending outside of Medicare would double \ncount a large share of those savings and overstate the improvement in \nthe government's fiscal position.\n  My Republican colleagues and I have argued for 3 weeks now that the \nReid bill takes money from Medicare and spends it on a new, \nunsustainable health care entitlement. Instead of strengthening the \nMedicare Program, today we received confirmation that the Reid bill \nrobs Medicare to the tune of nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion and threatens its \nsolvency.\n  CBO has said that this robbery does not really strengthen the \nsolvency of the Medicare Program. Instead the bill uses government \naccounting gimmicks to merely make it look like it is doing something \nto help the Medicare Program.\n  The Reid bill cuts $470 billion from the Medicare Program. Rather \nthan reserving those monies to pay for future Medicare benefits, the \nbill spends those monies to pay for a new program to provide health \ninsurance for the uninsured.\n  But because of government accounting rules, any savings are assumed \nto be used to purchase government bonds that will be saved to pay for \nfuture expenses. That allows sponsors of the bill to claim that they \nare extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate, I find it disturbing to see the \ngovernment using its accounting rules to allow it to spend these \nsavings twice. The sponsors of the Reid bill are counting the savings \ntowards the Medicare Program at the same time those monies are being \nspent to pay for other Federal spending.\n  This would constitute fraud in the private sector. If they had to \ncome under the same laws as private business, the administration and \nCongress would go to jail.\n  If there is any doubt, listen to what the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid:\n\n        Unified budget accounting shows that the majority of the \n     [Medicare] trust fund savings would be used to pay for other \n     spending under the [Reid bill] and would not enhance the \n     ability of the government to redeem the bonds credited to the \n     trust fund to pay for future Medicare benefits.\n\n  This means the claim that the Reid bill strengthens Medicare is \nfalse. The bill robs Medicare to pay for new spending.\n  Unfortunately this example of government accounting is just one \nexample of the growing problems that our Nation faces. Our Nation's \ndebt is now more than $12 trillion and our deficit for fiscal year 2009 \nwas over $1.4 trillion. As a percentage of the economy, our deficit is \n10 percent of GDP--the highest it has been since the Second World War. \nWe are faced with increasing the debt limit at a time when our Nation's \ncredit card is maxed out.\n  I worry about the country that I am leaving for my children and \ngrandchildren. Our Nation is being buried under a mountain of debt, \nwhich poses\n\n[[Page S14133]]\n\na deadly threat to the future of our Nation.\n  The government will make up the current deficit by borrowing more \nmoney, mostly from China and other foreign governments. These levels of \ndebt are not sustainable. The Chinese Government already made it very \nclear that they are growing apprehensive about our ability to pay these \ndebts.\n  As China's apprehension grows, the interest rates we pay on our debt \nwill grow. That means that it will soon cost us considerably more to \nallow Washington to continue to borrow the money it needs to fund its \ncurrent spending binge.\n  As the Chinese Government grows concerned about financing \nWashington's appetite for rampant spending, it should give everyone in \nthis Chamber pause. Our most fundamental duty as Members of Congress is \nto wisely manage the power of the purse for our Nation. Congress is \ncurrently failing to carry out this obligation.\n  According to David Walker, the former head of the GAO, at the end of \nfiscal 2000, the Federal Government had about $20.4 trillion in total \nliabilities, commitments, and unfunded promises for Social Security and \nMedicare. That number rose to $56.4 trillion at the end of fiscal \n2008--a 176-percent increase in just 8 years. By the end of this year, \nthat number is expected to have risen to $63 trillion.\n\n  On January 15 of this year, the Senate Budget Committee held a \nhearing on the long-term outlook for Federal debt. We heard testimony \nfrom a bipartisan panel of experts, including Dr. Richard Berner, chief \nglobal economist for Morgan Stanley; Dr. Allen Sinai, president and \nchief global economist/strategist for Decision Economics, Inc.; and Dr. \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, former Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  Some of these economists were Democrats and some were Republicans, \nyet all three agreed that the long-term outlook for U.S. debt was grim \nand that our Nation's creditworthiness was at risk without a plan to \naddress the costs of future entitlements and the multiple bailout/\nstimulus proposals Congress has passed.\n  All three panelists endorsed bipartisan commission concepts to \naddress entitlement spending such as the one sponsored by Senators \nConrad and Gregg. And the experts all agreed that the current budget \nprocess needs to be reformed to remove incentives to deficit spend. Yet \nnone of those recommendations are evident in the legislation we are \nvoting on today.\n  Dr. Sinai--one of the Democrat's invited witnesses from that day--\ntestified that we have exceeded several tipping points in \ncreditworthiness in the U.S. economy, but the only reason we don't feel \nthe effects of it now is because ``everyone else is drowning too'' and \ninvestors are fleeing to quality. But how long can that continue?\n  Further, Dr. Sinai states:\n\n       The deficit and debt prospects under almost any scenario \n     are daunting, with deficit-to-GDP and debt-to-GDP ratios not \n     seen before in a G-7 country. This territory is uncharted \n     with no real historical analogue to this kind of financial \n     situation for a major global economic power. . . The answer \n     to whether the U.S. can afford all of the initiatives on its \n     wish list--economic, societal, defense, and otherwise--is no.\n\n  Dr. Holtz-Eakin echoed similar statements from other panelists and \nstrongly urged Congress to adopt a plan that conveys to markets a clear \npath for stabilizing and reducing the debt burden.\n  That panel appeared before us in January, but we still lack any \ncoherent plan to stabilize our debt. Just last week on Tuesday, Dec. \n14, the Peterson-Pew Commission released its first report, Red Ink \nRising: A Call to Action to Stem the Mounting Federal Debt, which \nencourages lawmakers to act immediately to stabilize the national debt.\n  Crafted over the past year by former heads of the CBO, OMB, GAO, and \nthe congressional budget committees, the report strongly urges Congress \nand the President to commit immediately to stabilize the debt at 60 \npercent of GDP by 2018 and develop a specific and credible debt \nstabilization package in 2010. But there is nothing in this debt limit \nbill that does either of these things.\n  Some Senators will argue today that raising the debt ceiling is the \nonly fiscally responsible choice before us. I disagree. A vote to raise \nthe debt ceiling is merely a vote to raise taxes on our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  This cycle of kicking our responsibilities to the next generation \nmust stop and it must stop today. In my view, the only fiscally \nresponsible choice is to live within our means and balance our Federal \nbudget.\n  A newspaper columnist, Diane Badget from Lovell, WY, said it best \nwhen she wrote how her mother would react to what is happening in \nWashington today. Diane wrote, ``Momma always said, `If you don't have \nenough money to buy a quart of milk you don't take someone else's hard-\nearned cash and buy ice cream.' ''\n  If we fail to heed that warning, we will be responsible for passing \nalong unsustainable costs and obligations to our children and \ngrandchildren. That is where the Reid bill is taking our country.\n  The only remaining question is whether we will have the courage to \nstop this process and preserve our Nation's strength for future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my great concern \nabout the need for the legislation before us, which would increase the \nNation's debt limit.\n  It is sad and disturbing that the last vote we will take this year \nbefore recessing for the Christmas holiday is one to increase the \nalready almost unimaginably high $12 trillion debt ceiling.\n  What a horrible gift to deliver to the American taxpayer on this \nChristmas Eve. In a season when most families have cut back their own \nspending and, in many cases, cut up their own credit cards, the \nDemocratic majority is asking us to increase the Nation's credit card \nlimit so that they can continue to take on more debt to cover their \nvoracious appetite for spending.\n  Up until a few days ago, the Democratic leadership was actually \nlooking for a way to increase the debt limit by more than $1.8 \ntrillion, which would have been more than twice as much as the largest \nprevious increase in the debt limit. They were looking for a virtual \nblank check to continue their unrestrained deficit spending all the way \nthrough next year's election.\n  The fact that the majority party could not come to a consensus among \nits own ranks on this outrageous plan is evidence enough of the \nbrashness and hubris of the other side. Apparently, even a drunken \nsailor can be embarrassed enough to show a modicum of restraint if the \nprice tag is high enough.\n  Plain and simple, we need to take control of this out-of-control \ngovernment spending before we see the hopes and dreams of our children, \ngrandchildren, and all subsequent generations of Americans dashed \nagainst the rocks.\n  Federal spending is now taking the largest share of our national \nincome since the early 1950s and the current deficit is as large as it \nhas been since World War II. This is bad enough, Mr. President, but \nthere is no end in sight to the profligacy.\n  Based on current projections, which will probably get much worse, 10 \nyears from now it will be shown that this President and this Democratic \nmajority have left a shameful legacy. The CBO estimates that in 2019, \nthe Federal deficit will still be over $1 trillion for that 1 year and \nthat our total national debt will be over $20 trillion. Most of our new \nborrowing will be needed just to pay interest on the previous debt.\n  At some nearby place, which we are fast approaching, we will reach a \ntipping point where we will be in total bondage to this debt. When we \nget to the time that we are borrowing vast and ever-increasing sums \njust to pay the interest on previous debt, the hopes of ever escaping \nfrom the vortex of financial destruction will fade and we will have \nconsigned the next generations to a permanent substandard of living.\n  The other side keeps making the pathetically lame excuse that they \ninherited eight years of bad economic policy, which they say is the \nreal culprit of our fiscal problems. What is conveniently forgotten \naround here is the fact that the final two of those eight years were \nunder a Democratically led Congress.\n  I am the first to admit that Republicans in Congress were too eager \nto spend and that President Bush should have wielded his veto pen more \naggressively. There is some accountability\n\n[[Page S14134]]\n\nthere. But let us face it, our side are rank amateurs compared to the \nconsummate spenders we now have in charge.\n  For proof, we need look no further than the President's budget, the \ntrillion dollar stimulus bill, this $2.5 trillion health care bill, and \nthe recent $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill with its double digit \npercentage increases over last year's spending. The deficit has grown \nexponentially this year alone.\n  The numbers themselves tell the story. The Treasury Department's \nMonthly Treasury Statement for November shows a deficit over the first \ntwo months of this new fiscal year alone of nearly $300 billion. This \n2-month deficit is greater than the full-year deficits in 2002, 2006, \nand 2007, which, by the way, are part of the past eight years that were \nsupposed to represent the ultimate in reckless spending.\n  I am scared. All Americans should be frightened as well. We are on an \nunstable raft in the middle of an increasingly raging river. The \ncurrents are swirling around us and we are beginning to lose control of \nwhere we are going. Sharp rocks are starting to appear in the river \nthat threaten our destruction.\n  Our alarm grows as we begin to hear a sound off in the distance that \nslowly gets louder as we head downstream on these increasingly wild \nrapids. The sound we hear is the cataract that represents our fall from \nthe greatest nation in the history of mankind to that of a second-rate \nplayer on the world stage. Can you hear it? Can we find a way to turn \nthis boat around before it is too late to avoid the fall? Many of my \nfellow Utahns can hear it and they are begging me to find a way to get \nus off this destructive course and get us back to safe waters.\n  The first step is to reject this debt limit increase. Let us cut up \nthe credit card and stop this frightening spending spree before it \ntakes us to the precipice.\n  It is a good thing we are recessing for a few days. The Members of \nthis Senate need to go home and get a reality check from those who have \nsent us here. I hope that over the recess each of us will get a \nmessage, loud and clear, from our recession and debt-weary constituents \nthat they are sick and tired of this fiscal irresponsibility. They are \ndemanding change, and they will get it, one way or the other.\n  I hope that in the new year, we can consider these messages and find \na new resolve to come together, to find the restraint that is simply \nlacking now, and to reverse this reckless spending so we do not send \nour country down the river.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Madam President, during the consideration of \nthe health care bill, one of my primary concerns has been ensuring that \nthe longstanding Hyde amendment would be incorporated into the bill. I \nhave strongly held views on the subject, and I fought hard to prevent \ntax dollars from being used to subsidize abortions.\n  I was pleased that the House included strong abortion provisions in \nits health care bill in the form of the Stupak amendment. I modified \nthis language to meet the Senate bill and offered the Nelson-Hatch-\nCasey amendment to prohibit Federal funding of abortion, and I was \ndisappointed to see that amendment was tabled by a vote of 54 to 45.\n  I knew then that the underlying bill did not adequately prohibit \nFederal funding of abortion and, consequently, I would not be able to \nsupport it. So I began to look for other language to accomplish the \ngoal that no public funds should cover abortion in the new health care \nbill. After long days of negotiations, I believe we came up with a true \ncompromise that stays faithful to my principles.\n  I want to be clear, I stuck to my guns and stood for my pro-life \nprinciples. I did not look for weaker language. I looked for clearer \nlanguage, and my goal stayed the same: to maintain the standard that we \nhave had in Federal law since the mid-1970s.\n  While I respect the opinion of the Senator from Kansas, I have to \nrespectfully disagree. The Senate language fully upholds the Hyde \nprinciple like the language in the House bill. The wording may be \ndifferent, but the principle is, in fact, upheld.\n  Under the health care bill, if you cannot afford insurance, you will \nreceive Federal assistance to help pay for a private health care plan. \nThe Stupak language prohibits that Federal assistance from paying for \ninsurance that covers abortions. If you like a plan that covers \nabortion, you must purchase a rider or an endorsement to your plan with \nyour own funds. You could do that as well by writing just one check to \nthe insurer. For that you get a separate piece of paper addressing \nabortion.\n  The Senate language, with my added compromise, also prohibits Federal \nfunds from paying for private insurance that covers abortion. The only \ndifference is that in the Senate bill, if you are receiving Federal \nassistance to buy insurance, and if that plan has any abortion \ncoverage, the insurance company must bill you separately, and you must \npay separately from your own personal funds--perhaps a credit card \ntransaction, your separate personal check, or automatic withdrawal from \nyour bank account--for that abortion coverage.\n  Now, let me say that again. You have to write two checks: one for the \nbasic policy and one for the additional coverage for abortion. The \nlatter has to be entirely from personal funds.\n  So under both the Stupak and the new Senate language, no Federal \nfunds can be used to pay for a plan that covers abortion, and if you \nchoose to purchase abortion coverage--if it is available--you must pay \nout of your own pocket.\n  Furthermore, the Senate language allows States the right to ban \npublic and private insurance from supplying abortion coverage. Already, \n12 States ban abortion coverage on public plans and 5 States ban \nabortion coverage on both private and public plans. So, in short, the \nSenate bill ensures, once again, no Federal funds would be used for \nabortion.\n  I would like to note that the Senate bill goes beyond Stupak in two \nlife-promoting ways. One, it adds funding to support pregnant and \nparenting teens and women and, two, it expands the adoption tax credit \nto help adoptive parents with the considerable expense of adoption by \nmaking that credit a refundable tax credit. This means many potential \nparents who lack the regular resources to adopt will now be in a better \nposition to do so.\n\n  The Senate bill also contains the same strong conscience protections \nincluded in the Stupak language. We tried winning approval for the \nNelson-Hatch-Casey abortion language in the Senate, but we were \nunsuccessful. However, we did not give up. I know people have very \nstrong feelings about the issue of abortion, and I respect those who \ndisagree with my position, but I could not support health reform that \ndid not maintain the 30-year standard barring public funding of \nabortion. I did not compromise my pro-life principles; we just found \ndifferent wording, different language, and both will work. I believe \npeople will see that no public funding will go to abortion.\n  In addition, my provision empowers the States to pass laws banning \nthe sale of insurance that covers abortion. We make it clear that this \nnew law, this new bill does not in any way preempt the rights of States \nto be able to continue to make that ban in the decisions they might \nmake legislatively, and we want to make certain there is no doubt but \nthat this bill has no preemption of the States rights.\n  Despite what some partisans and talk show hosts say in their scare \ntactics, the conscience clause remains. Also, despite what those same \npeople and even some of my colleagues have said, the bottom line is \nthat the Senate health care bill will not allow taxpayer money to pay \nfor abortion, period.\n\n[[Page S14135]]\n\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/24/senate-section/article/S14135-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14135-S14136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which, in a historic \nvote only an hour and a half ago, the Senate overwhelmingly passed. I \nwish to talk for a moment about how that bill will improve the health \nof children across our country, particularly for children in my State \nof Ohio.\n  Ohio is home to six of the best children's hospitals that house a \ncombined 1,749 beds. Ohio is also home to 218,400 uninsured children. \nThe health reform bill which we have been debating on this Senate floor \nfor 26 straight days will help cover Ohio's uninsured children and help \nour children's hospitals provide the right care at the right time in \nthe right place. This legislation will make sure the children have \naccess to oral and vision care. It will keep children healthy by \neliminating copays and deductibles for recommended preventive care.\n  Similarly, in the Medicare section of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, senior citizens in Olympia, Redmond, Seattle, \nCleveland, Akron, and Canton will be able to get free mammograms and \ncolonoscopies and preventive care and annual checkups. Children, too, \nunder this legislation will have copays and deductibles eliminated for \nrecommended preventive care.\n  It will extend the Children's Health Insurance Program for an \nadditional 2 years and provide States with additional funding to ensure \nchildren have access to this program. It will increase the number of \npediatric primary care physicians and pediatric specialists. And we now \nknow how important it is, as I learned at Akron's Children's Hospital a \ndecade and a half ago, that the government assist in helping with \ntraining and providing funding through Medicare and through \nappropriations to train pediatric primary care physicians and \nspecialists.\n  Perhaps most important of all is this legislation will do something \nSenator Lautenberg, Representative Schwartz, and I have tried to do for \n3 years: it will eliminate immediately the preexisting coverage \nexclusion for children. For the past two Congresses, Senator \nLautenberg, Representative Schwartz, and I have introduced the \nChildren's Health Protection Act, legislation that would prevent \ninsurers from denying children needed medical care.\n  Twenty percent of school-age children suffer from a chronic illness--\n20 percent. All too often, these children face challenges accessing \naffordable and adequate health insurance due to their preexisting \nconditions. Children have preexisting conditions too. Yet children with \npreexisting conditions are so often denied medical insurance by \ninsurance companies.\n  Our bill, which is largely included in the Senate health reform \nlegislation which we passed an hour and a half ago, would ensure \nchildren suffering from chronic and debilitating and life-threatening \nillnesses have access to comprehensive and affordable health care \ncoverage.\n  This bill will help children such as Shaunell Johnson from Ohio. When \nher parents were unable to care for her, Shaunell was adopted by her \ngrandparents, Dorothy and Jack Johnson. Because their income exceeded \nthe limits for medical income eligibility, they turned to the private \nhealth insurance market for Shaunell. However, due to her asthma, a \npreexisting condition, the Johnsons were unable to afford health \ninsurance because they earn more than would qualify Shaunell for \nMedicaid but they don't earn enough to afford the $8,700 a year for \nprivate insurance coverage for a child with a preexisting condition.\n  Children with serious medical conditions shouldn't be cherry-picked \nout of health insurance policies while their families struggle to \nprovide care and pay medical bills.\n  The time has come for Congress to act on behalf of children such as \nShaunell and the Senate has acted today.\n  We must insure that children most in need are no longer denied access \nto health coverage. We must immediately prevent the insurance industry \nfrom denying millions of children the health care they need.\n  The health care reform legislation we passed an hour and a half ago \nwill do that.\n  Let me explain again why this matters and give some examples. A woman \nnamed Renee has a 5-year old boy in Ohio with hydrocephalus. He has a \nshunt that drains the fluid from his brain down to his belly. That \nsaid, he is a healthy, smart, and extremely happy little boy.\n  His neurosurgeon said he is truly a best-case scenario--very healthy. \nHowever, no insurance company will take him--no quote, no interest in \nlooking at his medical charts, nothing.\n  Renee said her family is truly left with no options for health care, \nunless she and her husband close down their business and go to work for \ncorporate America and get in a huge health insurance pool plan.\n  Renee, writing about her son, says she can't get him health insurance \nbecause he has a preexisting condition. This bill, as soon as the \nPresident signs it, will say to the health insurance industry: You can \nno longer deny, refuse, or lock out insurance for a family because they \nhave a child with a preexisting condition.\n  Think of the progress and of the thousands whom I mentioned in the \nbeginning and the 1,700 children's hospital beds in the children's \nhospitals in my State. There are 200,000 uninsured children in Ohio. \nMany of them are sick enough that they are deemed by the insurance \ncompany as having a preexisting condition. No longer.\n  When the President signs this bill in January, children from Seattle \nto Cleveland, from Cincinnati to Tacoma, will be able to be on their \nparents' health insurance policy and be able to get the coverage they \nneed.\n  I will share two other stories.\n  Laurie writes:\n\n       As a mother who had to deal with a baby born with problems \n     and had many days of hospital stays, and many months of in-\n     and-out-of appointments and check-ups, I realized the vital \n     importance of health care.\n       I was one of the lucky ones I guess, as I did have good \n     insurance at the time.\n       As a healthcare provider myself, I see too often parents \n     not being able to get their child seen [by a physician] due \n     to lack of insurance that does not cover the costs of \n     anything true.\n\n  It is our children who will be our future and those in Congress' \nfuture. When will enough be enough?\n  An hour and a half ago, we answered that question, when will enough \nbe enough, when we made this decision collectively--60 of us, an \noverwhelming majority in the Senate--that children with preexisting \nconditions will no longer be denied health insurance.\n  Cassandra, a 14-year-old from Toledo, is uninsured simply because she \nis sick. She suffers from seizures and, as a result, no insurance \ncompany will cover her.\n  Cassandra is a nationally ranked figure skater and once skated with \nMichelle Kwan, but after selling their home and everything else they \nown and putting $30,000 on their credit cards just to pay for \nCassandra's care, the family had to finally sell her ice skating \nequipment on eBay.\n  Her parents do everything they can to protect their daughter, \nincluding buying dim lights and blackout drapes and making sure there \naren't too many breakable items in the house.\n  Cassandra gets treatment for her seizures through the State's Bureau \nfor Children's Medical Handicaps, but they are on their own for \nCassandra's basic medical needs.\n\n[[Page S14136]]\n\n  Cassandra's life will get better. Her family's life will get better \nbecause of what the Senate did an hour and a half ago. When the \nPresident signs the bill, she will not be denied insurance for a \npreexisting condition. Her family will be able to pay--at a reasonable \ncost--for insurance so Cassandra will not have to rely on this State \nprogram that only takes care of procedures but can get the \ncomprehensive care she and every other child in this country deserve.\n  That is why I introduced this amendment, and that is why Senator \nLautenberg and I worked on this legislation.\n  Every year in my State, over 2 million kids are treated at Ohio's \nchildren's hospitals. Next year will be the first year that, when they \nleave the hospital, they will not have to worry about insurance \ncompanies denying them care based on a preexisting condition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/24/senate-section/article/S14136-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMPREHENSIVE IRAN SANCTIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND DIVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr REID. I want to speak today about S.2799, the Comprehensive Iran \nSanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2009. This important \npiece of legislation, which combines legislation written by Senator \nDodd with legislation introduced by Senators Bayh, Lieberman and Kyl, \nwas passed by the Banking Committee earlier this month. It would impose \nnew sanctions on Iran's refined petroleum sector and tighten existing \nU.S. sanctions in an effort to create new pressure on the Iranian \nregime and help stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  I know that Senator Kerry, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, has been working hard, along with other colleagues, to get a \nUC agreement so we can get this legislation passed. I understand that \nwe are making good progress towards reaching that goal.\n  As we move forward with these negotiations, I want everyone to know \nthat I am committed to getting this legislation to the floor sometime \nafter we return in January.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the majority leader for all of his help in trying \nto move this legislation forward. This comprehensive sanctions \nlegislation would arm the administration with critical tools to apply \nadditional pressure on the Iranian regime and disrupt its proliferation \nand terrorist activities at a pivotal time--a time when Iran's leaders \ncontinue to flaunt the will of the international community, trample on \nthe rights of its own people, and threaten the national interests of \nthe United States and our strongest allies, including Israel.\n  It is now clearer than ever that tougher sanctions must be a key \nelement of our comprehensive Iran strategy going forward. My primary \ngoal with this bill is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear \nweapons capability. That is why this measure passed the Senate Banking \nCommittee unanimously in October, and I had hoped that we would be able \nto consider it in the Senate and move toward a conference with the \nHouse before we went out for the holidays. While I would have strongly \npreferred that, I recognize that given the delays on health care \nreform, we will not now have time to do that. I am also aware that the \nadministration continues to have some concerns about how to create \nincentives in the bill for countries to cooperate more closely with \nU.S. efforts to impose tough new multilateral sanctions. I believe we \nhave made some progress in our discussions of recent days, and I am \ngrateful that the majority leader has indicated his willingness to move \nforward on the bill as soon as possible after we return.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate Senator Reid's commitment to move forward \nwith this legislation and his support of the progress we are making \ntowards a UC agreement. We all share the goal of creating maximum \nleverage in our efforts to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear \nweapon--this is a vital national security goal of the United States, \nand obviously of critical importance to our allies in Israel and around \nthe world.\n  I believe that this legislation has the potential to make an \nimportant contribution to that effort. Having the Senate stand united \nwith the administration behind this legislation would send a very \nstrong and positive signal. That is why many of us are committed to \nworking with the administration and the bill's sponsors to craft an \namendment that all can agree on. I know these discussions will be \ncontinuing during recess with the intention of reaching a mutually \nagreeable resolution so that this legislation can be considered as soon \nas possible when we get back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/24/senate-section/article/S14136-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CHARLES E. BRUEGGEMAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today I would like to recognize the \nextraordinary work of First Deputy Director Charles E. Brueggemann of \nthe Illinois State Police. Mr. Brueggeman has served with distinction \nfor 25 years with the Illinois State Police, including as second in \ncommand of the department since April 1, 2008.\n  Mr. Brueggemann began his outstanding career with the Illinois State \nPolice in 1985, serving in patrol, as well as a variety of \ninvestigative positions to include narcotics, homicides and crimes \nagainst persons. He also served during his tenure in management \npositions that contributed greatly to the department and community he \nserved. Those positions included district commander, executive officer, \nassistant deputy director, deputy director and first deputy director.\n  As first deputy director, Mr. Brueggemann oversaw the agency's five \ndivisions--operations, forensics, information and technology command, \ninternal investigations, and administration. He was responsible for the \noversight of the director's principal advisors assigned to legislative \naffairs, public information, inspections and budget.\n  In his prior position, Mr. Brueggemann had oversight of the \noperations division, with wide-ranging responsibilities including \npatrol, investigations, homeland security and gaming. While serving in \nthat capacity, Mr. Brueggemann was charged with coordinating a plan to \nreduce highway fatalities. Under his leadership, the division developed \na remarkable strategy that reduced highway crashes to their lowest \nlevel in 87 years.\n  In other honors, he was selected in 2005 by the FBI to attend a \ncounterterrorism leadership program that involved traveling abroad with \nseven other major city, State, and Federal law enforcement executives \nto share information and open lines of communications between different \nnations in the fight against terrorism. Law enforcement officials from \nScotland, England, Northern Ireland, and Canada also participated.\n  Mr. Brueggemann received his bachelors degree from McKendree \nUniversity and a masters degree in Homeland Defense and Security from \nthe Naval Postgraduate School. Married for more than two decades to his \nwife Susan, they have two daughters Beth and Ali.\n  I congratulate Mr. Brueggeman on his retirement and thank him for his \nservice to the people of Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/24/senate-section/article/S14136-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14136-S14137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATE PARLIAMENTARIANS\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, one of the important officers in the \nSenate is the Senate Parliamentarian. The Senate rules are arcane and \noften vague, and the Parliamentarian is responsible for making sure \nthey are properly applied. Our four Parliamentarians put in long, \nthankless hours in service to their country. They get no glory, no \npublic accolades. They rarely get high fives for getting the rulings \nright, but we are always too happy to tell them when we think they got \nit wrong. Often our disagreement is not with the Parliamentarians, but \nwith the precedents themselves.\n  The Senate often chooses to sidestep its rules, creating precedents \nthat become loopholes in the rules, which bind the Parliamentarian in \nthe future. We should be careful to avoid these situations because we \ncan unwittingly trample on the right of the minority.\n  I want to make it clear that while I do have occasional disagreements \nwith the Parliamentarian's office, I still believe they are doing their \nbest to be fair and to apply the rules and precedents as they see them.\n\n[[Page S14137]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/24/senate-section/article/S14137-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Corporal Xhacob LaTorre\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto mark the passing and honor the service of Marine CPL Xhacob LaTorre \nof Waterbury, CT.\n  Corporal LaTorre died this week of wounds he sustained from a \nroadside bomb while on patrol in Afghanistan's Helmand province. He \nwould have celebrated his 22nd birthday last Saturday.\n  Corporal LaTorre graduated from Crosby High School where he was \nactive in the ROTC program. A born leader, he joined the Marine Corps \nin 2005. He was on his third tour of duty, having served two tours in \nIraq and was awarded a good conduct citation and a Purple Heart.\n  In his too short time, Corporal LaTorre proved himself as a soldier \nand a patriot. The bravery and dedication he showed as a marine, \nhowever, was just one side of his personality. To his friends and \nfamily, Xhacob will be remembered as an outgoing and energetic young \nman with a kind heart, a penchant for mischief, and an infectious sense \nof humor.\n  As a young boy, Xhacob earned pocket money by going from table to \ntable at a restaurant, charming patrons and earning a dollar for each \njoke he told.\n  That young boy grew into a man of integrity and courage. His service \nand his sacrifice are a credit to his parents, Daniel and Nicole. I \nknow how proud they are of him, and I hope they know that we grieve \nalongside them. They, along with Xhacob's wife, Frances, and his young \nson, Javier, are in our hearts.\n  It may seem at times a sad irony that our best and brightest young \nmen and women are the ones who go into battle and sometimes do not come \nhome, having given their lives in service to their country. But that is \nwhat keeps our Nation strong and free.\n  All of us in Connecticut and across America mourn the loss of CPL \nXhacob LaTorre. And none of us will ever forget the debt of gratitude \nwe owe to him and his family.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the attached \narticles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Family and Friends Say Goodbye to Fallen Marine\n\n                    (By Amanda Raus and Doug Greene)\n\n       Family, friends and fellow Marines went to the Chase \n     Parkway Memorial on Wednesday to pay their respects to \n     Corporal Xhacob LaTorre, a proud Marine dedicated to serving \n     his country who lost his life fighting for it.\n       On Thursday morning, the Patriot Riders were there, with \n     flags to salute the fallen Marine on a bitterly cold December \n     morning.\n       ``It is a very sad day for us,'' LaTorre's aunt, Carmen \n     Lasalle, said. ``May God help us all overcome such a big \n     loss. We will make sure we all teach little Javy the same \n     values we taught you and from Heaven where you will be \n     resting in peace and looking after your son and wife, I hope \n     to feel your smile.''\n       ``It's deeply moving, a debt of honor. We're indebted to \n     him for the service he's provided to our country,'' said \n     Peter Verseckas, a former Naval Reserve man on Wednesday.\n       LaTorre was in his third tour of duty, stationed in \n     Afghanistan, when he was injured by a terrorist bomb in \n     August. He lost both his legs but never lost his spirit. For \n     four months he fought for his life with his wife, Frances, by \n     his side the whole time.\n       ``I got the call he was going to die at any moment. I went \n     running, and I was there, and as soon as I got there, he \n     died,'' said Frances LaTorre.\n       Even at the very end, LaTorre was happy. That's how his \n     family always knew him to be. They say he was a fun-loving \n     person who put others before himself.\n       ``He was wonderful, he was always there for everyone. Every \n     person that he touched was special, special to him,'' said \n     his aunt, Carmen LaSalle.\n       The people most special and closest to his heart were his \n     family members, especially his 18-month-old son Javier. \n     Frances says he's already a spitting image of his father.\n       ``He looks just like him. He does a lot of the same things \n     his father does,'' she said.\n       ``To me, it's like he never left. Seeing his son, is seeing \n     him grow up all over again,'' said Xhacob's brother, Danny \n     LaTorre.\n       And while they watch Javier grow, they'll remember the \n     dedicated husband, brother, nephew, father and Marine LaTorre \n     was.\n       ``Everybody makes great sacrifices. He made his. I'll \n     always honor and treasure that,'' said Danny LaTorre.\n       A funeral service was held on Thursday morning at 10:30 \n     a.m. at the Chase Parkway Memorial. Then Corporal LaTorre \n     will be buried with full military honors at the State \n     Veteran's Cemetery in Middletown.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Waterbury Marine Dies in Afghanistan\n\n       Waterbury (WTNH)--A Marine from Waterbury has died from \n     wounds he received in Afghanistan, the Defense Dept said \n     Thursday.\n       He's identified as Corporal Xhacob LaTorre, and he was 21 \n     years old.\n       The DoD says Cpl.

Madam President, I want to briefly draw your attention to \nan extraordinary trial that took place in Beijing yesterday morning. \nMr. Liu Xiaobo is a 53-year-old writer and social critic and one of \nChina's most prominent advocates of democratic reform. After being \ndetained without charges for over a year, he went on trial yesterday \nmorning in a 3-hour proceeding closed to the public. If convicted, Mr. \nLiu faces up to 15 years in prison. His verdict is likely to come on \nFriday, Christmas Day.\n  What was Mr. Liu's crime?\n  He was tried on charges officially defined as ``incitement to subvert \nstate power.'' Mr. Liu's calls for open elections and free speech were \nviewed as a threat to the ruling Communist Party.\n  What precisely did he do that got him into trouble?\n  He contributed to ``Charter 08,'' a political manifesto calling for \nhuman rights and the rule of law in China. The manifesto was posted on \nline last December and quickly gained thousands of signatures by \nChinese workers, teachers, and retired party members. Its name is a \nreference to Charter 77, a Soviet-era petition by Czech dissidents like \nVaclav Havel.\n  Mr. Liu's crimes are nonexistent. Yet his fate has been \npredetermined. In short, his trial is a travesty of justice:\n  Mr. Liu's 3-hour trial was closed to the public. Even his wife was \nnot allowed to attend. She has been relentlessly harassed and unable to \nspeak to him since March.\n  Officials warned Mr. Liu's supporters to stay away from the trial and \nnot write about it online. Police detained some people who came to the \ncourthouse to show support.\n  His verdict will be announced on Christmas Day. This is an obvious \ncalculation so that the verdict's announcement will garner less \ninternational attention.\n  According to his brother, one of the two family members allowed in \nthe courtroom, Mr. Liu told the judge that ``if he was sent to jail, it \nmight bring others freedom of speech.''\n\n[[Page S14138]]\n\n  I was struck by a report in yesterday morning's New York Times that \nan unemployed meat plant worker took an 18-hour train ride from his \nfar-flung province to show solidarity outside of the courthouse in \nBeijing. The worker said he had never met Mr. Liu, but that they had \nexchanged emails.\n  He also said proudly that he had signed ``Charter 08'' and pulled out \na copy of it from his backpack and handed it to a courthouse official. \nThe worker's intent was clear: ``I am not afraid. I love China. I just \nwant my country to have freedom and human rights.''\n  The trial of Mr. Liu is a sad milestone that has further diminished \nhopes that China's economic rise would bring about significant \npolitical and legal reforms. During the past year, as the \nCongressional-Executive Commission on China's reporting has shown, the \ngovernment has tightened restrictions on the Internet, harassed the \ncountry's human rights lawyers, and jailed muckrakers, working with \ngrieving parents, blamed shoddy school construction for the deaths of \nthousands of children during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.\n  We will learn the court's verdict and its jail sentence for Mr. Liu \non Christmas Day. I call on China's leaders to demonstrate compassion \nand genuine commitment, not just in words but in deeds, to the rule of \nlaw and fundamental rights by dismissing the case against Mr. Liu. In \ndoing so, the Chinese Government would be recognizing the serious \nprocedural flaws that have taken place in this case. It would also \nsignal to the rest of the world that the Chinese Government is \ncommitted to developing the rule of law and upholding international \nhuman rights standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/24/senate-section/article/S14138-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Saunders, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/24/senate-section/article/S14138-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n       At 9:52 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, \n     delivered by Ms. Miller, the Clerk of the House, announced \n     that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hoyer) has signed the \n     following enrolled bills:\n       H.R. 3819.
