Madam President, many Kentuckians awoke this morning \nto the sad news that one miner was killed and another is missing after \na ceiling collapse in an underground coal mine in Webster County, which \nis in the western part of Kentucky.\n  Right now, it is my understanding that MSHA officials are on the site \nand rescue teams are working to locate the missing miner. For now we \ncan only hope their efforts are successful.\n  I ask my colleagues and the American people to keep the miners, their \nfamilies, and the rescue workers in their prayers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for me, being a miner's son, having worked \nin the mines myself, these reports out of West Virginia and Kentucky \nare very troubling. Mining is a very dangerous occupation. I know that \npersonally as a result of my dad having been ``blasted'' as we called \nit, and reflecting back on my childhood friend, Stan Hudgens, whose \nfather was working in the blossom with my dad and a rock dropped on his \nhead and killed him. My dad brought him out of the mine.\n  So these reports out of the coal mines are troubling. I agree with my \ndistinguished friend that we have to make sure that we act--not do \nanything harmful to the industry because it is a very important \nindustry. Mining is the No. 2 industry in Nevada. It is not coal \nmining. And a lot of our mining now in Nevada is open pit, but not all \nof it is. We have a lot of underground mines too. The same with coal \nmining; coal mining is what we refer to as the hard rock business. It \nis open pit mining, but they have a significant amount of underground \nmining also.\n  So I look forward to working with my friend, the Republican leader, \nand all of those who want to make mines safer and protect this most \nimportant industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2771-8", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2771-S2772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SIGNING AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the managers of the bill wish to give \nopening statements on this important legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Dodd be recognized to use whatever time he feels \nappropriate, that Senator Shelby then be recognized to use whatever \ntime he feels appropriate, that Chairman Lincoln then be recognized to \nmake a statement, and following that, Senator Chambliss, the ranking \nmember of the Agriculture Committee, and then Senator Warner, a member \nof the Banking Committee, wishes to make a statement. I ask that be the \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are beginning debate on the floor of the \nSenate of a matter that has obviously been the subject of great \ndiscussion and debate over the last couple years. My remarks will be \nvery brief. I have talked a lot over the last week or so about the \nbill. I presume I will be spending a lot of time in the coming days. I \ndo not need to spend a lot of time now. My colleague and friend from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby, wants to be heard and others want to be heard \nthis afternoon. I will be here to engage them.\n  I begin by thanking and commending my colleague from Alabama. We have \ndisagreements about this bill. He is a good friend and someone I work \nwith closely, as we will on this bill as we move forward. We want to \naccommodate Members on all sides to be heard, to offer their \namendments, to have a good debate. We would like to accommodate and \naccept amendments where we can. If we cannot, we will try to lay out \nwhy or offer alternative ideas as we move through this debate.\n  Obviously, it is very important we get this right. Senator Shelby has \nsaid that many times, and I agree with him. It is very important. \nLiterally, language, punctuation marks can have implications. It is \nthat delicate as we work through language. My intention is to get \nthere.\n  Today we are going to have general debate on the bill; tomorrow \npossibly some additional debate. We will pick up our first amendments \non Tuesday when we get back. I wish to address that point in a minute, \nif I may.\n  I wish to begin the debate with a message for those who have seen the \nacrimony in the Chamber over the past couple weeks and have concluded \nthat the Senate is not up to getting the job done on legislation of \nthis import and this size.\n  I will be the first to admit that sometimes we become discouraged and \ndisappointed with each other. That is the nature, I suppose, of a \nlegislative body when we have as many different and strongly held \nviews. I, myself, was frustrated with how long it took to bring the \nbill up on the floor. Others are frustrated by what they see in the \nbill. All of this can be a rationale for why we express our \nfrustration.\n  The thing that made it possible to get to this point is the same \nthing that will make it possible to get to the finish line on this \nimportant legislation; that is, the trust we have, that we are each \ncommitted to getting the job done.\n  As Senator Shelby and I both pointed out last evening, we have worked \nclosely over the past 37 months that I have chaired the Banking \nCommittee. I mentioned we brought 42 measures out of our committee, 37 \nof which have become the law of the land. While we do not agree on this \nbill or at least not all of it, we are both confident this legislation \ncan become law as well if we work hard and together and achieve common \nground, even if it is not exactly as we would want if we were writing \nit on our own. I think it is what our colleagues in the country think \nof us.\n  Simply put, we have no other choice but to do so. The status quo is \nunacceptable. We cannot leave the American people vulnerable to the \npresent construct of our financial regulatory system. The American \npeople have paid too high a price for the failure of our system to stop \nWall Street greed and recklessness from undermining the stability of \nour economy.\n  We heard over and over that we have lost 8.5 million jobs and 7 \nmillion homes lost to foreclosure or are in foreclosure. Trillions of \ndollars--some say $11 trillion, some say $13 trillion, some say \nhigher--trillions of dollars of household wealth has been lost in the \nlast 18 months; home values--again, the number everyone agrees on--a 37 \npercent decline in home values across the Nation. In some States, the \nnumbers are much higher. We have seen a decline in retirement income by \nsome 20 percent as well across the Nation.\n  All this was not cause by one particular event or set of \ncircumstances. There was a variety of circumstances, the culmination of \nwhich and the expansion brought us to the brink of financial collapse \nand disaster.\n  I described the aims of our legislation. First, it ends ``too big to \nfail.'' Senator Shelby and I have been working on that issue. We have \nhad long discussions agreeing on principles and what needs to be done. \nMy hope is, in the first part of next week--our staffs are going to \nwork over the weekend to take the principles on which we have reached \nsome agreements and then do the delicate job of writing the language \nthat reflects those principles and ideas.\n  I thank my staff as well as Senator Shelby's staff for trying to get \nus to a point where we reach a level of comfort, that we have done what \nwe said we were going to do; that is, to end too big to fail. No longer \nwill there be an implicit understanding that if a major financial \ninstitution or even a less-than-major financial institution starts to \nfail somehow it is going to get propped up by taxpayer dollars. Our \ncolleague from California, Barbara Boxer--we heard already the language \nof her amendment which will once again add a voice to this effort to \nsay, when losses occur, too big to fail will never expose the American \ntaxpayers to writing a check to have to underwrite that cost.\n  I presume there may be others who have ideas on how best to nail this\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\ndown. We welcome those ideas. Again, Senator Shelby and I will work on \nan amendment we intend to offer the first part of next week that \nreflects those values as well. I thank him and his staff and others for \nthe time already spent. I cannot count the hours we have spent sitting \nwith each other, talking about these ideas and how best to achieve \nthem.\n  Obviously, we want to involve as well the Treasury Department and \nothers for their advice and counsel because they ultimately will be \nasked to implement a lot of what we have talked about. We will be busy \nover the coming days as well on those issues.\n  Senator Boxer's idea--I discussed this with Senator Shelby already, \nand without committing anyone at all, there seems to be, at least at \nthis juncture, a relatively good response or reaction to what she \nintends to do. Too big to fail has been a subject of major \nconversation. We all agree what we want to achieve. The question is, \nCan we do this? I am confident we can.\n  I would like us to begin on a positive note as well. There will be \ntimes during this debate where we will be at very different sides. That \nwill happen, as it should be. There is nothing wrong with that. I think \nit is better to begin a process where you can agree on issues and sit \ndown and come to common understandings. Too big to fail is an area \nwhere there is no disagreement about what we are trying to achieve. \nThat is a great starting point. My hope is we can do that in the coming \ndays.\n  We create an early warning system. This has not been the subject of a \nlot of debate. I think we all agree that to have the ability to watch \nand monitor what is occurring, both domestically and internationally, \nis very important.\n  We have established what we call a systemic risk council that will \nallow us to observe what is occurring on a regular basis so we can spot \nthese problems before they metastasize and grow into, as we have seen, \nproblems that created as much harm for our economy as the present \nrecession has. I will not go into the details of it, but I think there \nis a general agreement that this makes a lot of sense.\n  We bring derivatives out of the shadow and into the sunlight so Wall \nStreet is accountable for actions. I do not sense a lot of disagreement \non what we are trying to achieve. There is some disagreement on about \nhow this is best worked.\n  I am hopeful that in the coming weeks we can resolve these \ndifferences as we deal with these exotic instruments. Clearly, getting \nmore sunshine, more transparency we think will be a great asset as \nwell.\n  Finally, we put cops on the beat with consumer protection so \nAmericans can make smart decisions based on full information when they \nare planning for their financial futures. There is general agreement \nhaving a consumer protection agency or bureau or division makes sense. \nThere is disagreement on what the powers of that agency will be, how it \nshould operate, how it can be working. We have to work on that issue to \nsee if we can reach common ground. If not, we will have votes on \nwhether one is for it or against it, with additions or subtractions, \nwhat it can do and over what jurisdiction it has authority.\n\n  These are the principles. There is not much disagreement with what we \nare trying to achieve but there will be on how best to do it in certain \nareas. There may be disagreements on how to actually accomplish these \ngoals.\n  I said before that we agreed to move forward on this bill and that I \nwill allow each Member in this Chamber to offer his or her suggestions, \nair their concerns, vote up or down on ideas.\n  What I would like to see occur during this debate is not only are we \ntaking on a large issue, but this institution has been damaged over the \nlast number of years. It amounts to this: Senator Jon Kyl and I engaged \nin a colloquy the other day--not a planned one--about the issue of \ntrust, which is what people are concerned about. We need to restore \nthat trust if we can. It is incumbent we try to understand each other's \nmotives, not question them, and then deal effectively with ideas as \nthey come up.\n  My hope is not only will we end up with a good bill at the end of all \nthis, but we can also end up repairing some of the tensions and stress \nthat exists in this legislative body. When I said I want Members to be \nable to offer their amendments, to debate those amendments, and have \nvotes on those amendments, I mean it--I know my colleague from Alabama \nshares that view as well--and that people with limited time--obviously, \nwe do not want filibustering occurring--ought to have it to express \nthose ideas and then vote on the ideas.\n  I mentioned last night the amendment proposed by Senator Boxer. I \nhave discussed that amendment already. Others will have amendments to \ncome next week as well.\n  I cannot promise that the final product will be a bill that all 100 \nSenators will feel they can support. I understand that. But my goal is \nto get the best, most effective legislation we can. My belief is we can \nmake that happen by acting like Senators, listening to each other, \nensuring our debate is as civil as it is passionate, as factual as it \nis fierce.\n  To paraphrase our President: We did not ask for the job of saving our \nfinancial system from its inefficiencies and excesses, but that is our \njob today. That is what we have been asked to do. I have the greatest \nconfidence in my colleagues that we can get that job done. I look \nforward, again, to working with my colleague and friend, Senator \nShelby, moving forward as well with the leadership and others to \nachieve the desired results with this bill.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague and friend from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, before proceeding to my remarks on the \nbill, I want to thank Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, for his \nleadership, and also the members of the Banking Committee on both sides \nof the aisle for their hard work and dedication which has brought us \nthis far.\n  Also, I want to thank my colleague and the committee's chairman, my \nfriend, Senator Chris Dodd. Over the years, as he has said, we have \nworked together on a number of bills and quite often found a way to \ncompromise, to work forward on some very difficult and complex issues. \nUnfortunately, thus far, compromise has alluded us on this particular \npiece of legislation, at least some of it.\n  Throughout our discussions, we shared roughly, I believe, the same \ngoals. Where we have differed, however, is how to achieve those goals. \nMy goal during consideration of this legislation here will be to \nreshape this bill so that it actually ends bailouts, protects consumers \nwithout jeopardizing our small community banks, and brings \ntransparency, as Senator Dodd mentioned, to the world of derivatives, \nwithout sacrificing economic growth and job creation, which we \ndesperately need in this country.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--\nDemocrats and Republicans--will seek to remove dozens of provisions \nthat unnecessarily expand the reach of the Federal Government into the \nprivate affairs of Americans and potentially endanger our civil \nliberties. As always, I will try to focus on policy and not politics.\n  Unfortunately, over the last several days, debate has become tainted \nby accusations and misrepresentations. This is nothing new here. The \nprocess has already become overly political with allegations that \nRepublicans are blindly following the advice of a pollster's political \nmemo.\n  I wish to say for the record here that I voted against the Chrysler \nbailout in 1979, I believe it was, when this particular pollster they \nare talking about was still in high school. So I have a long record of \nfighting against bailouts and trying to protect the taxpayer.\n  Also, I advanced the toughest piece of legislation that would have \nreined in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac years ago. But that was opposed \nunanimously by the Democrats in the Banking Committee.\n  I was the only Senator criticizing the SEC's lack of supervision of \nthe Nation's largest investment banks while some of my Democratic \ncolleagues, including then-Senator Obama, were endorsing it.\n  I also opposed the imposition of the Basel II capital accords that \nwould have left our banks in far worse shape than they were when the \ncrisis hit.\n  I was questioning regulators about the growing housing bubble and the \nstability of our housing market years before the collapse.\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee before Senator Dodd, I authored \nand passed, with the help of the Senator, the only attempt to address \nthe lack of competition in the credit rating industry, once again over \na lot of opposition.\n  Finally, when Congress repealed the restrictions put in place by \nGlass-Steagall, I was the only Republican on the Banking Committee to \nvote no. So if any of my colleagues wish to discuss my motivation and \nmy record, I am standing here on the floor right now.\n  As I have stated, there are a number of changes I believe need to be \nmade to this bill before I can consider supporting it. I think we \nshould begin by listening to the people who will be negatively affected \nby this bill if it were to become law.\n  If a small business owner from my hometown in Tuscaloosa, AL, tells \nme that he fears an out-of-control consumer regulator, I listen. If an \northodontist from Mobile, AL, fears regulatory burdens because she \noffers installment payments, I listen. If the makers of Mars candy bars \nfear massive cost increases from this legislation that will threaten \nAmerican jobs and prices, I listen.\n  There are others we should be listening to as well. For example, \nlarge financial firms such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are in favor \nof this bill. Why is that? The answer is, as now written, they know \nthat the bill will bring them and Wall Street firms like them under the \nFederal safety net where they will get preferential treatment, just as \nGoldman Sachs got in the AIG bailout.\n  Yes, the bill, as written, will guarantee that Goldman Sachs could \nagain be paid 100 cents on the dollar if its bets go bad. That is a \nhuge benefit for Wall Street firms at the expense of others--mainly the \ntaxpayers.\n  The resolution authority established by this bill at the moment will \nensure that the politically influential investors in these firms, such \nas foreign governments and sovereign wealth funds, will get special \ntaxpayer bailouts not available to creditors of small financial \ncompanies. This will give these firms a permanent funding advantage \nover smaller competitors on Main Street.\n  Make no mistake, this bill will help the big banks get bigger, as it \nis written today, and further tilt the competitive playing field \nagainst small and less politically connected firms.\n  The legislation that we are about to consider will help the likes of \nGoldman Sachs but harm the American people. It will lead to job losses, \nlost opportunities for businesses to productively invest in the future, \nand it will ensure future bailouts, which Senator Dodd and I both want \nto prevent.\n  Chairman Dodd has assured me that he will address a number of \nconcerns I have expressed with respect to bailouts. We have talked \nabout this at length. I appreciate his assurances and take him at his \nword, but I am concerned that there appear to be no substantive changes \nin the relevant sections of the bill that would reflect such assurances \nyet. Therefore, at the conclusion of my remarks, and picking up on what \nwe talked about earlier, I wish to hear how the chairman intends to \naddress the following: the removal of the $50 million bailout fund, \nwhich some people call the honey pot; not allowing the government to \npay creditors and shareholders of a failed firm more than they would be \nentitled to in bankruptcy; not allowing the FDIC to prop up failing \nfirms with government and debt guarantees--meaning the taxpayer; not \nallowing the Federal Reserve to lend broadly on bad collateral; holding \nthe FDIC accountable if it fails to properly conduct resolutions or \nuses the resolution authority to provide bailouts; and not allowing the \ngovernment to deem any nonbank financial company as systemically \nimportant and worthy of taxpayer funds at the Fed's discount window.\n  As many of my colleagues are beginning to realize, it doesn't matter \nwhat we say. What matters is what is in the bill's language. And the \nlanguage in this bill right now would allow for bailouts. I urge my \ncolleagues to read the language carefully.\n  I have been assured that the bailout provisions will be addressed. \nHowever, they have not been addressed yet in the chairman's substitute \nlanguage. We need to see language from the majority that clearly \naddresses the issues I have set forth. My hope is that by Tuesday this \ncan be resolved quickly, with both of us offering a joint amendment.\n  Nevertheless, we are still left with a bill this afternoon that will \ncreate massive and intrusive new government bureaucracies, damage job \ncreation, reduce private investment in productive projects, make risk \nmanagement more difficult, and threaten our economy.\n  The bill before us now establishes overarching bureaucracies without \nany meaningful protections for our financial privacy rights. Also, the \nbureaucracies have been designed to address many issues that have \nlittle or no bearing on the recent crisis or any financial crisis. It \nis a power grab that can reach into virtually every aspect of our \neconomy, and it needs to be restrained.\n  I wonder how any crisis will be prevented through data collection \nfrom banks about deposit accounts of their customers to identify \ncommunity development opportunities as found in section 1071 of this \nbill.\n  Small businesses across this country fear the massive and potentially \nvery intrusive new bureaucracy created under the rubric of consumer \nprotection. And they have every right to be afraid. The massive new \ngovernment bureaucracy called for in this bill has authorities and \npowers to call you forward and ask you, under oath, about your personal \nfinancial affairs. The fact so many are looking the other way on this \nserious threat to our civil liberties is troubling. But as this debate \ngoes on, I think America is going to start focusing on the deep aspects \nof this bill.\n\n  The architects of this massive new bureaucracy have long argued for a \nconsumer bureau with the right culture, they call it. Whether that \nculture focuses on consumer protection and a safe and sound banking \nsystem or it becomes a way for community organizers and groups such as \nACORN to grab Federal resources is left wide open here.\n  This massive new bureaucracy will be funded by over $600 million \ntaken directly from the Federal Reserve, outside of the congressional \noversight or appropriations process. Tapping the central bank to pay \nfor political initiatives is a very disturbing and dangerous precedent. \nThey did that in Argentina to the utter dismay of the global community \nand to Argentina itself. It shows a complete lack of understanding of \nthe importance of an independent central bank. For us to follow \nArgentina's lead and tap the Fed for new government programs is not \nonly shortsighted but signals to the rest of the world the failure of \nthis country to act in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  In addition to the new Fed consumer protection bureaucracy, this bill \nenvisions a massive new potentially $\\1/2\\ billion per year Federal \nbureaucracy called the Office of Financial Research, designed to \ncollect granular financial data and to construct complex financial \nmodels. Did you hear that? This new bureaucracy is given unprecedented \nauthority, including abilities to obtain virtually any type of data it \nwants from financial companies, to the level of detail of what you buy \non your credit card.\n  This new bureaucracy is also designed to gather data, process it, and \nthen is required to make it available to Wall Street firms so they can \ncut their costs. So who is for Wall Street now?\n  This bill also threatens our economy, as Senator Dodd mentioned, by \nits treatment of derivatives. Greater transparency in all derivative \nmarkets is a good thing. But this bill, at this juncture, under the \nguise of promoting transparency, I believe, threatens Main Street \ncompanies and their customers for no good reason. The end-user \nexemptions put Main Street companies through almost endless and \nunworkable hoops that will ensure higher costs, lower growth, fewer \njobs, and diminished economic opportunity.\n  In addition, by seeking to concentrate all manner of risky products \ninto clearinghouses, the bill threatens to concentrate risk to the \npoint of becoming systemically large, which, as we all know, leads to \ngovernment or taxpayer bailouts. This bill could actually increase risk \nin our financial system, as it is written, and decrease economic output \nat a time when we need it the most.\n  Finally, while concentrating risks in America, this bill will shift \nderivative\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\ntrades offshore to places where we have no oversight or regulatory \nabilities to act.\n  Proponents of this bill also argue that regulatory gaps are being \nclosed and that the bill somehow simplifies and rationalizes the \nregulatory framework. Yet the Kansas City Fed President has said:\n\n       This bill actually increases the complexity of the \n     regulatory structure . . . as well as creating unnecessary \n     costs.\n\n  As is often the case with this bill, claims about what it does do not \nmatch the language itself. They claim it is regulatory simplicity; the \nlanguage means that there will be increased complexity.\n  I have highlighted here this afternoon some of the major problems in \nthis bill. It will not end taxpayer-funded bailouts as it is written; \nit provides for a drastic expansion and overreach of government into \nthe economy and every aspect of our personal financial lives; it also \nraises the cost of risk management and threatens the abilities of \ncompanies to manage risk using derivatives while potentially \naccumulating risk to systemic proportions; and it makes an already \ncomplex regulatory maze even more complex.\n  I welcome the opportunity to debate the bill before us and to offer \namendments and work with Senator Dodd, the chairman, to improve the \ndeficiencies and strengthen this bill's shortcomings. I hope we are \ngoing to be able to do this in a spirit of cooperation in the days \nahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, other than what you \nheard from my good friend from Alabama, he likes the bill. So we will \nhave some work to do.\n  Let me again assure him and my colleagues here that we have had very \nproductive talks, my friend from Alabama and I, particularly in the \ntoo-big-to-fail area. My two colleagues, Mark Warner and Bob Corker, \ndid a tremendous amount of work in our committee over many weeks as we \ndivided the labor to try to address these issues as thoroughly and as \ncomprehensively as possible. I think we have done that work, but I \nrespect the fact that others may have additional ideas to make this \nwork even better. I know he raised the issue here, and we are going to \ntry to work over this weekend to try to put together the legal \nlanguage, the language that has to be drafted here, to reflect some of \nthese ideas we can incorporate as part of this bill. My colleague and \nfriend from Alabama has my word on that. We will work on that to do \nthat. Again, I thank him. We have worked well together over these last \n37 months.\n  I make this offer to my colleagues too. I just had a brief \nconversation with Senator Chambliss. I say this on my own behalf, but I \nhope Senator Shelby might agree with me. If Members have amendments, it \nwould help, even in the next day or so, if you could let us know what \nthose amendments are. Even though we may not get to them for a while, \nwe can start to work with our colleagues on their ideas. We may be able \nto accept some.\n  I see my colleague from Arkansas here, the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee. I don't know whether she shares that view, but \nit would be helpful. If people have ideas, the earlier we know about \nthem, the better we will be able to respond to them or modify them in \nsome way so they are acceptable. I hope Senators will take advantage of \nthat offer; that the chair of the Agriculture Committee, myself, and I \npresume Senator Chambliss would share that view as well. Let's see \nthese amendments early on so we can try to be helpful to our colleagues \nearly on, if at all possible.\n  I commend my colleague as chairperson of the Agriculture Committee. \nShe has taken over that job over the last number of months and done a \ngreat job at it. I look forward to working with her, hopefully, in the \nnext week or two on this bill as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Dodd for his hard work. \nI absolutely agree that getting Members to bring their amendments \nforward is going to be critical in terms of working with them and their \nideas to see if we can move forward. We have a historic opportunity to \ndo something on behalf our country, and I hope we all work together to \nmake that happen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer be the next Democratic \nspeaker after Senator Warner in the queue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nDodd-Lincoln substitute amendment. This substitute amendment represents \na critical step forward in restoring the soundness of our financial \nsystem. This bill will ensure that our markets work for Main Street and \nnot just for Wall Street.\n  We have come to a critical juncture, and our Nation faces great \nchallenges. But within those challenges we find great opportunities.\n  Last fall, I had the honor and solemn responsibility of taking over \nthe gavel of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. As \nthe daughter of a very pragmatic, seven-generation Arkansas family, I \nfind myself, in the Senate Committee on Agriculture's 184 years, the \nfirst Arkansan to ever serve as chairman of that committee. I am proud \nof the work that has gone into the product we bring, along with the \nbanking bill, to this process.\n  Our committee was tasked with putting an end to the reckless behavior \nthat put our financial system in jeopardy, specifically bringing \nregulation to the over-the-counter derivatives market. Reforming this \nmarket is at the heart of financial regulatory reform. Within a decade, \nthis market exploded to $600 trillion in notional value and is today \ncompletely unregulated.\n  Last week, the Senate Agriculture Committee took a critical step \ntoward bringing transparency and accountability to this market, a \ncritical step toward passing the Wall Street Transparency and \nAccountability Act with bipartisan support.\n  The major provisions of this bill are included in this substitute \namendment I have offered today with Chairman Dodd. I appreciate the \nwork of my distinguished colleague, Chairman Dodd, and the Senate \nBanking Committee staff, along with the amazing staff from the \nAgriculture Committee, to merge our two bills.\n  I also appreciate the leadership of Majority Leader Reid, whose \ncommitment to producing strong financial regulatory reform guided us \nthrough this process.\n  This substitute legislation takes the best of both committees' \nproducts and represents the strongest reform legislation to date. I \nthank Chairman Dodd for his strong leadership on this combined effort. \nHe is a longtime leader in this body, and I very much appreciate not \nonly all of his leadership but certainly our strong relationship. I am \ngrateful for all of his hard work.\n  I would also like to thank the President and his Treasury Department \nfor their leadership on this issue. I also greatly appreciate the \nstrong support from Chairman Gensler at the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. Because of their commitment, the administration has been \ninstrumental in bringing us to this point.\n  I am also very fortunate to have a strong partner in my good friend \nand ranking member, Saxby Chambliss. His thoughtfulness and the hard \nwork of his unbelievable staff is reflected in many of the provisions \nwe will begin debating on the Senate floor today. While we have had \nsome policy differences, I know without a doubt that we share the goal \nof bringing thoughtful reform to these markets.\n  This legislation is historic. It is landmark reform. It will keep \nbanks in the business of banking. It will prevent future bailouts and, \nthrough the work done by Chairman Dodd, put an end to too big to fail. \nIt will lower systemic risk--systemic risk through our clearing \nmechanisms and our exchange trading and real-time price transparency. \nIt will close loopholes and make sure the regulators have the full \nauthority to go after those entities that would evade or abuse the law. \nIt protects jobs on Main Street by giving true commercial end users the \nability to hedge and manage their risks. It protects municipalities, \nalong with pensions and retirees and any governmental agency, from the \ngouging or the gross profiteering that has occurred in the past. Most \nimportantly, it will bring 100 percent transparency to what is \ncurrently a completely unregulated and dark marketplace.\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\n  This bill is true reform. This is strong reform. But we need to \nremember that this is not regulation for regulation sake. We have an \nimportant but narrowly tailored end user exemption and appropriate \nrestraint on the regulators where necessary. We understand we are \ncompeting in a global financial world. This is a robust package that \nbalances the need for strong, meaningful reform and recognizes the \nimportance of these markets.\n  Americans are demanding transparency and accountability from their \ngovernment and from their financial system. America's consumers and \nbusinesses deserve strong reform that will ensure that the U.S. \nfinancial oversight system promotes and fosters the most honest, open, \nand reliable financial markets in the world. That ensures that not only \ndoes the United States remain the world financial leader but, most \nimportantly, that we lead by example.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Dodd and my colleagues to \nconsider amendments over the next several days and to improving the \nsubstitute bill where necessary. Most importantly, though, I am looking \nforward to providing the American people with a sound economy and a \nfinancial regulatory system that they truly deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I will say more about it in my \nconclusion remarks, but first of all, Senators Dodd and Shelby, thanks \nfor continuing your dialog with each other, and thanks for coming forth \nwith the type of agreement that has allowed us to get this extremely \nimportant agreement to the floor.\n  With the financial collapse of 2008, there are a number of issues \nthat simply have to be addressed, and this is the appropriate forum now \nfor all of those issues to come forward and have debate on both sides \nof the aisle; to hopefully at the end of the day come up with the right \nkind of product that is going to make sure situations like 2008 never \noccur again.\n  To my chairman and my partner on the Committee on Agriculture, she is \nmy dear friend, and we have worked very closely together on so many \nissues, including this one. When we have our differences, we are able \nto disagree in a very professional way. I am very appreciative of her \nas well as of her friendship.\n  We all know that appropriate regulation of derivatives and \nspecifically the swaps market is a critical component of this \nlegislation, and the Agriculture Committee is responsible for the \noversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which will \nbecome one of the key regulators of the swaps market. As the ranking \nmember on the Agriculture Committee, I have the responsibility to \nensure that we get this right.\n  The Agriculture Committee has a history of not falling subject to \npartisan influence. We have a long tradition of checking our partisan \npolitics at the door in an effort to reach consensus so that both \nRepublicans and Democrats can then support our products on the floor. \nFor instance, the Agriculture Committee facilitated a bipartisan deal \nto close the Enron loophole back in 2008. Then-chairman Senator Harkin \nand I worked across party lines with Senators Snowe, Feinstein, Levin, \nand Cantwell to ensure that electronic trading facilities offering \ncontracts that perform a significant price discovery function are \nproperly regulated in a transparent way. Earlier this week, the CFTC \nused this new authority to subject seven natural gas contracts to \nincreased oversight. That is an example of how laws written with \nbipartisan agreements yield real results.\n  Derivatives legislation should have been handled this way too. It \nshould have come out of the Agriculture Committee as a bipartisan \nproduct. My staff and Chairman Lincoln's staff spent 5 months crafting \na derivatives bill which should have been reported from the committee \nwith support from both sides.\n  Unfortunately, things fell apart just as we were about to circulate \nan agreed-upon discussion draft. This discussion draft, which would \nhave required clearing of swaps by swaps dealers and others who \ncontribute to systemic risk--it would have provided the FTC and the \nCFTC with the authority to establish capital markets and margin \nrequirements. It would have allowed the CFTC to impose aggregate \nlimits, and, most importantly, it would have provided the much needed \ntransparency that has been absent from the swaps market. This would \nhave represented a 180-degree shift from current law that was in place \nin 2008. Transparency is the key here. Under our agreed-upon discussion \ndraft, 100 percent of all trades in the swaps and derivatives market \nwould have been out in the open and available to regulators to review \nin real time.\n  Unfortunately, this language is not part of the underlying bill. \nInstead, we are faced with a derivatives product crafted without input \nfrom Republicans, a derivatives product that reflects an agreement \nbetween both Democratic committee chairmen and the administration. \nRepublicans were not even invited into the room to provide input.\n  The product they have developed will have many unfortunate \nconsequences for Main Street businesses that had nothing to do with \ncreating this financial meltdown. I fear what I believe to be \nunintended consequences resulting from applying complicated regulations \ntoo broadly will subject our American businesses to more risk, not \nless.\n  For example, this legislation would force the Farm Credit System \ninstitutions to run their interest rate swaps through a clearinghouse, \nwhich will result in additional costs in the form of higher interest \nrates to their customers, without doing anything to lessen systemic \nrisk. Let me be clear as to whom this will ultimately affect--our \nfarmers and ranchers, our electric cooperatives, and our ethanol \nfacilities that seek financing from these institutions. Institutions \nsuch as CoBank will be forced to clear their swaps and execute them on \na trading facility, which will impose significant new costs and result \nin higher interest rates for their customers or, worse, discourage them \nfrom managing their risk, which will again result in higher costs for \ntheir borrowers.\n  Because this legislation broadly applies regulation, treating all \nfinancial institutions exactly the same. Cobank and Goldman Sachs are \nnot the same and should not be regulated in the same manner. Cobank \nshould have the option to clear their swaps and not be mandated to do \nso.\n  This legislation will also prevent John Deere Credit from hedging its \ninterest rate risk except through a clearinghouse. Again, this will \nresult in less attractive credit arrangements for farmers who need \nfinancing to buy tractors and combines.\n  The same can be said for consumers who would like favorable financing \narrangements with Ford Motor Credit to buy a car. They will not be \nallowed the best deal because Ford Motor Credit is now going to be \nforced to take on additional cost when hedging their interest rate \nrisk. Can anyone tell me why we are treating John Deere and Ford Motor \nCredit exactly the same as Goldman Sachs?\n  Also, entities such as Koch Industries that is hedging their risk and \nalso engaged in developing products for their customers' hedging needs \nshould not inadvertently be captured in a new regulatory category \ndesigned to apply to big financial dealers. But that is exactly what \nthis legislation does.\n  Koch's and Goldman Sachs' swaps businesses would essentially be \nregulated in the same way. Treating these entities like dealers may \nforce them to stop offering those products to their customers, in which \ncase their customers will have no other option but to seek products \nfrom the large dealers such as Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street \nbankers.\n  Today I heard the stock price of Goldman Sachs is up, and this \nexplains it. They will get increased opportunities to make more money \nunder this legislation. Why do we want to essentially lessen \ncompetition and drive all of the swaps business to those that are the \nmost systemically risky or, even worse, drive them offshore where we \ncannot regulate them?\n  Banks such as Goldman Sachs may even be forced out of the swaps \nbusiness if this legislation becomes law, which begs the question: Who \nwill then be left to offer these risk management tools to our \nconstituents' businesses?\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\nBusinesses rely on swaps as a very legitimate option to help them \nalleviate risk inherent to their business. But if no one is left to \nsell them this protection, they will be forced to hold the risk on \ntheir books. Why on Earth would Congress advance legislation that would \nactually prevent the businesses in each of our States from properly \nmanaging their risk, especially in these difficult times?\n  The American public wants to know why we cannot target these new \nregulations so Wall Street is regulated properly without punishing the \nbusinesses they rely on every day. I would like to know the same thing. \nUnfortunately, I think I already know the answer: It has absolutely \nnothing to do with regulating Wall Street.\n  When the Obama administration realized the Committee on Agriculture \nwas on the verge of producing a derivatives regulation package that \nwould have appealed to both Republicans and Democrats, they scrambled \nto kill the deal. You see, to the extent that any aspect of the \nfinancial regulatory reform package has Republican support, they can no \nlonger play politics with this issue.\n  If we produce a bill that has the support of several Republicans, \nthen they can no longer blame us for holding up this process, which \nwould cause the administration to lose the message they are pushing, in \nhopes that voters will forget about health care. Their message is \nsimple: They want to be able to tell the public that Republicans are \nopposed to regulating Wall Street.\n  Well, that is disingenuous at best and totally false at worst. \nRepublicans are just as anxious as Democrats to address what went wrong \non Wall Street and, frankly, it is long overdue. Why has the \nadministration waited almost 18 months to push financial regulatory \nreform? Why are they trying to cut Republicans out of the process? Is \nit that they wanted an issue that will drag on into the election \nseason, not a solution that will truly protect the consumers on Main \nStreet?\n  I wish we were here today debating a derivatives product that had \ninput from Senators on both sides of the aisle and perhaps a little \nless input from the administration. The American people expect the \nadministration to implement the laws that Congress passes, but they \nelected us to write those laws.\n  I feel certain that we could have done a much better job had we been \nallowed to work in a more bipartisan way. Unfortunately, I have to \nencourage my colleagues to oppose the derivatives portion of this bill \nbecause I think it will have undesirable consequences for Main Street \nbusinesses and consumers who are already struggling in this weakened \neconomy.\n  We will have amendments to correct the deficiencies in this bill, and \nI hope we will receive bipartisan support for those amendments because \nthey truly will reflect commonsense solutions to the complex \nderivatives issue.\n  Let me close by saying that I know Senator Dodd, Senator Lincoln, \nSenator Shelby, all of us, wanted, at the end of the day, to develop a \nbipartisan bill. I hope we can still do that. I see my friend, Senator \nWarner, is on the Senate floor. He and I have had some conversations \nabout trying to meld some of our ideas. I know he has worked very \nclosely with my dear friend, Senator Corker, from this side of the \naisle.\n  Now that we have this bill on the Senate floor, I hope we can get by \nthe rhetoric; that we can all say our piece and that we can roll up our \nsleeves and do what the American people want to see us do, which is to \nwork together for their best interests. They are the ones who are going \nto suffer for what comes out of here or they will be the ones to \nbenefit from what comes out of the Senate.\n  Senator Dodd is a dear friend. We have had many conversations about \nthis bill. I know what is in his heart. I know he wants to get this \ndone in the right way. Likewise with my dear friend, Senator Lincoln. \nSo as we move ahead now, I am very hopeful we can settle down to the \nreal business the Senate is famous for; that is, having real, hard-core \ndebate on issues because these are extremely tough.\n  There has not been a more complex issue that we have had to deal with \nin my now going on 8 years in this body. But the minds are very capable \nof resolving these issues. We can do so with good ideas from both sides \nof the aisle. I am very hopeful at the end of the day, we will come out \nwith a product the American people can look back at and say: Wow. That \nis the way the Senate is supposed to work. And the people we sent to do \nthe peoples' business have, in fact, put together a good product that \nis going to benefit America; it is going to benefit American business \nand, most importantly, it will benefit Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before Senator Chambliss leaves the floor, \nbefore we hear from my colleague from Virginia, let me thank both of \nour colleagues: my colleague from Arkansas who spoke, but also my good \nfriend from Georgia. I thank him immensely for his comments. We have \nworked together, not as often, and we do not sit on committees \ntogether. But we have come to know each other and respect each other \nimmensely. I know he is going to do exactly what we are talking about. \nThis is an opportunity for us not only to get a bill right, but to get \nthis institution right, in a way. It ought to be the way we can conduct \nourselves.\n  I have always said, there is nothing wrong with partisanship. In \nfact, the country was not built on anything but partisanship. It was \nthe contest of ideas. But the ability to have a civil debate in the \ncontext of some partisan ideas, with the ultimate goal of resolving \nthose issues so that we reach a common solution, is the purpose for our \nexistence in all this.\n  I have great faith in our ability to do that. I know we will get \ncloser to that because there is a guy named Saxby Chambliss. So I thank \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate the opportunity to follow the chair and the \nranking member of the Banking Committee and the chair and the ranking \nmember of the Agriculture Committee on this critically important \ndebate.\n  I commend their work, the great amount of work that has been done, \nactually, in a bipartisan fashion already on this important piece of \nlegislation. There are differences. But an awful lot of work has gone \ninto getting this product that now can be fully aired on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I want to pay particular compliments to my dear friend, someone I had \nthe opportunity to actually work for close to 30 years ago, the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, who, while I am a new guy in the \nSenate, seems to me, on this bill, has kind of done it the old-\nfashioned way. He has had an open door to any Member of both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  As this issue got more and more complex, he asked various members of \nthe committee to roll up their sleeves and take on portions. Senator \nCorker and I--and nobody has been a better partner than Bob Corker for \nme during this process--took on a major portion of the bill. Then, as \nwe kind of got to the Senate floor, time and again--and I will come \nback to certain specific examples--he has said: How can we find that \ncommon ground that seems to be so often missing from this debate?\n  I also commend the ranking member, Senator Shelby. Nobody has been \nkinder and no one has spent more time with me kind of helping me learn \nthe ropes of this institution than Senator Shelby. But I also have to \nsay that as we get into the substance, some of the comments that have \nbeen made from my colleagues, particularly on the other side, do not \nresemble the bill we are actually starting debate on, particularly some \nof the portions in which I personally have been very involved.\n  I want to try to address some of those briefly. In some of the \ncomments we have heard from my colleagues, they have talked about that \nwe did not put in too big to fail. If there was one overriding \nchallenge that we were all tasked with--I believe my colleagues from \nthe other side of the aisle would completely concur with this--it was \nending too big to fail and never again exposing taxpayers to the \nfinancial mistakes made by large systemically important institutions, \nmade by Wall Street.\n  What I have not heard from my colleagues--and I guess this will be \nassent--is that a lot of the things that we have put in this \nlegislation, bipartisan,\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\ntake us down that path. We have created a systemic risk council so for \nthe first time the regulators can actually get above their silo-like \nfocus, so they can look ahead of the crisis and create early trip wires \nto make sure we do not get to the kind of catastrophic place we ended \nup in September of 2008.\n  This systemic risk council will make sure that these systemically \nimportant firms--and there will be systemically firms no matter what we \ndo--but that the price of getting so large will actually be borne by \nthose institutions and not by the taxpayers.\n  So what are those speed bumps, as I have called them? Increased \ncapital requirements, making sure there is a better management of \nleverage, making sure they actually have in place risk management \nplans.\n  Then we have created two brandnew tools that regulators have never \nhad before. In fact, the price of getting so large, one is a whole \nnew--and I apologize to my colleagues and those who are viewing because \nsome of this is in the weeds, but the weeds are where billions of \ndollars are made or lost.\n  But we are creating a whole new area of capital that is called \ncontingent debt, that any of these firms will have to put in place. \nThat debt will convert to equity and dilute shareholders and dilute \nmanagement if any firm even gets close to getting into trouble.\n  It will be an immediate check by current management on not getting \ntoo far over the edge, because we believe the bankruptcy process should \nbe the way that firms unwind themselves; if they get into trouble, go \ninto bankruptcy. They may or may not come out at the other end, but you \nhave to have a plan in place.\n  We have spent an awful lot of time looking back, back to the Bear \nStearns crisis, the Lehman crisis, AIG. All of the stories show there \nwas no plan in place for how to unwind these firms.\n  So we have given this risk council the ability to require these \nsystemically important firms to basically put forward a plan on how \nthey will unwind themselves in bankruptcy at no risk to taxpayers. If \nthe regulators do not approve, they have the ultimate sanction of \nactually being able to break up these firms.\n  Now, time and again, in this legislation--and I hear some of my \ncolleagues saying: We are going to always default to resolution. If \nthis works, resolution should rarely and hopefully never, ever have to \nbe called upon. But who would have ever predicted that we would have \never gotten to the point of complete financial meltdown of September \n2008? So we cannot go responsibly forward without also having--and we \nheard this from people across the spectrum--without having some form of \na resolution plan in place.\n  There has been a great deal of comment made about the notion that the \nchairman's bill says we ought to go ahead and in effect ask these \nfinancially important firms to pony up a little bit of the resources so \nthat if one of them gets into trouble and has to be unwound, there is \nsome capital available to, in effect, keep the firm operating so the \nmarket doesn't lose faith in that institution and then create a \nfinancial run. We saw institutions that seemed to be very well \ncapitalized but, because the market lost faith in them, their capital \ndisappeared virtually overnight. You have to make sure there is an \nassurance that the firm can continue to operate and be out of business. \nSenator Corker and I looked at different options, but we thought \nperhaps the best way is to have some resources available, whether the \nnumber is $50 billion, as the chairman proposed, or a lesser amount, \nsubject to valid debate, and perhaps the industry ought to be paying \nfor that.\n  I have heard others criticize that, but what I have not heard from my \ncolleagues on the other side is, if the industry is not going to pay to \nkeep these firms alive through the process of being put out of \nbusiness--again, resolution means your firm is going out of business, \nyour management is gone, your shareholders are gone, your unsecured \ncreditors are gone. No rational management team would ever want this to \nhappen. They would always prefer bankruptcy. That is how we have tilted \nthis process. But if you are going to do that, you need to put them out \nin an orderly way. You don't want to have what happened when there was \nno plan to unwind Lehman. What I would ask is, if they don't like the \nprefund from industry--and some even in the Treasury don't like it--\nthen who will pay and how do we make sure taxpayers are not exposed?\n  My two goals are--and I know Senator Corker agrees--that taxpayers \nshould not be exposed, and you have to have some liquidity operating so \nyou can keep the firm operating so you can put it out of business.\n  I have also heard critiques that somehow in this process there would \nbe some preference for one creditor over another. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth in terms of what the Dodd bill proposes. It is \nas if somehow a whole new process was created out of whole cloth where \nsomehow the firm that was going to be put out of business was going to \nbe choosing which creditor was going to be paid or not paid. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. The model I believe the chairman's \nbill adopted was basically the model the FDIC uses as it puts banks out \nof business through the normal resolution process.\n  The fact is, the FDIC is charged, as this resolution authority is \ncharged, to say you have to maximize value as you put the firm out of \nbusiness. So, yes, you may have to pay the electric bill to keep the \nlights on, but there will be a recoupment process at the end so that \ncreditors balance out. It is not some new process. This has been used \nfor decades relatively effectively.\n  I also heard comments made about some new bureaucracy in the Office \nof Financial Resolution. Nothing could be further from the truth. One \nthing we heard time and again as institutions came in, as regulators \ncame in, was that too often they didn't have current real-time data. So \nwhen AIG was going down, nobody knew the extent of the \ninterconnectedness. When Lehman went down, nobody understood the state \nof their transactions. The Office of Financial Resolution that is \nproposed is to make sure that the regulators--experts from all across \nthe field, not Wall Street--have real-time data on the state of \ninterconnectedness of all the transactions that take place on a daily \nbasis. To me this could be one of the most effective tools in this \nwhole piece of legislation, making sure we have an immediate snapshot \nof the market.\n  In the consumer area, I think there is, again, broad agreement that \nwe need to improve consumer protections; that we ought to make sure \nfinancial products are regulated by the nature of the product, not by \nthe charter of the organization that is issuing the product.\n  There are still parts we need to work on. We need to make sure, \nparticularly for community-based banks, that a community-based bank, a \nsmaller institution that didn't create the crisis in the first place, \ndoesn't have one regulator come in on a Monday on a consumer issue and \nanother come in on a Wednesday on safety and soundness, and get \nconflicting advice. How we get enforcement right is an issue we have to \nwork through. But again, common ground can be found on this issue.\n  I commend the Agriculture chair and Senator Chambliss on the issue on \nderivatives. There has been a lot of discussion. There is an agreement \nthat derivatives, while they have been oftentimes appropriately \nvilified as some of the tools that created the crisis, are also a \nuseful way that legitimate businesses hedge risk. At the same time, as \nwe try to put in place new rules around derivatives, we don't want to \npush the whole derivatives market offshore. While I commend the end-use \nexemption that was created and the goal of trying to get everything \ncleared and on exchanges, my hope is we can put some penalties in \nplace. Some of the penalties the Agriculture Committee has put in place \nperhaps could be triggered if the banks do not end up meeting what they \nbasically said, not overusing the end-use exemption or not getting all \ntheir products cleared or on the exchanges. My concern is that no \nmatter how good the end-use exemption we write, there will always be \nmore resources on Wall Street to find ways around even the best written \nlegislation on something where as much money was put in place. So \nputting in place trip wires that might then cause a Draconian response \nwould help self-police the industry.\n  One more example of the approach Chairman Dodd has taken on this \nbill. In my background, I spent 20 years in\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nthe finance industry before I was Governor. I was in the early stage \ncapital formation business, something that is very important in the \ntech community. A lot of firms that are thrown around on this floor and \nelsewhere I have been a client of, worked with, worked against. One of \nthe areas I had great concerns about in an earlier draft was anything \nthat might stop or slow the ability for startup companies to access \ncapital. There were some provisions in the bill that looked at the \ndefinition of a qualified investor that could hurt the creation of \nangel investors which are so critical to creating new jobs. There were \nperhaps provisions put in around the SEC in terms of new deals that \nmight have to be vetted for a long period.\n  If you are a startup company, you don't have 120 days before you can \nraise your dollars to kind of get to the next step to stay alive. I \ncite these two examples because instead of simply saying no to the \nchairman, I said: Yes, you raise good points. Others have raised these \npoints. They are changing the bill. I think that spirit is what the \nchairman is going to bring to the debate.\n  In the 20 years of being in the finance business or around the \nfinance business, I came to this body thinking I might know a little \nsomething about this subject. There was probably a month in which I \nrealized that whatever I knew was incremental and that the last year \nand a half I have had to go back and retest all of my assumptions. It \nhas been an enormously challenging and exciting experience. I come away \nfrom this year and a half--again, particularly working with Senator \nCorker, where we had everybody from across the political spectrum talk \nto us to get us up to speed on these issues--with a couple conclusions.\n  One, there is no Democratic or Republican solution to financial \nregulatory reform. If there is ever an area that should not be broken \ndown on partisanship, it is this issue. Second, what the market craves \nmost is predictability. Sometimes it is overstated: if you do this, oh, \nmy gosh, it will be the death knell of American capitalism--there has \nto be balance. But oftentimes those statements are overstated. At the \nend of the day, what the market wants is a good, commonsense bill that \nwill set the tone, not just for the next year or two but for the next \n20 to 30 years.\n  Finally, because of the good work of Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, \nand many others, common ground is attainable. I look forward to \nspending as much time as needed and appreciate in particular those on \nthe Republican side who agreed to bring this bill to the floor and no \nlonger are there going to be political shenanigans; let's air these \nissues back and forth.\n  There is a lot more to say about some of the critiques that are made \nof the bill. I look forward to that discussion and look forward to \nworking toward that common ground so we end up with 21st century \nfinancial rules of the road.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before we hear from my colleague from \nCalifornia, I thank Senator Warner of Virginia. He is a relatively new \nMember of this body and a new member of the committee, but I can't even \nbegin to aptly characterize his contribution to this product. Since day \none, he has been at every meeting, been involved in almost every \nconversation about this bill, particularly the focus that he and \nSenator Bob Corker agreed to take on in working out title I and title \nII of the bill dealing with resolution authority and too big to fail. \nHis background, his experience, his knowledge made a wonderful \ncontribution to this product. His interest in other matters is valued \nas well, because he brings two decades of living in a world in which \nthese matters were something he absolutely grappled with. We have a \nlong journey in front of us in the coming weeks to get through all of \nthis, but his continuing involvement in this Chamber on this subject \nmatter will be invaluable to all of us as we go forward. I thank him \nfor that.\n  Let me thank my colleague from California. She also has a background \non this subject matter. She has often talked about it. I thank her for \nwhat will be our first amendment on this bill, something I think brings \nall of us together. I thank her for her energy and interest in the \nsubject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3737\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for all his work on \nso many issues. Just the way things worked out, he has been so pivotal \nin health care reform and now in Wall Street reform. This is an era of \nreform. My friend should be very proud that he happens to be here at \nthis time, because we can't go back to the days we left. As a reminder, \nI will show you some of the headlines. It is worth a minute of looking \nat these headlines. This is taken from 2007 and 2008, some of the \nheadlines we had to face in those times: ``U.S. unemployment rate hits \n10.2 percent, highest in 26 years.'' How about this one: ``Nightmare on \nWall St.'' ``The bailout to end all bailouts.'' ``Wall Street's latest \ndownfall: Madoff charged with fraud.'' ``Credit crunch continues as \nlending rates climb.'' ``Jobs, wages nowhere near rock bottom yet.'' \n``Where do we go from here?'' ``The Nasdaq in biggest fall since the \ndot.com crash.'' ``Dow dives 778 points.'' ``U.S. loses 533,000 jobs in \nbiggest drop since 1974.'' We can see the look on this man's face. He \nis obviously standing in the middle of the New York Stock Exchange. \nThat explains how everybody felt as our constituents lost their wealth. \nThey lost their wealth and with it their confidence in America.\n  I want to continue with one more chart because all of us want so much \nto put this behind us. That is what we will do with this bill. But we \nhave to remember. ``Economy in crisis, what now?'' ``U.S. pension \ninsurer lost billions in market.'' ``Housing prices take biggest dive \nsince 1991.'' ``Full of doubts, U.S. shoppers cut spending.'' ``Wall \nStreet employees set to get 145 billion 2009,'' the bonuses during this \ntime. ``How low can they go?'' ``Home prices drop 42%.'' ``Carnage \ncontinues: 524,000 jobs lost in December.'' And from the San Jose \nMercury News: ``Foreclosure Wave, San Jose Fights to Protect \nNeighborhoods.''\n  What we are doing here is so important. I am so proud of the work \nSenator Dodd did in his committee that has brought us to this point. I \nam grateful that our Republican friends let this bill move forward. We \nwill have our debates. That is fine. But we can't afford to go back to \nthose old days. Those old days could happen unless we act, as the \nPresident has stated.\n  I want to take the time to thank Senator Dodd in particular for \nworking with us, as well as to thank the administration for working \nwith us, to come up with an amendment which will synthesize exactly \nwhat the bill does.\n  The purpose of this amendment--which is pending at the desk, which I \nam hopeful we will vote on Tuesday--says in its purpose: ``To prohibit \ntaxpayers from ever having to bail out the financial sector.''\n  When I heard my colleagues on the other side say Senator Dodd's bill \nwould ensure taxpayer bailouts, I knew it was false, and I went to \nSenator Dodd and colleagues on the committee and said I did not \nunderstand why these comments were coming from the other side, as if \nsaying this glass of water on my desk is a cup of coffee. No. This \nglass of water is a glass of water. It is not coffee. And if you say \nseven, eight, and nine times that it is coffee, somebody might believe \nit. That is how I view the comments from the other side that this is \nguaranteeing bailouts, when in fact it is not.\n  So I said to Chairman Dodd: I have an idea that we should put \ntogether a very simple amendment to the bill that basically says what \nwe know is true:\n\n       All financial companies put into receivership under this \n     title shall be liquidated.\n\n  No company is ever going to be kept afloat. No taxpayer funds should \never be used to prevent the liquidation of any financial company under \nthis title, that all funds expended will be repaid to the taxpayers by \nthe financial sector through assessments or the sale of the assets of \nthe company.\n  Then, we repeated at the end:\n\n       Taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of any \n     authority under this title.\n\n  I am going to put up the Boxer amendment. It simply fits right on \nthis chart, I say to my friends. It is very simple. If a company is \ntaken into receivership, liquidation must follow. Nobody is being kept \nafloat. No one's\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nbusiness is being kept afloat. They are liquidated.\n\n       Recovery of Funds.--All funds expended in the liquidation \n     of a financial company under this title shall be recovered \n     [either] from the disposition of assets of such financial \n     company, or shall be the responsibility of the financial \n     sector, through assessments.\n\n  Lastly, just in case people really wanted it stated--and I see some \nsmiles on faces because we worked together to make sure no one could \nturn this around--\n\n       No Losses to Taxpayers.--Taxpayers shall bear no losses \n     from the exercise of any authority under this title.\n\n  So let there be no mistake. Senator Dodd's arms were open to this \namendment. He said this reflects exactly what we have done. But he \nsaid: Senator, if you feel better if we put it in one place, we will do \nit.\n  I think it is important for the American people to understand the \nsimplicity of the approach: No loss to taxpayers, period, end of quote. \nSo if somebody goes on TV this weekend and says this bill is about \nbailing out companies and keeping them afloat with taxpayer funds, it \ncannot be done under the bill, and this amendment certainly brings it \nhome in a very simple, plain English fashion.\n  I am proud to be working with my colleague Senator Dodd. I used to \nsit on the Banking Committee, and I was kind of lured off the committee \nbecause the people in California said: We have to have somebody on the \nCommerce Committee. We have so much at stake there. So it was tough for \nme to walk away, but I did walk away. But I still retain the \nrelationships.\n  I am going to go through what is in the Dodd bill that I think is so \nterrific--then I am going to yield the floor--because Senator Dodd has \nbeen talking about this by himself, and I think he deserves to have a \nbit of a rest and the rest of us should come over here and talk about \nit.\n  Again, taxpayer bailouts are done. We know the bill itself does it, \nbut we have made it clear. Taxpayers are covered. We will have a cop on \nthe beat for our consumers. We will know that a Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau has only one job, and that is the job to look after \nour consumers so they are protected from the kind of deceptive and \nabusive practices that fueled this crisis.\n  Let's face it, this crisis was fueled by Wall Street, by speculation, \nno leverage requirements--lots of things--dark markets. This bill takes \non these issues.\n  We see another part: brings disclosure to dark markets. The bill \neliminates the loopholes that allow reckless speculative practices to \ngo unnoticed. It brings real regulation to derivatives markets and to \nthe ``shadow banking system.''\n  I think we are probably going to have some debate over this. But I \ncan say right now, when I worked on Wall Street so many years ago, I \nhave to say--too many years ago to remind myself of, but let's say it \nwas a long time ago, and it was in the 1960s--those were the years when \na $12 million share day on Wall Street was breaking all the records. \nNow a $1 billion share day isn't that much. We did not have these kinds \nof instruments. We did not have these kinds of toxic instruments that \nwere so complex.\n  When I asked Treasury Secretary Paulson about it--he was George \nBush's Secretary of the Treasury--he essentially held his head in his \nhands and said: You know, it is hard for me to explain this to you. \nThat is a fact. It did not build up my confidence very much. I have to \nsay, we need to have a financial system that is understandable by \neverybody. But certainly the Secretary of the Treasury should not have \nto hold his head in his hands and say: I can't explain it. We have to \nend those days, and the best way is sunshine.\n  So I say to Senator Dodd, you did a great job in working to bring \ndisclosure to the dark markets. Senator Lincoln, working through the \nAgriculture Committee, I think brought us even more protection, and \nthat is very good. Because I think the President said it well. The \nPresident said: We want everyone to prosper. We want everyone to be \ninnovative. But we do not want to put our people at risk. When people \nstart losing in the ways we were losing--20 percent of our net worth; \n40 percent, 50 percent the market went down--50 percent of its value--a \nlot of people lost their dreams, and it was unnecessary. But it \nhappened because there were markets that were in the dark, and there \nwere people who were not fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility to \ntheir clients.\n  What else does the Dodd bill do? It curbs risky behavior on Wall \nStreet. The bill provides for strict new capital and borrowing \nrequirements as financial companies grow in size and complexity and \npose a risk to the financial system.\n  Regulators will restrict proprietary trading--speculative gambling--\nby critical financial firms. We have situations where a firm is \nadvising a client--and we know this happened with Goldman Sachs--\nadvising clients to buy a particular instrument which happened to be \nworthless. And I cannot use the word the traders used to describe it \nbecause this is a family audience. These were junk, and they called \nthem worse than that. They were junk. They were being sold to the \ncustomers of Goldman while Goldman was taking a short position--in \nother words, a position that bet on these instruments' failure. The \nkind of e-mails that came out were reminiscent of the e-mails that came \nout during the Enron scandal, bragging about how widows and orphans \nwere going to get hurt.\n  Well, if there is anything we should do here, it is to protect our \npeople, not put them at greater risk.\n  There is going to be an early warning system created to prevent a \nfuture crisis--the Financial Stability Oversight Council--to focus on \nthe risks before they lead to a crisis. As a last resort, the \nregulators can break up a company that is too big to fail.\n  Lastly, of the big accomplishments of the bill, the bill protects \nagainst securities markets scams. It mandates management improvements \nand increased funding for the SEC. The bill creates a new SEC Office of \nCredit Rating Agencies to strengthen the regulation of credit rating \nagencies, many of which failed to correctly rate risky financial \nproducts.\n  I have to say, I am working on an amendment that is even stronger \nbecause, for me, as someone who relied on, so many years ago, the \nhonesty of these rating companies--these are the companies that say: \nThis is AA, this is AAA, this is A, this is B, this is bad--they are \ngetting paid by the people who have an interest in them giving a good \nrating. That is wrong, and we have to do something here to insert some \ntype of responsibility to the public. These rating agencies have a \nresponsibility to the public. I am working on some approaches. We do \nnot have it ready. We are going to talk to Senator Dodd, and we hope he \nwill be amenable to it. But we have some thoughts about it.\n\n  In this area, the people of this country are putting their hopes and \ndreams into the financial markets. It has been a great thing, in \ngeneral, over the years. It has been a great thing because America is a \ngreat country, and we have innovation and innovators, and we have \nventure capitalists who put it all on the line, and they hit, and we \ncan all do very well if we invest, even if we do it through our 401(k) \nor our company does it through a pension plan.\n  We know most Americans have a stake in these markets. I heard some \nthings from Goldman Sachs--they said something like this: Well, the \npeople we were selling to were sophisticated, and they should have \nknown better. But they stop short of the truth. Maybe they were \nsophisticated, and maybe they were not doing their job either; \ntherefore, it trickles down to the people who were relying on that so-\ncalled sophisticated investor. All we are saying is, we need reasonable \nrules of the road. We want to know a rating agency is giving it their \nbest shot to tell the truth about a security. We want to ensure that. \nIf there are new, exotic instruments being traded, that is fine, but \nlet's take a look at them in the light of day so people are fully \ninformed. Then, if you take a gamble, if you are fully informed, that \nis one thing. But if you do not understand you are taking a gamble, \nthat is another.\n  So again, I am very pleased we are at this point. Somebody said the \nonly reason we got here is we threatened to work through the night. \nMaybe there is some truth in that. Frankly, it does not matter to me. \nWe are at this point. We can get to this bill. My Republican\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\nfriends who say they want to improve it--they did not try to do it in \nthe committee, is my understanding--but if they want to do it now, I \nwelcome that because I am sure I will support some of their amendments \nif they are in the spirit of this bill. The spirit of the bill is \nprotecting consumers, protecting taxpayers, making sure taxpayers are \nnever on the hook, and stopping a situation like this one, as shown on \nthis chart, where every newspaper had pictures of people like this who \nwere at a loss to understand: How could this happen in America?\n  I get the chills thinking about the conversations many Democratic \nSenators had. I know Republicans had the same conversation with the \nSecretary of the Treasury and with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in which \nthey basically said: We are on the brink of collapse. We may never come \nback from this situation.\n  We cannot forget that. If we do not move to correct the system in \nways that are not overly burdensome, but we get it right--and I think \nSenator Dodd pretty much has gotten to that sweet spot on this thing; \nwe may want to move here or there with an amendment--if we can do this, \nif we did nothing else--and, by the way, we have done other things, and \nwe will do more--this is crucial. It is crucial to consumer confidence. \nConsumer confidence fuels 70 percent of the market. Let's do this \nright.\n  I thank my Republican friends who decided to work with us. I thank \nSenator Dodd for his patience, for his passion, and I am very happy he \nis leading us because he is so effective and he knows what he is \nsaying.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, I commend our colleague from \nCalifornia and thank her for her involvement and her ideas and \nsuggestions. Again, it is going to be helpful that we begin with a \nproposal that I think is going to bring us together. As I said--I \ncannot speak for others; but at least I have heard, when I have asked \npeople to comment on the Senator's proposal--there seems to be almost \nunanimity around the Senator's idea. In a debate that is obviously \ngoing to have us not with unanimity, as we move forward in a number of \nareas, I think it is always good to begin where we speak with one \nvoice. I think that common voice is making sure we never again have \nthat too-big-to-fail concept as part of our economic structure.\n  The Senator will be making a significant and historic contribution to \nthis effort, and I thank her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do not have any other requests for time to \nspeak this afternoon on this bill. But it is obviously a leadership \ncall as to what their decisions are to go forward.\n  Again, I want to say to my friend and colleague from Alabama, we have \nhad a very good working relationship, and it will continue through this \nprocess. We have already been discussing several ideas. I appreciate \nSenator Warner raising a couple of issues. The angel investor idea is \none that needs to be changed. I know my friend and colleague from \nMissouri, Kit Bond, has ideas on this as well, and I am going to be \ngetting in touch with him and asking him, along with Senator Warner and \nothers, to work on some language we can add to our bill. I know Senator \nCorker is working on some ideas as well and, again, we want to be \ncooperative. A number of my colleagues over here have been submitting \namendments, including Ben Cardin and others, Sherrod Brown. I know \nSenator Sanders has some amendments. We have a lot of ideas that are \ngoing to be coming up in the coming days, so we have a lot of work in \nfront of us before we complete action on this bill.\n\n  Again, I am grateful to Senator Shelby and the other members of the \nBanking Committee. They have been very helpful over these many months, \nand we have had long conversations about this. There are a lot of \ndifferent ideas as to how this all can work, but each and every one of \nthem made a constructive contribution to the process, and I am grateful \nto them for that. I am very grateful to Leader Reid. Obviously, none of \nthis happens without the involvement of the leader and his very fine \nstaff who have been tremendously helpful in us getting to this point by \nproviding the structure and the organization that allows us to actually \nbegin a debate. Many thought we couldn't even get to this debate. I \nwish to underscore something Senator Boxer said a few minutes ago. We \nspent a lot of time over the last 2 weeks; there was a lot of acrimony \nand finger-pointing as to why we weren't starting. That is behind us. \nWe have now started. Some people want to flyspeck that debate. The fact \nis, we are on the bill and we are moving forward. That is good news. My \nhope is, over the next few weeks, we will complete this bill.\n  With that, I will note the absence of a quorum and let the leadership \ndecide what they want to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, Wall Street's crisis became the \nNation's crisis. Lost jobs in Toledo, foreclosed homes in Bedford \nHeights, frozen credit for small businesses in Lebanon, State budget \nshortfalls, and the list goes on and on. It can't happen again. We must \nnot let it happen again.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of the Wall Street reform process \nis, some policymakers started with the premise that, first of all, Wall \nStreet wealth must be protected. Sure, they have their lobbyists. Sure, \nthey have their PR people spinning. But it amazes me to think that is \nwhere some people started this whole debate. They focused their \nenergies on minimizing the safeguards put in place to protect our \nNation from another financial meltdown.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, E.J. Dionne quotes an e-mail from \nan arrogant banker, who happens to work at Goldman Sachs, who wrote:\n\n       What if we created a ``thing,'' which has no purpose, which \n     is absolutely conceptual and highly theoretical and which \n     nobody knows how to price?\n\n  At some point, we have to ask in this body: Whom do we report to, the \nmegabanks that raked in millions by gambling with the livelihoods, the \nhomes, the retirement security of middle-class Americans, or do we \nreport to middle-class Americans themselves? Is our job to protect Wall \nStreet or is our job to protect against more taxpayer-funded bailouts?\n  In my view, we must take the steps necessary to eliminate bailouts \nand establish foolproof financial protections for the Americans we \nrepresent, and we do it even if the behemoth banks don't like it, even \nif Wall Street lobbyists don't like it, and even if most of my \nRepublican colleagues don't like it. That is what the amendment I will \noffer on Tuesday is all about.\n\n  In the last few decades, the banking industry has become so \nconcentrated it no longer functions as a competitive market. Yesterday \nI met with Kansas City Fed President Dr. Tom Hoenig. He observed that \nsince 1990, the 20 largest financial firms have increased their control \nof banking assets. They once controlled 35 percent of those assets. \nToday they control 70 percent. Some firms are 30 to 40 percent larger \nthan they had been just before the crisis.\n  What does that mean? We are twiddling our thumbs as Wall Street once \nagain places our Nation at risk.\n  Think about this: 15 years ago the 6 largest U.S. banks had assets \nequal to 17 percent of GDP. Today, the 6 largest megabanks in this \ncountry have combined assets of 63 percent of GDP; from 17 percent 15 \nyears ago, percent of GDP, assets as a percent of GDP, to 63 percent \ntoday. Three of these megabanks have close to $2 trillion--that is two \nthousand billion--$2 trillion of assets on their balance sheets and \nover $1 trillion in liabilities. Because our economy rides on a few \nmegabanks, taxpayer-funded bailouts are far more likely than if these \nbanks were not so dominant.\n  As we have seen, that is not the only downside of banking \nconcentration. It also jeopardizes our small businesses which generate \nover 60 percent of new jobs. The current distortion in the market gives \nprivileged large banks clear funding advantages, up to $34 billion \nannually over smaller community banks. These large banks could game the \nsystem far too often at the expense\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nof the smaller banks, at the expense of the community banks. These \nlarge banks have put a virtual freeze on spending on small businesses--\ndespite receiving this taxpayer bailout.\n  Three of these largest banks slashed their SBA lending by 86 percent \nfrom 2008 to 2009. In Ohio, SBA-backed loans--those are government-\nguaranteed loans to help small business. I know the Presiding Officer \nhas fought for small business in Duluth and Rochester and St. Paul, as \nI have for small business in Toldedo and Dayton and Cincinnati. In \n2007, SBA-backed loans in my State went from 4,200 to only 2,100 in \n2009. They basically were cut in half.\n  I have heard from manufacturers and entrepreneurs, energy startups \nand mom-and-pop corner stores--all small business owners who strive to \nbe in the middle class and bring their employees up to the middle \nclass, who are struggling to get the credit they need to hire workers \nand expand businesses. They have the capacity, they have the customers, \nthey simply cannot get the credit they need to expand. It is clearly \nnot the small banks who are cutting their lending. In fact, according \nto the Kansas City Fed, 45 percent of banks with assets under $1 \nbillion actually increased their business lending in 2009.\n  What do the megabusinesses do instead of lending? In the last year \nWall Street megafirms have increased their trading by 23 percent. They \nare trading with each other on Wall Street so they can make money. They \nare not making loans to Main Street because it simply is not as \nprofitable for them.\n  Last year, we let 100 community banks fail across the Nation. \nMeanwhile, we spent $165 billion of taxpayers' money to keep the big \nsix banks afloat. But the cost of having these six megabanks is even \ngreater. The Bank of England estimates that the true social cost to our \neconomy of the financial crisis has exceeded $4 trillion, four thousand \nbillion dollars. If we don't want another economic crisis, if we don't \nwant more small business failures, if we don't want more bailouts, we \nneed to do something about the unprecedented concentration of wealth \namong a few large banks.\n  That is why Senator Kaufman of Delaware, Senator Casey of \nPennsylvania, Senator Merkley of Oregon, Senator Whitehouse of Rhode \nIsland, Senator Harkin of Iowa, Senator Sanders of Vermont, Senator \nBurris of Illinois, and I have introduced this amendment modeled after \nthe Safe Banking Act of 2010. These Senators come from the East and the \nSouth and the Midwest and all over our country. They will rise with me \nin support of the Brown-Kaufman amendment.\n  It would prevent any financial institution from becoming so large \nthat it could jeopardize the entire economy. Too big to fail means too \nbig to exist. The amendment would scale back the six largest banks of \nthe Nation--just six banks but six megabanks. Those six banks' total \nassets, as I said, are 63 percent of gross domestic product in this \ncountry. This amendment would require them to liquidate some of their \nbank before it is too late.\n  That would mean they could spin off one of their lines of work, they \ncould reduce one of their lines of work, they could do less business in \none region--whatever--so they are not megabanks with this kind of power \nover our economy.\n  Our amendment would place statutory limits on the leverage of these \nbanks. Our amendment imposes sensible size constraints on these banks. \nThe leverage ratio would be set in the vicinity of 6 percent--about 16 \nto 1.\n  We saw on Wall Street one of the things that brought on this crisis \nwas there were ratios of 25 and 30 and sometimes even 35 or 40 to 1. \nThis amendment would cap concentration of deposits held by any one bank \nat 10 percent of the Nation's deposits, about $750 billion--not small \nbut not so humongous as they are now.\n  The bill we will be considering beginning next week is strong, but it \nneeds to be stronger. It focuses on monitoring risk--that is the right \nthing--and taking action should regulators believe the risk has grown \ntoo big. But we know the regulators didn't exactly do it right during \nthe Bush years, and that is why it is so important that we write \nlegislation in a way to keep these large banks from getting too big. We \nshould not just monitor risk until we are once again on the brink of \ntrouble. We should learn from recent history and correct our regulatory \nmistakes by nipping risk in the bud. That means preventing the \nanticompetitive concentration of banks that become too big to fail and \nbank on that to engage in high-risk behavior. Not only would our \namendment help prevent bailouts and protect us against economic \ncollapse, it would help boost lending to small businesses.\n  I am joined in the Chamber by the Senator from Louisiana who has \nspecialized in finding ways to help small businesses. She knows, as I \ndo, these small businesses have not gotten the kind of credit they need \nto expand; that they have the capacity to grow; that they have the \nemployees, they have the customers, but they too often have not been \nable to get credit.\n  The Brown-Kaufman amendment would take action now to prevent economic \ncollapse and taxpayer-funded bailouts in the future. We believe the \nAmerican public does not want regulators to wait and see whether \nanother crisis develops. We should prevent it before it starts.\n  Too big to fail is too big. The American people saw the arrogance of \nGoldman bankers who seem, with little regret, without second thought, \nto completely disregard the public interest. They want us to teach Wall \nStreet megabanks a lesson that they will never again monopolize \nAmerica's wealth or gamble away America's dreams.\n  This is not about retribution. This is about protecting the American \npublic from banks too big to fail, banks that are too big to exist. It \nwill affect a relatively small number of banks, but these banks, \nfrankly, have too much power over our economy. These banks, coupled \nwith their risk and their size, present a real threat to the future \nprosperity of our great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Before I begin on my topic, which is different from the \ntopic of the Senator from Ohio--I thank him for his comments about our \nfocus on small business and assure him, as the Chair knows, that we are \ndoubling our efforts this week to hone in on a package of support and \nhelp for small businesses in America. We believe the recovery can take \nplace and will take place, but it will be led in large measure by the \nsmall businesses in America. We are going to do our very best, after we \ndeal with this bill that is on the Senate floor, to focus the attention \nof the Senate in that regard.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio and look forward to working with him in \nthe weeks ahead.\n\n\n                          Tragedy in the Gulf\n\n  Madam President, I rise today, though, to speak on an equally serious \nsubject--actually, a tragedy and disaster that is occurring right now \noff the coast of my home State, in Louisiana. On Tuesday, on April 20, \nas we all now know, at approximately 10 p.m., a tremendous and terrible \nexplosion occurred aboard a state-of-the-art drill ship, the Transocean \nDeepwater Horizon.\n  There were 126 men and women onboard that rig. It was drilling in \nalmost 6,000 feet of water--a real technological feat--some 50 miles \noff the Louisiana coast. The explosion, unfortunately and sadly, killed \n11 men and 17 others were injured--3 of them critically--and today 1 \nremains in the hospital.\n  We don't know what precisely caused this accident, but at present it \nappears that the blow-out preventer failed. We do not know why.\n  The blowout preventer is a very large piece of equipment. I would \nlike to try to explain.\n  It is, of course, very dark down in the depths of the ocean. This is \nthe best picture we have. This is what the floor of the ocean looks \nlike. This is the blowout preventer. This is a graph of it.\n  It is a standard piece of equipment on all wells, and it is a huge \npiece of equipment on a well like this. It would weigh up to 500 tons. \nIt is about 18 feet in length. At some point this piece of equipment, \nwhich is standard--this piece of equipment, which is tested every 14 \ndays, as required by law--\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\nfailed. This actual piece of equipment, this blowout preventer on this \nrig, was actually tested 10 days before this tragic incident, and it \npassed the inspection.\n  The investigation that is fully underway now and will continue for \nmany weeks and months will tell us more. But what we know today is the \nblowout preventer failed. The explosion that occurred ignited the oil \nand gas that flowed from a riser pipe that was connected to the well at \nthe sea bed. This riser pipe is a very thick and strong pipe. Right \nnow, today, as we speak, it is curled on the bottom of the ocean floor \nmuch like a garden hose would be, twisted in many places, but the well \nis not closed. So there are anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels of oil \nleaking from this well.\n  Despite heroic efforts that have been underway now for days, this has \nnot been closed. This will continue to leach and leak until it is. The \nrig burned, as did the oil and gas that issued forth, for some 36 \nhours, and then the rig began to take on water and ultimately sank to \nthe sea floor.\n  As I said, we know what the leak rate is, and it is headed to shore. \nThese are the facts. Everyone agrees this accident was and is an \nunmitigated disaster. I know the hearts and prayers of everyone in the \nUnited States are with the families of those who lost their lives and \nthose who are injured and we continue to pray for them as they recover.\n  But the issue for us is to acknowledge this and to make decisions \nabout how to move forward. Today, the U.S. Coast Guard reports that a \nrainbow sheen can be seen in the water--I will put up a map in a \nminute--about 32 miles by 42 miles in length. What is important about \nthis sheen is that 97 percent of it is a rainbow sheen. Only 3 percent \ncontains emulsified crude.\n  I would like to take a moment to explain what emulsified crude means. \nIt is a thicker oil clotted in water, but even in the areas where the \ncrude has beaded or gathered on the water's surface, it is a very thin \nlayer. In fact, in a briefing with the Coast Guard yesterday, the oil \nslick at its thickest point is about a millimeter or two in thickness, \nabout the thickness of a couple of strands of hair.\n  So it is important to understand why this is an unprecedented \ndisaster. The oil slick is wide and covers a large section of our \nocean. It is very thin; 97 percent of it is an extremely thin sheen of \nrelatively light oil on the surface.\n  I do not say that to diminish the tragedy, but to accurately convey \nto the American people what we are dealing with. This is not the heavy, \nthick oil that stained the Santa Barbara coast in 1969, nor does it \nlook like Prudhoe Bay crude that spilled from the ruptured hull of a \ntanker in 1989.\n  But what is of immediate concern to the people of my State and the \nGulf Coast is that the oil sheen is approaching our shores. The edge of \nthe sheen is approximately 23 miles off the coast of Plaquemines \nParish. This could change in a few days. We do not know. But it looks \nas though the spill is going to move right to the mouth of the \nMississippi River, to the Bayou La Loutre Pass.\n  In the meantime, I do know that there are 56,000 feet of flexible \nbarrier that have been deployed to contain the spill. That is about 15 \nmiles of barrier. An additional 31 miles is available to be deployed, \nand 72 miles of barrier and buffer have been ordered.\n  I also know there are literally hundreds if not thousands of people--\nI have been on the phone with the Commandant of the Coast Guard, I have \nbeen on the phone the last 3 days with the Admiral of the Coast Guard, \nMary Landry. I have spoken to the Department of Interior, I have kept \nin touch with local and parish officials. I do know there are hundreds \nand thousands of people at work, in Houma, LA, outside of Hammond, LA, \nand hundreds along the coast doing everything they can to minimize \npotential damage to our shore.\n  We are investigating every hour what more can be done. There are 70 \nresponse vessels in place. They are being used as skimmers, tugs, \nbarges, and recovery vessels, and approximately 1,000 government/\nindustry response personnel are on site responding to the incident. \nSome 65,000 gallons of dispersant have been deployed, and an additional \n110,000 gallons are available. And, today, a controlled burn began. \nThere are different views about how this oil can be eliminated. Some of \nit is dispersed naturally, some of it can be burned. It has to be \ncorralled and burned and, of course, controlled.\n  This has not happened in this depth of water. So the industry and our \ngovernment officials are using everything known at our disposal now to \ntake care of it. Some of it will be trial and error.\n  I want to spend a minute about what the options should be. We have \nseen disasters such as this before. We have seen them in the oil \nindustry when tankers explode or hit ground. We have seen them in \nshipping, when ships, for no apparent reason, sink in the middle of an \nocean. We have seen them in the nuclear power industry. And, in fact, \nwe have seen them in our space program.\n  We must react to this disaster in the measured but right way. We must \napply the lessons of past tragedies to this one, so we can make the \nbest and wisest decisions that will instruct us about how to move \nforward. I do not believe we can react in fear. I do not believe we \nshould retreat.\n  One option would be the way we dealt with, and I think it was a poor \nchoice, the Three Mile Island nuclear powerplant disaster. There were \nno deaths or injuries, but the disaster was so frightening to people, \nthere was so much concern, that basically we brought all new nuclear \npowerplant applications to a screeching halt.\n  In hindsight, that was not the right decision. Today, we are 30 years \nbehind the French in nuclear technology. France gets 80 percent of its \nelectricity from nuclear; we get less than 20. France is the largest \nnet exporter of electric power, exporting 18 percent of its total \nproduction to Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Britain, and Germany. \nIts electricity cost is the lowest in Europe.\n  Today, Areva, a French company, is the world's leading nuclear \ncompany. It could have been a U.S. company, but it is not, because we \nran, we retreated out of fear. We did not, in my view, respond the way \nwe should have.\n  For those who are interested in reducing carbon emissions--and I am \none of them--consider that France's carbon emissions per kilowatt hour \nare less than one-tenth of Germany's, and one-thirteenth that of \nDenmark. France's emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide have \nbeen reduced by 70 percent over 20 years, even though their total \noutput of power has tripled. Let me repeat that. Its emissions of \nnitrogen oxide and sulfur have been reduced by 70 percent, even through \ntheir production has tripled because they moved forward with nuclear \npower, found a way, fine-tuned their technology.\n  But because of our poor and inappropriate and wrong reaction, our \nUnited States has largely sat out of the nuclear renaissance at great \nexpense to our country. We have allowed foreign companies to step in as \nglobal leaders and 30 years later we are now trying to make up that \nground. So retreat is not an option.\n  By contrast, we can look at how we, the United States, responded to \nthe 1986 disaster of the Space Shuttle Challenger. I can remember \nexactly where I was, as many Americans can remember when that incident \nhappened. We all remember the joy of the takeoff and of the launch, and \nthen the unbelievable visual of that space shuttle exploding into a \nbillion pieces in space, losing all seven lives, and, remember, there \nwas a teacher on board, Christa McAuliffe. The horror of that disaster \nshocked us all, and it haunts us to this day. However, what we did not \ndo is end the space program. We did not stop launching. We did not stop \nexploring.\n  As we go through with this disaster, and we handle it, whether it \ntakes us a week or several weeks or a month or several months, we have \nto find a way to make sure it never happens again, strengthen our \nresolve, strengthen our technology, and continue to be the world leader \nin clean technology in this world. We did not declare the risks were \ntoo great and the benefits of the program were too few. We moved \nforward. As a result, the United States remains a global leader in the \nspace race, and we must continue to remain a leader in energy \nproduction, even as we transition from fossil fuels to wind and solar \nand other offshore opportunities.\n  No one has ever claimed, including myself, an unabashed proponent of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\nindustry, that drilling is risk free. The people of my home State of \nLouisiana know these risks better than anyone, both the safety of the \nrig workers, and to the environment itself. But we also know that \nAmerica needs 21 million gallons of oil a day to keep this economy \nmoving. Twenty-one million gallons of oil a day are necessary for this \neconomy. This well is leaching right now 5,000. That is less than one-\nfourth of 1 percent of the oil that is necessary.\n  So we must continue to drill. For advocates who say we cannot afford \nto drill off our coast, then what coast should we drill off of? Should \nwe have all of our oil coming, 100 percent, from Saudi Arabia or \nVenezuela or Honduras or West Africa? We have to take responsibility to \ndrill where we can safely. Out away from our shores is as safe as we \ncan be. We obviously have to improve our technology, and that we will. \nRetreat, we will not.\n  Let me give a few more facts, and then I will wrap up my comments. It \nis more risky to import our oil in tankers than it is to drill for it \noffshore, even considering this disaster we are dealing with today. \nAccording to a report by the National Academy of Sciences, spills from \ntankers bringing oil in from overseas account for four times as many \noil spills as does offshore drilling.\n  Compared to how much oil we use in this country, the industry spill \nrate is quite low. Minerals Management Service reports offshore \noperators have a spill rate of only .001 percent since 1980. That means \nthat 99.99 percent of all oil is produced, transported, and consumed \nsafely.\n  Again, I am not saying that to minimize this disaster. We know the \nblowout preventer failed. There may be other safeguards that must be \nput into place. The investigation will show that. There may be those \nwho need to be held accountable. The investigation will show that as \nwell.\n  But the fact is, natural seeps introduce as much as 150 times more \noil into our oceans than does offshore drilling. I agree we do not want \nto drill everywhere. I do not think we should drill in Yosemite \nNational Park. I believe there are places such as the Great Lakes and \nother places potentially off the Atlantic Coast that we should not \ndrill. But using the right amount of buffer zone, whether it is 50 \nmiles, or 35 miles, or 100 miles, using up-to-date technologies, backup \nblowout preventers, something I am learning about that actually goes on \nin Norway and other countries, might also reduce these risks even \nfurther.\n  But let me say one more word before I close, a word about revenue \nsharing. I have been probably the most outspoken advocate in this \nSenate, and will continue to be, and am proud of my advocacy on the \npart of coastal States, particularly the States of Texas, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama, that have been host to this industry for the \nbetter part of 75 years. We have lived through its ups and downs. We \nhave lived through disasters such as this, and periods of relative \ncalm. We have benefitted from the millions of dollars that have \nbenefitted our States indirectly through jobs. But with all that we \nhave done, generating almost $5 billion in taxes off the Gulf Coast, \nout of this Gulf Coast, $5 billion a year comes to the Federal \nTreasury. The fishermen in Plaquemines Parish, the fishermen in St. \nBernard, the schoolchildren in Orleans and in Jefferson have not \nreceived one penny, even though in our whole State today, many people \nalong the coast are standing watch to keep this oil spill from our \nshores.\n  We have come here time and time again and said, we are proud to be \npartners in this industry, even today, in the midst of this disaster we \nstill have. But you must understand the risk. We do. And we would like \nto have a portion of that funding to help us either have the kind of \ntechnology in place to invest in our wetlands, to fill up some of these \ncanals that have been left, even as we make the industry reach to \nhigher and better standards. I hope that as people watch this disaster \nunfold, they will hear again the call of the gulf coast Senators and \nHouse Members to allow us to share these revenues in a fair way so we \ncan all benefit from the upside, and most certainly share the downside, \nas we will do in the next weeks and months ahead.\n  We are going to continue to monitor, to react, to do everything we \ncan to save the environment, to investigate the accident, to continue \nto nurture and care for those who are still injured, and to comfort \nthose who have lost members of their family. There is a young mother I \nspoke to who lost her 21-year-old husband, and will be raising a 3-\nmonth-old and a 3-year-old by herself, at least for the foreseeable \nfuture. There are many other stories like that. But we are proud to be \npart of producing the resources this country needs, as we work on \ntechnologies to prevent these kinds of disasters in the future. We do \nnot believe that moving this production completely off of our shore is \nthe answer. We do not believe burying our head in the sand and \npretending the country does not need 21 million gallons of oil a day, \nor pretending we can get this energy tomorrow from somewhere else--we \nmay get it somewhere else in 20 or 30 years, but not next week, and not \nthe month after, and not the year after.\n  So let us be careful in the way we move forward. Let us be measured. \nLet us be open to hear the facts. Let us hold people accountable for \nwhat happened and understand what happened and prevent it again. In the \nmeantime, I know the Coast Guard, the military, Louisiana's agencies, \nand our local officials are going to do everything we can to protect \nour people and our environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to support the Democracy Is \nStrengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act, or the \nDISCLOSE Act, Senator Schumer's bill to fight the effects of the \nCitizens United decision.\n  I want to tell Minnesotans listening at home why I support this bill. \nI want to talk about the problem this bill addresses and how this bill \nfixes that problem. I also want to talk about a part of this \nlegislation that came from a bill I introduced earlier this year.\n  A lot of people don't follow the Supreme Court very closely, so I \nwould like to summarize what the Citizens United decision does. In a \nnutshell, it allows corporations to spend as much money as they want, \nwhenever they want, in any election in this country. It lets \ncorporations spend their shareholder money to do this. What is worse, \nit will allow foreign subsidiaries, wholly owned by foreign \ngovernments, to spend just as much money as their American competitors.\n  This decision changed our election laws in a radical way. In a single \ndecision, the Supreme Court reversed a century-old legal standard, 2 \nFederal laws, 24 State laws, including a 20-year-old Minnesota law, and \n2 of its own decisions, one of which it handed down just 6 years ago. I \nam not a lawyer and I don't speak Latin, but unless the term ``stare \ndecisis'' means ``overrule stuff,'' I think we have an activist court \non our hands.\n  But I don't want to talk about legal precedent; I want to talk about \nhow this decision will affect people's everyday lives. I want to talk \nabout the crisis Citizens United has created for communities: for the \nsafety of our communities and for our ability to run them without a \npermission slip from big business.\n  Let me give a couple of examples of policies that might never have \nbeen enacted if Citizens United had been the law of the land.\n  As of 1965, when America's population was about half as large as it \nis today, 50,000 people died every year from car accidents. Believe it \nor not, the auto industry knew full well it could prevent a large \nportion of highway deaths just by installing seatbelts in every car \nthey sold. But as late as the early 1960s, they refused to do that. \nThey said: ``Safety doesn't sell.'' They lobbied against legislation to \nrequire seatbelts.\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\n  Fortunately for all of us, in 1966 Congress passed a law requiring \nall passenger cars to have seatbelts. By the year 2000, the fatality \nrate from car accidents had dropped by 71 percent.\n  Here is another story. In the 1920s, oil companies started adding \nlead to gasoline. They did this even though they knew that lead was a \npoison. In fact, 80 percent of the workers at Standard Oil's very first \nlead gas plant died of or got lead poisoning. This didn't stop oil \ncompany representatives from testifying before this very body \nrepeatedly that leaded gasoline and lead pollution in the air were \ntotally safe. That is what they said.\n  But Congress didn't take the bait. In 1970, Congress passed the Clean \nAir Act and phased out leaded gasoline over the next two decades. By \n1995, the percentage of children with elevated levels of lead in their \nblood had dropped by 84 percent. By 2000, the level of ambient lead in \nthe air had dropped 98 percent.\n  A lot of people know that the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle \nSafety Act and the Clean Air Act of 1970 are two of the pillars of \nmodern consumer and environmental safety laws. Here is another thing \nthey have in common: They were both passed about 60 days before midterm \nelections.\n  Do you think the seatbelt bill would have been as strong if GM could \nhave run $1 million in attack ads against vulnerable Congressmen, by \nname, in the last months before those elections?\n  Do you think the Clean Air Act would have been so aggressive on lead \nif Standard Oil could have spent $10 million against lawmakers in \nTexas? These kinds of corporate expenditures would have been made \npossible by Citizens United, and this is what the DISCLOSE bill will \nfight.\n  Here is my point. At the end of the day, this bill is not about \nelection law. It's not about campaign finance. It's about seatbelts. \nIt's about clean air. It's about protecting our right to improve our \nlives without some corporation saying: No, you can't do that.\n  I want to talk a little about how the DISCLOSE Act is going to temper \nthe effects of Citizens United.\n  First, the bill will make sure voters know who is really behind any \nadvocacy group's election ad. Both the head of the advocacy group and \nits top contributors will have to appear in and approve every ad. These \ngroups will also have to disclose their top donors to the Federal \nElection Commission.\n  Secondly, the DISCLOSE Act will enhance accountability to \nshareholders. Corporations will have to disclose their political \nexpenditures in periodic reports. They will have to post this \ninformation on their Web sites. I have worked with Senator Schumer on \ngetting strong disclosure provisions, so I am particularly pleased to \nsee these provisions in place.\n  Thirdly, under the DISCLOSE Act, government contractors receiving \nmore than $50,000 will be banned from spending money on our elections. \nThe same goes for recipients of TARP funds who have yet to pay \ntaxpayers back. This makes sense. If companies are getting taxpayers' \nmoney, they should not be able to turn around and spend that same money \nto tell taxpayers how to vote.\n  I want to talk about a fourth part of the bill which I think is \ncrucial. As President Obama said in his State of the Union Address in \nJanuary, the Citizens United decision won't just open the floodgates \nfor special interests; it is going to open the floodgates for foreign \ninterests. Under Citizens United, foreign companies with subsidiaries \nin the United States will be able to use those companies to spend \nwithout limit in American elections. As President Obama said, American \nelections should not be bankrolled by foreign entities. Can't we all \nagree on that?\n  That is why that day, a few hours before President Obama stood before \nthe combined Houses of Congress, I introduced the American Elections \nAct, a bill that would close loopholes in our current laws that allow \nforeign companies to spend freely in our elections.\n  I am thrilled to say that the DISCLOSE Act contains three of the core \nprovisions of my legislation. I am so thankful to Senator Schumer for \nreaching out to work together to include them and for his remarks this \nmorning. He has been a true champion on this issue.\n  Let me summarize these provisions. First, the DISCLOSE Act bars \nelection spending by companies in which a foreign national controls \npolitical decisionmaking or the company's operations. This effectively \ncodifies an existing regulation. Secondly, it bars election spending by \ncompanies in which foreign nationals make up a majority of the board of \ndirectors. Finally, it bars election spending by companies in which a \nforeign entity owns a controlling share of stock, defined by the \nleading Delaware standard for a controlling share, which is 20 percent \nstock ownership. This may seem low, but, in fact, 31 out of the 32 \nStates that define a controlling share with a number define it as 20 \npercent or less. Actually, almost all of them define it as 10 percent, \nincluding Minnesota.\n  They all boil down to this: If a foreign individual, foreign company, \nor foreign government controls your company, your company should not be \nspending freely in American elections. American elections should be \ncontrolled by Americans.\n  My Republican colleagues are saying that we are fighting a paper \ntiger here, that we should not be concerned about foreign influence in \nour elections because the law already prohibits it. The day after \nPresident Obama delivered his State of the Union, Minority Leader \nMcConnell came to the floor to talk about this, and said that President \nObama was wrong and that the law was actually ``crystal clear'' on \nforeign spending. He said:\n\n       [C]ontrary to what the President and some of his surrogates \n     in Congress say, foreign persons, corporations, partnerships, \n     associations, organizations or other combination of persons \n     are strictly prohibited from any participation in U.S. \n     elections, just as they were prohibited before the Supreme \n     Court's Citizens United decision.\n\n  ``Strictly prohibited from any participation''? Yet, in fact, because \nour current laws are vague and out of date, even CITGO, a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of the Government of Venezuela, could easily spend freely in \nour elections before Citizens United.\n  Current Federal law has three main provisions against Federal \ninfluence:\n  First, companies must be incorporated and have their principal place \nof business in the United States.\n  CITGO's parent company is located in Venezuela, but CITGO itself is \norganized under the laws of Delaware, with its principal place of \nbusiness in Texas. CITGO passes that test.\n  Second, the Federal Elections Commission requires that any political \nspending by foreign subsidiaries be drawn from profits made in America.\n  No problem for CITGO. The latest SEC 10-K filing we could obtain \nshowed $625 million in annual profits here in the United States. CITGO \npasses that test. But it can only spend $625 million on American \nelections.\n  Finally, current regulations require that all political \ndecisionmaking for a company be made by Americans, not foreign \nnationals.\n  You would think that because CITGO's board of directors has no \nAmericans--it is just four Venezuelan citizens--it couldn't pass this \ntest. But believe it or not, a July 2000 decision from the Federal \nElections Commission said that even this would not disqualify a \ncompany. As long as a board of directors formed an elections committee \nwith only American members, that company can still spend on elections, \neven with 100 percent foreign board membership.\n  So there you have it. If our current laws can't stop Hugo Chavez, \nwhom can they stop?\n  Far from expanding the rights of American companies and leaving \nforeign ones behind a legal firewall, Citizens United has expanded the \nexisting rights of American companies and foreign subsidiaries equally. \nBoth American companies and foreign subsidiaries can now spend as much \nmoney as they want whenever they want in our elections.\n  We need to act now to protect our elections against foreign \ngovernments. We need to act now to protect our consumer safety and our \nenvironmental laws against a corporate veto. We need to act now to pass \nthe DISCLOSE Act, which I am proud to join as an original cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DOROTHY I. HEIGHT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor today to pay \ntribute to a great civil rights leader of our Nation, a woman who was \nmemorialized today at the National Cathedral here in Washington, DC. Of \ncourse, I am speaking of Dr. Dorothy Height, who was a tremendous \ntrailblazer, a true heroine of our time, a great leader of the civil \nrights movement. She had tremendous courage and tremendous \ndetermination that allowed women all over our Nation and, in fact, the \nworld to break through irrational limits set by society at large. She \nwas an inspiration to me and I know to the Presiding Officer and to \nother women who serve in this Chamber and to women leaders in all 50 \nStates.\n  She was the chair and president emerita of the National Council of \nNegro Women. The council was founded, as we know, by Mary McLeod \nBethune when she brought 28 women's organizations together to improve \nthe quality of life for women. Dr. Height embraced that vision and \ncontinued her work, her crusade for justice. Through her leadership, \nshe changed our Nation by shining a light on discrimination and \ninjustice, which was all too common in the century that has just ended. \nAnd we still find versions and, unfortunately, visions of it here \ntoday.\n  She was a member of many other organizations that have come to \nrepresent so many good things about America, such as the YWCA. She was \na very proud member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and traveled here \nfrequently with her sorority sisters, who I know are in true mourning \nfor her today as well. Through her dedication and commitment to these \norganizations, she encouraged women to be leaders in national and \ncommunity organizations and on college campuses.\n  She had an extraordinary presence, a very big and warm heart. She was \na great intellect. She had a passion for people, and in her own quiet \nbut very forceful way, she brought great change to our Nation.\n  She has received any number of awards. Many of those were mentioned \ntoday and in the past weeks, as we remember her fondly--the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom Award, the Congressional Gold Medal \nAward.\n  I was proud to join many of my colleagues in introducing a resolution \nhonoring the life and legacy of Dr. Height. She will be greatly missed. \nShe will be fondly remembered. There are very few women who will live \nin this century and have the kind of impact she has had on so many of \nus. So our prayers and thoughts are with her family and with her \nclosest of friends. But I wanted to give a moment of honor to her on \nthe Senate floor today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today, as I am pleased we are \nfinally moving to Wall Street reform--something I have come to speak \nabout several times on the floor. That is critically important to our \ncountry, critically important to our economy, critically important to \ninvestors and consumers to have confidence, and I am glad we are moving \nto that, as a member of the Banking Committee. But at the same time, \nthere is an enormous environmental challenge taking place in our \ncountry, one that I think portends the consequences of offshore \ndrilling.\n  I rise today to discuss the tragedy in the gulf and looming \nenvironmental disaster that threatens the gulf.\n  First, I want to remember those who lost their lives in the tragic \nfire and explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of \nMexico last week. Our thoughts and prayers are with the workers and \ntheir families.\n  The loss of life and the injuries are truly horrific, but this is \nalso an environmental tragedy, one that threatens to reach historic \nproportions. Over 1 million gallons of oil have already leaked into the \ngulf. Each hour that passes without a solution, without a way to stop \nit, leads us to wonder what the extent of the damage will be. It is a \nwake-up call to all who are trying to weigh the benefits against the \nrisks of offshore drilling as part of our energy mix. It certainly \nleads this Senator to wonder about the wisdom and the necessity of \ndrilling off the coast of my State of New Jersey and, I would argue, \noff the coast of any Senator's coastal State.\n  As I stand on this floor today--and I show you this picture I have in \nthe Chamber of the fire the Deepwater Horizon oil rig was engulfed in \nbefore it sunk--before it sunk--and then had all of the oil spilling \ninto the gulf. As I stand here on this floor today, an oil slick bigger \nthan the State of Delaware--over 4,000 square miles--is drifting toward \nshore--drifting toward shore. To give you some perspective of what that \nmeans, as shown in this other picture, this is how big this oil sheen \nis when compared to my home State of New Jersey--all of the yellow. If \nthis spill in the gulf were happening, for example, in Virginia waters \nright now, my whole State would be holding its breath because NOAA has \nshown my office how a spill in Virginia waters could easily wash up on \nthe New Jersey shore.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I do not know if you have visited New \nJersey, but we have magnificent, pristine beaches. The dunes along the \ncoast are breathtaking. Wildlife is abundant. Tourism depends on it. It \nwould all--it would all--be in jeopardy.\n  The next photograph I want to show is what happens to wildlife in \nthese oil slicks. This is a photograph in the aftermath of the Exxon \nValdez spill. We hope and pray the spill in the gulf stays offshore, \nbut the reality is, it could make landfall any day now and this \nphotograph could be repeated a thousand times.\n  Now we learn the spill from the Deepwater Horizon is worse than it \nwas originally reported--far worse, at least five times worse. The \nCoast Guard and NOAA have revised their estimate of the leak. They now \nsay it is not 42,000 gallons per day but 210,000 gallons a day. Imagine \nif the leak continues for 2 months, which seems like a real possibility \nat this point. In 2 months, it will have exceeded the amount of oil \nspilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster. Let's keep something in mind: The \nExxon Valdez was a tanker with a finite amount of oil aboard. This is \nvirtually a bottomless pit of oil.\n  When asked to compare this spill to previous spills, the Coast Guard \ncompared it to the IXTOC I spill. On June 3, 1979, an exploratory well \ncalled the IXTOC I blew out in the Gulf of Mexico. It took 9 months--9 \nmonths--to cap, to seal, and the resulting spill was the second largest \nin world history, over 10 times larger than the Exxon Valdez spill. As \nmy colleagues can see from this map which has Texas, Louisiana, and the \ngulf, the spill traveled 600 miles from its center--600 miles--\nblanketing the coasts of Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana, causing \nextraordinary damage.\n\n  Now we are debating the wisdom of expanding oil production on the \nOuter Continental Shelf; in essence, all along the coastlines of our \ncountry. Some think the way to expand offshore drilling reasonably is \nsimply to create some type of a buffer zone off the coast as if a \nlittle more room can protect our shores; as if the ocean is in neat, \nlittle boxes that could somehow be confined. Frankly, I think this \ngraphic of the IXTOC spill shows that oilspills don't respect State \nborders or buffer zones.\n  In the wake of what we are seeing in the gulf, I am deeply concerned \nthat the current 5-year plan recently announced by the administration \nwould allow oil drilling less than 100 miles from Cape May, NJ. Cape \nMay is a great historical place in New Jersey with beautiful beaches--\nsome of the greatest beaches in the Nation. Cape May, where Delaware \nBay meets the Atlantic, is the epicenter of bird migration on the \nentire East Coast and\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\none of New Jersey's most significant seaside resort communities; the \nfourth most lucrative fishing port in the entire Nation, rich with \nscallop beds. It is less than 10 miles from Delaware waters--waters \nthat the administration announced they are studying for possible future \ndrilling.\n  So I am concerned that if the lease sales go forward, the coastlines \nof Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey will be under threat--not just an \nenvironmental threat but an economic one as well. Approximately 60 \npercent--60 percent--of New Jersey's $38 billion tourism industry comes \nfrom the Jersey shore, and the State's multibillion-dollar fishing \nindustry would also be threatened by the specter of a potential \noilspill.\n  We had an unfortunate incident in New Jersey's history. Years ago, in \n1987, when the shore was polluted with medical waste in that year and \nmedical waste that ended up on the beaches of New Jersey--syringes on \nthe beach of New Jersey and other medical waste on the beaches of New \nJersey--tourism revenue dropped 22 percent the very next year, and it \ntook some time to recover. If a serious oilspill were ever to hit our \ncoast, the damage would be enormously costly, and if the Exxon Valdez \nspill is any guide, much of the damage would be permanent.\n  It simply does not make sense to play Russian roulette with an asset \nthat generates thousands of jobs and tens of billions of dollars per \nyear for potential drilling assets that could never generate even one-\ntenth of that, and this is only in one State. Magnify that by so many \nother States that have similar coastal economies.\n  This tragedy in the gulf is a wakeup call. It demands that whatever \nwe do in terms of drilling, we do carefully, thoughtfully, and with the \nvery real images of this tragedy in mind. It is obvious--now more than \never--that we cannot ignore the risks of oil exploration, that we \ncannot take the safety of these rigs for granted or the reliability of \nredundant shutoff systems that were supposed to prevent such a spill.\n  It is time to weigh the risks against the payback. And what is the \npayback? Well, the Energy Information Administration, the entity our \nFederal Government has to give us information about our energy sources, \nestimates that opening all the shores--all shores to drilling--would \namount to no more than a few hundred thousand barrels per day, which \ntranslates to a few tablespoons of gasoline per American vehicle. We \ndon't keep oil in a domestic market. Oil is part of a world market, so \nthere is no guarantee that American-produced oil comes to America for \nthe purposes we need. It is hardly a drop in the bucket, with no \nmeasurable impact on gas prices. I don't want to gamble with the \ncoastline of New Jersey or any of these other States for a few \ntablespoons of gasoline.\n  This image of a burning rig in the gulf that ultimately sunk and for \nwhich we have all this disaster taking place is a wakeup call to all of \nus who are committed to finding the best energy options for the \nfuture--options that will not put hundreds of miles of our coastline at \nrisk. I don't quite understand why it is that when we are talking about \nglobal climate change legislation, we are also in desperate pursuit of \noil, which is a contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions we are \ntrying to avoid and, in essence, change from, so we don't have the \nclimactic changes that can threaten our way of life. However, that is \nexactly what we are doing by going after this.\n  So I am respectfully requesting that the administration reconsider \nits proposal to expand offshore drilling until we are absolutely \ncertain we can protect the New Jersey shore and the entire Atlantic \nseaboard from the potential environmental and economic disaster that \ncould come from coastal drilling. I don't know why the Atlantic coast \nhas to be under siege, but it seems to be. The other coastline was \nlargely kept unexplored.\n  Instead of doubling down on 19th century fuels such as oil, we should \nbe investing in a 21st century green economy that will create thousands \nof new jobs, billions in new wealth, and help protect our air and water \nfrom pollution. It is time for this country to move forward and embrace \nthe future rather than clutch to the ways of the past that have not \nonly given us this addiction but at the same time given us the \nconsequences in our environment of polluting it in a way that \nultimately creates risks to our crops, our farmers, our shorelines, as \nwell as our health. My home State of New Jersey still has far too much \nincidence of respiratory ailments, including cancers.\n  We can do much better than this. We should do much better than this. \nWe should stop feeding an addiction that ultimately would only add but \na few tablespoons of gas and not do anything about the price but put an \nenormous risk to the economy of these coastlines, to our natural \nhabitats, and to the quality of air we breathe. I hope the President \nwill understand this disaster is a wakeup call that needs to be thought \nof seriously before we move forward on something that can be so risky \nto our economy, to our environment, and to our way of life.\n  With that, I yield the floor and observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I came to the floor of the Senate \nlast Tuesday to make 74 unanimous consent motions to trigger a law this \nbody voted for by a vote of 96 to 2 back in January of 2007, and this \nlaw says that once a unanimous consent motion is made for a nomination, \nthat people who are secretly holding the nomination must come out into \nthe sunlight.\n  The law requires that 6 days after that motion is made, whoever is \nholding the nominee must identify themselves and, in fact, that must be \npublished in the Congressional Record. Tomorrow would be the day for \npublication for all the dozens of different nominees being held up by \nwho knows who for who knows what reason.\n  I wished to make sure the leaders of both parties were aware that \nthis time had run and, today, I will ask unanimous consent that a \nletter I sent to the minority leader and the majority leader \nacknowledging that the rule has been triggered, with the list of the \nvarious nominees, asking that they make sure the Members of their party \nhave, in fact, come forward and identified themselves for the Record \ntomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I sent to Leader McConnell \nand Leader Reid be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2010.\n     Hon.

Within six-\n     session days of the unanimous consent request, the notice \n     must be printed publicly in the Congressional Record. The \n     rule is clear that it is incumbent upon the leaders of each \n     party to enforce the rules should members fail to comply.\n       Today marks the sixth session-day since I made seventy-four \n     unanimous consent requests to confirm the non-controversial \n     nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar (a complete list \n     is attached).

To date, there have not been any \n     notices filed in the Congressional Record despite the fact \n     that all seventy-four motions were objected to by Senator Kyl \n     on behalf of his Republican colleagues.

Madam President, we have gone back and looked at the \nExecutive Calendar from a historic perspective. At the beginning of \nthis week, we had 84 pending nominations. At the exact same time in \nPresident Bush's Presidency, we had eight. That is what we call a \nlopsided score--84 to 8. Of the 49 nominations we have voted on as a \nbody since President Obama took office, 38 of them were confirmed by \nmore than 70 votes. That is a pretty lopsided margin. Twenty of them \nwere confirmed by more than 90 votes.\n  I am confident that if we took the time--which I think may be the \ndesire of my friends on the other side--to file cloture and go through \nindividual votes on all these nominees, the vast majority of them would \nreceive those kinds of lopsided confirmations. This is a game we need \nto quit playing. The secret hold needs to end.\n  I have written some colleagues of mine, including Senator Mark Warner \nand Senator Whitehouse, and we have composed a letter--and we asked our \ncolleagues to sign it--saying we will no longer participate in the \nsecret hold. No more secret holds for us. We don't need the law to tell \nus we only have 6 days to secretly hold. We have asked in the letter \nthat the secret hold be abolished. There is not a good reason for it. \nThere isn't. Why does anything such as that need to be a secret? It is \nsomething that needs to be done publicly. The people whom everyone \nworks for need to know why they are holding up a nomination or blocking \na bill. The secrecy needs to stop.\n  You can hold somebody; it is your prerogative as a Senator to hold a \nnominee. Work against that nomination. Try to defeat them in committee. \nKeep in mind that all these nominees came out of committee without an \nobjection--no objection in committee. If you want to object, that is \nyour prerogative. Come out and tell the world why this is the wrong \nperson for the job but don't hide. Don't hide.\n  I will be watching with interest tomorrow the Congressional Record. I \nam very worried we are going to have the old switcharoo, which means if \nyou withdraw your hold in 6 days, then you can hand it off to somebody \nelse. You can say: I no longer have a secret hold, and then you whisper \nto your buddy: Why don't you do it now and then we will have 6 more \ndays and then another 6 days.\n  I wish to serve notice that I will be making these unanimous consent \nrequests every time there is a secret hold, so anybody who does it is \nonly going to have 6 days. Seriously, if we start the switcharoo and \ncontinue to go week after week without knowing who is holding these \npeople or why, that is when people should get angry. That means they \nvoted for a law that they had every intention of evading. People are \nmad enough at us. That is liable to get them over to the ``flat \nfurious'' category if we go into that territory.\n  I am hopeful this Congress will be the Congress where we end the \nsecret hold. I wish to again acknowledge the work Senator Grassley and \nSenator Wyden have done for years. They have definitely tilled this \nground, and they, in fact, put this in the law that we voted on in \n2007. I compliment them for their work on this issue. We are continuing \nto work together on this issue. Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley are \ncontinuing to try to find a way to reform and make this place more open \nand transparent.\n  I invite all my colleagues to sign the letter--Republican, \nDemocratic, Independent. Sign the letter. We have 43 signatures. That \nmeans we are almost halfway there. If we can get to 60--we can move \nmountains here when we get that magic 60 number. I hope we can get to \n60 by the end of next week. That means we will have more than a \nmajority to say: I don't need a rule or a law; I am willing to make any \nhold I have open to public inspection.\n  I wish to also make another unanimous consent request today. We have \na very important function in government; that is, investigating \naccidents. We are getting ready to enter into the travel season. The \nNational Transportation Safety Board is a very important body. In fact, \nthey are going to be considering, in the next week, the ``miracle on \nthe Hudson'' accident and the problem with aviation as it relates to \nthe danger of birds and possible engine failure. In June, they will be \ninvestigating the tragic Metro accident here in Washington, when 9 \npeople died. This is one of those boards where a Democrat and a \nRepublican are both appointed. The Democrat has been waiting since last \nDecember, ostensibly, for the Republican. Dr. Earl Weener has been on \nthe Executive Calendar for a number of weeks.\n  Dr. Rosekind and Dr. Weener are needed on the NTSB. If any Member has \na reason to recuse themselves, they would not have enough Members to go \nforward with these investigations. This is the kind of work that needs \nto be done. This is what people want the government to do. There is a \nlot of stuff the government does they don't want us doing. They want us \nto figure out what is going on with accidents in our transportation \nsystem and come up with answers so we can avoid these deadly accidents \nin the future. I think it is important, in light of that, that I go \nahead and make another unanimous consent request to try to confirm \nthese two people so they can begin working on the National \nTransportation Safety Board as we enter into the most heavily traveled \nperiod in America--the summer vacation months, when so many more \nAmericans are traveling with their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2788-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2788-S2790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to executive session for the\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\npurpose of the consideration of Calendar No. 592, Mark R. Rosekind, to \nbe a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, and No. 787, \nEarl F. Weener, to be a member of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en bloc; that no \nfurther motions be in order; that the President be immediately notified \nof the Senate's action, and that any statements relating to the \nnominations be printed in the Record, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have no \nproblem with either nomination. I understand they are in the process of \nbeing cleared by other Members. I believe that, while I have no \nspecific problem, we want to allow all Senators to sign off before \nconsent is granted.\n  Last week, I objected to some of the nominations to allow the two \nleaders to work their clearance process on the Executive Calendar. I \nunderstand that the two leaders worked to confirm four U.S. attorneys \nlater today.\n  Under the circumstances, as to the specific request of my colleague, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, if I could inquire of the Senator \nfrom Arizona for the purpose of making a clear record.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I objected.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I wish to make sure that the \nobjection--the reason I am asking to inquire is it has to be clear that \nthe objection is being made on behalf of someone else and not on behalf \nof the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me \nexplain this process. When a nomination is sought to be cleared by both \nsides, there is what is called a hotline. All offices receive a quick \nnotice that a particular bill or nominee is being hotlined. If you have \na question or a concern, you register that. It is registered as an \nobjection until it can be cleared up. In many cases, it is cleared up \nvery quickly--sometimes overnight. Sometimes the two leaders need to \nwork out a process for it to be cleared. It is, in one sense, a hold.\n  As I said, I have no objection to these two people, so I am not \nholding them. I am objecting on behalf of the Republican leadership in \norder to enable the two leaders to clear both of these nominees; that \nis, to make sure there is no objection on either side, so they can both \ngo forward. That is the basis for my objection.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, let me make a couple comments \nconcerning that.\n  First, Mr. Weener has been on the Executive Calendar since March 24. \nSo this isn't something that happened in the last couple days.\n  Second, it was very clear that the Senator from Arizona said he \nwasn't objecting, so he is objecting for someone else. This notion that \nthis has something to do with the leaders working together, none of \nthese nominees are being held by anybody. This is not about the leader \nasking for time to clear names. It is not whether somebody can hold. \nCertainly, somebody can hold. The question is, After they have done it \nfor 6 days, they can't be secret anymore. What I am trying to do--and I \nknow the Senator from Arizona understands this. I am not quarreling \nwith somebody's ability to hold. I just need to know who is holding. It \ncannot just be that we are working on it and it came over on the \nhotline and give us a few days. The 6 days are up. The people who are \nholding these nominees now have to say who they are.\n  I wished to make it clear that your objection was not your objection \nto these nominees. In other words, you are not claiming the objection, \nyou are claiming it on behalf of someone else who will not identify \nthemselves. That is the point. Tomorrow is the day that all these \npeople need to be identified as to who is holding them. If it is \nSenator McConnell holding every one, then he needs to claim them and \nsay: I am holding all the nominees. If it is other Members of the \ncaucus, then they need to claim it. It is the same for any Democrats \nwho are holding. I believe we had two or three nominees being held by \nDemocrats. They need to be published in the Congressional Record \ntomorrow. But this notion that it is being held up because the two \nleaders are working together, Senator Reid doesn't have anybody \nbeing held. So I wish to make sure we got that clear.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. KYL. If my colleague will yield first for a minute, I wish to \nmake it clear that it is precisely on the basis that I stated that I am \nobjecting this evening. I believe the two leaders will be able to clear \nthe two specific nominees my colleague asked unanimous consent for \ntonight. It is truly a matter of the clearance process through the \nhotline. As a result, what I said is true. It is nothing more than \nthat, to my knowledge.\n  I take all the other points my colleague made. As to my objection \nthis evening, I prefer to have my colleague acknowledge that what I \nsaid is what I believe; namely, that this is a clearance process for \nthe two leaders through the hotline and that it is my expectation that \nthese nominees will be cleared through that process. It is simply not \ncompleted.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I apologize. I didn't mean to intimate that the \nSenator was saying something he didn't believe. I apologize if that is \nthe way it was taken.\n  The point is pretty obvious. We have 84 nominees backed up at the \ntrain station, compared to 8 under the Bush administration. If anybody \ncan't see what is going on, they need to tune in and pay attention. \nThis is stall and block, stall and block, stall and block. Fine, but \nown it. If you are going to stall and block, let's see who you are. \nClaim it. That is all this is about. Claim it.\n  If you are proud of slowing the process down, we just want to know \nwho you are. To say this is about the two leaders clearing the hotline, \nthat is not what this is about. This is about the law that says you \ncannot have secret holds once a unanimous consent request is made. I \nwill be here as many times as it takes to reform this process and end \nthe secret hold.\n  I yield to my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. First of all, I thank the Senator for her continuing \nefforts on this point. I had the privilege of joining her on the first \nday in moving some of these unanimous consents. She brought up 73, I \nthink, in 1 day, to tee up all these names under the Senate rules that \nrequire that once a unanimous consent has been proposed, the identity \nof the Senator with the hold has to be divulged in 6 legislative \ndays. As I understand it, the 6 legislative days run today.\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Correct.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Therefore, tomorrow is the day when one of three \nthings has to take place. We can come to the floor and clear these \nfolks by unanimous consent because there will no longer be a secret \nhold is option 1. Option 2 is a Senator would have stood up, filed the \npapers that the rules of the Senate require and admit to the secret \nhold, making this process transparent and open. The third is they will \nhave done what Senator McCaskill and I have both called the switcheroo, \nand they will have gone quietly to some other Senator and said: I only \nhave 4 days left; I don't want to hold it till 6. If you pick up my \nhold now for me, then you are after the unanimous consent request, and \nwe think we can dodge the rules this way.\n  Is it the understanding of the Senator from Missouri that those are \nthe three options we will discover tomorrow as to all of these 80 \nnominees, which category they are in?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I believe under the law, those are the only three \noptions available: to either withdraw the hold and let the nomination \ngo forward or claim the hold and publicly identify yourself or evade \nthe law.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. With respect to the observation that the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona made that they had just, after this \nprocess, allowed four U.S. attorneys to be cleared, in the light of the \nfact that at this time in the Bush administration there were eight Bush \nadministration officials who were the subject of Democratic holds, but \nit is more than 80 Obama officials who are now still the subject of\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nalmost exclusively Republican holds, notwithstanding what is clear \nunder the pressure of this initiative, we are actually down from over \n100, but we are still holding at over 80 officials who are tangled up \nin secret holds.\n  Is it a fair statement of mine to put, ``Gosh, we released four'' \ninto the context of, ``Yeah, but we are holding 84''? That is the way \nthe ratio works right now; does it not?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. To be fair, I know we had 84 pending at the first of \nthe week. I think our raising a ruckus is beginning to have a little \nbit of an impact because the iceberg moved slightly this week. We may \nhave confirmed 14 this week of the 74, I believe, that I moved by \nunanimous consent last week.\n  Keep in mind, all 74 I moved last week had been unanimously reported \nout of committee, with no opposition from the Republican Party in \ncommittee. None.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Indeed, votes in favor by the Republicans on the \ncommittee.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Exactly. In fact, many of them were voice-voted. We \neven checked to make sure no one said nay at the committee level. These \nwere unanimously agreed to out of committee. There were 74 last week. I \nmade the requests last Tuesday on the 74. The Senator from Rhode Island \nmade a few requests on some that were not in that group that had been \nunanimously agreed to. I believe this week some of the group--maybe \nsome of the Senator's, maybe some of the ones on which I made unanimous \nconsent requests. I know we had 14 that moved. I think we are around 70 \ntotal right now. But of those, 60 of them are in this unanimous-consent \ncategory and ones we have no idea who is holding them.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Of those, if I may ask another question, who have \nbeen cleared, some have been allowed to come forward for votes on the \nSenate floor. The last was Judge Chin who had been held for a \nconsiderable period of time. We actually, if I recall correctly, had to \nfile cloture and take more time. There is a process built around \ncloture so it burns up Senate floor time. We were forced to do that.\n  When the nomination was finally voted on in the Senate, is my \nrecollection correct that he cleared the Senate 98 to 0?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. He was held for a long time. And, yes, the Senator is \ncorrect, we had to go through all the procedural hoops that take time. \nTime is money when you are working for the taxpayers. Every hour we \nspend on something is an hour we cannot spend on something else. \nEveryone--all the good people who are working in this room, in the \ncloakrooms, and in all the offices--is paid by the taxpayers. We took \ntime to go through cloture. Then there was not one ``no'' vote. If that \nis not a great example of obstructionism for the sake of obstructing, I \ncannot think of a better one--forcing the Senate to take days to \nconfirm unanimously a nominee after they have held for a long period of \ntime.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Just by a process of elimination, unless one of the \ntwo absent Senators was the one who had the hold, whoever was holding \nJudge Chin actually ended up voting for him after months and months of \nhaving delayed the nomination.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I don't know about the Senator from Rhode Island, but \nI would love to know how many people secretly hold a nominee and end up \nvoting yes. Nine times out of ten--I should not say that. I don't know. \nIt is secret. I have to believe that most times people secretly hold a \nnominee because they want something from an agency. In fact, I had a \nMember actually acknowledge to me: I don't care what happens to that \nnominee, but I need something from this agency. It is a leverage: I am \ngoing to hold your nominee hostage until this agency gives me what I \nwant.\n  I think we remember, there was an instance that came out in public \nthat some people were being held for projects in their State.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is the right of the Senator to do, so long as \nthey do it publicly.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Right.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. They can still do that even after the secret holds.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Absolutely. If someone is trying to leverage--I do \nnot agree with it, but that is their right as a Senator--if they want \nto leverage a project in their State by saying to the administration: I \nwon't let you have any nominees to go to work in that agency until that \nagency gives me what I want--that is their right. People should know \nabout it. I don't think it would be very popular. People might have a \nproblem with that. That is the beauty of the secret hold. They never \nhave to tell that they are leveraging a nominee to get something they \nwant out of an agency. That is why we need to end the secret hold. \nSimple.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, if I may conclude, I thank the \nSenator for indulging me in these questions and allowing me to ask them \nand for her energetic and principled leadership on this issue.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Rhode \nIsland. There are so many things about the Senate I respect--the \ntraditions, the service. Make no mistake about it, there are so many of \nmy Republican colleagues who serve whom I admire and respect. They care \ndeeply about their country. Sometimes we disagree on issues, but that \ndoes not diminish my respect for them as public servants and as people. \nWe all get along better than people probably realize we do. But there \nare certain traditions around here, frankly, that are more like a bad \nhabit.\n  The tradition of comity is wonderful. The tradition of debate is \nwonderful. The tradition of collegiality is wonderful, the tradition of \nseniority and respecting people who have been here for a great deal of \ntime. So much of it has been built up over the history of this Nation, \nand I am so proud to be a Member of this body in so many ways.\n  But there are some bad habits that are traditions of which we should \nnot be proud, and this is one of them. This is a tradition that needs \nto end. The secret hold is a bad habit. It is a luxury in which we \nshould not indulge as members of a public body to serve the public on \nbehalf of the people for whom we work.\n  Our work should be open. The word ``secret'' does not have a place of \nhonor in this democracy. Secret, good government, that is a little bit \nlike oil and water. Let's do away with this bad habit. Let's demolish \nthis tradition for all the right reasons and go forward and have a new \ntradition that from now on, if a Senator feels strongly enough about a \nnominee to block their nomination, that they come forward, explain \ntheir reasoning, and allow the people they work for to judge for \nthemselves whether that is a valid reason to stop a nomination.\n  In many instances, the people they work for may believe it is a valid \nreason and may applaud them for it. But if it needs to be secret, I \ndon't know, I bet maybe they might not. Let's end the tradition.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. I also, obviously, thank, once \nagain, Senator Grassley. He has so many times been the conscience of \nthis place for so many different reasons, so many different issues. I \nhave greatly admired his work in the inspector general community. He \nhas done so much with inspectors general to strengthen them, make sure \nthey have independence.\n  He has been a great champion for accountability and transparency in \nthe Senate. I am proud he has worked as long as he has on trying to \nstop the tradition of secret holds. He and Senator Wyden get the lion's \nshare of the credit that has been done on this issue over the years.\n  We now have 43 Senators who are willing to say: Enough already. Now \nif we can just get a few more, we can nail the coffin shut on secret \nholds once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \nstatement be followed by a colloquy among the cosponsors of the \namendment I will be discussing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I had actually planned to offer an \namendment to the Wall Street reform bill this afternoon, but I have \nbeen informed that the open-amendment process does not begin until next \nweek. I\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nwill describe my amendment this afternoon and then return to the floor \nat the earliest opportunity to actually call it up.\n  Before I describe it, I wish to commend Chairman Dodd and Chairman \nLincoln for their hard work in crafting a strong Wall Street reform \nbill. The collapse of the housing market in 2008 and the resulting \nrecession, near depression, was painful evidence that our financial \ninstitutions were underregulated and that we were ill-prepared for the \ninvention of complex, new financial products.\n  The legislation we are currently debating will strengthen and \nmodernize our Nation's financial regulation and substantially reduce \nthe chances for future market bubbles and collapses, with all the \neconomywide collateral damage we have seen from this collapse.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Senator Merkley, who is on the Senate \nfloor--I am delighted he is here with me--Senator Durbin, Senator \nSanders, and Senator Levin. It would address an area that is not yet \ncovered by the Wall Street reform bill, and that is runaway credit card \ninterest rates.\n  This amendment would address that issue not by imposing any new \nrestrictions on lending but, rather, by restoring to our States \nhistoric powers that they held for hundreds of years and that were \neliminated only in the relatively recent past.\n  Madam President, when you and I were growing up, a credit card offer \nwith a 20-percent or 30-percent interest rate might well have been a \nmatter to bring to the police. Such interest rates were illegal under \nthe laws of most, if not all, of the 50 States.\n  Today, in contrast, credit cards routinely charge rates of 30 percent \nor even more, usually after they have trapped people into a late \npayment or some trick of some kind to get them away from the teaser \nrate with which they sold them the credit card. They end up with 30 \npercent interest or higher. These interest rates have spiraled out of \ncontrol, and for reasons I will explain, the States, at least recently, \nhave been powerless to do anything about it despite the historic power \nthey had in this area.\n  Prior to 1978--indeed, for the first 202 years of our Republic--each \nState had the ability to enforce usury laws against any lenders doing \nbusiness with its citizens. Our economy grew and flourished during \nthese two centuries. These were not hard periods for the financial \nservices industries, and lenders profited while complying with the laws \nin effect where they operated. Then in 1978 came an apparently \nuneventful Supreme Court case. It was little noticed at the time it was \ndecided. In Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha \nService Corporation, the Supreme Court interpreted one word--the word \n``located''--in the National Bank Act of 1863. That word sat quietly in \nthat statute for 102 years, but in 1978 they interpreted it as meaning \nthe location of the business rather than the location of the customer--\nwhere the bank was headquartered or domiciled rather than where their \ncustomer lived.\n\n  Well, it did not take long before big banks cottoned on to the \nopportunity this created--an opportunity never sanctioned by Congress \nnor apparently even intended by the Supreme Court. It was an \ninadvertent loophole, but they found it, and they realized they could \navoid the interest rate restrictions by reorganizing as national banks \nand moving to States that had the weakest consumer protections. So what \nhappened? A race to the bottom. The proverbial race to the bottom took \nplace as a small handful of States eliminated consumer protections, \neliminated interest rate caps in order to attract into their States \nlucrative credit card business and their related tax revenue.\n  Today, there is a reason the credit card divisions of major banks are \nbased in just a few States, and it causes consumers in all of our other \nStates to be denied the historic protection they enjoyed from \noutrageous interest rates and fees. My amendment would reinstate the \nhistoric longstanding powers of our sovereign States to decide which \ninterest rate limits, if any, should be set to protect their own \ncitizens.\n  Let me be clear about what this amendment would not do. It would not \nprescribe or even recommend any interest rate caps and it would not \nimpose any other lending limitations. It would restore to the States \nthe power they enjoyed for over 200 years, from the very founding of \nthe Republic--the power to say ``enough,'' the power to say 30 percent \ninterest or 50 percent interest or 100 percent interest is too much and \nwe won't allow you to charge it to our citizens.\n  The current system is not just unfair to consumers who can't be \nprotected by their own State's government and are vulnerable to \npredatory lending in States far from their home, it is unfair to local \nlenders and retailers that continue to be bound by the laws of the home \nState. They are still bound. So the home State bank is under the State \nlaw. It is the huge, gigantic out-of-State national bank that can come \nin and compete against those small banks with that disadvantage. The \nsmall local bank has to play by the rules of fair interest rates, but \nthe gigantic national credit card companies can avoid having any rules \nat all. So we need to level the playing field to eliminate this unfair \nand lucrative advantage that Wall Street banks enjoy against our local \nMain Street community banks.\n  To make sure lenders can't find another statute to use to once again \navoid State law, my amendment would apply to all types of consumer \nlending institutions, not just national banks, and that is for the \npurpose of forbidding them and preventing them from changing their \ncharters to avoid limitations on gouging consumers.\n  One of the other factors in this bill is that you can't choose your \nregulator by changing your charter, and we have reached broadly with \nthis to protect against exactly that. My amendment would give State \nlegislatures ample time to revise their usury statutes, if they feel \nthey need revision, and would allow lenders the time to adjust. The \namendment would not go into effect until 1 year after the President \nsigns the bill into law.\n  In the meantime, it is worth noting that most States' usury laws are \naround or above 18 percent, and that federally regulated credit unions \ndo quite well under a Federal 18-percent interest rate cap. So the \nunderlying interest rates that States tend to apply, when this power \nhas not been stripped from them, really inadvertently, tend to be quite \nreasonable, as proven by the fact that our credit union industry \noperates under a Federal 18-percent interest rate cap and does quite \nwell.\n  It is the 30-percent and over interest rates that are the recent \nanomaly, the peculiarity in our country's history. We should go back to \nthe historic norm--the way the Founding Fathers saw things under the \ndoctrine of federalism--and close this modern bureaucratic loophole; \nprobably an inadvertent loophole, but one that the big Wall Street \nbanks found to gouge local citizens and compete unfairly with local \nbanks.\n  I ask my colleagues for their consideration on this, and I turn to \nthe distinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator Merkley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to praise my colleague from \nRhode Island for producing this amendment. I look forward to seeing it \noffered. I certainly am honored to be able to cosponsor it. I thought I \nwould share with him a story that goes back to my days as a member of \nthe Oregon legislature.\n  When I came to the Oregon legislature, I had a lot of folks in my \nhouse district saying: Wouldn't you do something about payday lending \nand other high-interest lending? How is it possibly reasonable to have \npayday loans, which are secured by the next paycheck at over 500 \npercent interest; and how is it reasonable or fair that I am being lent \nmoney through my credit card at 25 or 30 percent when the interest I am \nearning is just 1 or 2 percent? And I had no good answer for why it was \nfair, because it wasn't fair. It wasn't right.\n  So I proceeded to start working on this issue. When I went down to \nlegal counsel, they advised me: Well, Representative Merkley, it works \nlike this. You, at the State level, can apply rules to payday lending \nand to pawnbrokers and to title loans and to local consumer lending \ncompanies but not when it comes to credit cards. They explained to me \nthe story that the Senator from Rhode Island just shared, that those \nrules are set by the States issuing the credit cards.\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\n  Well, certainly any State that has reasonable standards for a credit \ncard, they are not going to be issued from within that State. Thus, we \ncome to the race to the bottom my colleague was describing. So I \nproceeded to carry the fight and the battle over the payday lending, \nthe title loans, the pawnbrokers and the local consumer loans, and we \nlargely won that battle in Oregon, but we couldn't take on credit \ncards.\n  In the back of my mind, when I was running for the Senate, I thought, \nthis will be an opportunity, if I join this body, to be able to weigh \nin on the issue of States rights in favor of consumers, in favor of \ncommon sense. So it is for all these reasons I am pleased to join \nSenator Whitehouse as a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am grateful for my colleague's \nsupport.\n  I see Senator Sanders of Vermont has joined us on the floor, and I am \ndelighted to welcome him to our colloquy.\n  Senator Sanders.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my colleague, and I applaud his introducing this \namendment.\n  The issue of credit card companies charging Americans outrageously \nhigh interest rates is something that has concerned me for a number of \nyears. We have another amendment which approaches this issue from a \ndifferent level, but I am going to work with Senator Whitehouse, and I \nthink this is a very important amendment.\n  The bottom line here is that usury and loan-sharking is immoral, it \nis wrong, and it has got to be prohibited. I know Senator Whitehouse \nand Senator Merkley are more than aware, there are even Biblical \nreferences in both the Old and New Testament to the immorality and the \ncondemnation of usury. We know as a Nation, people look askance at loan \nsharks.\n  Let's be honest. What are we talking about here? If a financial \ninstitution is charging people who are desperate enough to be buying \ntheir groceries, in many cases their basic necessities, on their credit \ncard, 25- or 30-percent interest rates, if that is not usury, if that \nis not loan sharking, then I don't know what is.\n\n  We have introduced legislation that would cap credit card interest \nrates at 15 percent. Senator Whitehouse is approaching it in another \nway, which is an interesting way. But the bottom line is that we have \nto deal with the absurd Marquette ruling which essentially nullifies \nwhat every State in the country has done. I think in Vermont we have \nusury rates at 12 percent. But it doesn't mean anything because of the \nMarquette decision.\n  So all over this country, when we have 20 percent of the people in \nAmerica now paying at least 20 percent interest rates on their credit \ncards, those people want action. And when we talk about Wall Street \nreform and we talk about consumer protection, yes, of course, we need a \nstrong, independent financial services consumer protection agency but, \nmore importantly, we need to address this outrage of high credit card \ninterest rates, and the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island \nwould do that.\n  I think the American people want to see action, and I hope we can \nwork together on the amendment and on my amendment and give people some \nrelief.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank Senator Sanders and both my \ncolleagues very much for their cosponsorship of this amendment and \ntheir advocacy of it. I would hope we could find support for this from \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  I do not see this as an exclusively Democratic issue. If you look at \nthe arguments that have been made by all of us on the floor just now \nfor it--Senator Sanders spoke eloquently about the Judeo-Christian \ntradition that informs so much of our civilization and its horror of \nexaggerated exorbitant interest rates--for those of our colleagues who \nare attuned to those traditions, who take their religious principles \nseriously, they only have to harken back to sources of our Judeo-\nChristian tradition to find these kinds of limits are good and \nhistoric.\n  For those of us who are constitutional scholars and historians and \nare familiar with the doctrine of federalism and the role of the States \nin protecting their local citizens, the notion of States rights is one \nthat has frankly been championed by colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. Here is an opportunity to express their fealty to that doctrine \nand to that principle of States rights.\n  To those who think that 202 years of successful tradition of local \nregulation of interest rates has value, we can document that this is a \nrecent anomaly. This is a peculiarity we are correcting. The great \nsweep of American history, over more than two centuries, is that the \nStates protected their citizens properly and well. Anyone who cares for \nconsumers in their States, local consumers up against huge credit card \ncompanies that keep you waiting on the phone for hours when you have to \ntry to file a complaint, whose offices are in another State or in \nanother country, sticking up for your local citizens is something I \nthink we should all be prepared to agree to.\n  And finally, for those of us who have local banks, community banks, \nMain Street banks that are domiciled in our home States, why should \nthey suffer the disadvantage of having to compete against these huge \nrapacious credit card companies and Wall Street banks and be subject to \ntheir State's law but have this loophole allow the monster banks, the \ngigantic banks to take advantage of consumers in this way?\n  I think you can look at this amendment from a whole variety of \nperspectives and the principles that it stands on are ones that many of \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle have supported and \nchampioned over the years.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. If I might chime in at this point and say that in terms \nof the discussion I saw at the State level in Oregon, this is a \nbipartisan discussion, because it is indeed deeply rooted in traditions \nand wisdom that extends back not just generations but thousands of \nyears.\n  Indeed, time after time after time the leaders--the philosophical and \nthe religious leaders, as well as political leaders--saw the damage \nthat was done to the foundation of societies from extraordinarily high \ninterest rates.\n  I think it goes back to understanding that the strength of a society \nis in the strength of its families. You do not build strong families \nwhen wealth is stripped away by usurious interest rates, by \nextraordinary interest rates, rates that exceed by many times the \nearnings on interest that a family can get by putting their money into \na bank or lending their money into a financial system. There is a very \nsmall return there, but borrowing out of that financial system, very \nhigh charges.\n  If our goal is to build families, then this has all the wisdom in the \nworld. I certainly want to note that the other aspect of this that \nhelps tie together Democrats and Republicans is that it is an issue of \nlocal control. There was never a moment when this Chamber, or the \nChamber a few yards from here, the House Chamber, proceeded to say we \nare going to take away States rights to control their own interest \nrates on cards. There was never a moment like that. Such a law was \nnever passed.\n  Indeed, you have not just the fact that Federal law has trumped State \nlaw but has trumped it without any deliberate act of Congress and in \nthe most bizarre of fashions. So I should think the reach in favor of \nbuilding strong families, building strong communities, and local \ncontrol will be high. I certainly look forward to a bipartisan effort \nto pass this legislation.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I can pick up from the Senator from Oregon, the \nreason, for thousands of years, that religious leaders and philosophers \nhave condemned usury, which is what we are talking about today, is that \nit is basically immoral, according to every major religion on Earth, to \ntell a desperate person who is in need of a loan that I am going to \ngive you this loan but I am going to charge a very high interest rate. \nThat is condemned by every major religion on Earth as well as every \ngreat writer I can think of who addressed that issue.\n  What I wish to do, I suggest to my friend from Rhode Island, is I \nwant for a moment to read some of the e-mails I received from Vermont \ndealing with this issue we are attempting to address. You are dealing \nwith it one way. I am trying to deal with it more on a national way. \nBut we both, together, are trying to address this.\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\n  Let me give a couple of e-mails that came to me over the last couple \nof months. This is from Jeffrey, from the State of Vermont:\n\n       I was one of those guys who failed to read the fine print. \n     A couple of years ago my credit card payment got lost in the \n     mail. By the time I had realized what had happened, they \n     charged me a $45 late fee and then spiked my interest rate up \n     to 35 percent. At the time I was in good standing with them. \n     I desperately tried to get this back on track but after 10 or \n     12 months of making these crazy payments I had to make a \n     choice--lose my transportation to work, lose my house--I am a \n     father of four beautiful children--or stop paying on the \n     credit card. Now my credit card report has suffered greatly \n     and, even though it has been over a year, they still harass \n     me almost daily. This situation has affected every part of my \n     family and my life.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from Jeffrey from Vermont.\n  This is Ronald from Colchester, VT:\n\n       I am writing about my Citi credit card.\n\n  I should point out, as my friend from Rhode Island knows, that the \nfour largest financial institutions in this country issue 66 percent, \ntwo-thirds, of the credit cards in the country.\n\n       I am writing about my Citi credit card. My interest rate \n     went from 12 percent to 29.9 percent overnight. I phoned them \n     and was told it was not just myself paying that rate, but \n     everyone pays that rate. How can credit card companies let \n     you make purchases on your account for a moderate interest \n     rate and just mysteriously move to 29.9 percent overnight? I \n     hope you are able to pass your law to restrict credit card \n     companies from abusing their power over their customers.\n\n  I have gotten many e-mails and I am sure you have as well. The bottom \nline is what we are saying is we intend to end this outrageous practice \non the part of huge banks that are ripping off the American people. \nWhat Senator Whitehouse is trying to do is say let us go back to the \nfederalist principles of this country where States have established \ntheir own interest rate caps, and let's enforce that.\n  We are taking a little bit different position. But both of us are \ngoing to do everything we can to end this outrage and I applaud the \nSenator from Rhode Island for his hard work on this.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me thank Senator Sanders, who is a passionate and \narticulate consumer advocate, and Senator Merkley of Oregon, who has \ncome to the Senate in the interests of his native Oregonians, trying to \nmake sure they are well served. He has been remarkable at that.\n  I apologize to Senator Durbin. I know he wanted to come and join us \nas well, but the timing changed and he was unable to attend. I thank \nhim for his cosponsorship of this amendment. I also thank distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Levin, for \ncosponsoring it. I am truly honored by their support. The distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Burris, tells me he wishes to cosponsor \nas well. So I am grateful to him and I thank him. He is a former banker \nso he understands these issues very well, and he understands the effect \nof backing in the local community. I am very gratified by his support.\n  The last thing I want to say before I close on this subject is that \nthe system by which credit card companies get consumers into these \nhigh-interest rate predicaments is no accident. It is a system and it \nhas been carefully designed by the credit card companies, beginning \nwith the way they write the agreement.\n  When credit cards began, the credit card agreement was two or three \npages long. I am looking at an array of young pages here in front of \nme. They are pretty soon going to be getting credit cards of their own. \nThey won't know what it was like when I got my first credit card. They \nare going to get a first credit card contract that has 20 pages of fine \nprint. And hidden in the fine print have been amazing tricks and traps.\n  One of my personal favorites, which we thankfully ended under the \nleadership of Chairman Dodd earlier, was that the credit card companies \nwould declare the day was over at 10 in the morning and then they would \nopen the mail at 11. So if you got your payment in on the day it was \ndue, they didn't open the mail until they declared the day was over.\n  The day wasn't over. The Sun was still up, morning was not even over, \nbut they had declared in the fine print of the contract that they could \nend the payment day at 10 in the morning and then open the mail later \nthat day so your check was, guess what, late, and that put you into a \nlate payment category so they could jack your interest rate.\n  As Senator Sanders' constituent and so many folks in Rhode Island \nhave experienced, 1 day you are at 12.9 percent and the next day you \nare at 30 percent and you don't know what hit you. And once they have \nyou there, it is very hard to unwind. It is very hard to pay it off and \nget out. Many consumers cannot pay off their credit card all at once so \nnow they are trapped, and they are trapped in what Prof. Ronald Mann of \nColumbia University has called ``the sweat box.''\n  He has looked at how the credit card companies manipulate their \nconsumers, and what they do is they set up all these tricks and traps \nand suddenly you build up a nice balance and it is at a reasonable \ninterest rate but you fall into one of the traps. They catch you with \none of the tricks. And bang, they have you. You are now at a 30-percent \ninterest rate, you don't have the resources to pay it off all at once, \nand the charges begin to pile up--the fees, the exorbitant interest--\nand pretty soon they have got you completely over a barrel.\n  It is systematized. It is done to extract the maximum amount of money \nand profit from consumers who are not aware of how sophisticated the \nmachinery is that is out there trying to gouge them.\n  This is not just a question of exorbitant interest rates; it is also \na question of pushing back against credit card companies that have \ndeveloped a system, the sweat box system, that needs to be put to an \nend. And State regulation can help do it. Because if the State is not \nbeing paid off with tax revenues to look away from what the bank is \ndoing, and if most of the damage is not being done in other States \nwhose complaints are not as relevant in the home State, in the domicile \nState, then they get away with it.\n  They will not get away with it once federalism, States rights, and \nthe American tradition of State protection of its citizens are restored \nand this inadvertent loophole is closed. My amendment would do that.\n  I hope colleagues who are listening to this will think about \nsupporting the amendment. As I said, I think it ought to have \nbipartisan appeal and will certainly be good for people in our country \nwho are at the business end of the credit card industry's machine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, my colleagues and I here in Washington are \nhere to fulfill a sacred public trust, a commitment we made the moment \nwe raised our hands and swore the oath of office. Whether we swore that \noath 30 days ago or 30 years ago, that commitment remains very real. We \nare here to fight for the citizens of our respective States, to \nrepresent their concerns and to make sure their voice rings out in the \ncommittee hearings and on the floor of this Chamber. That is the \nobligation we took upon ourselves the moment we entered public service. \nI know it is something all of us take very seriously.\n  I call upon my colleagues to rise to the challenge of this pivotal \nmoment. It is time to live up to the promise we made. It is time to \nstand up for the people we came here to represent, from all 50 States \nof this Union. It is time to take action on Wall Street reform so we \ncan restore accountability to a system that has spiraled out of \ncontrol, and cost billions in taxpayers' dollars.\n  The U.S. Constitution makes it clear that my colleagues and I are \naccountable to the American people we came here to serve. But because \nwe enjoy a thriving free market system, Wall Street bankers are bound \nby no such accountability. That is why we used to have strict \nregulations in place, such as basic capital standards and lending \nrequirements, that laid out the rules of the road by which all \nfinancial institutions must operate--not to interfere with the market \nbut to assure that business practices were free and fair.\n  It used to be that banks, large and small, based their security on \nthe quality of their investments. I worked at a very large bank in \nthose days. The\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nlending decisions were driven by confidence in the local businesses. \nFinancial institutions sank or swam as a result of the choices they \nmade. This encouraged responsible choices and ensured that banks made \nsmart investments. It kept them accountable to the communities they \nserved and to the businesses in those communities.\n  I said a moment ago I served as a banker for many years. I helped \nsecure loans for small and large businesses. I fought to keep investing \nin the local economy because I knew we had a responsibility to those \nwho worked with us. We helped enrich the people with whom we did \nbusiness. The bank's responsibility is to keep capital and cash \nflowing.\n  The bank's responsibility is to keep capital and cash flowing. So we \nwere accountable to our customers. That is what banking used to be. But \nnot anymore. Gradually over the past few decades, tough standards were \nrelaxed, regulations were rolled back, and rules were bent or ignored \nby some of the country's largest and most trusted financial \ninstitutions. Greed replaced accountability as the driving force behind \nmany transactions. Banks made bad loans and then repackaged them with \nother loans and sold off the risk. They created new types of securities \nand invented ways to place high-stake bets on investments. These \nactivities have no value of their own. They have nothing to do with our \nfree market economy. They are designed to make easy money for big \nbanks, which pass the risk on to someone else. But they contribute \nabsolutely nothing to the economy. There is no product, no investment \nin private enterprise that will benefit local communities.\n  So Wall Street has basically turned into a casino, and it has done so \nat our expense. These fat-cat bankers were gambling not just with our \nmoney but with our economic future. They placed our entire economy at \nrisk, and about 2 years ago their recklessness caught up with them. The \nbottom fell out. The whole massive scheme began to unravel. The \nAmerican economy fell apart like a house of cards because that is \nexactly what Wall Street had become--a giant pile of empty investments \nthat had been passed around between big banks, packaged and repackaged \nto the point where these investments were supported by little more than \nthe paper on which they were written. These large investment banks \ntried to make something from nothing, and in their wild pursuit of \nbigger and bigger profits, they gambled the stability of our entire \neconomy. So it is no wonder these systems came crashing down.\n  Wall Street dropped the ball, and now they are trying to pass the \nbuck. I refuse to let them do that. I refuse to stand by as these big \nfirms try to take the government bailout money and escape the \nconsequences of their action. What they did was irresponsible and \nunethical.\n  My colleagues and I were forced to make difficult decisions to \nprevent a complete economic collapse. We did what was necessary to stop \nthe bleeding and get America back on the road to recovery.\n  Now it is time to make sure this can never happen again. It is time \nwe pass financial reform that will make Wall Street accountable again \nso they cannot make decisions that undermine our economic security. \nThat is why I strongly support the bill introduced by my good friend, \nthe distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Chairman Dodd.\n  I thank my Republican friends for allowing us to bring it up for \ndebate. I said on this floor yesterday that the ball game had another \ninning, and it did. I am grateful to our Republican friends who said: \nYes, let's put this on the floor and let's debate it.\n  Let's not debate to debate and then not get on with the business of \naverage American citizens. As we discuss this legislation in this \nChamber in front of the American people, I hope to work with my \ncolleagues in both parties to hammer out a comprehensive, bipartisan \nbill, a bill that ends the days of the Wall Street casino and \nsafeguards every American from the kind of reckless behavior that led \nto this crisis in the first place. This is the difficult work we swore \nto do when we came to this Senate. As we take up the issue of Wall \nStreet reform, I intend to work with my colleagues, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, to see that it gets done.\n  As I said to the Senator from Rhode Island, I am very interested in \nhis piece of legislation that deals with the credit card interest.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris.)

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nfrom Keavy, KY, who bravely served his country in World War II.\n  Morris Black was drafted at age 19, and he proudly put on his uniform \nand left his friends and family behind. Among those left behind was his \nsweetheart and future wife, Ms. Pauline Cassidy. During the Battle of \nthe Bulge, while serving in one of the most exposed roles within his \ncompany--a field medic--Black was injured in both his head and leg. In \na subsequent battle, he rushed from one wounded soldier to the next, \nproviding as much care as possible, while coming under heavy enemy \nfire. For his heroic service as a field medic, Mr. Black received \nseveral medals, awards, and decorations, including the Purple Heart and \nthe Silver Star.\n  Unfortunately, field medic Black's well-deserved accolades would not \nbe presented to him for another 60 years due to bureaucratic oversight. \nMr. Black finally received these medals on March 7, 2010. Though he is \nappreciative, he is quick to point out that his service was not done \nfor the purpose of winning medals; it was to help the soldiers that \nneeded his assistance in those critical moments.\n  The Corbin Times-Tribune recently ran a story about Morris Black's \nservice. As Mr. Black recalls his experience in the interview, he says, \n``There were times when I didn't know whether I'd make it home or not, \nbut I did. There is no greater honor than to fight for your country.''\n  Today, I know my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to his \nservice and I ask unanimous consent that the full article from the \nTimes-Tribune be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Corbin Times-Tribune, Mar. 20, 2010]\n\n                              A Quiet Hero\n\n                           (By Erica Bowlin)\n\n       Corbin, KY.--Morris Black received a very special delivery \n     in the mail on March 7, 2010. He finally received his Silver \n     Star--60 years after serving in World War II.\n       During the war, Morris, of Keavy, won several badges, \n     medals, and honors. For so many years he wondered why he \n     never received his Silver Star, and he was unsure if he ever \n     would.\n       Black was drafted into the Army when he was just a young \n     man of nineteen. He was concerned about what would await him, \n     and he was unsure about leaving behind his sweetheart, Miss \n     Pauline Cassidy. But, the young man knew he had a \n     responsibility to fight for his country, to fight for those \n     who couldn't fight. So, Morris Black proudly put on his \n     uniform and joined the Army. The year was 1943.\n       Black was first sent to Army basic training at Campground, \n     Illinois. After boot camp he received orders to England and \n     worked there as an orderly in a hospital. Then the call came \n     to go to combat, and off he went to Germany.\n       As a Field Medic, Technician Grade 5, Black saw many \n     strenuous battles. During the Battle of the Bulge, he \n     received injuries to his leg and head. In a separate battle, \n     Black's unit was taking heavy enemy fire. Black ran from one \n     fallen soldier to the next, doing his best to care for each \n     and every one.\n       ``They had us all penned down,'' said Morris, ``and I just \n     did the best I could to get them in as good a shape as I \n     could get them.''\n       Black won the Silver Star for his efforts that day in \n     Germany. He was also awarded\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\n     the Purple Heart after the battle in which he was injured. He \n     just never got to hold the actual awards in his hand. That \n     is, until earlier this month.\n       But Black did not do what he did for the medals. He did \n     what he did because he is a patriot, and he knew he was the \n     only hope his fallen brothers may have had at those critical \n     moments.\n       Black is quiet in demeanor, never boasting. But, his honor \n     and integrity shows--in the way he holds his head high and \n     the way he smiles. It is clear that he is a hero.\n       ``I was just doing my job,'' he said.\n       After two years and nine months in Germany, Black was the \n     only one in his unit who hadn't returned home for leave. \n     Finally, he was granted a leave of absence and got the chance \n     to come home to his beloved country and back to his \n     sweetheart, Pauline. The two had been exchanging letters \n     during the war. Pauline was anxiously awaiting the arrival of \n     her soldier.\n       Black received word that the war had ended, just as his \n     ship arrived in New York.\n       ``They were unloading at the station when they started to \n     say `the war is over,' and I was very happy that day,'' he \n     said.\n       Soon Black was back at home in Keavy, where he'd been \n     raised. He was back with his family, back to his life. He \n     returned to Pauline, and the two were married just a few days \n     later.\n       ``I had really missed him,'' said Pauline, ``and I had \n     really worried about him. It was good to have him home.''\n       The two began building their house shortly after they were \n     married. They still live in the home today. Black worked as a \n     carpenter, and Pauline worked for the United States Postal \n     Service. The couple had two children, Harold Gene and Sheila \n     Kay. The Blacks will celebrate their 65th anniversary on May \n     19, 2010.\n       Morris Black continued to serve his community and country \n     after returning home. He was one of the founding members of \n     The Disabled American Veterans Chapter 158 in Keavy. The \n     center now serves as a community gathering place.\n       ``They hold family reunions and play ball at the field,'' \n     said Black.\n       Black also worked as a volunteer firefighter. Pauline \n     remembers her husband rushing off at all hours to fight \n     fires.\n       ``He would be working on something and when a call came in, \n     he was out the door,'' she said.\n       ``There was about three or four of us who got together and \n     decided we needed a fire department. So we started one,'' \n     said Black.\n       The Keavy Volunteer Fire Department is thriving and \n     continues to serve the community. Black is proud of all he \n     has done, and very grateful that he has been able to serve. \n     He is most grateful, he said, for his family.\n       ``It feels good to have my wife and children, and \n     grandchildren and great-grandchildren. That's what really \n     makes me proud.''\n       Morris and Pauline live each day as it comes, and they \n     thank God for every day they have together.\n       ``There are times when I didn't know whether I'd make it \n     home or not, but I did. There is no greater honor than to \n     fight for your country. And there's nothing like the feeling \n     of having people who love you,'' said Black.\n       After a lifetime of service, Black has every right to brag, \n     but that is not his style.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the life of women and civil rights pioneer Dorothy Height, a \nwoman who helped pave the way for an African American to be elected \nPresident of the Unites States, a Latino son of immigrants to represent \nNew Jersey in the U.S. Senate, and brilliant Jewish and Latina women to \npreside in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Dorothy Height first immersed herself in the civil rights movement in \n1933 when she became a leader of the United Christian Youth Movement of \nNorth America. It was her dedication to ending the horror of lynching, \nreforming the criminal justice system, and securing free access to \npublic accommodations that made her an American hero and the obvious \nchoice to serve as a representative of the YWCA to the World Conference \nof Christian Youth.\n  While serving as the assistant executive director of the Harlem YWCA, \nMs. Height met Mary McLeod Bethune, founder and president of the \nNational Council of Negro Women. Recognizing the promise and potential \nin Ms. Height, Bethune invited her to join the NCNW in her mission to \nsecure equal rights for women.\n  Throughout her countless years of leadership with the YWCA, the \nNational Council of Negro Women, and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority \nIncorporated, Ms. Height inspired a generation of future leaders. \nDuring those days of racism, intolerance, and hatred, it was extremely \ndifficult for a woman, an African-American woman, to advocate for civil \nrights. Imagine how frightening it must have been to stand up to \noppression, intolerance, and injustice that often ended in violence \nagainst those who simply came in peace seeking to be treated equally \nand fairly. A fearless leader, Ms. Height took the chance she knew she \nhad to take because as she plainly stated, ``we all have to do whatever \nwe can.''\n  It was that simple philosophy that motivated her to accomplish many \nachievements through her leadership with the YWCA, NCNW, and Delta \nSigma Theta Sorority. Her contributions are endless, and as a testament \nto her accomplishments, Ms. Height was awarded the Presidential Medal \nof Freedom in 1994 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004.\n  Dorothy Height's commitment to ensuring equality for all is her \nlegacy and our hope.\n  Heralded as a civil rights leader, Ms. Height was the only woman at \nthe highest level of the civil rights movement to march alongside \nrevered leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Whitney H. Young, \nA. Phillip Randolph, and John Lewis, just to name a few. During the \nheight of the civil rights era, she organized the ``Wednesdays in \nMississippi'' event, which brought together African-American and \nCaucasian women from different walks of life to create a discourse of \nunderstanding. Respected as a national leader, Ms. Height played a \npivotal role in several Presidential committees, including the \nPresident's Committee on the Employment of the Handicapped and the \nPresident's Committee on the Status of Women.\n  Her life's work helped to bring our Nation out from the shadow of \nsegregation to a place where we are moving closer to true racial, \nethnic, and gender equality. While we have made great strides toward \nobtaining equality, there is still much work left to be done. At the \nage of 98, Dorothy Height continued to play a role in addressing the \nsocial inequities some Americans face, as evidenced by her position of \nchairperson of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. She once \nstated, ``I want to be remembered as someone who used herself and \nanything she could touch to work for justice and freedom .  .  . I want \nto be remembered as one who tried.'' Ms. Height will not only be \nremembered as one who tried but also as one who achieved, one who \ninspired, and one who has left a footprint in this world. We can honor \nher legacy by doing our part and trying to make this society better \nthan the one she lived in by finally achieving equality for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2795-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2795-S2797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENUMERATED POWERS ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to closely \nexamine our United States Constitution and Congress's limits held \nwithin this important document. Our Founding Fathers granted Congress \nlimited powers within the Constitution, and we should not stray outside \nthose powers. They knew what would happen if a government grew too \nlarge and too controlling. So far during the 111th Congress, the \ngovernment has taken over banks, insurance companies, the student loan \nindustry and the automobile industry. The American people know this is \nwrong and they have spoken out. During the Wyoming State legislative \nsession, which concluded on March 5, two resolutions were passed \nbecause the Federal Government continues to overstep its bounds. These \ntwo resolutions, House Enrolled Joint Resolution 2 and House Enrolled \nJoint Resolution 3, demand that Congress desist from making mandates \nbeyond the enumerated powers of the United States Constitution.\n  In the U.S. Senate, I am working to pass S. 1319, The Enumerated \nPowers Act, to achieve what the Wyoming State Legislature passed and \nsigned into law on the State level earlier this year. The Enumerated \nPowers Act would require that every bill introduced in Congress include \na constitutionality clause pointing to the exact section in the \nConstitution that grants\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\nCongress the right to make that specific law. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this piece of legislation which was introduced by \nSenator Coburn.\n  We must learn from our constituents and fellow lawmakers. Our \nConstitution has held our country together for hundreds of years and \nthis is no time to abandon it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these two resolutions printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States reads as follows: ``The powers not delegated to \n     the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it \n     to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to \n     the people''; and\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of \n     federal power as being that specifically granted by the \n     Constitution of the United States and no more; and\n       Whereas, the scope of power defined by the Tenth Amendment \n     means that the federal government was created by the states \n     specifically to be an agent of the states; and\n       Whereas, the states are demonstrably treated as agents of \n     the federal government; and\n       Whereas, many federal laws are directly in violation of the \n     Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment assures that we, the people of \n     the United States of America and each sovereign state in the \n     union of states, now have, and have always had, rights the \n     federal government may not usurp; and\n       Whereas, Section 4, Article IV, of the Constitution says, \n     ``The United States shall guarantee to every State in this \n     Union a Republican Form of Government,'' and the Ninth \n     Amendment states that ``The enumeration in the Constitution, \n     of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or \n     disparage others retained by the people''; and\n       Whereas, Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative \n     and regulatory processes of the states; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress frequently considers \n     and enacts laws, and the executive agencies of the federal \n     government frequently promulgate regulations, the \n     constitutional authority for which is either absent or \n     tenuous, including, without limitation, the Real ID Act, \n     which imposes significant unfunded mandates upon the states \n     with respect to the traditional state function of drivers \n     licensing, the Endangered Species Act, which, as construed by \n     the United States Fish & Wildlife Service, authorizes a \n     federal executive agency to require specific state \n     legislation related to the traditional state function of \n     wildlife management, the Clean Water Act, which, as construed \n     by the Environmental Protection Agency, authorizes a federal \n     executive agency to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over \n     waters that are not subject to federal regulation, the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which implements a \n     policy of federal lands retention in derogation of the \n     ``equal footing'' doctrine. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That the State of Wyoming Legislature claims \n     sovereignty on behalf of the State of Wyoming and for its \n     citizens under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and \n     granted to the federal government or reserved to the people \n     by the Constitution of the United States.\n       Section 2. That the rights and liberties of Wyoming, its \n     costates and their respective citizens must be protected from \n     any dangers by declaring that Congress is limited by the \n     Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and \n     that this state calls on its costates for an expression of \n     their sentiments on acts not authorized by the United States \n     Constitution.\n       Section 3. That this resolution serve as notice and demand \n     to the federal government, as our agent, to cease and desist, \n     effective immediately, from enacting mandates that are beyond \n     the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers. The \n     State of Wyoming will not enforce such mandates.\n       Section 4. That all compulsory federal legislation that \n     directs states to comply under threat of civil or criminal \n     penalties or sanctions be prohibited or repealed.\n       Section 5. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress and to \n     the Wyoming Congressional Delegation, with a request that \n     this resolution be officially entered in the congressional \n     record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n     Colin M.

That the Wyoming Congressional delegation and \n     Congress take action to initiate the amendment process \n     provided by article 5 of the Constitution of the United \n     States to amend the tenth amendment and article 1, section 8 \n     (the interstate commerce clause), of the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       Section 2.

Mr. President, as the co-chairman of the U.S. Senate \nTaiwan Caucus, I ask for unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the speech of Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, delivered, via \nvideo conference, before the faculty and students at the Fairbank \nCenter for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        The Quest for Modernity\n\n   (Speech by Ma Ying-jeou, President, Republic of China at Fairbank \n               Center, Harvard University, Apr. 6, 2010)\n\n       President Ma Ying-jeou took part this morning in a video \n     conference with the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at \n     Harvard University. The conference was moderated by Dr. \n     William Kirby, Director of the Fairbank Center. Harvard \n     University president Drew G. Faust opened the conference with \n     a videotaped talk in which she welcomed President Ma to the \n     video conference. After the moderator's opening remarks, \n     President Ma followed with a speech entitled ``The Quest for \n     Modernity.'' Thereafter, professors Steven M. Goldstein, \n     David Der-Wei Wang, William P. Alford each posed a few \n     questions to the president. This was followed by a Q \n     session in which the president fielded questions from members \n     of the audience. As the conference was drawing to a close, \n     President Ma gave a short closing statement.\n       Prof. Kirby, Prof. Goldstein, Prof. Alford, Prof. Wang, \n     Prof. Su Chi, Ambassador Yuan, Director General Hung, Dear \n     faculty members, students, distinguished guests, ladies and \n     gentlemen: Good Evening!\n\n\n                       I. Nostalgia about Harvard\n\n       It heartens me to be once again addressing the excellent \n     faculty and student body of Harvard University. This moment \n     brings back a rush of nostalgia because it was here I became \n     a proud father for the first time before I even got my \n     doctoral degree. It was also at Harvard when I was cloistered \n     for long hours in the Law School Library, or debating with \n     fellow classmates and professors, that I was able to broaden \n     my understanding of the world, and hone my skills as a \n     scholar, intellectual and eventually a leader. I also feel \n     nostalgic on a deeper level. When I think of a long litany of \n     historic events, figures, and institutions: John Hay's Open-\n     Door Policy, Boxer Rebellion, American Indemnity Scholarships \n     for China with all its recipients, like Hu Shih and Chien \n     Shih-Liang, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, May \n     Fourth Movement, Flying Tigers, Pearl Harbor, John Leighton \n     Stuart, 1949, Korean War, United States-Republic of China \n     Mutual Defense Treaty, Fairbank Center, the Quemoy and Matsu \n     Crisis, Cultural Revolution, Shanghai Communique, Taiwan \n     Relations Act, mainland China's Reform and Open Policy, U.S. \n     arms sales to Taiwan and so on, I cannot help but think of \n     the far-reaching impact that America has had on China's, and \n     later on Taiwan's, convoluted path to modernization. I cannot \n     help but think my time at Harvard was not only a personal \n     academic journey, but also a microcosm reflecting a people's \n     long search for a modern nation.\n\n\n                    II. Wealth, Power and Democracy\n\n       The late venerable Benjamin Schwartz, who as you know had \n     been a prominent member of the Fairbank Center, described in \n     the life of Yen Fu that the evolution of modern China has \n     been a journey in search of wealth and power. Given the rise \n     of mainland China's economic power and military strength over \n     the last thirty years, it seems that it has achieved those \n     goals to a considerable degree. However, I believe a society \n     that is truly modernizing should not be limited to wealth and \n     power but must also include the foundations for freedom and \n     democracy. For it is only through the active participation \n     and free choice of one's citizens that government truly \n     serves the welfare of the people; only then can a government \n     sustain, and a nation thrive. So I am proud to say that the \n     Republic of China on Taiwan has in fact achieved all these \n     three pillars. The ROC has since become a thriving nation \n     with a robust economy, viable military and a truly open and \n     vibrant democracy. With so much already achieved the roadmap \n     of my administration is quite straightforward: namely to \n     strengthen the foundation of these three pillars so as to \n     safeguard the future of Taiwan's posterity, and to share with \n     mainland China our values and way of life.\n\n\n                      III. Coming out of Recession\n\n       My administration came into office two years ago in the \n     midst of a global economic crisis, so it's not an \n     exaggeration that we definitely ``hit the ground running.'' \n     Since then we have worked relentlessly to revitalize Taiwan's \n     economy. By taking measures such as guaranteeing 100% bank \n     deposits, substantially lowering interest rate in seven \n     instances, investing 16 billion US dollars in domestic \n     infrastructure in 5 years, distributing 2.7 billion US \n     dollars worth of shopping vouchers, and providing emergency \n     assistance for the underprivileged, my administration has \n     successfully brought the economy out of the downturn after a \n     year and a half. Now we expect to create about a quarter of a \n     million jobs to bring the unemployment rate below 5% and GDP \n     growth up to 4.72% this year. Job creation will remain our \n     top priority, especially those in the green energy sector. \n     With carbon reduction in mind, we are now ambitiously \n     promoting innovation across all of Taiwan's most competitive \n     sectors. These include the country's traditional strongholds \n     such as IT, agriculture, and healthcare as well as other \n     emerging industries like green energy, biotech, tourism and \n     the cultural creative industries. However, the growing trend \n     towards regional integration among economic powerhouses in \n     East Asia, like Japan, mainland China, South Korea and the \n     ASEAN countries, is threatening to marginalize Taiwan's \n     heavily export-driven economy. As such, my administration has \n     been seeking to institutionalize economic relations with \n     mainland China and diversify our export markets and products \n     so that Taiwan will not only avoid being cut off from the \n     global economy but also enhance its international \n     competitiveness. Therefore, we have been pushing hard for an \n     Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with the \n     mainland that will serve as a critical structural platform \n     for economic interaction between the two sides. On top of \n     intellectual property rights protection and investment \n     guarantee, the framework will include an early harvest \n     package of goods and services to enjoy zero custom tariffs. \n     The negotiations are already underway and expect to conclude \n     in the next few months. We have also established government \n     programs that will cushion potential shocks to industries and \n     workers, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises. \n     Although some assert that signing the ECFA with mainland \n     China will compromise our sovereignty, this is definitely not \n     the case. The top priority of my administration has always \n     been the principle of ``putting Taiwan first for the benefit \n     of the people.'' The truth of the matter, ECFA will spearhead \n     Taiwan's return to the accelerated track for economic \n     integration in Asia-Pacific and beyond. This without a doubt \n     will strengthen Taiwan's capabilities to enhance its \n     competitive edge in the global market and brighten its \n     outlook for negotiating similar arrangements with other \n     countries.\n\n\n         IV. Cross-Strait Rapprochement and Flexible Diplomacy\n\n       In the pursuit of power my administration is not merely \n     seeking military strength but more importantly to build up \n     our soft power. In fact, the heart of my foreign policy is to \n     reestablish mutual trust with all our major international \n     partners, especially the United States. In achieving this \n     goal, my administration has worked incessantly to transform \n     the Taiwan Straits from a major flashpoint into a conduit for \n     regional peace and prosperity. Therefore, in order to resume \n     constructive dialogue with the mainland after a hiatus of \n     over a decade, we first announced in 2008 the policy of ``No \n     Unification, No Independence, No Use of Force'' so as to \n     maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait under the \n     framework of the Republic of China's 1946 Constitution. This \n     breakthrough was further advanced under the framework of the \n     92 Consensus of ``one China, respective interpretations'' \n     that was reached by the two sides in November 1992. That is \n     now deemed a feasible formula by government leaders across \n     the Taiwan Strait as well as many in the wider world \n     community. We have also adopted a policy of Flexible \n     Diplomacy and pursued a diplomatic truce with the mainland, \n     which has by and large ended the vicious cycle of diplomatic \n     warfare between the two sides. This will assuredly foster \n     responsible stakeholdership in both Taiwan as well as the \n     mainland. At the same time, we are working equally hard to \n     enhance Taiwan's meaningful participation in and contribution \n     to the international community. This will be achieved through \n     our strong initiative to develop Taiwan's green technology \n     and healthcare industries in conjunction with our foreign aid \n     policies. For example, under the Flagship Program for Green \n     Energy Industry, we will be building up Taiwan's industrial \n     base in green technology especially in Photo voltaic solar \n     cells and LED. This will not only benefit our people and \n     economy, but more importantly, Taiwan will be able to share \n     its resources and expertise with our allies and friends. On \n     my visit to our Pacific island allies last month, I was proud \n     to survey firsthand the work that Taiwan has done for some of \n     the countries in the area. For example, Taiwan\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\n     has installed and provided solar energy technology to the \n     Solomon Islands in hopes of improving the environment and \n     livelihoods of their people. Taiwan has also set up an \n     impressive medical mission in the Marshall Islands to \n     treat the high prevalence of cataracts sufferers. In fact, \n     our government will boost the overall effectiveness of our \n     medical aid by initiating many more medical and public \n     health missions that will target specific conditions and \n     diseases common among the people of the Pacific island \n     allies and friends. At the same time, after Taiwan \n     effectively controlled the spread of the H1N1 Flu within \n     our own borders, with a mortality rate of 2 deaths per \n     million, which is only \\1/3\\ of the average for OECD \n     countries, I am proud to report that Taiwan will also be \n     giving away locally manufactured vaccines worth 5 million \n     U.S. dollars to other countries in need. Taiwan's search \n     and rescue teams were also one of the first on the scenes \n     when Haiti was hit by a devastating earthquake earlier \n     this year. In addition to donating $16 million worth in \n     aid and funds, our government is also planning to set up \n     medical and vocational training centers to train for \n     hundreds of medical and skilled workers, and build 1,200 \n     housing units. Also, as a sign of Taiwan's flourishing \n     civil society, World Vision Taiwan has collected countless \n     small donations from our people that will be sufficient to \n     feed and save more than 8,000 homeless Haitian children \n     and orphans. However, my administration realizes \n     humanitarian relief is only a small part of the long and \n     challenging road to full recovery. This is why we hope to \n     continue the work we have started in integrating the \n     advances we make in healthcare and green technology into \n     our foreign aid framework, so that Taiwan can truly make a \n     meaningful difference in the countries we help.\n\n\n            V. The Universal Value of Freedom and Democracy\n\n       However, coming back full circle, the search for a modern \n     nation cannot merely lie upon the pillars of wealth and \n     power. It is only under a true democracy that one's citizens \n     can live without fear according to the law, and share in the \n     burdens as well as benefits of good governance. Although \n     Taiwan has made impressive sociopolitical progress over the \n     last decades, it is still a young democracy. So, as firm \n     champions for democracy, my administration will work to \n     strengthen the democratic infrastructure of my country. \n     Already we are taking tangible steps to enhance Taiwan's rule \n     of law and protection of human rights in conformity with \n     international standards. In the past year, we have ratified \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n     (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social \n     and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), both administered by the United \n     Nations. In converting these covenants into domestic law, \n     they will certainly strengthen the human rights of our \n     citizenry and further consolidate our rule of law. \n     Furthermore, I came to power on the promise of combating \n     corruption in elections and government, whereby we have \n     already made meaningful progress. Without a doubt this goal \n     will continue to be a cornerstone of my presidency, which I \n     am determined to carry through in my capacity as the \n     President of the country. I will assuredly not waver from the \n     path in laying the foundations of a true democracy. In fact, \n     next year in 2011 will be the Centennial Anniversary of the \n     Republic of China. Against the background of thousands of \n     years of Chinese history, the last century was in some ways \n     merely a comma. But from a larger perspective, it was nothing \n     short of an exclamation mark, as it has been 100 years of \n     struggle; 100 years of experimentation and 100 years of \n     education before a people learned that they too have the \n     unequivocal rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of \n     happiness. This nation-building process undoubtedly was \n     achieved through the collective efforts of countless \n     dedicated individuals who traversed between tradition and \n     modernity that helped bridge the East to the West so many \n     years ago. Inevitably, this made it possible for a people to \n     aspire to the same democratic values as you cherish. From the \n     chaos arising out of the turn of the 20th century, to the \n     founding of the first republic in Asia in 1912 and its \n     evolution forward in 1949 when the Republic of China \n     Government moved to Taiwan, in 1987 when Taiwan lifted \n     martial law, launched its democratic transformation, and \n     subsequently allowed Taiwan residents to visit their \n     relatives on the mainland, in 1996 when people on Taiwan \n     directly elected its President for the first time, and in \n     2000 and 2008 when the Presidential elections further \n     consolidated Taiwan's democracy through two rotations of \n     power between political parties, the passage of these 100 \n     years has irrevocably transformed the foundations of a \n     political culture. Distinguished faculty members and \n     students, ladies and gentlemen, as the elected president of \n     the Republic of China, I will continue to strive toward \n     forging Taiwan into an exemplary democracy; one that will be \n     a source of inspiration and emulation for generations to \n     come.\n       Thank you.\n\n\n                     President Ma's closing remarks\n\n       Dear distinguished faculty, students and friends; it is my \n     great pleasure to hold this teleconference with you. Your \n     questions and comments are very good, and some are very tough \n     to answer, but in thinking and answering these questions you \n     force me to think deeper and strive harder on the challenges \n     that confront the road ahead.\n       Although today's conference is near an end, I am heartened \n     by the thought that our friendship will continue to grow as \n     there is still so much we need to do, together. The \n     international system that the US forged out of the \n     devastation of World War II 65 years ago has today become the \n     enduring foundation of our global village. Being rule-based \n     and sufficiently flexible, this system encourages positive-\n     sum international cooperation rather than zero-sum interstate \n     conflict. Hence, it changed the underlying dynamics of the \n     world order that made it possible for countries, big or \n     small, to prosper together. As a matter of fact, my idea to \n     seek rapprochement with the mainland find some similarities \n     with the ideas espoused by the American leaders in having \n     soft talks with the Soviet Union and to have detente. In \n     other words, to replace confrontation with negotiations; to \n     solve international disputes through peaceful means. It is \n     this very system that has interlocked the world into a \n     community of thriving interdependence, giving rise to the \n     possibility where foes can turn into friends, where every \n     country can be a winner and every contribution become part of \n     a greater picture.\n       This is also the system from which I draw my inspiration to \n     lead my country, particularly in dealing with the mainland. \n     In taking a responsible stake in the world, and in seeking \n     rapprochement with the Chinese mainland, my administration \n     has committed the Republic of China on Taiwan to becoming a \n     dependable and valuable contributor to this international \n     system. In my visit abroad last month, I kept saying to our \n     friends or to the overseas Taiwanese and to members of my \n     delegations, that what I tried to do as far as my country's \n     foreign relations is concerned is to make Taiwan a \n     respectable member of the international community. I want \n     every Taiwanese when they walk in the streets of New York, of \n     Paris, of Sydney, of Beijing that they are respected. People \n     will say they are from Taiwan, and that Taiwan is a \n     respectful country in the world. Some in my domestic audience \n     may disagree with me, but I firmly believe that this is the \n     right path for Taiwan to avoid being marginalized from the \n     forward march of the rest of the world. However, we will not \n     merely concentrate on our own interests but equally apply our \n     resources in hopes of having a positive impact on the world \n     community. In fact, under this system that the United States \n     started over half a century ago, we, as a whole, ought to be \n     able to right what has gone wrong; to unite as one humanity \n     against the global crises that threatens all that we hold \n     dear, whether climate change, the global economic downturn, \n     the risk of pandemics, or the wars that endanger the peace of \n     our world. In the end, we are the only ones that can overcome \n     the challenges we face. And in such an important partnership, \n     I am confident Taiwan will be there to live up to its \n     responsibilities.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2798-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIMMY WAYNE\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime to recognize the leadership and contributions of Jimmy Wayne to \nthe State of Tennessee and the United States of America for his \nremarkable efforts to combat homelessness.\n  Jimmy Wayne began his ``Meet Me Halfway'' on January 1, 2010. He \nplans to walk 1,660 miles from Nashville, TN, to Phoenix, AZ, to raise \nawareness about the plight of homeless youth in our country.\n  He knows firsthand about the challenges of being homeless. Jimmy is a \nproduct of the foster child system who grew up in a variety of foster \nhomes, and he occasionally found himself homeless as a teen.\n  He was fortunate to be given a second chance at the age of 16 when \nBea and Russell Costner gave him a home and a new start. They gave him \na place to stay but only if he agreed to ``meet them halfway,'' by \nfollowing the rules of their house.\n  It is fitting that Jimmy Wayne is using his ``Meet Me Halfway'' \ncampaign to not only raise awareness but to raise funds for \norganizations that benefit homeless youth. I thank Jimmy Wayne for his \nwork, and I look forward to congratulating him once he finishes this \ncampaign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2798-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2798-S2799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MAYOR DAVE MUNSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the lifetime \nof achievement by one of South Dakota's finest and most dedicated \npublic servants. Dave Munson's distinguished tenure as mayor of South \nDakota's largest city, Sioux Falls, followed a successful career in the \nfinancial industry and 24 years as an elected member of the South \nDakota Legislature.\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\n  As a native of Sioux Falls, Mayor Munson married and raised his \nchildren in the city he loves, pursued a successful business career, \nand ultimately rose to the position of mayor. He has provided critical, \nconsistent, and caring leadership to the residents of Sioux Falls \nduring his terms in office.\n  Over the past decade, Sioux Falls has witnessed tremendous \nresidential housing growth and business development. During Mayor \nMunson's tenure, an impressive sum of over 16,000 jobs have been added \nin the city. Tax valuation in the city has grown from $125 million in \n2002 to $229 million today.\n  Sioux Falls continues to be a great place to work, live, and raise a \nfamily, and this has been reflected in numerous top national rankings \nfor quality of life and job development. Most recently, Sioux Falls was \nnamed one of the top five cities in the Nation for job prospects by the \nManpower Employment Outlook Survey. For the past 8 years, Forbes \nmagazine has ranked Sioux Falls first out of 200 small metropolitan \nareas as the best places for businesses and careers. From adding 490 \nacres of parkland throughout Sioux Falls to increasing public safety by \nadding 50 police officers to the streets, from development of 23,000 \nacres on the east side of the thriving community to enhancing and \nimproving neighborhoods, Mayor Munson has exhibited a progressive \nattitude to developing and maintaining Sioux Falls as one of the best \ncities in our Nation. A recent survey shows that 92 percent of Sioux \nFalls citizens say their community is a good or excellent place to \nlive. Few city officials can tout such an extraordinary level of \nsatisfaction.\n  I have enjoyed my working relationship and friendship with Mayor \nMunson over many years. I have appreciated his can-do attitude, his \nvision for the future of Sioux Falls, and his team-oriented approach to \nresolving issues. Most of all, I have enjoyed collaborating with him on \nseveral large-scale projects that will continue to enhance the quality \nof life in Sioux Falls for decades. For example, the roadway from \n``Phillips to the Falls'' has been completed. Together, we ensured the \nfuture of the Orpheum Theater. We have long been partners to bring much \nneeded water to Sioux Falls with the construction of the Lewis and \nClark Regional Water System, which will meet the infrastructure needs \nfor increased growth in the Sioux Falls area far into the future.\n  Mayor Munson has provided a lasting legacy of leadership that will \nbenefit the citizens of Sioux Falls for generations to come. His \ndedication and commitment to the people of Sioux Falls is unmatched, \nand I commend his distinguished service as mayor. Another of his \nachievements, the illumination at Christmastime of the falls for which \nthe city is named, will serve as an annual reminder of his leadership. \nAs Mayor Munson concludes his final tenure, I thank him for his \nservice, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2799-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to thank my \ncolleagues for the time this morning to speak about a very special \nflight that just took place. The Louisiana HonorAir flight that came \ninto Washington on Saturday, April 10 included a group of 82 World War \nII veterans from Louisiana. These veterans visited the various \nmemorials and monuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's \ninvaluable servicemembers.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, sponsored this \nlatest trip--its 21st flight--to the Nation's Capital. The organization \nhonors surviving Louisiana World War II veterans by giving them an \nopportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this \ntrip, the veterans visited the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo \nJima memorials. They traveled to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a \nwreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there are roughly 30,000 living WWII veterans, and each \none has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory of freedom over \ntyranny. The oldest in this HonorAir group was born in 1918. Some began \ntheir service as early as 1940, before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and \nsome members of this group served as late as 1972. This HonorAir group \nserved in various branches of the military: 31 in the U.S. Army, 21 in \nthe Navy, 16 in the Air Force, 7 in the Marine Corps, 2 in the Coast \nGuard, 2 in the Merchant Marines and 1 was a Women's Army Corps Member, \nWAC.\n  Our heroes trekked the world for their country. They served across \nthe globe, participating in major invasions such as those at Iwo Jima, \nOkinawa, Guadalcanal, Leyte, the Phillippines, and southern France.\n  One was a prisoner of war in Germany, while others fought in the \nhistoric Battle of the Bulge or stormed the beaches at Normandy.\n  Many of these veterans have been decorated with multiple Purple \nHearts, Bronze Star Medals, Air Medals and Navy Crosses.\n  These men and women, who have given so much for our country, truly \nrepresent our greatest generation. I ask the Senate to join me in \nhonoring these 82 veterans, all Louisiana heroes, that we welcomed to \nWashington on April 10 and Louisiana HonorAir for making these trips a \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2799-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2799-S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING SEA BAGS, INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I honor a Maine small business \nthat has not only captured Maine history and tradition through their \nunique craft, but has also aimed to selflessly support various \norganizations and charities throughout the State of Maine for over a \ndecade. Sea Bags, Inc., coowned by Maine natives Hannah Kubiak and Beth \nShissler, is based in Maine's largest city, Portland, and has been \nusing recycled sails to create inventive, environmentally friendly \npurses and tote bags that are ``sailed around the world'' and \n``recycled in Maine.''\n  Sea Bags, Inc. was founded in 1999 on the principle that ``recycling \nis not just a fad, but a responsibility.'' And while they own a \nglobally successful business, Hannah Kubiak and Beth Shissler have \nalways emphasized making a positive and lasting impact locally. Ms. \nKubiak, who grew up sailing in the famed seaside town of Kennebunkport, \nwas inspired by her father, who would often brainstorm ways to reuse \nold sails. Additionally, Ms. Shissler travelled the world in her work \nfor several large companies before being drawn home to put her business \nexperience to use at Sea Bags. Their work has been featured in a \nvariety of publications, including Vanity Fair; the New York Times; \nVogue; and O, the Oprah Magazine.\n  Believing that everyone should have a second chance, Sea Bags has \npreviously partnered with the Maine Department of Correction's \nIndustries Program to engage inmates at the Maine Correctional \nInstitute for Women in helping make the bags and teaching them job \nskills such as sewing. This 2-year collaboration helped the company \nkeep up with the increased demand in recent years. In 2005, Sea Bags \nwas selling roughly 60 items per year, and it now sells over 2,000 each \nmonth. In addition to its line of regular, everyday tote bags--which \nare water resistant and durable--the company also offers creative bath \nmats, coasters, and shaving kits. Sea Bags has also created a limited-\nedition line of ``Cure Bags'' to ``celebrate a cure'' for breast \ncancer. Fifty percent of all of the proceeds from Cure Bags goes to the \nMaine Cancer Foundation for breast cancer support and awareness \nprograms.\n  When it comes to supporting Maine's timeless tradition of sailing, \nSea Bags donates to the Sail Maine Scholarship Fund with the aim of \nhelping underprivileged children learn how to sail. Sea Bags has teamed \nup with other local nautical organizations, including the Islesboro \nYacht Club Youth Sailing Program, the Compass Project, and the\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\nMaine Maritime Academy, to sustain the historic art of sailing. \nAdditionally, for the 2008 Olympics, Sea Bags created a line of totes \nto support the quest of New England sailors Andy Horton and Brad \nNichol, pledging $40,000 to help send the athletes to Beijing.\n  Hannah Kubiak and Beth Shissler have offered a vivid example of the \ndifference a small business can make in a community locally, and \nglobally, through a noble devotion to social responsibility. It is \nevident that through their distinctive dedication to promoting \nrecycling and assisting charities, they have started a trend in \nresponsible entrepreneurship that other small companies will surely \nemulate. I sincerely thank Ms. Kubiak and Ms. Shissler and everyone at \nSea Bags, Inc. for their continued service to the State of Maine, and \noffer my best wishes for their future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2800-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ASHLEY VAN DEN TOP\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I recognize the Sioux Falls \nNational Weather Service, a public weather informer that has been \nserving the U.S. since 1870.\n  Volunteers began making weather observations in the Sioux Falls area \nin 1890 creating the basis for the Sioux Falls station. From its first \nlocal forecast to the public in 1955 to the harsh weather South Dakota \nexperienced this past winter, the station has kept State residents \napprised of current conditions.\n  There is a strong need for the weather service to effectively \ncommunicate information to the public regarding storms, floods, \nwildfires, tornados, hail, and blizzards. The Sioux Falls National \nWeather Service provides these advisories for the area to keep families \nsafe and informed.\n  The Sioux Falls National Weather Service played a vital role in \nhelping the news media inform South Dakotans about the snow storms that \nhit South Dakota last winter. I would like to offer my appreciation to \nthe staff at the Sioux Falls Weather Forecast Office for their devotion \nto residents during times of critical need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2800-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HENRY SHELTON\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a Rhode \nIslander who has devoted his life to improving the lot of others. For \ndecades now, the name Henry Shelton has rung out as a clarion for \nsocial justice and equality in our Ocean State. He is and has always \nbeen a voice for the little guy--the homeless veteran, the hungry \nchild, or the underpaid laborer.\n  Most folks in Rhode Island know Henry as the founder and coordinator \nof the George Wiley Center, a nonprofit antipoverty organization based \nin Pawtucket. But before that, Henry was a Catholic priest for 16 \nyears, during which he began organizing needy Rhode Islanders in \nProvidence to elect leaders responsive to their needs. In 1973 he left \nthe church to marry his beloved Carol, a former nun who shared his \npassion for advocacy.\n  Ever since then, Henry has been ``raising hell,'' as he might say, \nand fighting for Rhode Island's overlooked and underpaid. In 1974 he \nstarted the Coalition for Consumer Justice and in 1981 founded the \nGeorge Wiley Center. Over the years Henry has organized sit-ins, \nbattled budget cuts, fasted to get clothes for children on welfare, \nadvocated to keep electricity rates down for low income residents, and \neven been arrested for disorderly conduct--a fact which may amuse those \nwho know Henry as a peaceful and gentle man.\n  And last year, Henry fought through his toughest battle yet. Just \nbefore the New Year, Henry suffered a serious stroke which landed him \nin the hospital. Anyone with a friend or family member who has \nexperienced a stroke knows that the recovery is often a slow and \npainful process, but none of this stopped Henry. In fact, the headline \nin the Providence Journal following his hospitalization read: \n``Advocate for the poor, Henry Shelton, suffers stroke--but continue \nwork from hospital.'' The paper went on to report that Henry organized \na State house rally from his hospital bed.\n  This is the Henry I know, and who we in Rhode Island have known and \nloved for many years. This Monday in Rhode Island, the Fund for \nCommunity Progress will present Henry with its Profile in Courage \nAward, which the organization describes as a ``distinctive honor for \nthose who have dedicated their lives to creating positive change in the \ncommunity.'' Henry Shelton has generated enough positive change in his \nlife to satisfy that requirement many times over.\n  And so today, Mr. President, I would like to thank Henry Shelton for \na lifetime of selflessness and courage, and for always being a voice \nfor those who needed one most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2800-5", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2800-6", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2800-7", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2800-S2801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 12:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 5147.

A bill to reauthorize the national small business tree \nplanting program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small Business \nEnvironmental Stewardship Assistance Act of 2010, a companion bill to \nthe legislation introduced in the House by another member of the Oregon \ndelegation, Congressman Schrader. I am pleased to launch this \nlegislation in the Senate and am joined today by Senator Merkley from \nmy home State, as well as Senators Stabenow, Specter, and Harkin.\n  Trees provide numerous benefits to our communities--from cleaner air \nto energy efficiency to more beautiful city streets. But trees and \ngreen spaces are also good for business and good for green job \ncreation. Beyond the most obvious benefits of trees, studies have shown \nthat businesses thrive in green, attractive, pedestrian-oriented retail \nenvironments. And this legislation will help America's small businesses \nand communities plant trees and enhance those kinds of environments. As \na Senator from Oregon--a State that grows many of the trees that \nbeautify cities around our Nation, including some of the very trees \nthat grace the Capitol grounds--I also know how critical jobs in our \nnursery and landscaping sector can be. In my State, the industry \nprovides 21,000 jobs and helps provide over $2 billion worth of \neconomic activity.\n  This bill would reauthorize the National Small Business Tree Planting \nProgram, which existed for several years in the 1990s. Between 1991 and \n1994, more than 18,000 green industry firms were employed to plant more \nthan 23 million trees across the country through the Small Business \nAdministration program. This program had numerous successes, including \nin my home State where 109 tree planting\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\ngrants were administered between 1991 and 1994. Nearly 11,700 shade, \nlandscape, and riparian area trees were planted.\n  The program would be authorized at $50 million a year between fiscal \nyears 2011 and 2015. The funding provides grants to State forestry \nagencies to enable communities to plant trees around retail \nstorefronts, rental housing units, and other public areas. This program \nrequires a 25-percent match for any grant received under the program, \nincluding in-kind contributions such as the cost or value of providing \ncare and maintenance for a period of 3 years after planting. Having a \nmatch requirement ensures that both private and community investments \nare made for the installation and care of trees funded by this program \nUltimately, this program will lead to healthier, greener more vibrant \ncommunities and result in green jobs. I look forward to working with \nSenate cosponsors, the nursery industry, State foresters, and the \nbill's other supporters to advance this legislation to the President's \ndesk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 3281. A bill to expand student loan forgiveness, to provide loan \nrepayment assistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce an \nimportant piece of legislation entitled the Student Loan Forgiveness \nand Repayment Assistance Act of 2010.\n  This legislation is in response to the increasingly high cost of \npostsecondary education, an important issue that I recently discussed \nwith Pennsylvania students. During this conversation I discussed the \nneed for what I called an ``education bill of rights'' and today I am \nintroducing a practical approach to increasing the accessibility and \naffordability of higher education.\n  On March 30, 2010, the President signed into law the Student Aid and \nFiscal Responsibility Act, AFRA, as part of the healthcare and \neducation reconciliation bill, which I am proud to have supported in \nthe Senate. This historic legislation made an important investment in \nhigher education, including: $36 billion to fund and strengthen the \nPell Grant program, $2.55 billion to support Historically Black \nColleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions, $1.5 \nbillion to strengthen the Income Based Repayment, IBR, plan as well as \nseveral other student financial assistance and deficit reduction \nprovisions.\n  These actions were an important first step, but we must do more. \nAccording to Campus Progress--the total federal student debt is more \nthan $617 million; the average student today graduates college with \nstudent debt 25 percent higher than that of college graduates a decade \nago; the average college senior graduated with $4,100 in credit card \ndebt and $23,200 in student loans; almost 7 in 10 college graduates are \nburdened with educational debt; student debt is outpacing the starting \nsalaries of jobs in teaching and social work; 38 percent of graduates \ndelay buying their first house because of debt, 14 percent marriage, \nand 21 percent delay having children; and over 60 percent of minorities \nface a gap between their expected family contributions, grants and \nloans and the cost of their education. These troublesome statistics \nunderscore the need for further action.\n  I strongly feel that education is our Nation's greatest capital \ninvestment. The legislation that I am introducing today reinforces this \nbelief and helps us make several smart investments in our Nation's \nfuture. We must improve accessibility to higher education, and the key \nto accessibility is affordability. For these reasons, the Student Loan \nForgiveness and Repayment Assistance Act of 2010 will focus on 5 key \ninitiatives which help make prudent and targeted investments in higher \neducation.\n  First, my bill will strengthen the IBR plan. The IBR plan is an \nimportant tool that helps borrowers afford their monthly student loan \npayments by capping a borrower's monthly payment based on his/her \nincome and family size. Currently the IBR plan caps monthly payments at \n15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income. SAFRA lowered the \npercentage to 10 percent starting in 2014, which will allow more \nborrowers to take advantage of this helpful plan. I propose to further \nreduce the percentage to 7 percent, thereby allowing more students to \nparticipate in the IBR plan. In addition to capping monthly payments, a \nborrower's remaining debt will be forgiven after 20 years of making \nqualified monthly payments. SAFRA reduced this threshold by 5 years \nfrom the original 25 year requirement. My legislation will further \nreduce the number of years that a borrower must make his/her payments \nbefore debt is forgiven to 15 years.\n\n  Second, the bill I am introducing will enhance the Public Service \nLoan Forgiveness Program. This program, which was created in 2007 by \nthe College Cost Reduction and Access Act, discharges remaining student \nloan debt if the borrower is employed in public service for 10 years. \nThis program not only provides important loan forgiveness, but it \nencourages essential public service. My legislation proposes to make \nthe benefits of this program more generous and encourage greater public \nservice participation. My bill would reduce the number of years, from \n10 to 5 that a borrower must work in the public sector before being \nable to take advantage of this program. After the 5th year, a \npercentage of the borrower's debt will be incrementally forgiven each \nyear, up until after the 10th year of public service when all remaining \ndebt will be forgiven.\n  Third, my legislation will expand the student loan programs or health \nprofessions, primary care, and nursing by reducing the interest rate to \n3.5 percent. My bill will also expand the health professions student \nloan program to include physician's assistants. Health care reform's \nembrace of some 32 million previously uninsured Americans has created a \nneed for additional doctors and nurses. Ways must be found to make \nmedical education more affordable and accompanying debt burdens less \nonerous. I believe my bill helps achieve this goal.\n  Fourth, my bill will enhance opportunities for minorities by creating \na new pilot program administered by the U.S. Department of Education, \nwhich will provide funding opportunities for minority serving \ninstitutions. This program will provide grants on a competitive basis \nto eligible institutions based on a college's plan to increase \nenrollment and graduation rates without increasing costs to students. \nMy legislation authorizes $100 million annually for this purpose, for 5 \nyears.\n  Fifth and lastly, my legislation will establish an Assistant \nSecretary position to evaluate and promote accessibility and \naffordability in higher education. It is important that we have a \nperson who can not only evaluate the efficacy of the programs that I \nhave discussed and to make recommendations to Congress on how to \nimprove them, but also to help make prospective students aware of how \nthey can gain access to, and afford a higher education. As I said \nearlier, education is our greatest capital investment, and I believe \nthat the Student Loan Forgiveness and Repayment Assistance Act of 2010 \nwill help our nation make a smart investment in our future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 3282. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe work opportunity tax credit for employers of certain veterans; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the health and future of Pennsylvania's \nveterans has been a longstanding concern of mine. The first veteran I \nknew was my father, Harry Specter, a veteran of WWI.\n  My father received terrific care from the VA following his service to \nour Nation. I want to make sure today's veterans, whatever their age, \nreceive the benefits and services we owe them.\n  I have had the privilege of serving for 6 of my nearly 30 years in \nthe Senate as chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee. Under my \nchairmanship from 1998 to 2002, funding for the VA increased by 28 \npercent, and from 2004 to 2006, funding increased a further 16 percent. \nSuch funding increases have allowed the VA to expand to meet increasing \nchallenges.\n  I want to note at this time that I recently cosponsored legislation \nto restore collective bargaining rights to VA medical personnel, as \ntheir well being is vital to ensuring that veterans get the best \npossible care.\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\n  The ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with the \nrecession, have put tremendous stress on the VA, and necessitate \nfurther improvements. Today I will outline proposals for making \nimprovements in five related areas: reducing the claims backlog; \nincreasing veterans' employment opportunities; combating homelessness \namong veterans; widening education opportunities through the Post-9/11 \nGI Bill; and expanding veterans courts.\n  In a slap at the men and women who fight our wars, a court created by \nCongress expressly to handle appeals of veterans' disability claims \nturned down the appeal of a disabled Korean War veteran because he \nmissed a filing deadline.\n  The veteran, David L. Henderson, served in the military from 1950 to \n1952. He was discharged following a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia \nand assigned a 100 percent disability rating. In 2001, he applied for \nin-home care and was turned down by a regional Veterans Administration \ndepartment.\n\n  The congressionally established Court of Appeals for Veterans \nClaims--the Veterans Court--then refused to hear his appeal on grounds \nthat he missed the filing deadline by 15 days. A divided federal \nappeals court upheld the decision.\n  After fighting a war and suffering long-term disability as a result, \nHenderson in later life has been penalized because he took 135 days, \ninstead of 120, to file his claims appeal.\n  The fact that he had good reason for missing the deadline didn't \nmatter. His psychiatrist called him ``incapable of rational thought or \ndeliberate decisionmaking.''\n  On April 12, 2010, I introduced the Fair Access to Veterans Benefits \nAct, to provide for the tolling of the timing of review for appeals of \nfinal decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals. Its main provision \nwould require the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, \nknown as the Veterans Court, to hear appeals by veterans of \nadministrative decisions denying them benefits when circumstances \nbeyond their control--sometimes the very service-related disabilities \nthat entitle them to benefits--render them unable to meet the deadline \nfor filing an appeal.\n  On January 28, 2010, I met with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in my \nWashington, DC office. Secretary Shinseki identified reducing the VA \nclaims backlog--which currently numbers 400,000--as being his top \npriority this year. The average processing time for an individual claim \nwas 161 days in January 2010. This is simply too long.\n  In January 2010, Secretary Shinseki initiated a pilot project at the \nVA Pittsburgh Regional Office to identify opportunities to reduce the \ntime required for the VA to request and receive evidence required to \nsupport veterans' claims. I believe that efforts such as this, which \nleverage the expertise of veterans' service organizations, will help to \ndecrease significantly the claims backlog by streamlining each claims \nsubmission, and so improving the care and benefits given to our \nveterans. I recently requested that the Milcon/VA Appropriations \nSubcommittee increase funding by $1 million in fiscal year 2011 for \ncosts associated with expanding the pilot program.\n  Beyond this pilot program, I am introducing legislation to give the \nSecretary of the Veterans Affairs the authority to award grants to \nstate and local agencies, and non-profit organizations such as VSOs, to \nassist in collecting evidence and submitting claims. I believe this \npre-submission assistance will aid the Veterans Benefits Administration \nin reducing the claims backlog.\n  The National Guard has played a vital role in ensuring our nation's \nsecurity since September 11, 2001. The citizen soldiers and airmen \nserving in the Guard have been called upon to serve both domestically \nand overseas.\n  Current law protects Guardsmen who are called up to serve overseas \nfrom losing their civilian jobs, but the same degree of protection does \nnot extend to domestic missions. After repeated deployments, Guardsmen \ncould soon find themselves having to chose between critical national \nsecurity missions--like protecting the southern border or responding to \nnatural disasters--and keeping their civilian job due to a five-year \ncap on cumulative service for employment protection, which can be \nwaived for overseas service but currently not domestic.\n  Legislation is needed to ensure that Guardsmen receive the same \nemployment protection whether they are called to serve domestically or \noverseas.\n  Congress took an important step when it established a tax credit \nincentivizing the hiring of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans as part of \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This tax credit is set to \nexpire in August 2011, and I am introducing legislation to extend \nthrough 2010 the veteran-specific provisions of the tax credit to \nassist recently discharged veterans secure employment.\n  On November 3, 2009, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki \nunveiled an ambitious five-year plan to end homelessness among the \nnation's veterans. According to the VA's latest estimates, there are \ncurrently 107,000 homeless veterans, down from 131,000 in 2008.\n  The VA's fiscal year 2011 budget request includes $4.2 billion to \nprevent and reduce homelessness among Veterans--over $3.4 billion for \ncore medical services and $799 million for specific homeless programs \nand expanded medical programs.\n  On November 11, 2009, I held a field hearing on the issue of \nunemployment and homelessness among veterans. Among those who testified \nwere four formerly homeless veterans who have benefited from HUD-VASH \nvouchers and VA job training programs. The hearing highlighted the \nsuccess of the HUD-VASH voucher program and the need to expand it, so I \ncosponsored Sen. Reed's Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act of \n2009, which would increase the number of vouchers by 60,000 over the \nnext four years. Additionally, two of the witnesses were single \nmothers. Their testimony underscored the importance of tailoring \nassistance to the needs of individual veterans, and to ensuring that \nthe specific needs of veterans with special needs, such as homeless \nfemale veterans and homeless veterans with children are addressed. I \ncosponsored Senator Murray's Homeless Women Veterans and Homeless \nVeterans with Children Act, which would authorize $10 million a year in \ngrants for five years to assist homeless veterans with special needs or \ndependents. I voted for this legislation when it was passed by the \nVeterans Affairs Committee on January 28, 2010.\n\n  The GI Bill of Rights, which had remained largely unchanged for over \ntwo decades, was in need of revision. I was pleased to cosponsor and \nadvocate for the Post-9/11 GI bill, which was signed into law in June \n2008. This bill, which went into effect in August 2009, will provide \nfor this generation what the post-WWII GI Bill provided for veterans of \nthat conflict. As our men and women serving today will continue to lead \nand serve our country tomorrow, it is in our best interest to ensure \nthat they are afforded higher educational opportunities.\n  Yet there remain aspects of this legislation which need improvement. \nWhile all veterans deserve educational opportunities, they also deserve \nthe right to choose where to secure their education. For some, a \nvocational program, apprenticeship, or on the job training is more \nappealing than a traditional university education. We should support \nsuch decisions, and so I recently cosponsored the Veterans Training \nAct, introduced by Senator Lincoln, to make this enhancement.\n  Various studies report that between 20- and 50-percent of the \nveterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars will suffer from \npost-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, depression, traumatic brain \ninjury, TBI, or other mental disorders, and half of those veterans will \nnot receive the mental health care they need.\n  The symptoms and subsequent behavior associated with PTSD and TBI, as \nwell as the abuse of drugs and alcohol by veterans suffering from these \nsymptoms, bring many of these veterans into contact with the criminal \njustice system. Veterans account for 9 of every 100 inmates in U.S. \njails and prisons. In Pennsylvania state prisons, there are \napproximately 3,000 male and female military veterans currently \nincarcerated, according to Dr. Mark L. Dembert, Chief of Psychiatry, \nBureau of Health Care Services, Pennsylvania\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nDepartment of Corrections. That number does not include those locked up \nin county jails.\n  The chief goal of the Veterans Court program is to direct veterans \nwho have been charged with a crime into an intensely monitored network \nof support coordinated by the VA and the courts. While Veterans Courts \nare voluntary, they will offer participating veterans a pathway to \nrehabilitation and reduced rates of recidivism. Following my February \n2010 hearing on veterans courts in Pittsburgh, I cosponsored \nlegislation, S. 902, the Services, Education, and Rehabilitation for \nVeterans Act, introduced by Senators Kerry and Murkowski, which would \nauthorize the Attorney General to award grants up to $25 million over 5 \nyears to assist States in the development of Veterans Courts.\n  Our freedom has been assured by the courageous service of our \nveterans. Our gratitude can best be shown by ensuring that their needs \nare met, whether medical, educational, professional or legal. I will \ncontinue to fight for treatment of our veterans worthy of the \nsacrifices they have made and dedication they have shown.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3284. A bill to designate a Distinguished Flying Cross National \nMemorial at the March Field Air Museum in Riverside, California; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, to introduce legislation to honor recipients of the \nDistinguished Flying Cross--the oldest military aviation award created \nby Congress.\n  This bill would designate the Distinguished Flying Cross National \nMemorial at March Field Air Museum in Riverside, California as the \nNational Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial. Companion legislation was \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Ken Calvert \nand recently passed by a vote of 410-0.\n  The Distinguished Flying Cross honors members of the armed forces who \nperform an act of ``heroism or extraordinary achievement while \nparticipating in an aerial flight.'' Since it was established by \nCongress in 1926, tens of thousands of brave Americans have been \nawarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, including Wilber and Orville \nWright, Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, former President George H. \nW. Bush, Senator John McCain, former Senator John Glenn, Chuck Yeager, \nGeneral Jimmy Doolittle, and Admiral Jim Stockdale.\n  More recently, it has been awarded to a number of American men and \nwomen serving our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am proud that so \nmany of the service members who have received the prestigious \nDistinguished Flying Cross are from my home State of California.\n  This legislation has the support of the Distinguished Flying Cross \nSociety, the Military Officers Association of America, the Air Force \nAssociation, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Association of \nNaval Aviation, the Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association, and the \nChina Burma Indian Veterans Association.\n  This is a fitting tribute to those who have served our country with \nhonor and distinction. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring \nthese brave service men and women by supporting this legislation, and I \nlook forward to seeing it enacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 3290. A bill to modify the purposes and operation of certain \nfacilities of the Bureau of Reclamation to implement the water rights \ncompact among the State of Montana, the Blackfeet Tribe of the \nBlackfeet Indian Reservation of Montana, and the United States, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Blackfeet \nWater Rights Settlement Act, along with my good friend, Senator Tester. \nWe introduce this bill as a critical step in 2 decades of negotiations \nbetween the Blackfeet Nation, the State of Montana, and the U.S. The \nbill ratifies the water rights compact with the Blackfeet Nation. It \nconfirms that the United States is a nation that honors its commitments \nto all its citizens, including those who belong to Tribal Nations.\n  Over 150 years ago, the United States and the Blackfeet people signed \na treaty that created the Blackfeet Reservation on a tract of land the \nsize of Delaware abutting what became Glacier National Park and the \nCanadian Border. Over 100 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \nsuch treaties imply a commitment to reserve sufficient water to satisfy \nboth present and future needs of a Tribe. Honoring this particular \ncommitment has been delayed for decades. With the introduction of this \nbill, we are on the brink of fulfilling that commitment.\n  The Blackfeet people call the mountains of their homeland the \n``backbone of the world.'' When you visit their land, you can feel a \nshiver in your own backbone at its beauty and spiritual significance. \nThese mountains are also the wellspring of the reservation's water. \nTheir cirques and flanks, frozen for much of the year, store the \ncrucial resource that makes the Great Plains inhabitable. The drainages \nand storage systems that define how the snow melts and the water flows \nare the principal subject of this legislation. This water is necessary \nfor irrigation, livestock, fisheries, wildlife, homes, and other uses.\n  By ratifying this compact, Congress will both establish the federal \nreserved water rights of the Tribe and authorize funds to construct the \ninfrastructure necessary to make the water available for use. This \ninfrastructure includes rehabilitation of the Blackfeet Irrigation \nProject and construction of other water projects. It also mitigates the \nimpacts of the Tribe's water rights on current non-tribal water users.\n  The Blackfeet Water Compact has already been ratified by the State of \nMontana. The Montana Legislature has appropriated $15 million toward \nthe overall Blackfeet settlement and has committed to provide an \nadditional $20 million in this bill.\n  The bill that Senator Tester and I have introduced addresses a vital \nconcern of the Blackfeet people and the State of Montana. It is time \nfor the U.S. to honor its commitment to the Blackfeet Nation.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Blackfeet \nWater Settlement Act of 2010 with my friend and colleague, Senator \nBaucus. The bill will ratify the water rights compact negotiated for \ntwo decades by the Blackfeet Tribe, State of Montana and U.S. It will \nimprove water infrastructure in the local area and, more importantly, \ncreate a self-sustaining homeland for the Blackfeet Nation. The bill \nenjoys broad support on the local, regional and national level. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to enact it this year.\n  The time to implement this legislation is now. The United States and \nBlackfeet Tribe created the Blackfeet Reservation by treaty over 150 \nyears ago. Over 100 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court held that in \ncreating Indian reservations, the government must provide enough water \nto sustain a permanent homeland for the American Indians living on \nthem. This legislation will fulfill that law.\n  By ratifying the compact, this bill provides water for domestic and \nmunicipal use, irrigation and livestock, and for developing Reservation \nresources. It will also provide water to sustain reservation wildlife \nand fisheries located in the majestic Rocky Mountains, next door to \nGlacier National Park. Enacting this bill not only establishes the \nTribe's federally reserved water rights, paper water, but also \nauthorizes resources to construct the infrastructure that will deliver \nwater to Reservation users, wet water.\n  The process of building critical infrastructure authorized by this \nbill will also create valuable reservation jobs, where the unemployment \nrate regularly reaches 70-80 percent. It authorizes funds to \nrehabilitate the Blackfeet Irrigation Project, construct water storage \nfacilities, repair community water systems and promote economic \ndevelopment.\n  The bill enjoys strong support in Montana. The State of Montana \nratified the Blackfeet Water Compact in 2009. The Montana Legislature \nhas already appropriated $15 million toward the overall Blackfeet \nsettlement. Most recently, the state supports provisions in this bill \nthat commit it to provide an additional $10 million.\n  This bill is long past due. As Justice Hugo Black said in the 1960 \nTuscarora\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\ncase: ``Great nations, like great men, should keep their word.'' It is \ntime for this great Nation to keep its word to the Blackfeet people. \nSenator Baucus and I introduce this bill to do just that. With adequate \nwater, infrastructure and jobs, the Blackfeet Nation will take another \nstep to a secure future for many years to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3291. A bill to establish Coltsville National Historical Park in \nthe State of Connecticut, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coltsville \nNational Historic Park Act, which provides for the designation of the \nColtsville Historic District in Hartford, Connecticut, as a national \npark. I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Lieberman, for \nsupporting this legislation, as well as my good friend, Congressman \nLarson, who recently introduced an identical version of this bill in \nthe House.\n  I recognize that when most of us think of national parks, we picture \nthe vast, sprawling landscapes of Yellowstone and Yosemite. Clearly, \nConnecticut's smaller size precludes it from having a national park on \nthe scale of these sites. In fact, Connecticut itself is only about \ntwice the size of Yellowstone National Park and currently has only one \nnational park, the Weir Farm National Historic Site, which spans 60 \nacres in the towns of Ridgefield and Wilton. But, while Connecticut may \nnot possess the physical grandeur of our nation's largest parks, it is \nhome to a rich national heritage that must be made accessible to every \nAmerican.\n  Located in Hartford's Sheldon-Charter Oak neighborhood, Coltsville \ngrew around Samuel Colt's firearms factory, a landmark red brick \nbuilding with a blue onion dome, during the Industrial Revolution of \nthe 19th century. Colt made Hartford the center of precision \nmanufacturing. While Americans may associate the name Sam Colt with \nfirearms, the Colt legacy goes far beyond. Colt was a key figure of the \nIndustrial Revolution, contributing to the development of waterproof \nammunition, underwater mines, and the telegraph. He was also the first \nAmerican manufacturer to open a plant overseas. Colt set the standard \nfor a nation that fast became known for its technological innovations \nand industrial productivity. It is also a little-known fact that after \nColt's death in 1862, his widow, Elizabeth Hart Jarvis Colt, \nsuccessfully managed Colt Industries for 42 years and presided over the \ncompany during its most prosperous years in a period when men dominated \nthe industrial world.\n  Today, the Colt armory remains a beacon in the Hartford skyline, and \nColtsville still boasts grand Victorian homes, including Armsmear, the \nhome of Sam and Elizabeth Colt. Other nearby attractions include old \nmill housing, the Church of the Good Shepherd, and the Colt Memorial. A \nnational park at Coltsville would be the main venue on a tour of \nHartford that could include sites such as the houses of Mark Twain and \nHarriet Beecher Stowe and the riverfront. It would also be a prime \ndestination for anyone taking an extended tour of historic and scenic \nNew England.\n  A national park at Coltsville would include more than 200 acres and \nbe comprised of both public and private space. The centerpiece would be \na museum within the armory celebrating Sam Colt and the growth of \nAmerican industry. The museum could hold the vast collection of Colt \nfirearms that currently rests in the Museum of Connecticut History as \nwell as other machinery and memorabilia from the Industrial Revolution. \nPrivate property which is currently located within the proposed \nboundaries of the park, such as artists' studios and condominiums, \ncould remain private. In fact, a museum and visitors' center in the \nColt armory itself would take up only part of the building, the rest of \nwhich could be left open for private development. The armory already \nhouses a business that manufactures replica Colt firearms, which would \nonly enhance the proposed museum.\n  In my capacity as Connecticut's senior Senator, I have fought hard \nalongside my colleagues in the State's Congressional delegation to help \nrealize the goal of including this testament to America's industrial \nand manufacturing prowess within the National Park System. In 2003, we \nwere successful in passing legislation that required the National Park \nService to conduct a study assessing the feasibility of designating \nColtsville as a national park. On July 22, 2008, Coltsville reached \nanother critical milestone in this effort when it was designated as a \nNational Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  Unfortunately, Coltsville has not been immune from the devastating \neffects of the global financial crisis that began later that year. \nWhile the Park Service's report, which was finally released last \nNovember, found that Coltsville is nationally significant and suitable \nfor inclusion in the Park System, its determination of feasibility \nlargely hinged on the ability of a private developer to manage the site \nin conjunction with the Park Service. Given the challenges currently \nfacing our Nation's economy, Coltsville has run into some difficulties \nwith this requirement. As a result, the Park Service was unable to \nconclude that Coltsville met the feasibility standards for inclusion in \nthe Park System.\n  That is why the legislation I introduced today with Senator Lieberman \nis so timely and important. The Coltsville National Historic Park Act \nauthorizes the establishment of a national park in Coltsville when the \nfeasibility issues outlined in the Park Service's November 2009 study, \nnamely those surrounding private management of the site, are resolved. \nOur bill also sets standards for administration of the park, and \ncreates a local advisory commission to develop and implement an \noverarching management plan for the park. This legislative approach is \nsupported by a variety of State and local stakeholders, and in my view, \nprovides us with a great opportunity to jump-start efforts to bring \nColtsville into compliance with Park Service feasibility standards.\n  I firmly believe that one of our most important obligations as \nSenators is to ensure that our Nation's vast array of natural treasures \nand historical landmarks are managed responsibly and preserved for the \nbenefit of future generations. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nextending these protections to the Coltsville Historic District.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 3292. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nto establish a weekend and holiday feeding program to provide \nnutritious food to at-risk school children on weekends and during \nextended school holidays during the school year; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation titled The Weekends Without Hunger Act. This legislation \nwill ensure that children who rely on free and reduced-price school \nmeals have access to nutritious meals on the weekends and during other \nperiods in which they are away from school.\n  Nearly 20 million school-age children, including more than one \nmillion in Pennsylvania, eat a free or reduced-price meal at school. \nExisting programs designed to ensure access to affordable meals for \nthese disadvantaged children at home are inadequate. A Department of \nAgriculture survey released in November 2009 reported that 49 million \nAmericans were unable to consistently get enough to eat during 2008; 17 \nmillion of them were children. A recently conducted survey by Drexel \nUniversity shows that the number of children under the age of 6 \nexperiencing very low food security has tripled since 2006.\n  The legislation I am introducing today addresses the food insecurity \nexperienced by our Nation's school children by providing them a weekend \nfeeding option. My legislation establishes a 5-year pilot program \nduring which time eligible institutions, such as schools and food \nbanks, may provide a free backpack of child-friendly, non-perishable \nfood for the weekend. It is my intention to seek inclusion of The \nWeekends Without Hunger Act in the upcoming reauthorization of the \nChild Nutrition Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Reid, Ms.\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\n        Snowe, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Collins, Mr. Casey, Mr. Risch, Mr. \n        Franken, and Mr. Johanns):\n  S. 3293. A bill to reauthorize the Special Olympics Sport and \nEmpowerment Act of 2004, to provide assistance to Best Buddies to \nsupport the expansion and development of mentoring programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor, today, to \nintroduce the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Act. I am very pleased that \nSenator Hatch has joined me in introducing this legislation, as well as \nSenator Dodd, who has been a long time supporter of the Best Buddies \nprogram. We are also joined by 8 other co-sponsors, both Republicans \nand Democrats, demonstrating the bipartisan support for this \nlegislation.\n  The Special Olympics program is respected around the world as a model \nand leader in using sport to end the isolation and stigmatization of \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities. For more than 40 years, \nSpecial Olympics has encouraged skill development, sharing, courage and \nconfidence through year-round sports training and athletic competition \nfor children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Through their \nprograms, Special Olympics has helped to ensure that millions of \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities are assured of equal \nopportunities for community participation, access to appropriate health \ncare, and inclusive education, and to experience life in a \nnondiscriminatory manner. Special Olympics gives athletes with \nintellectual disabilities the tools they need to be included in \nsociety, and it gives society the understanding and tools it needs to \ninclude them.\n  I can speak first-hand about what a rewarding experience it is for \nall of us who have been involved in Special Olympics. In 2006, my State \nof Iowa hosted the first USA National Summer Games. Thousands of \nathletes, volunteers, coaches, and families attended our Games, in \naddition to 30,000 fans and spectators. Ames, IA, was transformed into \nan Olympic Village, and it was thrilling to experience.\n  Similarly, the Best Buddies program is dedicated to ending the social \nisolation of people with intellectual disabilities by promoting peer \nsupport and friendships with their non-disabled peers. The aim is to \nincrease the self-esteem, confidence and abilities of people with and \nwithout intellectual disabilities. Equally important, the Best Buddies \nprogram has provided opportunities for integrated employment for \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities.\n  Research shows that participation in activities involving both people \nwith intellectual disabilities and people without disabilities results \nin more positive support for inclusion in society, including in \nschools.\n  This new bill is named in honor of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who \ndevoted her life to improving the lives of people with intellectual \ndisabilities around the world. Mrs. Shriver founded and fostered the \ndevelopment of Special Olympics and Best Buddies, both of which \ncelebrate the possibilities of a world where all people, including \nthose with disabilities, have meaningful opportunities for \nparticipation and inclusion.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the former Special Olympics Sports and \nEmpowerment Act and providing an authorization for the Best Buddies \nprogram, this bill will also allow the Department of Education to award \ncompetitive grants to support increased opportunities for inclusive \nparticipation by individuals with intellectual disabilities in sports \nand recreation programs.\n  I am pleased to be the chief sponsor of this legislation, which will \ncontinue our support for these important programs which promote the \nextraordinary gifts and contributions of people with intellectual \ndisabilities as well as broader community inclusion.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join with me, Senator Hatch, Senator \nDodd, Senator Casey, Senator Collins, Senator Franken, Senator Johanns, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Reid, Senator Risch, and Senator Snowe in \nsupporting this very worthy bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 508\n\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, \n     Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT), also referred \n     to as Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome, is a long-neglected \n     national health problem that affects approximately 70,000 (1 \n     in 5,000) people in the United States and 1,200,000 people \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas HHT is an autosomal dominant, uncommon complex \n     genetic blood vessel disorder, characterized by \n     telangiectases and artery-vein malformations that occurs in \n     major organs including the lungs, brain, and liver, as well \n     as the nasal mucosa, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and skin \n     of the face and hands;\n       Whereas left untreated, HHT can result in considerable \n     morbidity and mortality and lead to acute and chronic health \n     problems or sudden death;\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, 20 \n     percent of those with HHT, regardless of age, suffer death \n     and disability;\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, due \n     to widespread lack of knowledge of the disorder among medical \n     professionals, approximately 90 percent of the HHT population \n     has not yet been diagnosed and is at risk for death or \n     disability due to sudden rupture of the blood vessels in \n     major organs in the body;\n       Whereas the HHT Foundation International estimates that 20 \n     to 40 percent of complications and sudden death due to these \n     ``vascular time bombs'' are preventable;\n       Whereas patients with HHT frequently receive fragmented \n     care from practitioners who focus on 1 organ of the body, \n     having little knowledge about involvement in other organs or \n     the interrelation of the syndrome systemically;\n       Whereas HHT is associated with serious consequences if not \n     treated early, yet the condition is amenable to early \n     identification and diagnosis with suitable tests, and there \n     are acceptable treatments available in already-established \n     facilities such as the 8 HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence \n     in the United States; and\n       Whereas adequate Federal funding is needed for education, \n     outreach, and research to prevent death and disability, \n     improve outcomes, reduce costs, and increase the quality of \n     life for people living with HHT: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the need to pursue research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for HHT;\n       (2) recognizes and supports the HHT Foundation \n     International as the only advocacy organization in the United \n     States working to find a cure for HHT while saving the lives\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\n     and improving the well-being of individuals and families \n     affected by HHT through research, outreach, education, and \n     support;\n       (3) supports the designation of June 2010 as National \n     Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT) month, to \n     increase awareness of HHT;\n       (4) acknowledges the need to identify the approximately 90 \n     percent of the HHT population that has not yet been diagnosed \n     and is at risk for death or disability due to sudden rupture \n     of the blood vessels in major organs in the body;\n       (5) recognizes the importance of comprehensive care centers \n     in providing complete care and treatment for each patient \n     with HHT;\n       (6) recognizes that stroke, lung, and brain hemorrhages can \n     be prevented through early diagnosis, screening, and \n     treatment of HHT;\n       (7) recognizes severe hemorrhages in the nose and \n     gastrointestinal tract can be controlled through \n     intervention, and that heart failure can be managed through \n     proper diagnosis of HHT and treatments;\n       (8) recognizes that a leading medical and academic \n     institution estimated that $6,600,000,000 of 1-time health \n     care costs can be saved through aggressive management of HHT \n     in the at-risk population; and\n       (9) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe and support the month through \n     appropriate programs and activities that promote public \n     awareness of HHT and potential treatments for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2813-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 509--DESIGNATING APRIL 2010 AS ``NATIONAL STD \n                           AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BURRIS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 509\n\n       Whereas sexually transmitted infections (referred to in \n     this preamble as ``STIs'') (also commonly known as sexually \n     transmitted diseases, or ``STDs'') are a major public health \n     challenge for the United States in economic and human terms;\n       Whereas the United States has the highest rate of people \n     with STIs in the industrialized world, with an estimated \n     19,000,000 new cases occurring each year;\n       Whereas, each year, approximately \\1/2\\ of the new cases of \n     STIs occur in young people between the ages of 15 to 24;\n       Whereas all people of the United States have an interest in \n     STIs because every community is impacted and everyone pays \n     for the cost of the infections, either directly or \n     indirectly;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (referred to in this preamble as ``CDC''), STIs \n     impose a tremendous economic burden on the United States, \n     with direct medical costs for treating STIs as high as \n     $15,900,000 per year;\n       Whereas, in 2008, the CDC estimated that 1 in 4 young women \n     between the ages of 14 and 19 in the United States, or \n     3,200,000 teenage girls, and nearly 1 in 2 African-American \n     young women are infected with 1 or more of the most common \n     sexually transmitted infections, including the human \n     papillomavirus (referred to in this preamble as ``HPV''), \n     chlamydia, herpes simplex virus, and trichomoniasis;\n       Whereas, in 2010, CDC data indicated that 1 in 6 Americans \n     between the ages of 14 and 49 years old are infected with \n     type 2 of the herpes simplex virus, a lifelong and incurable \n     infection, and that of the group of infected Americans, \n     African-American women were the most affected group, with a \n     prevalence rate of 48 percent;\n       Whereas poverty and lack of access to quality health care \n     exacerbate the rate of infection with the human \n     immunodeficiency virus (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``HIV'') and other STIs;\n       Whereas men who have sex with men continue to be \n     disproportionately impacted by STIs, accounting for 63 \n     percent of all syphilis cases in 2008 as compared to only 4 \n     percent of STIs in 2000;\n       Whereas racial disparities in rates of STIs are among the \n     worst health disparities in the United States for any health \n     condition;\n       Whereas most STIs have been associated with increased risk \n     of HIV transmission and are likely contributing to the \n     ongoing HIV epidemic in the United States;\n       Whereas the CDC reports that the 2 most common STIs among \n     young women are HPV, with 18 percent infected, and chlamydia, \n     with 4 percent infected;\n       Whereas the long-term health effects of HPV and chlamydia \n     are especially severe for women and include infertility and \n     cervical cancer;\n       Whereas vaccination, screening, and early treatment can \n     prevent some of the most devastating effects of STIs;\n       Whereas high STI infection rates in the United States \n     demonstrate the need for better ways to reach the individuals \n     most at risk for infection;\n       Whereas the CDC recommends--\n       (1) annual chlamydia screenings for sexually active women \n     25 years of age and younger;\n       (2) HPV vaccination for girls and women between the ages of \n     11 and 26 who have not been vaccinated, or who have not \n     completed the full series of shots; and\n       (3) screening for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea \n     at least once a year for men who have sex with men and who \n     are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship;\n       Whereas chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, \n     chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and tubular pregnancies, \n     which can affect the health and well-being of a woman \n     throughout her lifetime;\n       Whereas STIs can be transmitted from infected mothers to \n     infants during childbirth and can cause severe health \n     consequences in the infants;\n       Whereas STIs often cause social stigma and may have a \n     serious psychological impact among the individuals who are \n     infected;\n       Whereas people protect themselves against STIs through \n     participation in programs that provide comprehensive and \n     medically accurate health information and screening and \n     treatment services, including title X of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.) and the STI prevention \n     program of the CDC;\n       Whereas school-based STI screening programs have been \n     highly successful in cases in which the programs are \n     implemented and are effective at preventing the spread of \n     STIs among adolescents;\n       Whereas the sexual and reproductive health needs of men \n     must be more thoroughly recognized and better addressed by \n     the public health and medical provider community in order to \n     more effectively combat the spread of STIs;\n       Whereas STI programs in State and local health departments \n     that are funded through the Division of STD Prevention of the \n     CDC are the frontline of the defense of the United States \n     against the spread of STIs;\n       Whereas STI screening, vaccination, and other prevention \n     strategies for sexually active women should be among the \n     highest public health priorities; and\n       Whereas the CDC observes April as ``National STD Awareness \n     Month'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2010 as ``National STD Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) encourages the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     and nonprofit organizations to observe the month with \n     appropriate programs and activities, with the goal of \n     increasing public knowledge of the risks of sexually \n     transmitted infections (referred to in this resolution as \n     ``STIs'') and protecting people of all ages;\n       (3) recognizes the human toll of STIs and the importance of \n     making the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of STIs an \n     urgent public health priority;\n       (4) calls on all people of the United States to learn about \n     STIs and the prevention approaches recommended for STIs; and\n       (5) encourages all sexually active individuals to get \n     tested for STIs and to seek appropriate care if infected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2813-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2813-S2814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 62--CONGRATULATING THE OUTSTANDING \n  PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC SERVANTS, BOTH PAST AND PRESENT, OF THE NATURAL \n RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Casey, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nBennet, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \nJohanns) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 62\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States is dependent on \n     productive soils along with abundant and high-quality water \n     and related natural resources;\n       Whereas the Natural Resources Conservation Service (in this \n     resolution referred to as ``NRCS'') was established as the \n     Soil Conservation Service in the Department of Agriculture in \n     1935 to assist farmers, ranchers, and other landowners in \n     protecting soil and water resources on private lands;\n       Whereas Hugh Hammond Bennett, the first Chief of the Soil \n     Conservation Service and the ``father of soil conservation'', \n     led the creation of the modern soil conservation movement \n     that established soil and water conservation as a national \n     priority;\n       Whereas the NRCS, with the assistance of President Franklin \n     D.

definitions.--For purposes of--\n       (i) subparagraphs (A) and (B)--\n\n       (I) the term ``insider'' has the same meaning as in section \n     101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code;\n       (II) a transfer is made when such transfer is so perfected \n     that a bona fide purchaser from the covered financial company \n     against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be \n     perfected cannot acquire an interest in the property \n     transferred that is superior to the interest in such property \n     of the transferee, but if such transfer is not so perfected \n     before the date on which the Corporation is appointed as \n     receiver for the covered financial company, such transfer is \n     made immediately before the date of such appointment; and\n       (III) the term ``value'' means property, or satisfaction or \n     securing of a present or antecedent debt of the covered \n     financial company, but does not include an unperformed \n     promise to furnish support to the covered financial company; \n     and\n\n       (ii) subparagraph (B)--\n\n       (I) the covered financial company is presumed to have been \n     insolvent on and during the 90-day period immediately \n     preceding the date of appointment of the Corporation as \n     receiver; and\n       (II) the term ``insolvent'' has the same meaning as in \n     section 101(32) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n       (12) Setoff.--\n       (A) Generally.--Except as otherwise provided in this title, \n     any right of a creditor to offset a mutual debt owed by the \n     creditor to any covered financial company that arose before \n     the Corporation was appointed as receiver for the covered \n     financial company against a claim of such creditor may be \n     asserted if enforceable under applicable noninsolvency law, \n     except to the extent that--\n       (i) the claim of the creditor against the covered financial \n     company is disallowed;\n       (ii) the claim was transferred, by an entity other than the \n     covered financial company, to the creditor--\n\n       (I) after the Corporation was appointed as receiver of the \n     covered financial company; or\n       (II)(aa) after the 90-day period preceding the date on \n     which the Corporation was appointed as receiver for the \n     covered financial company; and\n       (bb) while the covered financial company was insolvent \n     (except for a setoff in connection with a qualified financial \n     contract); or\n\n       (iii) the debt owed to the covered financial company was \n     incurred by the covered financial company--\n\n       (I) after the 90-day period preceding the date on which the \n     Corporation was appointed as receiver for the covered \n     financial company;\n       (II) while the covered financial company was insolvent; and\n       (III) for the purpose of obtaining a right of setoff \n     against the covered financial company (except for a setoff in \n     connection with a qualified financial contract).\n\n       (B) Insufficiency.--\n       (i) In general.--Except with respect to a setoff in \n     connection with a qualified financial contract, if a creditor \n     offsets a mutual debt owed to the covered financial company \n     against a claim of the covered financial company on or within \n     the 90-day period preceding the date on which the Corporation \n     is\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\n     appointed as receiver for the covered financial company, the \n     Corporation may recover from the creditor the amount so \n     offset, to the extent that any insufficiency on the date of \n     such setoff is less than the insufficiency on the later of--\n\n       (I) the date that is 90 days before the date on which the \n     Corporation is appointed as receiver for the covered \n     financial company; or\n       (II) the first day on which there is an insufficiency \n     during the 90-day period preceding the date on which the \n     Corporation is appointed as receiver for the covered \n     financial company.\n\n       (ii) Definition of insufficiency.--In this subparagraph, \n     the term ``insufficiency'' means the amount, if any, by which \n     a claim against the covered financial company exceeds a \n     mutual debt owed to the covered financial company by the \n     holder of such claim.\n       (C) Insolvency.--The term ``insolvent'' has the same \n     meaning as in section 101(32) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n       (D) Presumption of insolvency.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the covered financial company is presumed to have \n     been insolvent on and during the 90-day period preceding the \n     date of appointment of the Corporation as receiver.\n       (E) Limitation.--Nothing in this paragraph (12) shall be \n     the basis for any right of setoff where no such right exists \n     under applicable noninsolvency law.\n       (F) Priority claim.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     title, the Corporation as receiver for the covered financial \n     company may sell or transfer any assets free and clear of the \n     setoff rights of any party, except that such party shall be \n     entitled to a claim, subordinate to the claims payable under \n     subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subsection (b)(1), but \n     senior to all other unsecured liabilities defined in \n     subsection (b)(1)(D), in an amount equal to the value of such \n     setoff rights.\n       (13) Attachment of assets and other injunctive relief.--\n     Subject to paragraph (14), any court of competent \n     jurisdiction may, at the request of the Corporation as \n     receiver for a covered financial company, issue an order in \n     accordance with Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure, including an order placing the assets of any \n     person designated by the Corporation under the control of the \n     court and appointing a trustee to hold such assets.\n       (14) Standards.--\n       (A) Showing.--Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure shall apply with respect to any proceeding under \n     paragraph (13), without regard to the requirement that the \n     applicant show that the injury, loss, or damage is \n     irreparable and immediate.\n       (B) State proceeding.--If, in the case of any proceeding in \n     a State court, the court determines that rules of civil \n     procedure available under the laws of the State provide \n     substantially similar protections of the right of the parties \n     to due process as provided under Rule 65 (as modified with \n     respect to such proceeding by subparagraph (A)), the relief \n     sought by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph (14) may be \n     requested under the laws of such State.\n       (15) Treatment of claims arising from breach of contracts \n     executed by the corporation as receiver.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this title, any final and non-appealable \n     judgment for monetary damages entered against the Corporation \n     as receiver for a covered financial company for the breach of \n     an agreement executed or approved by the Corporation after \n     the date of its appointment shall be paid as an \n     administrative expense of the receiver. Nothing in this \n     paragraph shall be construed to limit the power of a receiver \n     to exercise any rights under contract or law, including to \n     terminate, breach, cancel, or otherwise discontinue such \n     agreement.\n       (16) Accounting and recordkeeping requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--The Corporation as receiver for a covered \n     financial company shall, consistent with the accounting and \n     reporting practices and procedures established by the \n     Corporation, maintain a full accounting of each receivership \n     or other disposition of any covered financial company.\n       (B) Annual accounting or report.--With respect to each \n     receivership to which the Corporation is appointed, the \n     Corporation shall make an annual accounting or report, as \n     appropriate, available to the Secretary and the Comptroller \n     General of the United States.\n       (C) Availability of reports.--Any report prepared pursuant \n     to subparagraph (B) and section 203(c)(3) shall be made \n     available to the public by the Corporation.\n       (D) Recordkeeping requirement.--\n       (i) In general.--The Corporation shall prescribe such \n     regulations and establish such retention schedules as are \n     necessary to maintain the documents and records of the \n     Corporation generated in exercising the authorities of this \n     title and the records of a covered financial company for \n     which the Corporation is appointed receiver, with due regard \n     for--\n\n       (I) the avoidance of duplicative record retention; and\n       (II) the expected evidentiary needs of the Corporation as \n     receiver for a covered financial company and the public \n     regarding the records of covered financial companies.\n\n       (ii) Retention of records.--Unless otherwise required by \n     applicable Federal law or court order, the Corporation may \n     not, at any time, destroy any records that are subject to \n     clause (i).\n       (iii) Records defined.--As used in this subparagraph, the \n     terms ``records'' and ``records of a covered financial \n     company'' mean any document, book, paper, map, photograph, \n     microfiche, microfilm, computer or electronically-created \n     record generated or maintained by the covered financial \n     company in the course of and necessary to its transaction of \n     business.\n       (b) Priority of Expenses and Unsecured Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--Unsecured claims against a covered \n     financial company, or the Corporation as receiver for such \n     covered financial company under this section, that are proven \n     to the satisfaction of the receiver shall have priority in \n     the following order:\n       (A) Administrative expenses of the receiver.\n       (B) Any amounts owed to the United States, unless the \n     United States agrees or consents otherwise.\n       (C) Any other general or senior liability of the covered \n     financial company (which is not a liability described under \n     subparagraph (D) or (E)).\n       (D) Any obligation subordinated to general creditors (which \n     is not an obligation described under subparagraph (E)).\n       (E) Any obligation to shareholders, members, general \n     partners, limited partners, or other persons, with interests \n     in the equity of the covered financial company arising as a \n     result of their status as shareholders, members, general \n     partners, limited partners, or other persons with interests \n     in the equity of the covered financial company.\n       (2) Post-receivership financing priority.--In the event \n     that the Corporation, as receiver for a covered financial \n     company, is unable to obtain unsecured credit for the covered \n     financial company from commercial sources, the Corporation as \n     receiver may obtain credit or incur debt on the part of the \n     covered financial company, which shall have priority over any \n     or all administrative expenses of the receiver under \n     paragraph (1)(A).\n       (3) Claims of the united states.--Unsecured claims of the \n     United States shall, at a minimum, have a higher priority \n     than liabilities of the covered financial company that count \n     as regulatory capital.\n       (4) Creditors similarly situated.--All claimants of a \n     covered financial company that are similarly situated under \n     paragraph (1) shall be treated in a similar manner, except \n     that the Corporation as receiver may take any action \n     (including making payments, subject to subsection \n     (o)(1)(E)(ii)) that does not comply with this subsection, \n     if--\n       (A) the Corporation determines that such action is \n     necessary--\n       (i) to maximize the value of the assets of the covered \n     financial company;\n       (ii) to maximize the present value return from the sale or \n     other disposition of the assets of the covered financial \n     company; or\n       (iii) to minimize the amount of any loss realized upon the \n     sale or other disposition of the assets of the covered \n     financial company; and\n       (B) all claimants that are similarly situated under \n     paragraph (1) receive not less than the amount provided in \n     paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (d).\n       (5) Secured claims unaffected.--This section shall not \n     affect secured claims or security entitlements in respect of \n     assets or property held by the covered financial company, \n     except to the extent that the security is insufficient to \n     satisfy the claim, and then only with regard to the \n     difference between the claim and the amount realized from the \n     security.\n       (6) Priority of expenses and unsecured claims in the \n     orderly liquidation of sipc member.--Where the Corporation is \n     appointed as receiver for a covered broker or dealer, \n     unsecured claims against such covered broker or dealer, or \n     the Corporation as receiver for such covered broker or dealer \n     under this section, that are proven to the satisfaction of \n     the receiver under section 205(e), shall have the priority \n     prescribed in paragraph (1), except that--\n       (A) SIPC shall be entitled to recover administrative \n     expenses incurred in performing its responsibilities under \n     section 205 on an equal basis with the Corporation, in \n     accordance with paragraph (1)(A);\n       (B) the Corporation shall be entitled to recover any \n     amounts paid to customers or to SIPC pursuant to section \n     205(f), in accordance with paragraph (1)(B);\n       (C) SIPC shall be entitled to recover any amounts paid out \n     of the SIPC Fund to meet its obligations under section 205 \n     and under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 \n     U.S.C. 78aaa et seq.), which claim shall be subordinate to \n     the claims payable under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of \n     paragraph (1), but senior to all other claims; and\n       (D) the Corporation may, after paying any proven claims to \n     customers under section 205 and the Securities Investor \n     Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq.), and as \n     provided above, pay dividends on other proven claims, in its \n     discretion, and to the extent that funds are available, in \n     accordance with the priorities set forth in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Provisions Relating to Contracts Entered Into Before \n     Appointment of Receiver.--\n       (1) Authority to repudiate contracts.--In addition to any \n     other rights that a receiver may have, the Corporation as \n     receiver for any covered financial company may disaffirm or \n     repudiate any contract or lease--\n       (A) to which the covered financial company is a party;\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\n       (B) the performance of which the Corporation as receiver, \n     in the discretion of the Corporation, determines to be \n     burdensome; and\n       (C) the disaffirmance or repudiation of which the \n     Corporation as receiver determines, in the discretion of the \n     Corporation, will promote the orderly administration of the \n     affairs of the covered financial company.\n       (2) Timing of repudiation.--The Corporation, as receiver \n     for any covered financial company, shall determine whether or \n     not to exercise the rights of repudiation under this section \n     within a reasonable period of time.\n       (3) Claims for damages for repudiation.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs (4), (5), \n     and (6) and in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of this \n     paragraph, the liability of the Corporation as receiver for a \n     covered financial company for the disaffirmance or \n     repudiation of any contract pursuant to paragraph (1) shall \n     be--\n       (i) limited to actual direct compensatory damages; and\n       (ii) determined as of--\n\n       (I) the date of the appointment of the Corporation as \n     receiver; or\n       (II) in the case of any contract or agreement referred to \n     in paragraph (8), the date of the disaffirmance or \n     repudiation of such contract or agreement.\n\n       (B) No liability for other damages.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (A), the term ``actual direct compensatory \n     damages'' does not include--\n       (i) punitive or exemplary damages;\n       (ii) damages for lost profits or opportunity; or\n       (iii) damages for pain and suffering.\n       (C) Measure of damages for repudiation of qualified \n     financial contracts.--In the case of any qualified financial \n     contract or agreement to which paragraph (8) applies, \n     compensatory damages shall be--\n       (i) deemed to include normal and reasonable costs of cover \n     or other reasonable measures of damages utilized in the \n     industries for such contract and agreement claims; and\n       (ii) paid in accordance with this paragraph and subsection \n     (d), except as otherwise specifically provided in this \n     subsection.\n       (D) Measure of damages for repudiation or disaffirmance of \n     debt obligation.--In the case of any debt for borrowed money \n     or evidenced by a security, actual direct compensatory \n     damages shall be no less than the amount lent plus accrued \n     interest plus any accreted original issue discount as of the \n     date the Corporation was appointed receiver of the covered \n     financial company and, to the extent that an allowed secured \n     claim is secured by property the value of which is greater \n     than the amount of such claim and any accrued interest \n     through the date of repudiation or disaffirmance, such \n     accrued interest pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (E) Measure of damages for repudiation or disaffirmance of \n     contingent obligation.--In the case of any contingent \n     obligation of a covered financial company consisting of any \n     obligation under a guarantee, letter of credit, loan \n     commitment, or similar credit obligation, the Corporation \n     may, by rule or regulation, prescribe that actual direct \n     compensatory damages shall be no less than the estimated \n     value of the claim as of the date the Corporation was \n     appointed receiver of the covered financial company, as such \n     value is measured based on the likelihood that such \n     contingent claim would become fixed and the probable \n     magnitude thereof.\n       (4) Leases under which the covered financial company is the \n     lessee.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Corporation as receiver disaffirms \n     or repudiates a lease under which the covered financial \n     company is the lessee, the receiver shall not be liable for \n     any damages (other than damages determined pursuant to \n     subparagraph (B)) for the disaffirmance or repudiation of \n     such lease.\n       (B) Payments of rent.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), \n     the lessor under a lease to which subparagraph (A) would \n     otherwise apply shall--\n       (i) be entitled to the contractual rent accruing before the \n     later of the date on which--\n\n       (I) the notice of disaffirmance or repudiation is mailed; \n     or\n       (II) the disaffirmance or repudiation becomes effective, \n     unless the lessor is in default or breach of the terms of

which the covered financial company is the \n     lessor.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Corporation as receiver for a \n     covered financial company repudiates an unexpired written \n     lease of real property of the covered financial company under \n     which the covered financial company is the lessor and the \n     lessee is not, as of the date of such repudiation, in \n     default, the lessee under such lease may either--\n       (i) treat the lease as terminated by such repudiation; or\n       (ii) remain in possession of the leasehold interest for the \n     balance of the term of the lease, unless the lessee defaults \n     under the terms of the lease after the date of such \n     repudiation.\n       (B) Provisions applicable to lessee remaining in \n     possession.--If any lessee under a lease described in \n     subparagraph (A) remains in possession of a leasehold \n     interest pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (A)--\n       (i) the lessee--\n\n       (I) shall continue to pay the contractual rent pursuant to \n     the terms of the lease after the date of the repudiation of \n     such lease; and\n       (II) may offset against any rent payment which accrues \n     after the date of the repudiation of the lease, any damages \n     which accrue after such date due to the nonperformance of any \n     obligation of the covered financial company under the lease \n     after such date; and\n\n       (ii) the Corporation as receiver shall not be liable to the \n     lessee for any damages arising after such date as a result of \n     the repudiation, other than the amount of any offset allowed \n     under clause (i)(II).\n       (6) Contracts for the sale of real property.--\n       (A) In general.--If the receiver repudiates any contract \n     (which meets the requirements of subsection (a)(6)) for the \n     sale of real property, and the purchaser of such real \n     property under such contract is in possession and is not, as \n     of the date of such repudiation, in default, such purchaser \n     may either--\n       (i) treat the contract as terminated by such repudiation; \n     or\n       (ii) remain in possession of such real property.\n       (B) Provisions applicable to purchaser remaining in \n     possession.--If any purchaser of real property under any \n     contract described

of \n     any contract for services between any person and any covered \n     financial company for which the Corporation has been \n     appointed receiver, any claim of such person for services \n

which the \n     receiver was appointed.\n       (B) Services performed after appointment and prior to \n     repudiation.--If, in the case of any contract for services \n     described in subparagraph (A), the Corporation as receiver \n     accepts performance by the other person before making any \n     determination to exercise the right of repudiation of such \n     contract under this section--\n       (i) the other party shall be paid under the terms of the \n     contract for the services performed; and\n       (ii) the amount of such payment shall be treated as an \n

to in subparagraph (B) in connection \n     with a contract described in subparagraph (B) shall not \n     affect the right of the Corporation as receiver to repudiate \n     such contract under this

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The proper functioning of the financial markets is \n     dependent upon safe and efficient arrangements for the \n     clearing and settlement of payment, securities, and other \n     financial transactions.\n       (2) Financial market utilities that conduct or support \n     multilateral payment, clearing, or settlement activities may \n     reduce risks for their participants and the broader financial \n     system, but such utilities may also concentrate and create \n     new risks and thus must be well designed and operated in a \n     safe and sound manner.\n       (3) Payment, clearing, and settlement activities conducted \n     by financial institutions also present important risks to the \n     participating financial institutions and to the financial \n     system.\n       (4) Enhancements to the regulation and supervision of \n     systemically important financial market utilities and the \n     conduct of systemically important payment, clearing, and \n     settlement activities by financial institutions are \n     necessary--\n       (A) to provide consistency;\n       (B) to promote robust risk management and safety and \n     soundness;\n       (C) to reduce systemic risks; and\n       (D) to support the stability of the broader financial \n     system.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to mitigate \n     systemic risk in the financial system and promote financial \n     stability by--\n       (1) authorizing the Board of Governors to prescribe uniform \n     standards for the--\n       (A) management of risks by systemically important financial \n     market utilities; and\n       (B) conduct of systemically important payment, clearing, \n     and settlement activities by financial institutions;\n       (2) providing the Board of Governors an enhanced role in \n     the supervision of risk management standards for systemically \n     important financial market utilities;\n       (3) strengthening the liquidity of systemically important \n     financial market utilities; and\n       (4) providing the Board of Governors an enhanced role in \n     the supervision of risk management standards for systemically \n     important payment, clearing, and settlement activities by \n     financial institutions.\n\n     SEC. 803.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Because of the systemic importance of credit ratings \n     and the reliance placed on credit ratings by individual and \n     institutional investors and financial regulators, the \n     activities and performances of credit rating agencies, \n     including nationally recognized statistical rating \n     organizations, are matters of national public interest, as \n     credit rating agencies are central to capital formation, \n     investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the \n     United States economy.\n       (2) Credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized \n     statistical rating organizations, play a critical \n     ``gatekeeper'' role in the debt market that is functionally \n     similar to that of securities analysts, who evaluate the \n     quality of securities in the equity market, and auditors, who \n     review the financial statements of firms. Such role justifies \n     a similar level of public oversight and accountability.\n       (3) Because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and \n     analytical services on behalf of clients, much as other \n     financial ``gatekeepers'' do, the activities of credit rating \n     agencies are fundamentally commercial in character and should \n     be subject to the same standards of liability and oversight \n     as apply to auditors, securities analysts, and investment \n     bankers.\n       (4) In certain activities, particularly in advising \n     arrangers of structured financial products on potential \n     ratings of such products, credit rating agencies face \n     conflicts of interest that need to be carefully monitored and \n     that therefore should be addressed explicitly in legislation \n     in order to give clearer authority to the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission.\n       (5) In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on \n     structured financial products have proven to be inaccurate. \n     This inaccuracy contributed significantly to the \n     mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and \n     investors, which in turn adversely impacted the health of the \n     economy in the United States and around the world. Such \n     inaccuracy necessitates increased accountability on the part \n     of credit rating agencies.\n\n     SEC. 932. ENHANCED REGULATION, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND \n                   TRANSPARENCY OF NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED \n                   STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Section 15E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \n     U.S.C. 78o-7) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) in the second sentence, by inserting ``any other \n     provision of this section, or'' after ``Notwithstanding'';

An \n     objection may properly be made, received, and entered upon \n     the record when it is claimed that such person is entitled to \n     refuse to answer the question on grounds of any \n     constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including \n     the privilege against self-incrimination, but such person \n     shall not otherwise object to or refuse to answer any \n     question, and such person or attorney shall not otherwise \n     interrupt the oral examination.\n       (iv) Refusal to answer.--If a person described in clause \n     (i) refuses to answer any

(II) on grounds of the privilege against self-\n     incrimination, the testimony of such person may be compelled \n     in accordance with the provisions of section 6004 of title \n     18, United States Code.\n\n       (E) Transcripts.--For purposes of this subsection--\n       (i) after the testimony of any witness is fully \n     transcribed, the Bureau investigator shall afford the witness \n     (who may be accompanied by an attorney) a reasonable \n     opportunity to examine the transcript;\n       (ii) the transcript shall be read to or by the witness, \n     unless such examination

writing waives the signing, is ill, cannot be \n     found, or refuses to sign; and\n       (v) if the transcript is not signed by the witness during \n     the 30-day period following the date on which the witness is \n     first afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine the \n     transcript, the Bureau investigator shall sign the transcript \n     and state on the record the fact of the

limit such witness to \n     inspection of the official transcript of his testimony.\n       (H) Witness fees.--Any witness appearing for the taking of \n     oral testimony pursuant to a civil investigative demand shall \n     be entitled to the same fees and mileage which are paid to \n     witnesses in the district courts of the United States.\n       (d) Confidential Treatment of Demand

as confidential.\n       (e) Petition for Enforcement.--\n       (1) In general.--Whenever any person fails to comply with \n     any civil investigative demand duly served upon him under \n     this section, or whenever satisfactory copying or \n     reproduction of material requested pursuant to the demand \n     cannot be accomplished and such person refuses to surrender \n     such material, the Bureau, through such officers or attorneys \n     as it may designate, may file, in the district court of the \n     United States for any judicial district in which such person \n     resides, is

service, by any Bureau investigator named in \n     the demand, such person may file with the Bureau a petition \n     for an order by the Bureau modifying or setting aside the \n     demand.\n       (2) Compliance during pendency.--The time permitted for \n     compliance with the demand in whole or in part, as determined \n     proper and ordered by the Bureau, shall not run during the \n

Specific grounds.--A petition under paragraph (1) shall \n     specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in \n     seeking relief, and may be based upon any failure of the \n     demand to comply with the provisions of this section, or upon \n     any constitutional or other legal right or privilege of such \n     person.\n       (g) Custodial Control.--At any time during which any \n     custodian is in custody or control of any documentary \n     material, tangible things, reports, answers to questions, or \n     transcripts of oral testimony given by any person in \n

Such order may, by \n     provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the \n     covered person or service provider to cease and desist from \n     the subject activity, and to take affirmative action to \n     correct the conditions resulting from any such violation.\n       (2) Effectiveness of order.--A cease-and-desist order shall \n     become effective at the expiration of 30 days after the date \n     of service of an order under paragraph (1) upon the covered \n     person or service provider concerned (except in the case of a \n     cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall \n     become effective at the time specified therein), and shall \n     remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except \n     to such extent as the order is stayed, modified, terminated, \n     or set aside by action of the Bureau or a reviewing court.\n       (3) Decision and appeal.--Any hearing provided for in this \n     subsection shall be held in the Federal judicial district or \n     in the territory in which the residence or principal office \n     or place of business of the person is located unless the \n     person consents to another place, and shall be conducted in \n     accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5 of the \n     United States Code. After such hearing, and within 90 days \n     after the Bureau has notified the parties that the case has \n     been submitted to the Bureau for final decision, the Bureau \n     shall render its decision (which shall include findings of \n     fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue \n     and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or \n     orders consistent with the provisions of this section. \n     Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as \n     provided in this subsection. Unless a petition for review is \n     timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as \n     provided in paragraph (4), and thereafter until the record in \n     the proceeding has been filed as provided in paragraph (4), \n     the Bureau may at any time, upon such notice and in such \n     manner as the Bureau shall determine proper, modify, \n     terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon filing of the \n     record as provided, the Bureau may modify, terminate, or set \n     aside any such order with permission of the court.\n       (4) Appeal to court of appeals.--Any party to any \n     proceeding under this subsection may obtain a review of any \n     order served pursuant to this subsection (other than an order \n     issued with the consent of the person concerned) by the \n     filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the \n     circuit in which the principal office of the covered person \n     is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, within 30 days after the date \n     of service of such order, a written petition praying that the \n     order of the Bureau be modified, terminated, or set aside. A \n     copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the \n     clerk of the court to the Bureau, and thereupon the Bureau \n     shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as \n     provided in section 2112 of title 28 of the United States \n     Code. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have \n     jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall \n     except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (3) be \n     exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in \n     whole or in part, the order of the Bureau. Review of such \n     proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5 \n     of the United States Code. The judgment and decree of the \n     court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject \n     to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon \n     certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28 of the \n     United States Code.\n       (5) No stay.--The commencement of proceedings for judicial \n     review under paragraph\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\n     (4) shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, \n     operate as a stay of any order issued by the Bureau.\n       (c) Special Rules for Temporary Cease-and-desist \n     Proceedings.--\n       (1) In general.--Whenever the Bureau determines that the \n     violation specified in the notice of charges served upon a \n     person, including a service provider, pursuant to subsection \n     (b), or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause the \n     person to be insolvent or otherwise prejudice the interests \n     of consumers before the completion of the proceedings \n     conducted pursuant to subsection (b), the Bureau may issue a \n     temporary order requiring the person to cease and desist from \n     any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action \n     to prevent or remedy such insolvency or other condition \n     pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may \n     include any requirement authorized under this subtitle. Such \n     order shall become effective upon service upon the person \n     and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in \n     proceedings authorized by paragraph (2), shall remain \n     effective and enforceable pending the completion of the \n     administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until \n     such time as the Bureau shall dismiss the charges specified \n     in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued \n     against the person, until the effective date of such order.\n       (2) Appeal.--Not later than 10 days after the covered \n     person or service provider concerned has been served with a \n     temporary cease-and-desist order, the person may apply to the \n     United States district court for the judicial district in \n     which the residence or principal office or place of business \n     of the person is located, or the United States District Court \n     for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting \n     aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or \n     effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the \n     administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges \n     served upon the person under subsection (b), and such court \n     shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.\n       (3) Incomplete or inaccurate records.--\n       (A) Temporary order.--If a notice of charges served under \n     subsection (b) specifies, on the basis of particular facts \n     and circumstances, that the books and records of a covered \n     person or service provider are so incomplete or inaccurate \n     that the Bureau is unable to determine the financial \n     condition of that person or the details or purpose of any \n     transaction or transactions that may have a material effect \n     on the financial condition of that person, the Bureau may \n     issue a temporary order requiring--\n       (i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave \n     rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or \n     inaccurate state of the books or records; or\n       (ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to \n     a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the \n     proceedings under subsection (b)(1).\n       (B) Effective period.--Any temporary order issued under \n     subparagraph (A)--\n       (i) shall become effective upon service; and\n       (ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in \n     proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and \n     enforceable until the earlier of--\n\n       (I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under \n     subsection (b) in connection with the notice of charges; or\n       (II) the date the Bureau determines, by examination or \n     otherwise, that the books and records of the covered person \n     or service provider are accurate and reflect the financial \n     condition thereof.\n\n       (d) Special Rules for Enforcement of Orders.--\n       (1) In general.--The Bureau may in its discretion apply to \n     the United States district court within the jurisdiction of \n     which the principal office or place of business of the person \n     is located, for the enforcement of any effective and \n     outstanding notice or order issued under this section, and \n     such court shall have jurisdiction and power to order and \n     require compliance herewith.\n       (2) Exception.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by \n     injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any \n     notice or order or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or \n     set aside any such notice or order.\n       (e) Rules.--The Bureau shall prescribe rules establishing \n     such procedures as may be necessary to carry out this \n     section.\n\n     SEC. 1054.

The court shall have jurisdiction to grant all \n     relief necessary to make the employee whole, including \n     injunctive relief and compensatory damages, including--\n\n       (I) reinstatement with the same seniority status that the \n     employee would have had, but for the discharge or \n     discrimination;\n       (II) the amount of back pay, with interest; and\n       (III) compensation for any special damages sustained as a \n     result of the discharge or discrimination, including \n     litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable \n     attorney fees.\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\n       (E) Other appeals.--Unless the complainant brings an action \n     under subparagraph (D), any person adversely affected or \n     aggrieved by a final order issued under subparagraph (A) may \n     file a petition for review of the order in the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation with \n     respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred or \n     the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of \n     such violation, not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     issuance of the final order of the Secretary of Labor under \n     subparagraph (A). Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title \n     5, United States Code.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration \nof H.R. 3714 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3714) to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 to include in the Annual Country Reports on Human Rights \n     and Practices information about freedom of the press in \n     foreign countries, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senate for enacting the \nDaniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act, H.R. 3714, a bill to strengthen \nand protect press freedoms around the world. I am proud to cosponsor \nthe Senate companion to this bill, S. 1739.\n  I congratulate and commend my good friend, Senator Dodd, for his \nleadership on this bill and for his longstanding commitment to freedom \nof the press. I have worked closely with Senator Dodd for many years on \nlegislation to establish a Federal shield law for journalists, and I am \npleased that the Judiciary Committee recently reported Federal shield \nlegislation. I also commend Representative Adam Schiff for championing \nthis important legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act will amend the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 to require the Secretary of State to include \ninformation about freedom of the press practices in other countries in \nthe Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. The bill will \nalso require that this report identify countries in which there are \nviolations of freedom of the press, such as physical attacks on \njournalists, imprisonment, and censorship by foreign governments.\n  The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that more journalists \nhave been killed around the world in 2009 than in any other year since \nthat organization first started tracking this data in 1981. This \ntroubling report demonstrates that the press freedoms that we often \ntake for granted at home are in danger of being snuffed out in many \nother parts of the world. I believe that this bill will help to reverse \nthis trend and to signal to the world community that the United States \nis committed to ensuring freedom of the press at home and abroad.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote in a letter to fellow Founding Father \nJohn Adams that ``[t]he light which has been shed on mankind by the art \nof printing has eminently changed the condition of the world . . . And \nwhile printing is preserved, it can no more recede than the sun return \non his course.'' Although these words were written almost two centuries \nago, the critical role of a free and vibrant press is no less \nsignificant today. Again, I congratulate the lead sponsors of this \nimportant legislation for their commitment to freedom of the press. I \nurge the President to promptly sign this important legislation into \nlaw.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate, and that any statements relating to \nthe measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3714) was ordered to be read a third time, was read \nthe third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2981-5", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2981-S2982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AUTHORIZING USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 62, \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 62) congratulating \n     the outstanding professional public servants, both past and \n     present, of the Natural Resources Conservation Service on the \n     occasion of its 75th anniversary.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering a \nresolution recognizing the 75th Anniversary of the Natural Resources \nConservation Service, known as NRCS.\n  Congress established the Soil Conservation Service, the predecessor \nto NRCS, in April of 1935. Since that time, the agency has aided \nlandowners in implementing conservation measures to protect and enhance \nour Nation's natural resources. Meanwhile, American farmers and \nranchers have become the most productive of any on Earth--ensuring a \nsafe, diverse, and nutritious food supply for their fellow citizens and \nmany of the world's citizens.\n  Today, NRCS administers more than 20 conservation programs that \nprovide technical and financial assistance to landowners. These \nprograms improve soil and water quality, increase energy efficiency, \nenhance agricultural practices, and retire marginal lands to create and \nprotect wildlife habitat. NRCS has directly contributed to the \nprotection or establishment of 160 million acres of wildlife habitat \nand to the preservation, restoration, or enhancement of 9 million acres \nof wetlands.\n  We have seen real progress over the past 75 years, but I would argue \nprivate lands conservation is more important in 2010 than ever before, \nas we confront challenges such as climate change and loss of open \nspace, and explore opportunities for creating wealth in rural \ncommunities through renewable energy production and water quality and \ncarbon credit trading.\n  Properly managed working lands generate environmental benefits we all \nenjoy, such as clean air, water made clean by filtering through forests \nand fields, high-quality soils that capture carbon and make life \npossible, and wildlife habitat that promotes biodiversity and offers \nrecreational opportunities such as fishing and hunting. With 70 percent \nof U.S. lands in private hands, the continuation of successful farm \nbill conservation programs--along with other technical assistance \nefforts--should be of interest to all of us.\n  NRCS programs provide important public benefits while working with \nlandowners on a voluntary basis. This unique approach is aided by the \nagency's presence in every county of every State. Agency employees in \nevery office work toward the common goal of conserving natural \nresources for the benefit of the landowner and all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution recognizing \nthe NRCS's 75 years of service.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate, and any statements relating to the measure be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 62) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 62\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States is dependent on \n     productive soils along with abundant and high-quality water \n     and related natural resources;\n       Whereas the Natural Resources Conservation Service (in this \n     resolution referred to as ``NRCS'') was established as the \n     Soil Conservation Service in the Department of Agriculture in \n     1935 to assist farmers, ranchers, and other landowners in \n     protecting soil and water resources on private lands;\n       Whereas Hugh Hammond Bennett, the first Chief of the Soil \n     Conservation Service and the ``father of soil conservation'', \n     led the creation of the modern soil conservation movement \n     that established soil and water conservation as a national \n     priority;\n       Whereas the NRCS, with the assistance of President Franklin \n     D. Roosevelt, State governments, and local partners, \n     developed a new mechanism of American conservation service \n     delivery, which brings together private individuals with \n     Federal, State, and local governments to achieve common \n     conservation objectives;\n       Whereas the NRCS provides a vital public service by \n     supplying technical expertise and financial assistance to \n     cooperating private landowners for the conservation of soil \n     and water resources;\n       Whereas the NRCS, as authorized by Congress, has developed \n     and provided land conservation programs that have resulted in \n     the restoration and preservation of millions of acres of \n     wetlands, forests, and grasslands that provide innumerable \n     benefits to the general public in the form of recreational \n     opportunities, wildlife habitat, water quality, and reduced \n     soil erosion;\n       Whereas the NRCS is the world leader in soil science and \n     soil surveying;\n       Whereas the NRCS is the national leader in the inventory of \n     natural resources on private lands, providing national \n     leaders and the public with the status and trends related to \n     these resources and helping forecast the availability of \n     critical water supplies;\n       Whereas the NRCS has helped communities develop and \n     implement thousands of locally led projects that continue to \n     provide flood control, soil conservation, water supply, and \n     recreational benefits to all Americans, while providing \n     business and job creation opportunities as well;\n       Whereas, since its establishment, the NRCS has developed, \n     tested, and demonstrated conservation practices, helped \n     develop the science and art of conservation, and continues to \n     strive toward innovation;\n       Whereas the NRCS encourages and works with landowners and \n     land users to adopt conservation practices and technologies \n     in a voluntary manner to address natural resource concerns;\n       Whereas NRCS employees serve in offices in every State and \n     territory, while other employees assist other countries and \n     governments;\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\n       Whereas, while some NRCS employees work directly with \n     landowners, other employees serve in support of NRCS field \n     operations, but all work toward a common goal of improving \n     the condition of all natural resources found on private \n     lands, knowing when they succeed, all Americans benefit; and\n       Whereas the NRCS has been ``helping people, help the land'' \n     for 75 years: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) congratulates the outstanding conservation \n     professionals of the Natural Resources Conservation Service \n     on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service;\n       (2) recognizes the vital role conservation plays in the \n     well-being of the United States;\n       (3) expresses its continued commitment to the conservation \n     of natural resources on private lands in both the national \n     interest and as a national priority; and\n       (4) recognizes the services that the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service provides to the United States by helping \n     farmers, ranchers, and other landowners to protect soil, \n     water, and related natural resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2983-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Res. 507) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 507\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``el Dia de los \n     Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'', on April 30, in \n     recognition and celebration of the future of the nations--\n     their children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States and are the center of families in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     spirit of the United States;\n       Whereas according to the latest Census report, there are \n     more than 47,000,000 individuals of Hispanic descent living \n     in the United States, nearly 16,000,000 of whom are children;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on el Dia de los Ninos, \n     and wish to share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and people in the \n     United States rely on children to pass on these family \n     values, morals, and culture to future generations;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and that encourage children to explore and \n     develop confidence;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm for the people of the \n     United States the\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\n     significance of family, education, and community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     aspirations, and to find comfort and security in the support \n     of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the Nation to declare April 30 as ``el Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans'', a day to bring together \n     Hispanics and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children; and\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its people, and people should be encouraged to celebrate \n     the gifts of children to society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 2010, as ``el Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with \n     all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, \n     cities, and States across the Nation to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies, including activities that--\n       (A) center around children, and are free or minimal in cost \n     so as to encourage and facilitate the participation of all \n     our people;\n       (B) are positive and uplifting and that help children \n     express their hopes and dreams;\n       (C) provide opportunities for children of all backgrounds \n     to learn about one another's cultures and to share ideas;\n       (D) include all members of the family, especially extended \n     and elderly family members, so as to promote greater \n     communication among the generations within a family, enabling \n     children to appreciate and benefit from the experiences and \n     wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (E) provide opportunities for families within a community \n     to get acquainted; and\n       (F) provide children with the support they need to develop \n     skills and confidence, and to find the inner strength and the \n     will and fire of the human spirit to make their dreams come \n     true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/29/senate-section/article/S2984-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 2010\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
