Mr. President, I was so proud to have my pastor and \nvery good friend deliver the opening prayer. Father McCormick and I \nhave known each other since 1983, when he first came to our parish \nchurch of St. James in Orlando. He is a product of Dublin, Ireland, but \nhe became a proud citizen in 1973, much as I did in 1971. He has not \nonly been a tremendous source of faith and inspiration to me and my \nfamily and, more importantly, perhaps, my children, but he has also \nbeen a tremendous advocate for the poor and needy in our community. He \ndoes tremendous work overseas as well in a program called Food for the \nPoor where the Caribbean nations and Latin America have benefited \ngreatly from his generosity and hard work.\n  There are a couple of things I must point out. He has also developed \na love for American football since coming here. But not being perfect, \nhe has chosen the Cowboys over the Redskins. And then in a further \nimperfection that may be less forgivable, he has chosen the Gators over \nthe Seminoles in Florida. I frequently have been a patient listener as \nhe, on Sunday mornings, regales about the Gators and beats up on the \nSeminoles. Today is my day for revenge. I am awfully proud to have him \nhere. He is a wonderful friend. I know he has looked forward to this \nday.\n  I thank the Chair for the courtesy of allowing me to say a couple \nwords about my dear friend and pastor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we join the Senator from Florida in \nwelcoming his pastor this morning. I am pleased to see that he will be \nforgiven for his sin of advocating the success of the Cowboys and the \nGators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2780-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS--H.R. 1105\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Grassley, the \nranking Republican on the Finance Committee, I ask unanimous consent \nthat when the Senate resumes consideration of H.R. 1105, the omnibus \nbill, the pending amendments be set aside and, on behalf of Senator \nGrassley, it be in order to call up amendment No. 628, which strikes \nsection 102 related to IRS private debt collection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a topical issue. From news accounts \nthis morning, I heard it mentioned a couple of times. I will be happy \nto work with Senator Grassley, see how we work through these \namendments. I think it is something we could do. I know he would agree \nto a reasonable time period. We will see what we can do to work that \nout. For this time, I object, but I hope we can work something out.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Sessions, I ask \nunanimous consent to take up amendment No. 604, which relates to a 5-\nyear reauthorization of the E-Verify Program.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not as familiar with that as Senator \nSessions. I know he has talked about that on a number of occasions. I \nwill be happy to have my staff look at this, and hopefully we can work \nour way through the amendments we have. I know Senator Sessions feels \nstrongly about this. I hope we can work out something and have him come \nand present this amendment. But for this morning, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, last evening President Obama had invited \nthe chairs and ranking members of committees in both the House and \nSenate to the White House for dinner. I wanted to mention that the \nopportunity for Republicans and Democrats, both chairs and ranking \nmembers of committees, to spend some time with the President was very \nimportant, a very important signal by the President to the Congress \nthat he wants to work with everybody. He didn't give a speech. He and \nhis wife, the First Lady, welcomed the Members of Congress. I was \npleased to be there. My point is, this President is trying to reach out \nand change the culture, which is so important.\n  This afternoon, I have been invited by the President to join a number \nof my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to go to the White House \nfor a health care summit. Once again, the President is reaching out to \nsee if there are ways for Republicans and Democrats, who work for the \nsame masters--that is, American interests and the American people--to \ncome together and find ways to reach significant policy goals. Do we \nhave a need to address our health care problems? Absolutely. We spend \nmuch more than any other group of people on the face of the Earth on \nhealth care. Our costs are much greater than anyone else's, yet the \noutcomes are not. We rank 41st in life expectancy despite the fact that \nwe spend far more than anyone else in the world on health care. Health \ncare costs are accelerating. They are injuring businesses paying for \nhealth care insurance for employees. Health care costs are strangling \nfamily budgets. Health care costs are hurting Government, which has to \npay for Medicare and Medicaid.\n  We have to get a handle on it.\n  The President is saying: Let's try to find a sensible, thoughtful way \nto reform health care. A good start is to invite a group of Republicans \nand Democrats from the Congress, a group of people from the private \nsector, from the health care industry, from the consumer side, \nsupporters and opponents of various kinds of reforms and changes, to a \nsummit at the White House to say: Let's talk. Let's try to figure out \nhow we address these issues.\n  I commend the President because we have to change the culture. This \ncannot possibly continue to be an ``us versus them'' Congress or a \nCongress and Presidency that is deeply divided.\n  This country faces very serious challenges. The fact is, we have to \nwork together to solve them. The very serious financial challenge, the \ncrisis we face, is going to require the best energies all of us have \nand the best ideas of all of us. Included in the financial crisis is \nwhat health care costs are doing to the economy. That is why the \nPresident has indicated that one of the first issues we have to tackle, \neven as we try to stabilize the economy, is to address the issue of the \nburgeoning cost of health care. So I commend the President, and I look \nforward to the meeting today at the White House. I think it will be a \ngood start to at least begin discussing health care costs.\n\n  I want to talk about one piece of health care costs because yesterday \nSenator Snowe from Maine, myself, Senator McCain from Arizona, my \ncolleague Senator Stabenow from Michigan--we announced, on behalf of 25 \nSenators, a piece of legislation we introduced yesterday dealing with \nprescription drug costs. One of the fastest rising items of health care \ncosts is the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Now, we have introduced this legislation before, and it has \nsuccessfully\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\nbeen blocked. But things have changed in a very dramatic way. The \nmakeup of the Senate has changed. One of the people who cosponsored our \nlegislation in the last session of the Congress is now sitting in the \nWhite House--then Senator Barack Obama, now President Obama. He was a \ncosponsor. The Chief of Staff at the White House, Rahm Emanuel, was one \nof the key sponsors in the House. So the fact is, we think we have an \nopportunity to pass legislation that will put some downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices. This is bipartisan and nonpartisan. This \nstretches from John McCain to President Obama. Both Presidential \ncandidates were cosponsors in the last session of Congress of this \nidentical piece of legislation. Many other Republicans and Democrats \nhave joined us, so that as we introduced it, there are 25 original \ncosponsors.\n  Now, let me describe the problem we face in this country. By consent, \nI wish to show two bottles that did contain medicine. These are bottles \nof Lipitor. Lipitor, by the way, is a drug that I think probably is the \nmost prescribed drug in this country, or at least one of the top \nprescribed drugs in this country. It is a cholesterol-lowering drug. \nLipitor is made in Ireland and then shipped around the world.\n  Here is the way Lipitor is shipped in these bottles: same size, same \ncap; the only difference is, one is blue, one is red; the same pill put \nin the same bottle, made by the same company, FDA inspected. This red \none goes to the United States. This blue one goes to Canada. The \ndifference? This red one costs twice as much.\n  The U.S. consumer is told: You pay more than twice as much for the \nsame prescription drug. Why? By what justification should not just \nLipitor but other medicines be priced in a manner that says to the \nAmerican consumer: You pay much more than we are asking others around \nthe world to pay for the identical prescription drug? There is no \njustification.\n  Zocor, here is an example of a cholesterol-lowering drug. The United \nStates and Canada--$5.16 for a 20-milligram pill in the United States; \n$2.45 in Canada.\n  Let me describe where these drugs are coming from. We are told by the \nopponents of this: Well, if drugs were to come into this country from \noutside the country, there might be a counterfeiting problem. Well, do \nyou know what. Most of these drugs are made outside of our country. \nLipitor is made in Ireland. Nexium is made in France. Tricor is made in \nFrance. Vytorin is made in Singapore and Italy and the UK.\n  Now, my point is simple: We have a law in this country that says the \ndrug companies can import drugs into our country, made in other regions \nof the world, but consumers cannot, registered or licensed pharmacists \ncannot, and wholesalers cannot. Our piece of legislation is very \nsimple. It says, let's provide some competition here. If the \nprescription drug industry is selling their drugs in virtually every \nother country in the world for a fraction of the price they sell those \ndrugs here, let's let licensed pharmacists in our country purchase them \nfrom Canada or another country and pass the savings along to the \nconsumer. Let's let wholesalers who are licensed in this country access \nthose lower cost prescription drugs. Let's allow American consumers to \naccess those drugs from Canada.\n  Now, I sat on a hay bale out on a farm 1 day at a little town meeting \nwhere there were 40 or 50 farmers, and we sat and talked about life and \nabout the farm program and about what was going on in their region of \nNorth Dakota.\n  There was one old codger there who was kind of lamenting what it was \ncosting him to live. He said: We don't make much money. We don't have \nmuch spendable income. And he said: I'm over 80 years old, and my wife \nhas been fighting breast cancer for the last 3, 3\\1/2\\ years. He said: \nShe has to take a drug called Tamoxifen. He said: So we have been going \nto Canada to try to buy Tamoxifen because it costs 80 percent less in \nCanada. It is the same drug--exactly the same drug--prescribed for an \nelderly woman who is fighting cancer, but you can pay much, much, much \nmore here in the United States or much, much, much less in other \ncountries. He said: For us, we have to drive to Canada to try to access \nthis drug.\n  Americans should not have to do that. This ought to be a fair pricing \nstrategy for American consumers, and today it is not. So we have \nintroduced legislation that has substantial safety requirements \nattached to it. We provide substantial additional funding for the Food \nand Drug Administration. We provide pedigree requirements for drug lots \nproduced anywhere in the world. We provide much more inspection of \nplants that produce drugs the FDA is approving. By the way, we know \nthat substantial amounts of ingredients come from China and elsewhere. \nWe also know that despite the fact there are supposed to be inspections \nof many of these plants, the inspections are few and far between.\n  The legislation we have introduced will dramatically increase the \nmargin of safety--not decrease it--increase the margin of safety. What \nit will do is allow the American public to have access to lower cost \nprescription drugs. If one part of driving up the costs of health care \nin this country, as rapidly as it has gone--if one part of that is the \nrapidly increasing price of prescription drugs, then we can remedy \nthat. We can simply say to the pharmaceutical industry: Give us the \nopportunity to have the same kind of pricing the rest of the world has. \nWe can make that happen, not by asking them to give it to us, but by \nrequiring a circumstance where our pharmacists and our wholesalers can \naccess those same lower cost drugs.\n  Now, what does it mean? Well, we could save with this legislation \nabout $50 billion in the next 10 years for American consumers; and \nabout $10 billion of that would be saved by the Federal Government for \nits programs, Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Here is a New York Times piece. It says: ``More Americans Are \nSkipping Necessary Prescriptions, the Survey Finds.'' That was from \nJanuary of this year. It says: One in seven Americans under 65 went \nwithout prescribed medicines, as drug costs spiraled upward in the \nUnited States, a nonprofit research group said.\n  Well, we can fix this. We can pass this legislation. As I indicated \nearlier, finally I think we have a bit of a tailwind here. We have a \nPresident who wants this. He put it in his budget. So now we have put \nin the architecture of a complete piece of legislation. We have worked \non it for many years. My colleague, Senator Snowe, and I, and many \nothers--from Senator Kennedy, Senator McCain, Senator Grassley, Senator \nStabenow--all of us have worked to make this happen: increase the \nmargin of safety, reduce prescription drug prices, and give the \nAmerican people the opportunity to have some sort of competitive \nprescription drug prices that others all around the world have as a \nresult of the current scheme that--let me not use the term ``scheme''--\nas a result of the current pricing policies of the prescription drug \nindustry.\n  Let me complete my statement by saying, we introduced this \nlegislation yesterday. We will continue to try to access more and more \ncosponsors. Whether this is a part of a health care reform bill or \npassed on its own, I think it is going to be good news for American \nconsumers.\n  Let me say one more time that the President's call today for a health \ncare reform summit at the White House is one more example of bringing \nRepublicans and Democrats together. This President is determined to do \nthat. That is good news because there are a lot of good ideas that can \ncome from every corner of this Chamber and every corner of the \npolitical system.\n  We ought to work together to give the American people the best of \nwhat both political parties have to offer rather than the worst of \neach, and nowhere is that more important than to do it in health care \nreform.\n  I thank the President for creating this summit this afternoon. One of \nthe issues I will raise there will be the prescription drug importation \nbill, which I think could put some downward pressure on prescription \ndrug prices, and that would be good for the people who live in this \ncountry and be good for this country's budgets and business budgets and \nso on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2782-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2782-S2789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take the floor in defense of one of our \nmost successful environmental statutes. Since its nearly unanimous \npassage in 1973, the Endangered Species Act has protected nearly 2,000 \nspecies from extinction. That success has contributed significantly to \nthe economic benefit of this Nation. According to a study by the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, wildlife-related recreation--meaning hunting and \nfishing and wildlife watching--generated more than $122 billion in \nrevenue in 2006. So this statute has protected wildlife diversity and \nhas protected our economy.\n  In my home State of Maryland, wildlife watching generated over $1 \nbillion in revenue and sustained over 10,000 jobs.\n  In December of 2008, the Bush administration finalized two rules that \nundercut the success of the Endangered Species Act. Now, that was in \nDecember of 2008, after the elections, after Senator Obama was elected \nPresident of the United States. The Bush administration issued two \nregulations in an effort to undermine the Endangered Species Act.\n  One rule undermines important safeguards for all threatened and \nendangered species. The other withholds key protections from the polar \nbear.\n  I believe it is critical the safeguards that have worked to protect \nendangered species for decades be reinstated. Section 429 of the fiscal \nyear 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act would give the Secretaries of \nInterior and Commerce the authority they need to do that. It will allow \nthe Secretaries to reverse the Bush administration's midnight \nregulations and reinstate the regulations previously in place.\n  To understand why this special authority is needed, I think it is \nhelpful to understand how devastating the rule changes are. So let me \nsay a little bit about the two rules President Bush put in place.\n  For decades, under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, Federal \nagencies have consulted with scientists at the Fish and Wildlife \nService or the National Marine Fisheries Service to make sure an \nagency's planned actions do not jeopardize a threatened or endangered \nspecies.\n  In line with a long record that expressed a low regard for science, \nin December, 2008, the Bush administration finalized a rule that \neffectively eliminated the critical role scientists play in the section \n7 system of checks and balances. What the Bush administration \nregulation did was to allow a Federal agency to avoid consultation with \nthe scientists in making its determination as to whether there was an \nimpact on an endangered species.\n  Professional scientific organizations argued, came out and said, \nquite frankly, this is unacceptable. The agency does not have the \ncapacity to make a determination as to whether a species is endangered \nby the action of the agency. They do not have the budget. They do not \nhave the expertise. And, quite frankly, they have a different mission. \nSo the impact of this regulation could have a devastating impact on the \nprotection--legitimate protection--of wildlife.\n  Now, some of my colleagues argue that requiring consultation with \nindependent scientists will slow infrastructure projects funded through \nthe recently passed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But let me \nremind my colleagues that the projects that are ready to go have \nalready gone through this environmental review. They are ready to go. \nThey will not be delayed as a result of section 7 of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. We are ready to proceed. And as President Obama recently \nsaid:\n\n       With smart, sustainable policies, we can grow our economy \n     today and preserve the environment.\n\n  But, quite frankly, these changes to the consultation rule were not \nthe only regulations the Bush administration issued. We had the one \nthat would compromise consultation with scientists in issuing the \nappropriate safeguards under the Endangered Species Act. The other was \nspecifically aimed toward the polar bear. The new rule granted no new \nprotections to the polar bear. Now, the President's regulations said \ndifferently, but that is not the case. The special rule not only denied \nadditional protections normally provided under the Endangered Species \nAct, but it set a bad precedent for weakening ESA safeguards.\n  The new rule does not require plans to monitor, minimize, or mitigate \nimpacts that could harm the bears. And the rule does not allow \nscientists and agencies to even consider climate change as a factor \nthat could injure polar bears.\n  Last year, I had the opportunity, along with members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, to visit Greenland. We saw \nfirsthand what is happening in regard to the loss of the snow caps and \nthe impact it is having on the polar bear population.\n  Global climate change is clearly affecting the future stability of \nthe polar bears, and the regulation that was issued in December \ncompromises that. It is quite clear why. Seven editorials from \nnewspapers in 32 States oppose the Bush administration's efforts. \nDozens of wildlife, scientific, and environmental organizations oppose \nthe change. In addition, eight State attorneys general, including the \nattorney general of Maryland, have filed suit to have these regulations \nwithdrawn.\n  So we have an amendment that has been offered. The amendment would \ntake out of the omnibus bill the additional authority we want to give \nto the agencies so that they can reverse the midnight changes attempted \nby the Bush administration. I would urge my colleagues to reject that \namendment. Let's not compromise the protections we have in the \nEndangered Species Act that allow Federal agencies to have the best \ninformation before they take action on their projects. It is what we \nshould be doing. It does preserve the diversity of wildlife in this \nNation. It maintains the leadership of the United States on these types \nof issues. It is the right policy. We should go through regular order \nwhen we change it. The Bush administration did not do that. They did \nthis as a last-minute gesture of the Bush administration. Let's restore \nthe status quo, and then let's look at the normal regulation process \nfor modifications that may be needed.\n  I would urge my colleagues to reject the amendment offered that will \nundermine the Endangered Species Act.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak once again \nabout the pending bill before the Senate--the very large and \nsignificant omnibus spending bill--but more specifically about \nprovisions in this bill that have very little to do with spending and \nhave a lot to do with foreign policy, including provisions relating to \nU.S. and Cuban relations. I decided to inform the Senate of a few \nthings that are in this morning's press and why what this bill will do \nmakes so little sense for the United States at this moment in time and \nwhy it would be a mistake for us to approve the current bill.\n  The current bill is an attempt to, frankly, usurp from the Executive \nthe prerogative to conduct foreign policy. In his campaign, the \nPresident indicated there were some things he wanted to change about \nU.S. policy toward Cuba relating to travel and remittances. I would \nhope that would be done in the order of Presidential prerogatives and \nnot by a legislative fiat but that, as it is done, it is done in a way \nthat is conducive to the best interests of our Nation and the best \ninterests of our long-term foreign policy objectives. Unfortunately, it \nis being done in a haphazard way, without real clarity about the \nimplications it will have relating to what is attempting to be done.\n  One of the issues relates, more importantly than all, perhaps, to \nagricultural business trade with Cuba. This is a $780 million-a-year \nbusiness which is now done by the Cubans paying cash before they can \nreceive the goods, before the goods leave our ports. This was done in \nthe prior administration because, in fact, the Cuban Government was not \nexactly playing it as it was supposed to. The shipments would get to \nCuba and then payment would not be there when the goods arrived, but \nmaybe 30 days later, maybe 60 days\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\nlater, and it was all of a sudden creating a problem. So we fixed the \nproblem, and American farmers are protected. They get to sell their \ngoods to Cuba--and $780 million is not an insignificant amount of \nsales--they get paid in cash, and they get paid before the goods leave \nthe port. That makes a lot of sense for America. It may not make a lot \nof sense for Cuba because it is an inconvenience. But I don't think we \nshould be making policy to the convenience of a brutal, dictatorial \nregime so close to our shores and which is a hostile and avowed enemy \nof the United States.\n  But what happened today in the news that is of interest? Well, \nseveral things. Let's see, how do we begin. There has been great hope \nthat there will be change in Cuba because Raul Castro is now in charge. \nI remember as a child always hearing that Raul Castro was the enforcer; \nthat Fidel was the nice guy and Raul was the tough guy. Raul Castro is \ncredited with over 500 deaths under his supervision in the first months \nof the revolution. In addition to that, he is the head of the armed \nforces--the armed forces where an Air Force plane was directed by him \nand authorized by him to shoot down civilian airplanes in the Florida \nstraits, killing three Americans and an American resident. That was \ndone to an unarmed civilian aircraft.\n  So there is great hope that this guy is going to be somehow an agent \nof change, is going to be an agent of pragmatism, and is going to be \nsomeone who is less ideological. I remember hearing all the time how \nthe real ideologues were Raul Castro and Ernesto Guevara. Those were \nthe two ideologues. They were the real Communists. It was Raul Castro \nwho first went to the Soviet Union and made deals with them about \nbeginning this arms buildup that led to the missile crisis that put the \nworld in peril.\n  So now we are talking about the future of Cuba. So he has had a \nshakeup. He has really had a military coup. If it was anyone else other \nthan a romantic revolutionary in Cuba, the U.S. press would be talking \nabout this as, in fact, a military coup, which is really what has \nhappened. He has tightened the circles.\n  There is an article today by the AP which talks about the closing of \nthe ranks. The fact is that the only rays of hope, the only people \nunder 75 years of age in any position of significant leadership--Carlos \nLage and Felipe Perez Roque have both been ousted. Worse than that, now \nFidel Castro has said they were undignified, or some other term such as \nthat, which means they have now fallen into disgrace, never to be heard \nfrom again, and they are not going to be the future leaders. Many \npeople thought Carlos Lage was the logical next successor. Nobody \nreally knows who will be leading Cuba in the future. But much like the \nsclerotic Soviet Union leadership of the time before Gorbachev where \nthey were passing around the titular head of government from one 80-\nyear-old to another, the Cubans are doing the very same thing. It is \nthe same old guard. Ramiro Valdes, an enforcer, a tough guy, a hard-\nliner, no-nonsense, ``kill them first, ask questions later''--that is \nwho is really the effective No. 2 to Raul Castro today. So there is no \nreal hope of change with this bunch in charge.\n  Here is the other thing that is of significance and importance to our \nU.S. interests. This is not about the interests of the Cuban \nGovernment: If we buy agricultural products from you, then you become a \nlobbyist for us and you advance our agenda, and at the top of that \nagenda is we don't want to have to pay cash when we pick up the goods. \nWe want credit. We want the goods to be paid for when they get to Cuba, \nin our own sweet time, which is really nothing more than another way of \neroding the trade sanctions we have with Cuba.\n  So there is another article today in the Miami Herald talking about \nCuban influence in Venezuela spreading. Now, we know Hugo Chavez is not \na friend of the United States. We also should remember that for almost \n50 years now, Fidel and Raul Castro and their band of collaborators \nhave not been friends of the United States. They, in fact, have been \navowed enemies of the United States and continue to be at every \ninternational forum, at every place where they can be heard.\n  So this story today in the Miami Herald tells us that some 40,000 \nCubans are now working in Venezuela, and of course Cuba receives 90,000 \nto 130,000 barrels of oil a day as a subsidy to continue their work and \ntheir repression of the Cuban people and the terrible living conditions \nthey are in. So they are in public education, which is a way of \ncontrolling minds and hearts.\n  I remember how the first Ministry that went to an avowed Communist \nafter Defense was Education. Armando Hart became the head of Cuba's \nEducation Ministry back in the early 1960s. It is a way of controlling \nwhat people are reading, what people are studying, because education is \nsubverted for political propaganda purposes to wash the minds of young \npeople. Now, this sounds all Cold War-ish and it sounds like crazy \nstuff, but it is going on today.\n\n  So with Cuba's help, in addition to that, sources within the \nVenezuelan military say that Cuban military experts control several \nsecurity circles that protect President Hugo Chavez. He doesn't trust \nhis Venezuelans. He has to have his Cuban thugs there to keep him alive \nand protect him. They have penetrated strategic areas of the armed \nforces and the central government, including the situation room and \nVenezuela's Presidential palace. So they run his security, they run his \nsituation room, the equivalent of our White House, and Cuban advisers \nplay a critical role.\n  Now, why is that important? Well, it is important because it shows \nthe linkage, the alliance, the partnership, the working together of \nVenezuela and Cuba to try to spread their brand of anti-Americanism and \nsocialism throughout Latin America where they are having, frankly, \nsignificant success with Venezuela's oil wealth and with Cuba's know-\nhow of the security apparatus and control.\n  That is all working very well for them because, see, here is the next \nnews item in that same article in the Miami Herald. It also mentions \nthat an additional area where the Cubans are providing their dark \nexpertise is in that of policing. They are working as advisers to the \npolice forces throughout the country, and Cuban advisers will play a \ncritical role. It won't be long before we will be seeing the Committees \nfor the Defense of the Revolution coming to a neighborhood near you in \nVenezuela. That is unfortunate, and that is bad for the Venezuelan \npeople.\n  But here is now another thing not in the policy interests of the \nUnited States, another headline: This morning, Chavez orders \nexpropriation of Cargill's rice plant. Another Miami Herald story. \nWell, the last I knew, Cargill is an American company. The last I knew, \nAmerican investors invested their good money and have processing plants \nin a company based in Minneapolis, MN, and they operate in Venezuela. \nThey invested in good faith. In good faith, they attempted to provide a \nservice to the Venezuelan industry and commerce. So now we find out it \nis a purposeful, continuing attempt to expropriate, without appropriate \ncompensation, American properties.\n  We go full circle. This is how the Cuban trade sanctions began under \nthe Eisenhower administration--it almost sounds comical now. The fact \nis that it began because of Cuba's expropriations of American property \nin Cuba without proper compensation and in violation of every \ninternational law and rule in existence. So today we find that, in \npartnership, the Cubans and Venezuelans are once again continuing this \nadvance of anti-Americanism, of expropriation of American properties, \nof taking out each and every one.\n  I believe this article details that Empresas Polar, another private \nenterprise, is no longer going to be private because the government is \ntaking it over. Over the past year, Chavez has nationalized Venezuela's \nlargest telephone, electric, and cement companies. His government is \nalso negotiating compensation for a takeover of the country's biggest \nsteelmaker, Sidor. So, as we can see, it is a pattern of government \ncontrol. From the police forces that are being trained now by the \nCubans--have been, really--to the security apparatus around President-\nfor-life Hugo Chavez, to everything else that goes on around them, we \nfind that the Cuban presence is there and is continuing and is ever-\npresent.\n  So at a time when all of this is taking place, at a time when just \ntoday\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\nthese three articles are in our news media--this is just today, by the \nway. There are things such as this every day about what is going on in \nLatin America right under our noses. So on this very day, when these \nthree news articles--we are probably going to take a vote tonight where \nwe are going to pass a spending bill that contains provisions dealing \nwith foreign policy issues that have not been through hearings, that \nhave not had the consultation and input of the executive branch, and we \nwill just go headlong into that. This is not to mention, by the way, \nthe 9,000 earmarks--some of which are very questionable and some of \nwhich are by a company under Federal investigation as we speak--and a \ntremendous amount of spending that completely violates what the \nPresident said would be the change and the hope that the American \npeople had, that there would be a new day, that we would be looking at \nevery line in the budget and we would be looking at all the spending \nwith a fine-tooth comb, and, by golly, there will not be earmarks \nbecause I will stop earmarks. I remember the President saying that. I \nwish today he would stand up and live up to those campaign promises.\n  It is a very lame excuse to say that this is last year's business. \nThis is happening on a Democratic majority watch in both Houses of the \nCongress. This is happening on the watch of a President who promised \ndifferently during his campaign. So whether it be because of what is in \nthis bill as it relates to spending or whether it is by the overreach \nof seeking to dictate foreign policy in a very misguided and mishandled \nway, where, frankly it isn't really clear where we are left if the \nprovisions in this bill are passed as to how the U.S. Government will \nenforce its regulations that are now being disbanded.\n  It is making a real mess and mockery of the process. For a lot of \nthose reasons, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nconsider whether it is wise to support this bill, whether it is, in \nfact, a good idea or whether we should be looking at ways in which we \ncan allow reason to prevail and put the best interests of the United \nStates first, not the best interests of the agricultural import Cuban \ncompany that forces those whom they buy product from to sign a \nmemorandum of understanding, where they agree to lobby on behalf of \nCuba's agenda. One of the top items of that agenda is this issue of not \nhaving to pay cash as the goods leave the port.\n  I know the chair worries about the rice farmers in Arkansas. It is \ngreat they can sell rice in Cuba. Rice to Cubans is like potatoes to \nthe Irish. We love to eat rice with every meal. It is great that \nArkansas is selling rice to Cuba. Isn't it great also that those rice \ngrowers from Arkansas are getting paid for it? The last thing we need \nin these economic times is to provide credit to a country that is \nuncreditworthy. They have the worst credit in the world, save one other \ncountry. I would like to know what is that country. Out of every \ncountry in the world, only one country has worse credit than Cuba. So \nto the second worst credit country, we are going to give them credit as \nthey purchase food rather than simply allow the current business to \ncontinue; $780 billion is not a bad piece of business.\n  It is going great. It ain't broke. Don't fix it. This bill seeks to \nfix that and more in a misguided and wrong way, which I know is not in \nthe best interest of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2009 \nOmnibus Appropriations Act.\n  Before I begin, I want to commend Chairman Inouye for his leadership \nin bringing this bill forward. Over the course of this grueling week of \ndebate, he has done his best to ensure that this process has been \ncivil, open, and transparent. In doing so, he has protected the \nauthority and responsibility of the Congress to shape the funding \npriorities of this country.\n  I would be remiss if 1 did not recognize the work of Senator Byrd, \nwho laid the groundwork in the Appropriations Committee last year, \nwinning bipartisan support for nearly all of the bills that comprise \nthis legislation.\n  Finally, I wish to acknowledge the work of all of the subcommittee \nchairs, but in particular, Senator Mikulski, for her support in helping \naddress the needs of New England's lobster and groundfish harvesters \nwho continue to be severely impacted by Federal regulations and catch \nrestrictions and face the prospect of losing not only their livelihoods \nbut a way of life. Because she has been such an effective advocate for \nthe watermen of Chesapeake Bay, she has recognized, perhaps more than \nanyone outside New England, the economic and cultural importance of our \nfishing communities, as well as the strain they are under.\n  Mr. President, setting aside the fact that we must pass a bill now in \norder to avoid a Government shutdown, the fact is this is the right \nbill for us to pass.\n  It will, as I indicate, avoid disruption of essential services to the \nNation at a time when the American people demand and need the support \nof a functioning Government.\n  This legislation complements the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct by funding additional programs that will save and create thousands \nof jobs. It includes continued investments in transit, highway, and \nwater infrastructure. These kinds of investments are sorely needed \nthroughout the country. In Rhode Island, trucks and other large \nvehicles must be diverted from a key stretch of the interstate because \nof concerns about its structural integrity. This is a disruption in \ncommerce that Rhode Island and the region can ill-afford. This package \nincludes funding to help speed the repairs at this important stretch of \nhighway.\n  The bill will also ensure we are investing in the institutions that \nare responsible for protecting the public interest, but have fallen \ndown on the job. Indeed, over the course of this decade, we have \nwitnessed the unraveling of essential regulatory agencies, from the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission to the Food and Drug Administration, \noften with alarming results. Certainly, the failure to provide adequate \nresources for these agencies has been a major contributor to their \nfailures. With the supplemental appropriations bill passed last year \nand continuing with this legislation, we have begun to reverse the \neffects of years of chronic underfunding. Senator Durbin, in response \nto the concerns that Senator Dodd, and I raised with respect to funding \nfor the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, worked to increase \nfunding for the Commission in this bill. The additional $37 million \nprovided here will give the SEC resources to aggressively investigate \nand prosecute fraud that cost taxpayers and investors billions of \ndollars. Coupled with systemic reform within the Commission, this \nfunding will help restore investor confidence and integrity to our \nmarkets.\n  Thanks to the efforts of Senator Harkin, this legislation also \ncontinues to invest in our most valuable national resource--our people. \nAs the successor to the late Claiborne Pell, I am gratified that this \nomnibus bill substantially increases funding for the grant bears his \nname. This legislation, together with the funding provided in the \neconomic recovery package, will help boost the maximum Pell grant by \n$619 to $5,350 in fiscal year 2009. It is worth noting how far we have \ncome. Just 2 years ago, the maximum Pell grant was stuck at $4,050--the \nsame level it had been funded at over the previous 4 years.\n  To supplement Pell grant and other higher education assistance, this \nlegislation maintains funding for the Leveraging Educational Assistance \nPartnership, leveraging additional need-based grant aid and support \nservices for our neediest students and families. It also boosts funding \nfor the teacher quality enhancement grants by $17 million to improve \ncollege teacher preparation programs and ensure that every classroom in \nAmerica has a high-quality teacher.\n  The bill increases funding for the state library program under the \nLibrary Services and Technology Act to $171.5 million. I have long \nadvocated for this funding level because it is the amount necessary to \nreach a key goal included in the 2003 reauthorization of the Museum and \nLibrary Services Act that I authored to double the minimum State \nallotment. This additional funding will help libraries respond to the\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\ndemand for free access to all types of information and digital and \nonline service. With the economic crisis we are suffering through, \nlibraries have become critical centers for guidance and career services \nfor unemployed workers as they search for jobs, and families as they \nsearch for the diversion that a public library can provide in very \ndifficult economic times.\n  The bill increases funding for the National Institutes of Health by \nalmost $1 billion, which will fund 10,600 new research grants. I \nstrongly supported the historic doubling of NIH funding between 1998 \nand 2003. Regrettably, since 2003, our investment in science has \neroded. As a result, only 24 percent of research projects are currently \nfunded, compared to 32 percent in 1999. I am glad that with the \neconomic recovery bill and this bill, we will reverse that trend and \ninvest in lifesaving research that will result in cures and treatments \nfor debilitating diseases.\n  The bill increases funding for community health centers by $125 \nmillion, which will provide access to an additional 470,000 uninsured \nAmericans. In my State, this program just awarded a grant to a health \nclinic that was on the verge of shutting its doors. The funding is a \nlifeline that saved 25 jobs, and could create another 22 jobs within \nthe next 18 months. More important, the center will provide primary \nhealth care, mental health counseling, and dental care to those who \nhave lost their jobs, and with them their health insurance, during this \neconomic crisis. This will keep people healthy and reduce health care \ncosts in the future.\n  The bill increases support for health care workforce programs, which \nis critical to increase access to primary care and to address the \nnursing shortage that our country faces.\n  Lastly, the bill increases funding for immunizations by $30 million, \nwhich will provide vaccinations to an additional 15,000 children. \nImmunizations are one of the most cost-effective ways to improve health \nand an important component in transforming our health care system to \nprevent sickness, and not just treat it.\n  Mr. President, for all of these reasons and more this bill makes the \nright investments in our country and I urge its passage.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wish to discuss the DC voucher \nprogram, officially the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. This is a \nprogram that was established in 2004 to provide low-income families \nwith scholarships to attend private schools in the District of \nColumbia.\n  The legislation we are debating, unfortunately, makes it harder for \nthat program to continue. The fiscal year 2009 omnibus legislation \nincludes language that would end the scholarship program in September \n2010, and it says we could not continue it by appropriation, which is \nunusual. It would also add the requirement that the DC City Council \nwould have to approve whatever we did.\n  That is a very unwise situation, I believe. The U.S. Secretary of \nEducation, Arne Duncan, said yesterday that poor children getting \nvouchers to attend private schools in the District of Columbia should \nbe allowed to stay there. He said that to the Associated Press. I am \nreading from that article where it says that Secretary Duncan opposes \nvouchers. But he says essentially that Washington is a special case, \nand kids already in private schools on the public dime should be \nallowed to continue.\n  To quote him directly, he said that ``I don't think it makes sense to \ntake kids out of a school where they're happy and safe and satisfied \nand learning. . . . I think those kids need to stay in their school.''\n  I think Secretary Duncan is right. I also think--and I said this at \nhis hearing--that Secretary Duncan is the best of the distinguished \nappointments President Obama has made. He can be a real help to the \nchildren in this country. I look forward to working with him.\n  I am an original cosponsor of an amendment that Senators Ensign, \nLieberman, Gregg, Voinovich, Kyl, DeMint, Brownback, and Cornyn have \nintroduced that would solve this problem, that would remove the \nlanguage from the omnibus bill that would make it harder for the DC \nVoucher Program to continue.\n  I think we should also take note that DC Mayor Adrian Fenty and \nChancellor Michelle Rhee, both of whom are acting courageously to try \nto improve the schools in the District, favor keeping the program.\n  The Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Wall Street Journal \neditorial pages have all voiced support of this program since this \nomnibus language was introduced in the House. The DC program is being \nsingled out.\n  I understand this may cause some problem with some House Members who \nwould rather see us not amend the bill that came to us, but that is our \njob. This is the Senate. That is the House of Representatives. If, in a \ngreat big bill that spends $410 billion, we see some things that need \nto be improved, we ought to have a chance to improve them. In this \ncase, there is broad agreement with the President's Education Secretary \nand many others that the DC kids need this and deserve this. There are \n1,700 children currently attending private schools in DC using these \nopportunity scholarships of up to $7,500 a year.\n  I make this point to call attention to the DC voucher program and the \nimportance of making certain we have a chance to amend the omnibus \nbill--the bill before us--so we do not make it harder for the DC \nvoucher program to continue. If that means we have to go on into next \nweek in order to have a sufficient number of amendments, then we should \ndo that.\n  I appreciate the fact that the majority leader has adopted this year, \nas he should, the practice that the Senate is a place that is \ndistinguished primarily by virtually unlimited debate and virtually \nunlimited amendments and then we vote. So a premature conclusion to \nthis bill before we have a chance to improve it, such as keeping the DC \nvoucher program, I think would be unwise.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the Associated Press article, the Washington Post editorial, the \nChicago Tribune editorial, and the Wall Street Journal editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            US Schools Chief Wants DC Kids to Keep Vouchers\n\n                            (By Libby Quaid)\n\n       Washington.--Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Wednesday \n     that poor children getting vouchers to attend private schools \n     in the District of Columbia should be allowed to stay there \n     even as congressional Democrats work to end the program.\n       His remarks, in an interview with The Associated Press, put \n     the Obama administration at odds with Democrats who oppose \n     the program because it spends public dollars on private \n     schools.\n       Duncan opposes vouchers. But he said Washington is a \n     special case, and kids already in private schools on the \n     public dime should be allowed to continue.\n       ``I don't think it makes sense to take kids out of a school \n     where they're happy and safe and satisfied and learning,'' \n     Duncan told said. ``I think those kids need to stay in their \n     school.''\n       Democrats in Congress have written a spending bill that \n     would effectively end the program after next year. The bill \n     says Congress and the city council would have to OK more \n     money, which is unlikely.\n       A vote is expected later this week.\n       Lawmakers, in a statement accompanying the bill, said no \n     new children should be enrolled in the program. And they said \n     D.C. schools chancellor Michelle Rhee should take steps to \n     minimize any disruption for kids as they transition back into \n     public schools.\n       The issue of vouchers exposes a deep fissure between \n     Republicans, who support them, and Democrats, who oppose \n     them.\n       Republicans insist that parents deserve a choice if their \n     kids are in failing schools, saying vouchers create \n     competition that puts pressure on public schools to do \n     better.\n       Democrats say it is impossible to expect public schools to \n     do better while precious public dollars are being siphoned \n     away to private schools.\n       ``I don't think vouchers ultimately are the answer,'' \n     Duncan said. ``We need to be more ambitious. The goal \n     shouldn't be to save a handful of children. The goal should \n     be to dramatically change the opportunity structure for \n     entire neighborhoods of kids.''\n       The voucher program in Washington has been an exception in \n     the debate over vouchers. Because of the sorry state of \n     public\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\n     schools in the nation's capitol, some Democrats were willing \n     to allow it in 2003 when a Republican-led Congress created \n     the voucher program.\n       And while big-city school superintendents generally oppose \n     vouchers, Rhee, the schools chancellor, has said she is open \n     to the District's voucher program.\n       ``I don't think vouchers are going to solve all the ills of \n     public education, but parents who are zoned to schools that \n     are failing kids should have options to do better by their \n     kids,'' Rhee told The New York Times recently.\n       The D.C. program gives scholarships to about 1,700 poor \n     kids so they can attend private schools.\n       It is the only federal voucher program in the country. \n     Other cities and states have similar programs--vouchers are \n     available in Milwaukee, Cleveland, Florida, Utah, Arizona and \n     Georgia--but they are paid for with local tax dollars.\n       Several states offer tax credits to help pay for private \n     school, but those are also local and not federal programs.\n       Obama sent mixed messages on vouchers during his \n     presidential campaign. He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel \n     in February 2008 that he was open to vouchers if research \n     showed they work. But his campaign swiftly backtracked, \n     issuing a statement saying Obama had always been a critic of \n     vouchers.\n       Supporters of the District's voucher program are quick to \n     point out that Obama's daughters attend a private school in \n     Washington, Sidwell Friends School, that also has students \n     whose tuition is paid through the voucher program.\n       When asked about Duncan's remarks, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-\n     Tenn., said the education secretary was ``exactly right.''\n       ``Senators should listen to him by voting this week to \n     continue funding vouchers for DC schoolchildren,'' Alexander \n     said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Mar. 2, 2009].\n\n                        `Potential' Disruption?\n\n\n Ending D.C. school vouchers would dash the best hopes of hundreds of \n                                children\n\n       Rep. David R. Obey (Wis.) and other congressional Democrats \n     should spare us their phony concern about the children \n     participating in the District's school voucher program. If \n     they cared for the future of these students, they wouldn't be \n     so quick as to try to kill the program that affords low-\n     income, minority children a chance at a better education. \n     Their refusal to even give the program a fair hearing makes \n     it critical that D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) seek help \n     from voucher supporters in the Senate and, if need be, \n     President Obama.\n       Last week, the Democrat-controlled House passed a spending \n     bill that spells the end, after the 2009-10 school year, of \n     the federally funded program that enables poor students to \n     attend private schools with scholarships of up to $7,500. A \n     statement signed by Mr. Obey as Appropriations Committee \n     chairman that accompanied the $410 billion spending package \n     directs D.C. Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee to \n     ``promptly take steps to minimize potential disruption and \n     ensure smooth transition'' for students forced back into the \n     public schools.\n       We would like Mr. Obey and his colleagues to talk about \n     possible ``disruption'' with Deborah Parker, mother of two \n     children who attend Sidwell Friends School because of the \n     D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. ``The mere thought of \n     returning to public school frightens me,'' Ms. Parker told us \n     as she related the opportunities--such as a trip to China for \n     her son--made possible by the program. Tell her, as critics \n     claim, that vouchers don't work, and she'll list her \n     children's improved test scores, feeling of safety and \n     improved motivation.\n       But the debate unfolding on Capitol Hill isn't about facts. \n     It's about politics and the stranglehold the teachers unions \n     have on the Democratic Party. Why else has so much time and \n     effort gone into trying to kill off what, in the grand scheme \n     of government spending, is a tiny program? Why wouldn't \n     Congress want to get the results of a carefully calibrated \n     scientific study before pulling the plug on a program that \n     has proved to be enormously popular? Could the real fear be \n     that school vouchers might actually be shown to be effective \n     in leveling the academic playing field?\n       This week, the Senate takes up the omnibus spending bill, \n     and we hope that, with the help of supporters such as Sen. \n     Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.), the program gets the reprieve \n     it deserves. If it doesn't, someone needs to tell Ms. Parker \n     why a bunch of elected officials who can send their children \n     to any school they choose are taking that option from her.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Mar. 3, 2009]\n\n                          A Vote for Ignorance\n\n       ``If there was any argument for vouchers, it was, `Let's \n     see if it works.' And if it does, whatever my preconception, \n     you do what's best for kids.''--Barack Obama, Feb. 13, 2008.\n       There's a novel concept--approaching education policy with \n     the paramount goal of helping students rather than, say, \n     teachers unions or school bureaucracies. So novel, in fact, \n     that within days of making that statement, Obama thought \n     better of it. ``Senator Obama has always been a critic of \n     vouchers,'' his campaign declared.\n       Now Democrats in Congress are lining up to oppose this \n     alternative rather than waiting to see if it works. In the \n     giant spending bill passed last week by the House, they cut \n     off money for the only federally financed voucher program in \n     the U.S.\n       It's in Washington, D.C., which has among the worst schools \n     in America. A 2007 report found that fewer than half of the \n     capital's grade-school pupils are proficient in reading or \n     math--and results are worse in higher grades.\n       In 2004, Congress financed a pilot program to give some \n     1,900 children vouchers to attend private schools.\n       It's a modest undertaking, providing just $7,500 per \n     child--less than a third of what the District of Columbia \n     spends per pupil in public schools. It only begins to satisfy \n     the demand for educational alternatives, since more than \n     7,000 kids applied for the vouchers. Ninety-nine percent of \n     the recipients, by the way, are black or Hispanic, with an \n     average family income of less than $23,000.\n       But vouchers are anathema to many in the Democratic Party \n     because teachers unions feel threatened by the prospect of \n     more children going to non-union private schools. So this \n     bill says there will be no more money for the program after \n     this year and directs the head of D.C.'s public schools to \n     ``promptly take steps to minimize potential disruption and \n     ensure smooth transition'' for kids who will be forced back \n     into schools their parents found wanting.\n       Democrats to kids: Tough luck.\n       What's the hurry here? This experiment has yet to run its \n     course, with only two years' worth of data assessed so far. \n     Patrick Wolf, a University of Arkansas professor who is \n     leading the assessment, found that children who got vouchers \n     have performed no better than those who were turned down. But \n     he says there have been ``large positive effects'' on their \n     parents'' satisfaction.\n       And there are reasons for hope. Of the 10 studies of \n     existing voucher systems, says Wolf, nine found significant \n     academic improvements.\n       President Obama doesn't need to be told about the \n     deficiencies of Washington's public schools: He rejected them \n     in favor of a private school for his daughters.\n       Ask how many members of Congress send their children to \n     public schools in D.C.\n       They are pushing through legislation that is grossly unfair \n     fashion toward 1,900 children and their parents who don't \n     have the luxury of paying for private schools.\n       We need more information about the effects of school \n     vouchers. Should Democrats in Congress have their way, we \n     won't get it.\n       If they want to end the experiment at such an early stage, \n     it's not because they think it's failing, but because they \n     fear it's working.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 3, 2009]\n\n                  Will Obama Stand Up for These Kids?\n\n       Dick Durbin has a nasty surprise for two of Sasha and Malia \n     Obama's new schoolmates. And it puts the president in an \n     awkward position.\n       The children are Sarah and James Parker. Like the Obama \n     girls, Sarah and James attend the Sidwell Friends School in \n     our nation's capital. Unlike the Obama girls, they could not \n     afford the school without the $7,500 voucher they receive \n     from the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program. Unfortunately, \n     a spending bill the Senate takes up this week includes a \n     poison pill that would kill this program--and with it perhaps \n     the Parker children's hopes for a Sidwell diploma.\n       Known as the ``Durbin language'' after the Illinois \n     Democrat who came up with it last year, the provision \n     mandates that the scholarship program ends after the next \n     school year unless Congress reauthorizes it and the District \n     of Columbia approves. The beauty of this language is that it \n     allows opponents to kill the program simply by doing nothing. \n     Just the sort of sneaky maneuver that's so handy when you \n     don't want inner-city moms and dads to catch on that you are \n     cutting one of their lifelines.\n       Deborah Parker says such a move would be devastating for \n     her kids. ``I once took Sarah to Roosevelt High School to see \n     its metal detectors and security guards,'' she says. ``I \n     wanted to scare her into appreciation for what she has at \n     Sidwell.'' It's not just safety, either. According to the \n     latest test scores, fewer than half of Roosevelt's students \n     are proficient in reading or math.\n       That's the reality that the Parkers and 1,700 other low-\n     income students face if Sen. Durbin and his allies get their \n     way. And it points to perhaps the most odious of double \n     standards in American life today: the way some of our loudest \n     champions of public education vote to keep other people's \n     children--mostly inner-city blacks and Latinos--trapped in \n     schools where they'd never let their own kids set foot.\n       This double standard is largely unchallenged by either the \n     teachers' unions or the press corps. For the teachers' \n     unions, it's a fairly cold-blooded calculation. They're \n     willing to look the other way at lawmakers who chose private \n     or parochial schools for their own kids--so long as these \n     lawmakers vote in ways that keep the union grip on the public \n     schools intact and an escape hatch like vouchers bolted.\n       As for the press, complaints tend to be limited to the odd \n     column or editorial. That's one reason it was so startling \n     back in 2000 when Time magazine's Tamala Edwards, during a \n     live televised debate at Harlem's Apollo Theater, asked Al \n     Gore about the propriety of sending his own son to private \n     school while opposing any effort to extend the same choice to \n     African-Americans without his financial wherewithal. As CNN's \n     Jeff\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\n     Greenfield would note later in the same debate, Mr. Gore \n     ``bristled'' when Ms. Edward's put the question to him.\n       Virginia Walden-Ford, executive director of D.C. Parents \n     for School Choice, wouldn't mind making a few more \n     politicians bristle. ``I'd like to see a reporter stand up at \n     one of those nationally televised press conferences and ask \n     President Obama what he thinks about what his own party is \n     doing to keep two innocent kids from attending the same \n     school where he sends his?''\n       As for Sidwell, the school has welcomed the Opportunity \n     Scholarship program. Though headmaster Bruce Stewart declines \n     to get into either politics or the Obamas, he says that a \n     program that gives parents more educational options for their \n     children is not only good for their kids, it's good for the \n     community. Plainly he's not doing it for the money: Even the \n     full D.C. voucher covers only a small fraction of Sidwell's \n     actual costs.\n       All of which leaves the First Parent with a decision to \n     make: Will he stand up for those like his own children's \n     schoolmates--or stand in front of the Sidwell door with Mr. \n     Durbin? It's hard to imagine white congressional Democrats \n     going up against him if he called them out on an issue where \n     they have put him in this embarrassing position. This, after \n     all, is a man who has written of the ``anger'' he felt as a \n     community organizer, when his attempts to improve things for \n     Chicago school kids ran up against an ``uncomfortable fact.''\n       ``The biggest source of resistance [to reform],'' he said, \n     ``was rarely talked about ... namely, the uncomfortable fact \n     that every one of our churches was filled with teachers, \n     principals, and district superintendents. Few of these \n     educators sent their own children to public schools; they \n     knew too much for that. But they would defend the status quo \n     with the same skill and vigor as their white counterparts of \n     two decades before.''\n       Let's just say that Sarah and James Parker--and thousands \n     just like them--could use some of that same Obama anger right \n     about now.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Senator from Tennessee is a friend \nof mine. He has served as Secretary of Education, we talk about \neducation issues, and we share a common admiration for the new \nSecretary of Education. But I would like to correct, while he is still \non the floor, a few of the things he said.\n  Five years ago, the Bush administration said, for the first time in \nthe history of America, we will create a federally funded voucher \nprogram. Here is what it says: Federal taxpayers' dollars will be given \nto parents of students in the District of Columbia--Washington, DC--who \nwant to put their kids in private schools. The Federal Government will \npay a certain amount of money in tuition vouchers to those schools on \nbehalf of the students and their parents.\n  It was a 5-year experiment, and there was a lot of controversy \nassociated with it. Some of us were skeptical. I offered three \namendments to this DC voucher program. The first amendment I offered in \nthe Appropriations Committee said that all the teachers in the voucher \nschools--the private voucher schools--have to have a college degree. \nThe amendment was defeated. It was defeated because those pushing for \nvoucher schools said that is going to stop creativity, it is going to \nconfine these schools, and we should let them do what they are going to \ndo.\n  I didn't buy that because, frankly, we impose those standards on \npublic schools across America, but my amendment was defeated.\n  Now, the second amendment I offered said the DC voucher schools--the \nbuildings themselves--had to pass the fire safety code of the District \nof Columbia for teaching children. All right? The amendment was \ndefeated. Those pushing the voucher program said: You know, you don't \nget it. This is about a creative approach to education. It may not be \nthe traditional classroom setting. We defeat your amendment.\n  The third amendment said: Well, in fairness, if the argument is that \nvoucher schools are better than DC public schools, there ought to be a \ncommon standard to judge them. So my amendment said they shall take the \nsame achievement test--the voucher school students and the public \nschool students--so we can then compare apples to apples. My amendment \nwas defeated, and the argument was voucher schools have to be allowed \nthis creativity to think anew and to try different things. I don't buy \nit.\n  So I started with real skepticism and I voted against this program. \nNow, in the ensuing time--the 4 or 5 years--1,700 students have \nreceived Federal subsidies to go to private schools. It is the only \nplace in America I know where that is happening. The idea, of course, \nwas that at the end of this experimental authorization period, we would \ntry to step back and ask: Was this a good idea? Was it good for the \nkids, good for the families, good for the District of Columbia, and our \nNation?\n  That was the idea behind it. This law creating these DC voucher \nschools was to expire this year in June. Now, my committee funds the \nDistrict of Columbia, the Federal funds that go into it, and so we \nsaid: You know, that may be too abrupt. It may not be fair. So what we \nwill do is we will extend through the 2009-2010 school year the DC \nvoucher schools, but somebody has to step back and take a look at this \nand ask: Is it working?\n  When the Government Accountability Office went to take a look at it, \nthey said that some of these schools are world class--these voucher \nschools--and some of them end up being classes taught in the basement \nof a private church in the District of Columbia by people who don't \nhave the competence to teach.\n  Now, the Senator from Tennessee doesn't want that to happen in his \nState, and I don't want it to happen in my State, and I certainly don't \nthink it should happen here on our watch. So I extended this program 1 \nyear, and it is in the hands of Senator Joe Lieberman. Senator \nLieberman is the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs. He gave his personal assurance to the Members of \nthe Senate that there will be a hearing and an attempt to markup \nreauthorization of this program. That is the orderly process, it is the \nsensible process, and at the end of the day we are going to learn a lot \nabout the voucher schools and how they are doing.\n  Now, in the meantime--and I know the Senator from Tennessee knows \nthis--I would say we have a new school chancellor in the District of \nColumbia who is trying her very best to bring reform to public \neducation. I know some of her proposals are controversial, but I think \nshe is on the right track to bring in quality teachers and a quality \nlearning environment in the public schools. So let us look at this \nthing in the perspective of an experiment for 5 years, that was \nextended 1 year by this bill, that we can take an honest look at and \nask: Did it work?\n  Put aside for a moment whether you agree the Federal Government ought \nto put money into the hands of families to send kids to private schools \nand ask the basic question: Did it work? Are the students better off? \nAre they learning more? That is a legitimate question, and I want to \nknow the answer, and I will bet the Senator does too. In the meantime, \nwe should provide an environment for the public schools in the District \nof Columbia to have real reform, and that involves some money, I am \nsure, but it ought to be money we invest wisely as we invest in the \nvoucher schools. There have been a few articles that have been \ninaccurate about the DC voucher program, and I wished to present my \npoint of view on that program while the Senator from Tennessee is still \nhere. I wish to move to another topic, unless he wants to address a \nquestion, which I would be happy to entertain.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Illinois, and I look forward \nto working with him on helping the District of Columbia, including the \nmayor and the superintendent in the District who would like for this to \ncontinue.\n  The question I have is: Why is it necessary for this legislation to \ninsist that the program end in September of 2010 and that we add the \nprovision the city council would have to approve it if it is continued \nby the Congress?\n  Usually, when we have education programs whose authorization runs \nout, we continue them for a while as we go through the analysis the \nSenator talked about, such as the Higher Education Act which took us 6 \nyears or the Head Start Act which took us 3 or 4 years or No Child Left \nBehind or so many others. Why is it necessary that we even address the \nending of this program in this legislation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say, in response to the Senator from Tennessee, \nthat is a legitimate question. When the law was written, that is what \nit said: This program will expire. The authorization will end. I have \nextended it in\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\nthis bill an additional year so we can take the time not to push the \nkids out of the classrooms and take the time to make the judgment \nwhether it is working.\n  One of your colleagues, whom you vote with frequently and who sits \nbehind you, from Oklahoma, who has this passion about authorizations, \nhe says: You know, you do an authorization bill, and you are talking \nabout spending money. I don't happen to agree with him. I think it \ntakes an appropriation in addition to an authorization. But if an \nauthorization has any meaning, particularly when dealing with a new \nventure, in terms of Federal taxpayer dollars going to private schools, \nI think we owe it to everybody--the taxpayers as well as the parents, \nteachers, and kids--to ask the hard questions.\n  If the GAO comes in and tells us someone somewhere in the District of \nColumbia has created what they call a voucher school so that their wife \ncan declare herself principal and their daughter can declare herself a \nteacher and the kids can sit in a building which doesn't have a fire \nexit, I am a little worried about that. I don't think we ought to go on \nwith business as usual in that situation, and I would like to at least \nhave an honest appraisal.\n  I would say to the Senator from Tennessee, it is my impression \nSenator Lieberman of Connecticut is leaning toward the voucher school \nprogram, so he doesn't come to this with prejudice against it. I would \nnot presume that is his ultimate position, but I think he will be an \nhonest broker. He will bring all the facts out. I think that is why we \nare here, and I think it is a legitimate exercise of our \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Illinois, and would only note \nthat Senator Lieberman is a cosponsor of the amendment we would like to \nhave a chance to vote on.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 607\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there is an amendment pending--and it is \nan amendment offered by Senator Wicker of Mississippi--which is one of \nthose red-hot amendments that gets people riled up around here because \nit deals with a controversial issue, and that is the issue of abortion.\n\n  Of course, many of us have stated our positions on the record time \nand again, but this comes down to a specific element here. What Senator \nWicker does is to strike the language in the bill that permits funding \nof the U.N. Population Fund for six limited purposes. He has stated \nthat his reason for doing so is to make certain we don't put money into \nChina, where there is evidence of coercive abortion and involuntary \nsterilization; and he certainly says he doesn't want Federal funds to \nbe spent for the promotion of abortion anywhere in the world.\n  I would say there are two elements of the bill which I would \nrecommend to all Members before they vote on the Wicker amendment, \nwhich I hope they will oppose. Page 763 of the bill--it is a big one, \nbut I will point you to the specific page, 763--says:\n\n       . . . none of the funds made available in this Act nor any \n     unobligated balances from prior appropriations Acts may be \n     made available to any organization or program which, as \n     determined by the President of the United States, supports or \n     participates in the management of a program of coercive \n     abortion or involuntary sterilization:\n\n  A flatout prohibition. It is already there. Then when it comes to the \nissue of China, which has been the centerpiece of this debate about \ncoercive abortions and involuntary sterilization, there is a long \nsection--page 929--which I will refer my colleagues to. The net result \nis this. It says in the first paragraph:\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the \n     Committees on Appropriations indicating the amount of funds \n     that the UNFPA is budgeting for the year in which the report \n     is submitted for a country program in the People's Republic \n     of China.\n\n  So we ask the Secretary of State to go to New York and find out how \nmuch money is going to China, where we suspect coercive abortion and \ninvoluntary sterilization. The second paragraph says we will then \ndeduct that amount of funds from any money that goes to the United \nNations for family planning.\n  So it is specific, and we are specific in terms of these practices. \nWe can't spend any money for these practices; and, secondly, no money \nto the People's Republic of China which is not set off by a reduction \nin the Federal investment.\n  Now, let me tell you why this amendment not only ignores the clear \nlanguage of the bill but should not be passed. There are six limited \npurposes for which we are trying to use the U.N. Population Fund, and \nthey are, among other things, to reduce genital mutilation and \nobstetric fistula and to provide voluntary family planning and basic \nhealth care to women and girls.\n  It has been my opportunity and honor to visit Africa. In one of those \nvisits, with Senator Brownback of Kansas, we went to the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo, which doesn't get the publicity of many places in \nAfrica, but it has been one of the killing fields. There have been \nthousands--maybe hundreds of thousands--of people killed in this \nregion. It has been torn back and forth since the Rwandan genocide, \nwith the exploitation of minerals. The net result has been the poorest \npeople on Earth, smack dab in the center of Africa, have been pushed \nout of their villages and into refugee camps, and they have been \nvictimized by guerilla soldiers.\n  Well, I went to a hospital in Goma, which is in the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo. It is one of those places where you think if God has \na bad day, the first thing he does is look at Goma because they have \nhad it all--poverty, disease, all the strife of guerrillas and all the \nwar that revolves around them and, to put the icing on the cake, a \nvolcano which erupts with regularity. These poor folks get it in every \ndirection. But there in Goma was a hospital called DOCS hospital. DOCS \nhospital is sustained and financed by protestant churches in the United \nStates. It has a modern surgical suite, paid for by the United Nations.\n  When you go to this hospital, you see women lined up in a row, \nhanging onto their meager belongings, waiting for the chance to be \nadmitted to the hospital. Why? Because this is the only place within \nhundreds of miles where they can go for surgical treatment of what is \nknown as obstetric fistula. Obstetric fistula--I will try to describe \nit; not being a doctor--is the result of early pregnancies, long labors \nof young girls, rape, terrible mutilation that occurs and causes \nserious problems for these women. They become incontinent, they are \nunable to join their families, they are shunned by their villages. This \nis their only hope. They come to this hospital and they wait. They sit \nin the dust in the road hoping--and it is sometimes weeks later--to be \nseen by a doctor. They cook outside and help one another, and then they \nmay go through a surgery. At the end of the surgery, they end up two to \na bed trying to recuperate. Some of them, because they are so badly \nmutilated, have to go through multiple surgeries and wait month after \nweary month while a handful of surgeons and nurses do heroic jobs in \ntrying to put their lives back together.\n  Is that worth putting some money into? Is it? Is it worth saying to \nthe U.N. Population Fund: Can you help these people? Can you bring in \nsome doctors, some surgeons to treat them? They are victims, helpless \nvictims, who are trying to put their lives back together. I think it is \nmoney well spent.\n  I have a friend of mine named Molly Melching. Molly Melching is in \nSenegal. She was in the Peace Corps there, and after her service in the \nPeace Corps she decided to stay on. She has created an organization \ncalled Tostan. Tostan is trying to stop the ritualistic genital \nmutilation of girls. It is horrible, and it is dangerous. Village by \nvillage, tribe by tribe, Molly is making progress, and I think that is \nthe right thing to do, for the dignity of these young girls and for the \nrole of women in these African societies. Is it worth money from the \nUnited Nations Population Fund? I think it is.\n\n  And voluntary family planning, we have ascribed to that particular \ngoal in America, that women should have a choice to plan their families \nwith their spouse and with their conscience. I think the same thing, \nshort of abortion, should be available through the United Nations \nPopulation Fund. Unfortunately, the Wicker amendment strikes the \nlanguage which permits funding for those purposes. It is not right.\n  We know you cannot spend the money here for coercive abortion, we\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\nknow you cannot spend the money here for involuntary sterilization, we \nknow if you spend the money in China we are going to take it away from \nthe United Nations.\n  This amendment goes too far. I urge my colleagues, particularly those \nwho are of a persuasion that opposes abortion and believe they should \noppose it in every circumstance, give women in the poorest countries on \nEarth the option of voluntary family planning. Do something for these \npoor women who have been victimized by rape and war, and these young \npregnancies that unfortunately cause so much damage to their bodies. \nGive them a chance to put their lives back together. Also, when it \ncomes to genital mutilation, the United Nations should be in the \nforefront of promoting modern treatment of women and not leave \nourselves in the distant dark past of these tribal customs. I am sure \nSenator Wicker does not intend for this to happen, but I am afraid that \nis the result of it.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Wicker amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2789-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I may speak for \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition to comment about the pending \nbill. As I reflect on it, I am speaking on the bill and do not need to \nput it in morning business. It is on the bill itself.\n  I note the majority leader has filed a motion for cloture and it is \nscheduled for 9:30 tomorrow. We may vote on it today. But whenever we \nvote on it, there are some observations I have. I want to give my \nthinking on the issue. My current inclination is to vote against \ncloture because there has been insufficient time to offer amendments.\n  This omnibus bill contains most of the budget process and there are a \ngreat many amendments pending. I compliment the majority leader for \nmoving from the position of blocking all amendments. We have had \nconsiderable discussion last year, and even before that, about a \npractice of majority leaders taking procedural steps known as--there is \nan arcane procedure, inside-the-beltway talk--filling the tree, \nstopping amendments being offered and then moving to cloture. I have \nopposed cloture and have urged that regular order be followed in \nallowing amendments to be offered.\n  The unique feature about the Senate is that any Senator can offer \nvirtually any amendment at virtually any time on virtually any bill. \nThat, plus unlimited debate, makes this a very extraordinary body where \nwe can focus public attention on important matters of public policy and \nacquaint the public with what is going on and seek to improve our \ngovernance.\n  The majority leader has objected to quite a number of amendments \ncoming up. Looking over the list, there are quite a number of \namendments which I believe merit consideration. Senator Grassley has \ntried to advance amendment No. 628. He did again this morning. There \nwas an objection raised to it.\n  Senator Sessions has sought to offer amendment No. 604 and he has \nbeen blocked on four occasions from offering this amendment on the \neconomic stimulus.\n  Senator Vitter has a number of amendments, one of which is amendment \nNo. 636, involving drug reimportation from Canada.\n  Senator Ensign has amendment No. 615, cosponsored by Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Kyl, Senator DeMint, Senator Brownback, and Senator \nCornyn, which would deal with a subject where they are seeking to have \na vote.\n  I do not necessarily agree with all of these amendments. In fact, as \nI review them, there are some I disagree with. But I believe Senators \nought to have an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  Yesterday the Senate voted on an issue involving Emmett Till, and \nmany Senators voted against that amendment, as I understand it, to \navoid having an amendment agreed to on the omnibus which would require \na conference with the House of Representatives. I think it is something \nwe ought to decide on the merits, as to the amendment, without respect \nto having a conference.\n  Regular order under our legislative process is to exercise our \njudgment on amendments. Then, if the Senate bill is different from the \nHouse bill, if an amendment is agreed to, then you have a conference. \nThat is the way we do business. That is regular order. To determine how \nyou are going to vote on an amendment in order to avoid a conference \nseems to me to be beside the point.\n  If there were some emergency, some reason to avoid a conference, \nperhaps so. But there is time to have a Senate bill which disagrees \nwith the House bill and to have a conference and iron it out on regular \norder. Whenever we depart from regular order, it seems to me, we run \ninto potential problems. The institutions of the Senate have been \ncrafted over centuries. The Senate is smarter than I am, certainly, and \nperhaps smarter than other Senators. But I think we ought to follow the \nregular order. That is why I am disinclined to vote for cloture.\n  I know the majority leader wants to move this bill, but we have time \nto take up these amendments. If we move on into additional sessions of \nthe Senate later this week, later tonight, later next week, then I \nthink that is what ought to be done and Senators ought to have an \nopportunity to offer these amendments.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 11:25 the Senate will begin 45 minutes of \ndebate on amendment No. 607, and the time will be equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, the Senate is on the bill.\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 607\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand that we are on the Wicker \namendment. I have listened to the statements made about it. It is hard \nto understand what the real purpose of the amendment is, although the \njunior Senator from Mississippi says the purpose is as follows: To \nrequire that amounts appropriated for the United Nations Population \nFund are not used by organizations which support coercive abortion or \ninvoluntary sterilization.\n  I do not know anybody who would disagree with that. But apparently he \nbelieves that his amendment is necessary to prevent funds from being \nused for coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. Let me state \nwhat is in the bill, because it is the same as current law. It already \nprohibits funds for abortions of any kind, whether coercive or \notherwise. No funds in this bill can be used for abortion. So the \namendment is unnecessary for that purpose.\n  His amendment prohibits funds for involuntary sterilization. Well, \nnone of us is going to permit the use of Federal funds for involuntary \nsterilization. I urge him to read the bill. We already prohibit that. \nSo the amendment is unnecessary for that purpose.\n  Actually, if he is on the floor, I would urge him to declare victory \nand withdraw his amendment. Long before he was in the Senate, we were \nalready prohibiting the things he wants to prohibit.\n  His amendment also prohibits funds for the U.N. Population Fund for a \nprogram in China. Well, again, our bill already does that. We already \nprohibit explicitly any funds being used in China by the U.N. \nPopulation Fund.\n  His amendment says we should put funds for the U.N. Population Fund \nin a separate account and not commingle them with other sums. We \nalready do that. Again, there is no need for it.\n  His amendment prohibits funds to the U.N. Population Fund unless it \ndoes not fund abortion. Well, the bill already says that. For the \nRecord, the U.N. Population Fund has always had a policy of not \nsupporting abortion. In fact, there is not a shred of evidence that it \never did. It supports the same voluntary family planning and health \nprograms the United States Agency for International Development does, \nbut it does it in about 97 more countries than the United States Agency \nfor International Development does.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Mississippi would deduct, dollar \nfor dollar, from the U.N. Population Fund for a program it spends in \nChina. The bill already does that. So for all practical purposes, the \namendment of the junior Senator from Mississippi does nothing that the \nbill already does not do, with one exception.\n  His amendment would also strike the six limited purposes that are \nspecified in the bill for which funds are made available to the U.N. \nPopulation Fund. For example, he would strike the funds that are \nprovided ``to promote the abandonment of female genital mutilation and \nchild marriage.'' Why would we want to cut programs to help encourage \nan end to child marriage? Is there anybody in the Senate in favor of \nchild marriage? Is there anyone in the Senate in favor of female \ngenital mutilation? I find it amazing I have to even come to the floor \nto talk about this. Yet his amendment would remove the funds we provide \nto try to stop child marriage and female genital mutilation. Why should \nwe vote for something like that?\n  Why should we prohibit funding to reduce the incidence of child \nmarriage in countries where girls as young as 9 years old are forced to \nmarry men they have never met, sometimes five times their age, who then \nabuse them?\n  The bill also provides funds to prevent and treat obstetric fistula. \nFor those who are not familiar with this, it is a terrible, \ndebilitating condition that can destroy the life of any woman who \nsuffers from it. But it can be treated with surgery.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a February 24 article in the New York \nTimes on obstetric fistula be printed in the Record at the end of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why we would want to prohibit funds to save the lives of \nwomen who otherwise could die or be painfully debilitated for the rest \nof their lives, I cannot understand. None of us would hesitate for a \nmoment to provide funds to help someone in our family who might be in \nthis condition. I see the Senator from Mississippi on the floor. His \namendment prohibits funds to the U.N. Population Fund for that.\n  The bill provides funds to reestablish maternal health care in areas \nwhere medical facilities and services have been destroyed or limited by \nnatural disasters, armed conflict or other factors, such as in Pakistan \nafter the earthquake that destroyed whole villages. Why would we not \nwant to support maternal health care? Any one of us, be it our sisters \nand daughters, our wives, we would want them to access to these medical \nservices. Or in Congo, where armed conflict has destroyed what limited \nhealth services existed and where thousands of women and girls have \nbeen raped, some barely old enough to walk. This bill provides funds \nfor programs to help them. The amendment of the Senator from \nMississippi would prohibit funding for the U.N. Population Fund for \nthat.\n  Funds are provided to promote access to clean water, sanitation, food \nand health care for poor women and girls. His amendment would prohibit \nthat. I have traveled to different parts of the world. I have seen the \ndifferences in the lives of women and young girls that are made with \nthese programs. The Senator prohibits that.\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development has these types of \nprograms in 53 countries, but the U.N. Population Fund works in about \n150 countries. If you live in the Republic of the Congo or the Central \nAfrican Republic, two of the poorest countries in Africa, and you are a \n16-year-old girl with obstetric fistula, you are out of luck because \nUSAID does not have programs there. That is why we fund the U.N. \nprogram. If you have a 7-year-old daughter who has been raped there, we \ndon't have a program to help her. But we give funds to the U.N. to help \nher. The amendment of the Senator from Mississippi would stop that.\n  If you live in Niger or Mauritania, where genital mutilation is \ncommon, or in Sri Lanka where child marriage is common, we don't have \nfunds there, but we give funds to the U.N. to help.\n  The Senator's amendment creates a problem where there is none. It \ndenies funding to address the basic needs of poor women and girls who \nare subjected to practices that would be crimes in this country.\n  Our law already prohibits funds for abortion of any kind, whether \ncoercive or voluntary. We already prohibit funds for involuntary \nsterilization. We prohibit funds for the U.N. Population Fund's program \nin China. We have already done all these things. But we do provide \nfunds to help girls who are being forced into marriages at the age of \n9. We do support care for women who suffer from these debilitating \nconditions. We do have funds for maternal care, clean water, and \nvoluntary family planning. But if the amendment of the junior Senator \nfrom Mississippi is agreed to, we would prohibit those funds in many \nparts of the world.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 2009]\n\n                 After a Devastating Birth Injury, Hope\n\n                           (By Denise Grady)\n\n       Dodoma, Tanzania.--Lying side by side on a narrow bed, \n     talking and giggling and poking each other with skinny \n     elbows, they looked like any pair of teenage girls trading \n     jokes and secrets.\n       But the bed was in a crowded hospital ward, and between the \n     moments of laughter, Sarah Jonas, 18, and Mwanaidi Swalehe, \n     17, had an inescapable air of sadness. Pregnant at 16, both \n     had given birth in 2007 after labor that lasted for days. \n     Their babies had died, and the prolonged labor had inflicted \n     a dreadful injury on the mothers: an internal wound called a \n     fistula, which left them incontinent and soaked in urine.\n       Last month at the regional hospital in Dodoma, they awaited \n     expert surgeons who\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\n     would try to repair the damage. For each, two previous, \n     painful operations by other doctors had failed.\n       ``It will be great if the doctors succeed,'' Ms. Jonas said \n     softly in Swahili, through an interpreter.\n       Along with about 20 other girls and women ranging in age \n     from teens to 50s, Ms. Jonas and Ms. Swalehe had taken long \n     bus rides from their villages to this hot, dusty city for \n     operations paid for by a charitable group, Amref, the African \n     Medical and Research Foundation.\n       The foundation had brought in two surgeons who would \n     operate and teach doctors and nurses from different parts of \n     Tanzania how to repair fistulas and care for patients \n     afterward.\n       ``This is a vulnerable population,'' said one of the \n     experts, Dr. Gileard Masenga, from the Kilimanjaro Christian \n     Medical Center in Moshi, Tanzania. ``These women are \n     suffering.''\n       The mission--to do 20 operations in four days--illustrates \n     the challenges of providing medical care in one of the \n     world's poorest countries, with a shortage of doctors and \n     nurses, sweltering heat, limited equipment, unreliable \n     electricity, a scant blood supply and two patients at a time \n     in one operating room--patients with an array of injuries, \n     from easily fixable to dauntingly complex.\n       The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building \n     with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds \n     against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed \n     labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong \n     position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, \n     obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften \n     enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers \n     a corpse.\n       Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her \n     bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the \n     baby's skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a \n     hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the \n     vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks \n     out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.\n       One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 \n     was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, \n     with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have \n     contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or \n     women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that \n     make them prone to obstructed labor.\n       The women wore kangas, bolts of cloth wrapped into skirts, \n     in bright prints that stood out against the ward's drab, \n     chipping paint. Under the skirts, some had kangas bunched \n     between their legs to absorb urine.\n       Not even a curtain separated the beds. An occasional hot \n     breeze blew in through the screened windows. Flies buzzed, \n     and a cat with one kitten loitered in the doorway. Outside, \n     kangas that had been washed by patients or their families \n     were draped over bushes and clotheslines and patches of \n     grass, drying in the sun.\n       Speaking to doctors and nurses in a classroom at the \n     hospital, Dr. Jeffrey P. Wilkinson, an expert on fistula \n     repair from Duke University, noted that women with fistulas \n     frequently became outcasts because of the odor. Since July, \n     Dr. Wilkinson has been working at the Kilimanjaro Christian \n     Medical Center, which is collaborating with Duke on a women's \n     health project.\n       ``I've met countless fistula patients who have been thrown \n     off the bus,'' he said. ``Or their family tells them to \n     leave, or builds a separate hut.''\n       For the women in Ward 2, the visiting doctors held out the \n     best hope of regaining a normal life.\n       Fistulas are a scourge of the poor, affecting two million \n     women and girls, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia--those \n     who cannot get a Caesarean section or other medical help in \n     time. Long neglected, fistulas have gained increasing \n     attention in recent years, and nonprofit groups, hospitals \n     and governments have created programs, like the one in \n     Dodoma, to provide the surgery.\n       Cure rates of 90 percent or more are widely cited, but, Dr. \n     Wilkinson said, ``That's not a realistic number.''\n       It may be true that the holes are closed in 90 percent of \n     patients, but even so, women with extensive damage and \n     scarring do not always regain the nerve and muscle control \n     needed to stay dry, Dr. Wilkinson said.\n       Ideally, fistulas should be prevented, but prevention--\n     which requires education, more hospitals, doctors and \n     midwives, and better transportation--lags far behind \n     treatment. Worldwide, there are still 100,000 new cases a \n     year, and most experts think it will take decades to \n     eliminate fistulas in Africa, even though they were wiped out \n     in developed countries a century ago. Their continuing \n     presence is a sign that medical care for pregnant women is \n     desperately inadequate.\n       ``Fistula is the thing to follow,'' Dr. Wilkinson said. \n     ``If you find patients with fistula, you'll also find that \n     mothers and babies are dying right and left.''\n       The day before her surgery, Ms. Jonas sat on her bed, \n     anxiously eyeing the other women as they were wheeled back \n     from the operating room. Some vomited from the anesthesia, \n     and she found it a distressing sight.\n       Ms. Jonas said that when she was 16, she became intimate \n     with a 19-year-old boyfriend, without realizing that sex \n     could make her pregnant. It quickly did. Her labor went on \n     for three days. By the time a Caesarean was performed, it was \n     too late. Her son survived for only an hour, and she \n     developed a fistula, as well as nerve damage in one leg that \n     left her with an awkward gait.\n       Her boyfriend denied paternity and married someone else, \n     and some friends abandoned her because she was wet and \n     smelled. She was living in a rural village in a two-room mud \n     hut with her parents, two sisters and a brother. She had one \n     year of education and could not read or write, but said that \n     she hoped to go to school again someday.\n       The operating room in Dodoma had just enough room for two \n     operating tables, separated by a green cloth screen. Two at a \n     time, the patients, wearing bedsheets they had draped as \n     gracefully as their kangas, walked in. Some were so short \n     that they needed a set of portable steps to climb up onto the \n     table.\n       The women had an anesthetic injected into their spines to \n     numb them below the waist, and then their legs were lifted \n     into stirrups. Awake, they lay in silence while the doctors \n     worked, Dr. Masenga at one table and Dr. Wilkinson at the \n     other, each surrounded by other doctors who had come to \n     learn.\n       An air-conditioner put out more noise than air. Flies \n     circled, sometimes lighting on the patients. A mouse scurried \n     alongside the wall. There were none of the beeping monitors \n     that dominate operating rooms in the United States. \n     Periodically, a nurse would take a blood pressure reading.\n       Midway through the first operation the power failed, and \n     the lights went out. Dr. Wilkinson put on a battery-powered \n     headlamp and kept working, but Dr. Masenga had to depend on \n     daylight. Their scrubs and gowns grew dark with sweat.\n       Most fistula surgery is performed through the vagina, and \n     can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. It \n     involves more than simply sewing a hole shut: delicate \n     dissection is needed to loosen nearby tissue so that there \n     will not be too much tension on the stitches, and sometimes \n     flaps of tissue must be cut and sculpted to patch or replace \n     a missing or damaged area. It can take several weeks to tell \n     how well the operation worked.\n       At the end of the week in Dodoma, the surgeons said that of \n     the 20 operations, some were straightforward and easy, and a \n     few seemed likely to fail. Three patients needed such \n     complicated repairs that they were referred to the \n     Kilimanjaro medical center.\n       At first, it seemed as if Ms. Jonas's operation had worked, \n     while Ms. Swalehe's outlook was uncertain. Shortly after \n     their surgeries, the two young women were violently ill. Ms. \n     Swalehe wept from pain when the surgeons came in to check on \n     her. But both women were smiling the next day, hoping for the \n     best. (Ultimately, Ms. Jonas's surgery failed, and Ms. \n     Swalehe's succeeded.)\n       One day after the last operation, the fistula surgeons \n     moved on, already thinking about the countless new cases that \n     awaited them.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, if I could understand the order, do I \nunderstand that the time is equally divided between the proponents and \nopponents of the amendment and that we are to vote at approximately 10 \nafter noon; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WICKER. If I may, let me begin the debate. I understand Senator \nBrownback and others may be coming also. I had, frankly, understood the \ndebate would begin later so I rushed over from a hearing.\n  The Senator from Vermont has questioned the necessity of this \namendment. Actually, I will point out to my colleagues that what the \nWicker amendment does is restore the Kemp-Kasten provision that has \nbeen a part of the foreign policy of this Nation for almost a quarter \ncentury. It has worked well under Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. I submit it would be wrong to change that policy at \nthis point.\n  What does Kemp-Kasten say? Kemp-Kasten says Federal funds, American \ntaxpayer dollars, should not go to fund coercive abortion practices or \ninvoluntary sterilization practices. It prohibits the appropriation of \nAmerican dollars to organizations involved in such activities. But it \nhas always made provision that the President of the United States has \nthe right to investigate and certify whether these organizations have \nbeen engaged in practices involving coercive family planning \nactivities.\n  Should my amendment pass, President Obama would have the same \nauthority President Reagan, President Bush 1, President Bush 2, and \nPresident Clinton had to make this certification. In other words, the \nWicker amendment keeps the Federal policy as it has been, and the \nunderlying bill would amount to a dramatic shift in foreign policy.\n  Why do we need the amendment to begin with? I quote from a letter, \ndated June 26, 2008, from John D. Negroponte,\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\nthe Deputy Secretary of State, to Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen on \nthis question, wherein he writes:\n\n       As reflected in the law and as a matter of longstanding \n     policy, the United States opposes coercive abortion and \n     involuntary sterilization.\n\n  Let me interject at this point. Certainly, that should still be the \npolicy of the United States. That should always be the policy of this \nFederal Government, that we oppose coercive abortion and involuntary \nsterilization.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       I have determined that by providing financial and technical \n     resources through its sixth cycle China Country Program to \n     the National Population and Family Planning Commission and \n     related entities, UNFPA provides support for and participates \n     in management of the Chinese government's program of coercive \n     abortion and involuntary sterilization. If that is true, this \n     Senate, this Congress has no business taking hard-earned tax \n     dollars from taxpayers and sending them to UNFPA, if it, \n     indeed, is true that they participate in the management of \n     this coercive Chinese program.\n\n  If it is not true, the President will be able to make a \ndetermination. But if he investigates the question and finds that such \ncoercion is still being practiced in China and if American dollars, \nthrough UNFPA, are being used to assist the program, then I would hope \nhe would truthfully make the determination and, once again, it would \nnot be a matter of the U.S. taxpayer funding such awful practices.\n  Now, let me read, then, from the Analysis of Determination that Kemp-\nKasten Amendment Precludes Funding to UNFPA, which was attached to \nSecretary Negroponte's letter.\n  The analysis says:\n\n       China's birth limitation program retains harshly coercive \n     elements in law and practice, including coercive abortion and \n     involuntary sterilization.\n\n  That is what this debate is about. Do we want tax dollars of American \nworkers to go for coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization?\n  The analysis goes on to say:\n\n       These measures include the implementation of birth \n     limitation regulations, the provision of obligatory \n     contraception services, and the use of incentives and \n     penalties to induce compliance.\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       [I]t is the provinces that establish detailed birth \n     limitation policies by regulation, enforce their compliance \n     and punish noncompliance.\n\n  Quoting from the second page of this analysis:\n\n       China's birth limitation program relies on harshly coercive \n     measures, such as so-called ``social maintenance'' fees . . . \n     the threat of job loss or demotion, loss of access to \n     education--\n\n  If Chinese citizens do not comply with these harsh measures--\n\n     extreme social pressure, and economic incentives.\n       In families that already have two children, one parent is \n     often pressured to undergo sterilization.\n\n  On the third page:\n\n       Since fiscal year 2002, the Administration has reviewed \n     annually UNFPA's program in China and determined that the \n     U.S. cannot fund UNFPA in light of its support or \n     participation in the management of China's program of \n     coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\n\n  Let's be careful. I would say to my colleagues, let's be careful with \nAmerican tax dollars. Let's keep the provision that allows the \nPresident of the United States to make this determination. If there is \nevidence to prove that American tax dollars would be used by the United \nNations to fund these coercive practices, then, for God's sake, let's \nnot allow the U.S. taxpayers to be a party to these abhorrent and \ncoercive practices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nWicker amendment. I am very appreciative Senator Wicker has brought up \nthis amendment. This is an issue we have debated for some time, the \nKemp-Kasten language, although it has been in since 1985. Our \ncolleagues have put it in there. One of the prime authors of that \nlanguage, then-Congressman Kemp, is struggling with illnesses himself \nright now, and I certainly wish him and his family well. They have been \nin my prayers.\n  I want to put a personal feel and touch on this issue. This is a \nstory about a young couple in China.\n  Yang Zhongchen was a small-town businessman, and he wined and dined \nthree Government officials for permission to become a father. It is a \nstory for which I am paraphrasing some pieces and others I am taking \ndirectly out of an AP story that was filed in 2007, to give you a \ntexture of what we are talking about.\n  Here is a young, small-town businessman. He goes to Government \nofficials, and he says: Look, I want to be a dad. I want to be a \nfather. He wines and dines the local officials. ``But,'' as the AP \nwriter writes, ``the Peking duck and liquor weren't enough. One night, \na couple of weeks before [his wife's] date for giving birth, Yang's \nwife was dragged from her bed in a north China town and taken to a \nclinic, where, she says, her baby was killed by injection while still \ninside her.''\n  Quoting from her:\n\n       ``Several people held me down, they ripped my clothes aside \n     and the doctor pushed a large syringe into my stomach,'' says \n     Jin Yani, a shy, petite woman with a long ponytail. ``It was \n     very painful. . . . It was all very rough.''\n       Some 30 years after China decreed a general limit of one \n     child per family, resentment still brews over the state's \n     regular and sometimes brutal intrusion into intimate family \n     matters. Not only are many second pregnancies aborted, but \n     even to have one's first child requires a license.\n       Seven years after the dead baby was pulled from her body \n     with forceps, Jin remains traumatized and, the couple and a \n     doctor say, unable to bear children. Yang and Jin have made \n     the rounds of government offices pleading for restitution--\n     [all] to no avail.\n\n  This is a 2007 Associated Press story which I ask unanimous consent \nbe printed at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, there is no reason to change this \nKemp-Kasten language we have had since 1985. There is every reason to \nkeep it, to provide this Presidential discretion. I have held hearings \nin the Senate where we have had people come in who have gone undercover \nin investigating forced abortions and sterilizations in China who have \ncome back with traumatic and dramatic stories about this continuing to \ntake place. It should not continue to take place, and it certainly \nshould not happen with any sort of support--tacit, implicit, or actual, \nor financial--from the U.S. Government.\n  Clearly, the U.S. citizenry would be completely opposed to doing \nanything like this, and in tough budgetary times, this certainly does \nnot help our economy grow. It is a policy people broadly oppose of any \nsort of support for forced abortions or sterilizations. It is something \nfor which there would probably be 90 percent agreement in this country \nthat we should not fund or support forced sterilizations or abortions \nanywhere--probably 95 percent. Maybe it is 98 percent.\n  So this policy that has stood since 1985 has broad bipartisan \nsupport. Why would we change it at this point in time, with the \nfinancial difficulties we have, the broad bipartisan support that it is \nnot the right way to go, and the continued evidence that this continues \nto be the case today in places such as China and other countries around \nthe world?\n  I do not see the reason why we would want to go a different way. It \ndoes not make any sense to me we would want to go a different way. I \nthink this is not a good foreign policy for the United States to be \nengaged in. I do not think it is a policy the American taxpayers \nsupport.\n  I think if we would actually do some thorough digging throughout \nChina--where many of these decisions are made and the actions are \nactually happening at the provincial level--we would find a lot more of \nthis going on than we would care to know about because a number of \nthese quota numbers are given to local officials who do not have much \noversight on a national basis, and so they act on their own accord, and \nthen a lot of bad things happen. We would not want to be anywhere near \nany of that. The American people do not want us anywhere near any of \nthat.\n  For those reasons, I would urge my colleagues to look at this. This \nis a time-honored policy that has served us well. Support Senator \nWicker's language that reinstates Kemp-Kasten, language that has stood \nus well in the test of time, and let's not go down a\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\ndifferent road that is going to be harmful to a lot of people and is \ndisagreed to by the American public.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Aug. 30, 2007]\n\n        Chinese Victims of Forced Late-Term Abortion Fight Back\n\n                           (By Alexa Olesen)\n\n       Qian'an, China.--Yang Zhongchen, a small-town businessman, \n     wined and dined three government officials for permission to \n     become a father.\n       But the Peking duck and liquor weren't enough. One night, a \n     couple of weeks before her date for giving birth, Yang's wife \n     was dragged from her bed in a north China town and taken to a \n     clinic, where, she says, her baby was killed by injection \n     while still inside her.\n       ``Several people held me down, they ripped my clothes aside \n     and the doctor pushed a large syringe into my stomach,'' says \n     Jin Yani, a shy, petite woman with a long ponytail. ``It was \n     very painful. . . . It was all very rough.''\n       Some 30 years after China decreed a general limit of one \n     child per family, resentment still brews over the state's \n     regular and sometimes brutal intrusion into intimate family \n     matters. Not only are many second pregnancies aborted, but \n     even to have one's first child requires a license.\n       Seven years after the dead baby was pulled from her body \n     with forceps, Jin remains traumatized and, the couple and a \n     doctor say, unable to bear children. Yang and Jin have made \n     the rounds of government offices pleading for restitution--to \n     no avail.\n       This year, they took the unusual step of suing the family \n     planning agency. The judges ruled against them, saying Yang \n     and Jin conceived out of wedlock. Local family planning \n     officials said Jin consented to the abortion. The couple's \n     appeal to a higher court is pending.\n       The one-child policy applies to most families in this \n     nation of 1.3 billion people, and communist officials, often \n     under pressure to meet birth quotas set by the government, \n     can be coldly intolerant of violators.\n       But in the new China, economically powerful and more open \n     to outside influences, ordinary citizens such as Yang and Jin \n     increasingly are speaking out. Aiding them are social \n     campaigners and lawyers who have documented cases of forced \n     abortions in the seventh, eighth or ninth month.\n       Chen Guangcheng, a self-taught lawyer, prepared a lawsuit \n     cataloguing 20 cases of forced abortions and sterilizations \n     in rural parts of Shandong province in 2005, allegedly \n     carried out because local officials had failed to reach \n     population control targets.\n       Chen, who is blind, is serving a prison sentence of three \n     years and four months which his supporters say was meted out \n     in retaliation for his activism.\n       Many countries ban abortion after 12 or sometimes 24 weeks \n     of pregnancy unless the mother's life is at risk. While China \n     outlaws forced abortions, its laws do not expressly \n     prohibit or even define late-term termination.\n\n\n                           A family unplanned\n\n       Jin, an 18-year-old high school dropout from a broken home, \n     met 30-year-old Yang, a building materials supplier, in \n     September 1998. They moved in together. A year and a half \n     later, in January or February 2000, they discovered Jin was \n     pregnant but couldn't get married right away because she had \n     not reached 20, the marriage age.\n       After her birthday in April, Jin bought porcelain cups for \n     the wedding and posed for studio photos. On May 5, they were \n     married.\n       Now all that was missing was the piece of paper allowing \n     them to have a child. So about a month before Jin's due date, \n     her husband Yang set out to curry favor with Di Wenjun, head \n     of the neighborhood family planning office in Anshan, the \n     couple's home town about 190 miles east of Beijing.\n       He faced a fine of $660 to $1,330 for not having gotten a \n     family planning permit in advance, so he treated Di to the \n     Peking duck lunch on Aug. 15, 2000, hoping to escape with a \n     lower fine since this was his first child.\n       The next day he paid for another meal with Di and the \n     village's Communist Party secretary and accountant.\n       He said the mood was cordial and that the officials toasted \n     him for finding a young wife and starting a family.\n       ``They told me `We'll talk to our superiors. We'll do our \n     best. Wait for our news.' So I was put at ease,'' Yang said.\n       But three weeks later, on Sept. 7, when Yang was away \n     opening a new building supplies store, Jin was taken from her \n     mother-in-law's home and forced into having the abortion.\n       Why had the officials failed to make good on their \n     assurances? One of Yang's two lawyers, Wang Chen, says he \n     believes it was because no bribe was paid.\n       ``Dinner is not enough,'' Wang said. ``Nothing gets done \n     without a bribe. This is the situation in China. Yang was too \n     naive.''\n       Di, who has since been promoted to head of family planning \n     for all of Anshan township, could not be reached. Officials \n     who answered his office phone refused to take a message and \n     gave a cell phone number for him that was out of service.\n\n\n                      Late-term procedures decline\n\n       Zhai Zhenwu, a sociology professor at the People's \n     University Institute of Demographic Studies in Beijing, said \n     that while forced, late-term abortions do still occur \n     sporadically, they have fallen sharply.\n       In the late '80s and early '90s, he said, some family \n     planning officials ``were really radical and would do very \n     inappropriate things like take your house, levy huge fines, \n     force you into procedures.''\n       Things have improved since a propaganda campaign in 1993 to \n     make enforcement more humane and the enactment of the family \n     planning law in 2001, he said. Controls have been relaxed, \n     allowing couples in many rural areas to have two children \n     under certain conditions.\n       Still, Radio Free Asia reported this year that dozens of \n     women in Baise, a small city in the southern province of \n     Guangxi, were forced to have abortions because local \n     officials failed to meet their population targets.\n       In the province's Bobai county, thousands of farmers rioted \n     in May after family planners levied huge fines against people \n     with too many children. Those who didn't pay were told their \n     homes would be demolished and their belongings seized.\n       Yang and Jin are suing the Family Planning Bureau in their \n     county of Changli for $38,000 in medical expenses and \n     $130,000 for psychological distress.\n       But it's not about the money, said Yang, a fast-talking \n     chain-smoker. No longer able to afford to run his business, \n     he now works as a day laborer in Qian'an, an iron mining town \n     east of Beijing.\n       ``What I want is my child and I want the court to \n     acknowledge our suffering,'' he said.\n       A family planning official in Changli justified Jin's \n     abortion on the grounds she lacked a birth permit. The woman, \n     who would only give her surname, Fu, said no one in the \n     clinic was punished for performing the procedure.\n\n\n                         Contradictory evidence\n\n       The National Population and Family Planning Commission, the \n     agency overseeing the one-child policy, says it is looking \n     into Jin and Yang's case. Meanwhile, the evidence appears \n     contradictory.\n       Jin's medical records include a doctor's certificate from \n     2001, the year after the abortion, confirming she could not \n     have children. Doctors in Changli county say they examined \n     her in 2001 and 2002 and found nothing wrong with her.\n       The court ruling says Jin agreed to have the operation. Jin \n     says the signature on the consent form is not hers but that \n     of Di, the official her husband courted.\n       Sun Maohang, another of the Yangs' lawyers, doubts the \n     court will rule for the couple lest it encourage further \n     lawsuits. But he hopes the case will stir debate and lead to \n     clearer guidelines on abortion.\n       As she waits for the next round in court, Jin says she is \n     too weak to work and has been celibate for years because sex \n     is too painful.\n       Her husband prods her to tell her story, but during an \n     interview she sits silent for a long time and finally says \n     she doesn't want to talk about the past because it's too sad.\n       Then she quietly insists the lawsuit is something she has \n     to do for Yang Ying, the baby girl she carried but never got \n     to see or hold.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, may I inquire of the Chair as to how the \nremainder of time will be divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the Senator from Vermont has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Chair.\n  I would inquire of the Senator from Vermont if he has further \nspeakers?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, responding on the time of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, I believe there may be some, and we are trying to \nascertain that right now. I know I am going to speak some more.\n  Mr. WICKER. Reclaiming my time, I await their remarks, and I yield \nthe floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 1 minute 45 seconds for the \nSenator from Mississippi, and 10 minutes for the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is hard to respond to all the things \nthat have been misstated about the amendment before us.\n  For one thing, the bill before us does not change the Kemp-Kasten \namendment. You can find it on page 763 of the bill. It is in the bill. \nIn fact, let me read what it says:\n\n       Provided further, That none of the funds made available in \n     this Act nor any unobligated balances from prior \n     appropriations Acts may be made available to any organization \n     or program which, as determined by the\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\n     President of the United States, supports or participates in \n     the management of a program of coercive abortion or \n     involuntary sterilization.\n\n  So there is no need to pass the amendment of the Senator from \nMississippi to put that language in--I suppose we could just print it \ntwice--it is already in there.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from Vermont \nwill yield on that point?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will yield on the time of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, I do not ask for that, Madam President. Now, I \nasked if the Senator will yield on his time. I yielded to him on my \ntime just a moment ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have heard it said several times that \nwe should not spend U.S. taxpayer dollars on coercive abortion. I agree \nwith the Senator from Mississippi. We should not. I have taken that \nposition. I have been chairman or ranking member of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee several times. I have always taken that \nposition. We should not, we don't, we never have. It is prohibited in \nthe bill--Republicans and Democrats have always agreed about that. I \ndon't know how many times we have to say it.\n\n  I am reminded of Senator Mark Hatfield, a revered member of the \nRepublican Party and a former chairman of the Appropriations Committee. \nI know of no stronger pro-life opponent of abortion, but there is also \nno stronger pro-life proponent of family planning. He knows that if \nthere are voluntary family planning services, you are most apt to avoid \nunwanted pregnancies and thus avoid abortion.\n  Now, we have heard Senators say: Well, we don't want to use taxpayer \nmoney for coerced abortions. You can't. There is no money in here with \nwhich it can be done. We specifically prohibit that.\n  But let me repeat for my colleagues what this amendment does do. The \nWicker amendment removes funds we have in here for UNFPA to promote the \nabandonment of female genital mutilation and child marriage. The funds \ncan be used in countries where we don't have USAID programs, to help \nprevent child marriage. The Senator from Mississippi would remove those \nfunds. I have listened to some of the harrowing stories: 7, 8 or 9 \nyear-old girls forced into marriage. We ought to all unite to try to \nstop that, but the Senator from Mississippi takes out the funds that \ncan be used to try to stop that.\n  Obstetric fistula--anybody who is familiar with that knows how \nterrible it is, a debilitating condition that can destroy the life of \nany woman who suffers from it, but it can be cured by surgery. If any \nmember of our family was faced with that, of course they would have the \nsurgery to fix it. The funds are not there, not available in many \ncountries. But there are funds in the bill so UNFPA can help women with \nthat terrible condition. The amendment of the Senator from Mississippi \ntakes that money out. I can't support something like that.\n  We have funds in the bill to reestablish maternal health care in \nareas where medical facilities and services have been destroyed or \nlimited by natural disasters. We put in funds to rebuild those health \nservices, but the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi takes that \nmoney out.\n  We are talking about countries where the average person doesn't earn \neven $100 a year. We ought to think about it, as the wealthiest, most \npowerful Nation on Earth, where there is a certain God-given moral duty \nto help people less privileged, but the amendment of the Senator from \nMississippi takes that money out.\n  Are we concerned with coercion and forced abortion in China, as the \nSenator from Mississippi and the Senator from Kansas said? Of course. I \nhave no doubt that they find that morally repugnant. I totally agree \nwith the Senator from Mississippi. I totally agree with him that forced \nabortions are wrong. I totally agree with the Senator from Kansas about \nthat. That is why, when Senator Gregg and I brought this bill to the \nAppropriations Committee, we prohibited any funds going to China. We \nprohibit any funds for abortion. We prohibit those things. It is not \ncorrect to suggest otherwise.\n  I don't know what kind of political points are made by bringing up \nthis kind of an amendment, but explain those political points to the \nmother of a 5-year-old who has been raped in the Congo. Explain those \npolitical points to a mother, herself a child, who is giving birth and \nnow has the problem of obstetric fistula, and we can't do anything to \nhelp her. Explain it to those families in war-ravaged countries where \nthe U.S. does not have programs. Explain to them when they ask: Why \ncan't you help us--a wealthy nation like America--why can't you help \nus? And the answer is because we are making a political point.\n  I don't accept that. I oppose this amendment with every fiber of my \nbody.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Vermont has 1 \nminute remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 45 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I am prepared to close, and I assume the \nSenator from Vermont will do so also.\n  The Senator from Vermont says the money in this bill will go to \nsanitization, to protect against child marriage, to protect against \nfemale genital mutilation, to promote maternal health care. No one \nobjects to that. If the President of the United States, under the \nWicker amendment and under the 25-year-old Kemp-Kasten provision, can \ncertify that such organizations do not promote coercion in the name of \nfamily planning, then the money will go to these worthy causes. The \nquestion is, Why does the Senator from Vermont and the people who agree \nwith him on this issue not trust the President of their own political \nparty to make a determination?\n  Now, the Senator says that the Kemp-Kasten language is still in the \nbill. I would submit that, in fact, is not true. The bill purports to \nretain Kemp-Kasten, but it goes on to say that funds will be directed \nto the United Nations Population Fund ``notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law.'' I say to my friend from Vermont, that is the change \nin the law that guts Kemp-Kasten, that changes 23 years to 25 years of \nFederal policy and allows U.S. taxpayer dollars to be spent for \ncoercive sterilization, for forced abortion, and that is the issue. \nYes, Kemp-Kasten is purported to be in the bill, and then it is gutted \nin the next paragraph.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe women around the world should \nhave access to safe health care that will help them plan their families \nand stay free of diseases.\n  These are basic rights. That is why I rise in opposition to the \namendment being offered by Senator Wicker to block funding to the \nUnited Nations Population Fund.\n  In the developing world, ``complications from pregnancy'' is still \none of the leading causes of death for women.\n  More than half a million women die each year--one every minute--from \npreventable complications of pregnancy and childbirth.\n  Madam President, 201 million women can not get access to safe, modern \ncontraception even w en they want it, and 6,800 new cases of HIV occur \nevery day.\n  With its mission ``to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every \nbirth is safe, every young person is free of HIV/AIDS, and every girl \nand woman is treated with dignity and respect,'' the United Nations \nPopulation Fund is working every day to make things better.\n  For nearly 40 years, UNFPA has provided more than $6 billion in aid \nto about 150 countries for voluntary family planning and maternal and \nchild health care.\n  They are helping more women survive childbirth.\n  They are providing contraceptives to help women plan their families \nand stay free of HIV/AIDS.\n  They are promoting access to basic services, including clean water, \nsanitation facilities, food, and health care for poor women and girls.\n  Yet Senator Wicker and other supporters of this amendment would deny\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\nwomen around the world this basic care because they believe \nmisinformation that has been spread by antichoice lobbyists who say \nthis fund would pay for coerced abortions.\n  The reality is that our government already prohibits any money from \nbeing used to fund coerced abortions. And, no U.S. money goes to China.\n  This bill actually continues that policy.\n  So all Senator Wicker's amendment would do is prevent women around \nthe world from getting access to basic health care services--services \nthat we take for granted here in the United States.\n  All of us would agree that we want to see fewer abortions in the \nworld. I certainly do not condone funding coercive abortion practices \nin China or anywhere else.\n  And I cannot accept that we would deny women life-saving care because \nof a dishonest lobbying campaign.\n  Not only is contributing to UNFPA the right thing to do--it is in our \nbest interest.\n  By helping to lift families out of poverty, and slow the spread of \ndisease, we can reduce conflicts and bring stability and hope to some \nof the most troubled regions in the world.\n  I am proud that President Obama is pledging to refund UNFPA after the \nprevious administration consistently canceled funding for the agency.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote down the Wicker amendment.\n  So let me simply say that I believe that women around the world \nshould have access to safe health care that will help them plan their \nfamilies and stay free of diseases. These are basic rights, and that is \nwhy I oppose the amendment that is being offered by Senator Wicker to \nblock funding to the United Nations Population Fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nConrad), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Johanns) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. \nSessions).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 81 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Collins\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Conrad\n     Johanns\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Sessions\n  The amendment (No. 607), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, at 1 o'clock today, Democrats and \nRepublicans have been invited to the White House to work on health \ncare. That is going to take 4 hours. There are Senators here who are \ngoing to be working. We have a number of Senators on our side who wish \nto speak on the five remaining amendments that have been offered. So we \nwill continue to work on those.\n  What we are trying to work out with the minority staff is to have a \nseries of votes starting at 5:30 this afternoon and then continue \nworking through these amendments. I had a conversation with the \nRepublican leader today, who suggested Senators Sessions and Grassley \nhad amendments. I have spoken with Senator Grassley. Senator Sessions \nwas not available. Senator Grassley is trying to make a determination \nif he wants to offer the amendment. I had a conversation with him. So \nthat is where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, if I might add, if we could vote on \nall amendments that are now pending at 5:30 p.m., I think that would \ngive us a better chance to figure out the way forward.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend, if I didn't say that, \nthat is what I wanted to say. I have had a number of people on my \nside--for example, I just spoke with Chairman Kerry. He is going to \ncome and speak on the Kyl amendment. He will finish lunch and do that. \nAnyone who has speeches they want to give on these five amendments must \ncome before 5:30 p.m. because we are going to enter into that agreement \nas soon as we can, which will be very quickly. We will have all those \nvotes at 5:30 p.m. and decide anything else we have to do. We \nunderstand that. A number of people contacted me about amendments on my \nside and on the Republican side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me add, I think at that point, we \nwill be able to determine what additional amendments Members on my side \nwish to offer and figure out where we go from there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burris are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BURRIS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I return to the floor to talk about this \nbill before us which includes 9,000 earmarks and a 1,844-page statement \nof managers that accompanies this 1,122 page bill. When the Congress \nestablishes its funding priorities, it should do so decisively without \ncause for subjective interpretation or reference to material outside \nthe bill passed by Congress and signed by the President. These funding \npriorities should have the binding force of law, subject only to the \nPresident's veto power.\n  Yet here we are with a statement of managers that totals 1,844 pages, \nincluding 775 pages identifying over 9,000 Members' earmark requests \nthat are expected to be funded, although most of them are not contained \nin the bill text. Because they are conveniently not listed in the bill \ntext, Members who question the merits of specific earmarks are unable \nto offer an amendment to specifically strike them.\n  They are wasteful. They should not be funded. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       $1.7 million for pig odor research in Iowa; $2 million for \n     the promotion of astronomy in Hawaii; $6.6 million for \n     termite research in New Orleans; $2.1 million for the Center \n     for Grape Genetics in New York; $650,000 for beaver \n     management in North Carolina and Mississippi; $1 million for \n     mormon cricket control in Utah; $332,000 for the design and \n     construction of a school sidewalk in Franklin, Texas; \n     $870,000 for wolf breeding facilities in North Carolina and \n     Washington; $300,000 for the Montana World Trade Center; \n     $1.7M ``for a honey bee factory'' in Weslaco, TX; $951,500 \n     for Sustainable Las Vegas; $143,000 for Nevada Humanities to \n     develop and expand an\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\n     online encyclopedia; $475,000 to build a parking garage in \n     Provo City, Utah; $200,000 for a tattoo removal violence \n     outreach program in the LA area; $238,000 for the Polynesian \n     Voyaging Society in Honolulu, Hawaii; $100,000 for the \n     regional robotics training center in Union, SC; $1,427,250 \n     for genetic improvements of switchgrass; $167,000 for the \n     Autry National Center for the American West in Los Angeles, \n     CA; $143,000 to teach art energy; $100,000 for the Central \n     Nebraska World Trade Center; $951,500 for the Oregon Solar \n     Highway; $819,000 for catfish genetics research in Alabama; \n     $190,000 for the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, WY; \n     $209,000 to improve blueberry production and efficiency in \n     GA; and  $400,000 for copper wire theft prevention efforts.\n       $250,000 to enhance research on Ice Seal populations; \n     $238,000 for the Alaska PTA; $150,000 for a rodeo museum in \n     South Dakota; $47,500 to remodel and expand a playground in \n     Ottawa, IL; $285,000 for the Discovery Center of Idaho in \n     Boise, ID; $632,000 for the Hungry Horse Project; $380,000 \n     for a recreation and fairground area in Kotzebue, AK; \n     $118,750 for a building to house an aircraft display in \n     Rantoul, IL; $380,000 to revitalize downtown Aliceville, AL; \n     $380,000 for lighthouses in Maine; $190,000 to build a Living \n     Science Museum in New Orleans, LA; $7,100,000 for the \n     conservation and recovery of endangered Hawaiian sea turtle \n     populations; $900,000 for fish management; $150,000 for \n     lobster research; $381,000 for Jazz at Lincoln Center, New \n     York; $1.9 million for the Pleasure Beach Water Taxi Service \n     Project, CT; $238,000 for Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for \n     curriculum development; $95,000 for Hawaii Public Radio; \n     $95,000 for the state of New Mexico to find a dental school \n     location; $143,000 for the Dayton Society of Natural History \n     in Dayton, OH; $190,000 for the Guam Public Library; $143,000 \n     for the Historic Jazz Foundation in Kansas City, MO; \n     $3,806,000 for a Sun Grant Initiative in SD; and $950,000 for \n     a Convention Center in Myrtle Beach, SC.\n       The Army Corps of Engineers has the distinction of having \n     the largest number of individual earmarks imposed among all \n     of the federal agencies funding in this legislation, with an \n     amazing 1,849 individually identified earmarked projects as \n     identified by the Appropriations Committee. Examples include:\n       $670,000 for Abandoned Mine Restoration in California; \n     $59,000 for Dismal Swamp and Dismal Swamp Canal in Virginia; \n     $2 million for Chesapeake Bay Oyster Recovery in Maryland and \n     Virginia; $3 million for Joseph G. Minish Waterfront in New \n     Jersey; $18 million for Middle Rio Grande Restoration in New \n     Mexico; $10 million for North Dakota Environmental \n     Infrastructure;  $5.56 million for Northern Wisconsin \n     Environmental Assistance; $546,000 for Surfside-Sunset-\n     Newport Beach in California; $3.8 million for Mississippi \n     River Levees; and $41.180 million for Yazoo Basin in \n     Mississippi (this is a total for all of the Yazoo Basin \n     projects listed under MRT--Construction).\n       We're giving billions of dollars to 1,849 projects--some \n     which are authorized--but with no clear understanding of what \n     our nation's water infrastructure priorities actually are or \n     should be. We witnessed how lives literally depend on these \n     projects and yet we're just throwing money at them without \n     the benefit of any realistic or transparent set of criteria. \n     It is long overdue for Congress to take a hard look at how \n     our Army Corps dollars are being spent and whether or not \n     they're actually going to the most necessary projects.\n       While the Corps

Mr. President, examples of earmarks on this list include \n$870,000 for wolf-breeding facilities in North Carolina and \nWashington--not anyplace else but North Carolina and Washington State; \n$1,427,250 for genetic improvements of switchgrass; $100,000 for the \ncentral Nebraska World Trade Center; $819,000 for catfish genetics \nresearch in Alabama; $250,000 to enhance research on ice seal \npopulations; $47,500 to remodel and expand a playground in Ottawa, IL; \n$285,000 for the Discovery Center of Idaho in Boise; $632,000 for the \nHungry Horse Project; $380,000 for a recreation and fairground area in \nAlaska; $190,000 to build a living science museum in New Orleans, LA; \n$7,100,000 for the conservation and recovery of endangered Hawaiian sea \nturtle populations; $900,000 for fish management; $381,000 for jazz at \nLincoln Center, New York; $238,000 for the Pittsburgh Symphony \nOrchestra for curriculum development; $95,000 for Hawaii Public Radio; \n$143,000 for the Dayton Society of Natural History in Dayton, OH; \n$193,000 for the Guam Public Library; $143,000 for the Historic Jazz \nFoundation in Kansas City, MO; and $950,000 for a convention center in \nMyrtle Beach, SC.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  The fact is, this has been stated by members of the administration, \nincluding, incredibly, the President's Budget\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\nDirector as ``last year's business.'' This is this year's business. \nThis is funding that will be provided this year. This is 1,122 pages of \na bill accompanied by 1,844 pages of porkbarrel earmark projects. It is \nnot last year's business; it is this year's business. If it is last \nyear's business, then if it is passed by the Senate and the House, send \nit down to Crawford, TX, and have it signed by last year's President. \nIt won't be. It will be signed by this year's President, when it should \nbe vetoed by this year's President.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues, again, that over the course of the \nlast campaign I talked about earmarks. I have been fighting against \nthem for years, and I was severely critical of Republicans who were in \ncharge and frittered away our responsibilities as fiscal conservatives \nand paid a very heavy price for it. The then candidate and now \nPresident of the United States also stated repeatedly his opposition to \nearmarks, and he had stopped asking for earmarks, even though his first \n2 years he had many millions of dollars in earmarks.\n  The President should veto this bill and send it back to Congress and \ntell them to clean it up.\n  Last week, President Obama commented on the fiscal 2010 budget \nblueprint after the Democratic-controlled Congress passed a $1.2 \ntrillion stimulus bill. He said he had inherited a $1 trillion budget \ndeficit from the prior administration. Again, I say, the Republican \nParty lost its way in recent years because we gave in to higher \nGovernment spending and porkbarrel spending and it bred corruption. We \nhave former Members of Congress residing in Federal prison. As a \nresult, the Republican Party paid a price for it at the polls.\n  That said, I think we have to be honest about the bill that is before \nus. It is a massive bill, here for our consideration because the House \nDemocratic leadership--specifically, the Speaker and House \nAppropriations Committee chairman--made a calculated decision last \nyear. They were faced with a threat from President Bush to veto each of \nthese combined appropriations bills that exceeded his budget request. \nAs a result, they decided to put the Federal Government under a \ncontinuing resolution and wait for the outcome of the election in hopes \nthat a new administration would be more willing to go along with the \npork-laden projects that have been inserted into every aspect of this \nswollen, wasteful, egregious example of out-of-control spending. Their \nwish came true. Elections have consequences and this bill is one of \nthem.\n  As I said earlier, a mere 6 months ago, Candidate Obama vowed he \nwould not support earmarking business as usual when he said during the \ndebate in Oxford, MS: ``We need earmark reform and when I am President, \nI will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money \nunwisely.''\n  Let's start going line by line on this 1,122 pages. Let's start going \nline by line with this 1,844 pages. It is loaded with billions of \ndollars of unnecessary and wasteful spending. Sadly, based on recent \ncomments by some of his top advisers, including the Chief of Staff and \nthe Director of OMB, it doesn't sound as if he is willing to put his \nveto pen to use to back up his vow.\n  The majority party has presented us and the new President with an \noutrageous example of a massive spending bill of more than $410 billion \nthat, I repeat, includes over 9,000 wasteful earmarks. This bill is one \nof the first examples, among what will be many, of whether this \nCongress and this new President are serious about fiscal \nresponsibility. I am not encouraged by this bill, to say the least.\n  If we can't reform earmarking, the best thing to do is to provide the \nPresident with a line-item veto authority. Yesterday, Senator Feingold \nand I, along with Congressman Paul Ryan, introduced legislation to \ngrant the President specific authority to rescind or cancel \ncongressional earmarks, including earmark spending, tax breaks, and \ntariff benefits. Granting the President the authority to propose \nrescissions which then must be approved by the Congress could go a long \nway toward restoring credibility to a system ravaged by congressional \nwaste and special interest pork.\n  Yesterday, there were comments made by some of the leaders of \nCongress who basically said that if the President tries to eliminate \nwasteful and porkbarrel spending, that they can't do it. We hear the \nmajority leader of the Senate who said:\n\n       Since we have been a country we have had the obligation as \n     a Congress to direct spending . . .\n\n  Defending a new spending bill that is bursting with congressional \nearmarks.\n\n       We cannot let spending be done by a bunch of nameless, \n     faceless bureaucrats buried in this town someplace.\n\n  I am asking that we authorize these programs the way this Congress \ndid business for many, many, many, many years--many years. We \nauthorized programs. Then we appropriated. That is why we have the \nauthorization committees we have today. Unfortunately, bills such as \nthis completely bypass the authorizing committees and are put in quite \noften without any consideration, without any authorization, and are \ndirectly related to the influence of the Member of Congress. Somebody \npays for all this. Somebody pays for all of it, and it is our kids and \nour grandkids. That is what is going on. The President of the United \nStates should veto it.\n  I agree with the Senator from Indiana, Evan Bayh, who had an op-ed \npiece in the Wall Street Journal saying:\n\n       The Senate should reject this bill. If we do not, President \n     Obama should veto it.\n\n  I understand that Senator Evan Bayh's op-ed in the Wall Street \nJournal of March 4 was printed in the Record yesterday.\n  So what has happened here? What has happened here, as I have watched \nover the years, is the system got more and more out of control. Yes, we \nhave made a little progress. Now it is easier to identify who put the \nearmark in and who the lobbying group was, but if there is any \ntestimonial to the fact that we have made no progress in the effort to \nreform, it was the vote yesterday on an amendment offered by Senator \nTom Coburn that said we would eliminate 13 earmarks, worth about $9 \nmillion, which were put in by a lobbying organization that is now shut \ndown and under FBI investigation. Remarkable. Remarkable. We couldn't \neven take out porkbarrel projects that were inserted through the \ninfluence of a lobbying organization that has been raided and shut down \nby the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Remarkable. Remarkable.\n  So it is a fight worth having, my friends. I would imagine the Senate \nwill vote and probably this legislation will pass, but it is a very bad \nsignal to send to the American people, and it is a very bad precedent \nfor this administration to begin its first 100 days with the President \nof the United States signing a bill that has 1,844 pages of pork on the \none hand and 1,122 pages of pork on the other.\n  One of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle came to the \nfloor yesterday and said Republicans were guilty as well as Democrats. \nI agree. I agree. I have always said there are three kinds of Members \nof Congress: The Democratic members, Republican members, and \nappropriators.\n  A number of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have voted \nconsistently against eliminating these porkbarrel earmarks. So my \nprediction is, the American people will not stand for this much longer. \nThe American people are beginning to figure out we are mortgaging their \nchildren's and their grandchildren's future. The American people are \nfed up with this kind of a system that breeds corruption. The American \npeople, I don't think, will stand for it, and I think sooner rather \nthan later, you are going to see a rejection of this kind of practice, \nwhich does such damage to our credibility, to our ability to serve, and \nthe ability of us to take care of future generations of Americans, as \nwell as this one.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico.) Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 635, as Modified\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have made no secret of the fact that the \nappropriations bill we have in front of us today is one that I think is \nway too large relative to what we should be doing in light of the fact \nthat 2 weeks ago we passed a $1 trillion stimulus bill which will fund \nmany of the same programs that are funded under this appropriations \nbill.\n  This appropriations bill creates an increase of 8.3 percent in \nfunding over last year's appropriated level, which is the largest \nincreased appropriation, year over year, that we have seen since the \nCarter administration. In fact, an 8.3-percent increase represents more \nthan twice the rate of inflation.\n  Most Americans and families today are trying to survive and live at a \ntime when they are dealing with diminishing revenue coming into their \nhouseholds and certainly are not getting an increase that is the same \nas the rate of inflation. We have an appropriations bill in front of us \ntoday that is more than twice the rate of inflation. So I would daresay \nthe Federal Government is certainly not leading by example when it \ncomes to tightening our belts. I think when American families are \nstruggling to make ends meet and tightening their belts, it is \nimportant that we also do the same thing, and this appropriations bill \nis anything but that. The 8.3-percent increase, as I said, is more than \ntwice the rate of inflation and represents the largest year-over-year \nincrease in appropriations since the Carter administration.\n  Having said that, I expect at the end of the day it is probably going \nto pass in the Senate. What we have tried to do as we have debated it \nis make improvements in it and address different priorities all of us \nbring to this debate.\n  I have one in particular that I think needs to be adopted, an \namendment that needs to be adopted. It is filed, it is pending at the \ndesk, and hopefully we will have a vote on it later today. What it does \nis reduce discretionary spending throughout the bill by $400 million, \nwhich equals the fiscal year 2009 authorized amount from PEPFAR.\n  Now, PEPFAR was an emergency--well, the PEPFAR itself was the Tom \nLantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act, which passed last \nyear. But the Emergency Fund for Indian Safety and Health was \nestablished as part of that legislation. It was an authorization. And \nof the $50 billion that was authorized in the so-called PEPFAR bill, $2 \nbillion of that was set aside to address what are very urgent needs on \nAmerica's Indian reservations, the argument being that there are needs \nthat are great abroad, other places around the world, but we have some \nvery urgent and pressing needs right here at home. So the $2 billion \nauthorization was a 5-year authorization, which would represent $400 \nmillion each year, and what my amendment would do is simply fund at \n$400 million that first-year level of authorization that was created by \nthe PEPFAR legislation we passed last fall.\n  In order to do that, because there wasn't any funding for the \nemergency fund for Indian safety and health in the underlying bill, we \nhave to find the money somewhere else. What my amendment does, very \nsimply, is reduce by one-tenth of 1 percent each program funded in the \nbill. So bear in mind, you have an 8.3-percent increase over last \nyear's appropriated level in the base bill. With my amendment, what you \nwould do is reduce the 8.3-percent increase each of these programs \nwould receive in this bill to 8.2 percent and take that one-tenth of 1 \npercent and distribute it into this emergency fund for Indian safety \nand health, which was created as part of the PEPFAR legislation that we \npassed last fall. It is done in a very straightforward way. It \ndistributes money where it is needed most.\n  Keep in mind it doesn't do anything to the significant funding that \nwas included for many of these same programs that received a portion of \nthe stimulus bill funding we passed a couple of weeks ago.\n  Why is this important to people in Indian Country? There are a number \nof reasons because what that authorization did is, it allowed money, \nmoney that would come through appropriated funds later after it was \nauthorized, to be used for three purposes: One is law enforcement, \npublic safety; one is Indian Health Service and health care on \nreservations; the third one was water development. We separated those \nout in the bill and allocated a certain amount of funding to each of \nthose particular categories.\n  The reason that is so important is because in many places, \nparticularly on Indian reservations, these very basic needs many of us \ntake for granted are not being met. Nationwide, 1 percent of the U.S. \npopulation doesn't have access to safe and adequate drinking water and \nsanitation needs. On Indian reservations, if you can believe this--I \nsaid 1 percent is the average across America. On the Nation's Indian \nreservations that number climbs to 11 percent, and in some parts of \nIndian Country, the worst parts in terms of not having access to some \nof these necessities that most people expect--water and sanitation \nservices--that number climbs to 35 percent. Lack of reliable safe \ndrinking water leads to high incidences of disease and infection. The \nIndian Health Service estimates for each $1 it spends on safe drinking \nwater and sewage systems, it receives a twentyfold return in the form \nof health benefits.\n  The Indian Health Service estimates in order to provide all Native \nAmericans with safe drinking water and sewage systems, they would \nneed--this is the backlog--over $2.3 billion. What we are talking about \nrepresents a small amount of what the need is that exists out there, \nbut that being said, we could go a long way, by enacting this \namendment, toward meeting that need.\n  With respect to health care, nationally Native Americans are three \ntimes as likely to die from diabetes as compared to the rest of the \npopulation. An individual who is served by the Indian Health Service is \n50 percent more likely to commit suicide than the general population. \nAn individual who is served by the Indian Health Service is 6.5 times \nmore likely to suffer an alcohol-related death than the general \npopulation.\n  On the Oglala Sioux Reservation in my State of South Dakota, the \naverage life expectancy for males is 56 years old. I want you to \ncompare that with some other countries around the world. In Iraq, the \naverage life expectancy for a male is 58. In Haiti, it is 59 years. In \nGhana, the average life expectancy for a male is 60 years old--all \nhigher than right here in America. On the Oglala Sioux Reservation in \nmy home State of South Dakota, the average life expectancy for males is \n56.\n  In South Dakota, between 2000 and 2005, Native American infants were \nmore than twice as likely to die as nonnative infants. In South Dakota, \na recent survey found that 13 percent of Native Americans suffer from \ndiabetes. This is twice the rate of the general population, where only \nabout 6 percent suffer from the same disease.\n  With respect to public safety, one out of every three Native American \nwomen will be raped in their lifetimes. According to a recent \nDepartment of Interior report, tribal jails are so grossly insufficient \nwhen it comes to cell space that only half of the offenders who should \nbe incarcerated are being put in jail. That same report found that \nconstructing or rehabilitating only those detention centers that are \nthe most in need would cost $8.4 billion. Again, it is way more than \nwhat we are talking about here. But, certainly, what we could do today, \nin the form of this amendment, would be to put a downpayment on and \nbegin to address what is a very serious need of adequate space for \npeople who have committed crimes.\n  The South Dakota attorney general released a study at the end of last \nyear on tribal criminal justice statistics. That study found that \nhomicide rates on South Dakota reservations are almost 10 times higher \nthan those found in the rest of South Dakota. Forcible rapes on South \nDakota reservations\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\nare seven times higher than those found in the rest of South Dakota. \nThese are all things that statistically point to the very serious \npublic safety needs that exist on America's Indian reservations today \nand point to the importance of us adopting the amendment I will put \nbefore the Senate and have a vote on later today.\n  These critical, unmet needs have consequences in the day-to-day \noperations for tribal courts and law enforcement. I talked about public \nsafety, how that translates. You see all the statistics and data. That \nis stunning enough. But then you talk about how that actually impacts a \nlot of our reservations. I will give a couple examples.\n  At the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Court, a tribe that is a supporter of the \namendment, on June 19, 2008, the tribal prosecutor scheduled to attend \ncourt proceedings that day did not appear at court. Alarmed, the tribal \njudge sent a court employee to the police department to ensure the \nprosecutor was not hurt in an accident. Once it was clear the \nprosecutor was not injured but instead did not show, all cases \nscheduled that day had to be dismissed because no replacement \nprosecutor was available. Cases that were dismissed that day included \nsexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, and DUIs.\n  At Standing Rock Reservation, another example, another reservation \nthat borders or crosses the line in South Dakota and North Dakota--in \nearly 2008, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation had six police officers \nto patrol a reservation that is geographically the size of Connecticut.\n  This meant during any given shift there was only one officer on duty \nto cover that entire area. One day the only dispatcher on the \nreservation was out sick. This left only one police officer to act both \nas a first responder and also as the dispatcher. Not only did this \ndirectly impact the officer's ability to patrol and respond to \nemergencies, it also prevented him from appearing in tribal court to \ntestify at a criminal trial.\n  Later in the year I was able to work with my Senate colleagues in the \nBureau of Indian Affairs to bring additional police officers to the \nStanding Rock Sioux Reservation through Operation Dakota Peacekeeper. \nThat operation, which was a success, was only possible because of the \nBureau of Indian Affairs being able to dramatically increase the number \nof law enforcement officials on the reservation during what we referred \nto as the surge. This dramatic increase in officers was only possible \nbecause the Bureau had been given additional public safety and justice \nfunds in 2008, something I would like to continue with my amendment.\n  The way these dollars would be used, if my amendment is accepted, \nalso is spelled out in the amendment. It is actually spelled out in the \nstatute, the authorization bill. But the $400 million would be \ndistributed as follows: $200 million will go to congressionally \napproved water settlements; $150 million will go to public safety and \njustice; $74 million for detention facility construction, \nrehabilitation, and placement through the Department of Justice; $62 \nmillion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs public safety and justice \naccount which funds tribal police and tribal courts; $6 million for \ninvestigations and prosecution of crimes in Indian Country by the FBI \nand the U.S. attorneys; $6 million would go to the Department of \nJustice Office of Justice Program for Indian and Alaska Native \nPrograms; $2 million for cross-deputization or other cooperative \nagreements between State, local, and tribal governments; $50 million to \nhealth care which would be divided as the Director of Indian Health \nServices determines between contract health services, construction and \nrehabilitation of Indian health facilities, and domestic and community \nsanitation facilities serving Indian tribes.\n  Passage of the original amendment to PEPFAR, which occurred last \nyear, showed a commitment by the Senate on a bipartisan basis to \naddress these domestic priorities that are faced by Native Americans in \nIndian Country. That was a bill that had, and the amendment I offered \nto that bill had, bipartisan cosponsorship. There were a number of \npeople on both sides of the aisle who supported it. Vice President \nBiden was a supporter. Secretary of State Clinton was a cosponsor of \nthe amendment. A number of colleagues have supported the effort we made \nto demonstrate a commitment to addressing these very serious needs, \nwhich I have alluded to that exist today in Indian Country.\n  What my amendment to the Omnibus appropriations bill before us does \nis ensures the underlying bill, the bill that we authorized, actually \ngets funded, and the dollars we committed are actually appropriated for \nthe purpose of addressing these very serious needs.\n  I ask that when this comes to a vote, amendment No. 635, my \ncolleagues support it in the same sort of bipartisan way we were able \nto support the underlying authorization that was approved last year. \nThere is no greater need. The statistics in Indian Country, both in \nSouth Dakota and other reservations in other States, are dire. We, as \nthe Senate, have a responsibility to address those needs, particularly \nat a time when we are already funding or going to pass a bill which \nincreases spending in this appropriations bill by as much as it does.\n  One-tenth of 1 percent is all we are saying would be necessary to \nprovide the $400 million that is necessary to fund this amendment and \nthe important priorities it would serve.\n  I hope my colleagues will be able to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I understand Senator Thune has modified \nhis amendment to correct an earlier drafting error.\n  The original amendment proposed a $400 million across-the-board cut \nagainst the programs funded in the interior division of the bill, as an \noffset to increase funding for various Indian health and safety \nprograms in the interior division by $400 million.\n  As it stands, the modified amendment proposes that the $400 million \nacross-the-board cut now applies to the entire omnibus appropriations \nbill, not just the interior subcommittee's division.\n  Nevertheless, I still oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  This amendment now makes cuts to all programs in the omnibus.\n  This means there will be cuts in job training, law enforcement, \ncancer research, highway funding, food inspection, energy research, and \non, and on, and on.\n  I know that no single cut will be that great, but if we are going to \ngo down this road, where will it end?\n  Who brings the next amendment, claiming that it only cuts 0.1 \npercent?\n  How many more of these will we have to accept before we say we have \ncut enough out of law enforcement or enough out of health care?\n  Mr. President, just to make the record clear, the interior division \nof this bill contains $2.376 billion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand $3.581 billion for the Indian health service.\n  Many of the programs run by those agencies and by the tribes \nthemselves deal directly with health and safety issues.\n  We cannot start chipping away in this fashion and have any hope of \never finishing this bill.\n  Furthermore, the amendment, as modified, causes the interior bill to \nexceed its 302(b) allocation for budget authority. This makes it very \ntroublesome.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might respond to the remarks of the \ndistinguished chairman, and I understand what I am doing here may \ncreate some technicality with regard to the budget rules, but we do \nthis all the time, and we routinely waive the budget. The only reason \nit does is because it does take that one-tenth of 1 percent from across \nthe entire nine appropriations bills as opposed to taking it out of one \nparticular appropriations bill. What that does is attempts to \ndistribute that reduction across the board so no one area is hurt in a \nsignificant way relative to the others.\n  But, again, I would simply point out--and I appreciate what the \nchairman said about these other areas in the budget, these programs \nbeing cut--bear in mind, this is an 8.3-percent increase, year over \nyear, over last year's appropriated level in all these accounts. There \nis not any account in this appropriations bill that is receiving a cut. \nThey are all receiving an increase.\n  The question is, Will it be an 8.3-percent increase or an 8.2-percent \nincrease? What I am simply saying is,\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\nyou make it an 8.2-percent increase and use that one-tenth of 1 percent \nto fund a program this Congress, this Senate voted to authorize last \nyear, specifically, for Indian health care, for water development, and \nfor public safety on our reservations. Of course, there is funding in \nthe underlying bill for some of these things, but none of which is \nadequate to address the need, which is precisely why so many of the \nreservations in my State have the high incidents of crime, the data \nthey have in terms of the many areas I mentioned. When it comes to \nprosecutions, when it comes to detention facilities, when it comes to \nlaw enforcement personnel and officers, we are deficient in the \nresponsibility we have.\n  So, again, it is not a question of whether all the programs that are \nfunded in the bill are going to get an increase. They are all going to \nget an increase, a substantial increase. Under my amendment, it is \nsimply an 8.2-percent increase as opposed to an 8.3-percent increase.\n  It seems to me, at least, the least we can do to honor the commitment \nwe made by passing the emergency fund for Indian safety and health we \npassed last year is to provide funding for it.\n  So I appreciate the chairman's observations. I would simply ask my \ncolleagues to look beyond whatever technicality may be raised with \nregard to where the one-tenth of 1 percent is coming from. It is coming \nfrom all nine appropriations bills across the board as opposed to from \none particular area or account. But that, to me, seems to be the fair \nway in which to do this in a way that distributes that one-tenth of 1 \npercent reduction evenly. So I hope my colleagues will support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 635, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to, first of all, \noppose the Thune amendment, and then to speak in opposition to the \nMurkowski amendment.\n  I rise as chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. In \nits current form, the Interior portion of the omnibus is funded at $27 \nbillion. This section includes a substantial increase for the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs and the Indian Health Service. For fiscal year 2009, the \nbill provides $5.957 billion. This is an increase of $320 million over \nthe fiscal year 2008 bill. It is a 5.7-percent increase. That is a \ngreat deal of money.\n  The Thune measure--well, let me make one other point first. In \naddition, the Recovery Act, which we enacted last month, contained $1 \nbillion for these two agencies. So taken together, the omnibus bill and \nthe recovery act will provide $6.957 billion. That is an increase over \nthe 2008 level of $1.320 billion, or 23 percent. Now, that is what the \nunderlying bill and the recovery act, the stimulus bill, does--a 23-\npercent increase. That is a great deal of money.\n  Senator Thune has proposed an across-the-board cut of 0.1 percent to \nthe entire omnibus to pay for an increase of $400 million for these two \nagencies in addition. That means every account in the entire omnibus \nbill must take a cut.\n  Now, if the Thune amendment were successful, it would increase my \nbill, the Interior bill, by $372 million, which would put us over our \nallocation, which would make germane a point of order against our bill. \nI think that is wrong. I think when we do a substantial increase, I do \nnot understand the need for this. I do not understand why a 23-percent \nincrease, to the tune of $6.957 billion--that is a huge increase, \nprobably one of the greatest increases in any part of this omnibus, and \nthat is the underlying omnibus bill.\n  So I am concerned. I would urge a ``no'' vote on the Thune amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to raise a point of order against the \namendment under section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act. The \npending amendment would increase spending in the Interior Subcommittee \nby $400 million, primarily by cutting spending in the jurisdiction of \nthe eight other subcommittees funded in this act. The amendment, \ntherefore, would result in spending exceeding the budget allocation of \nthe Interior Subcommittee.\n  I make a point of order under section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act that the amendment provides spending in excess of the \nInterior Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation under the fiscal year 2009 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order the \nSenator raised under the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive has been entered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenator concludes her remarks on the other amendment, I have a couple \nminutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to recognizing the Senator \nfrom South Dakota after the Senator from California yields?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 599\n\n  Mr. President, I would now like to speak against amendment No. 599, \noffered by Senator Murkowski, which would limit the Endangered Species \nAct protections for the polar bear and other fragile species.\n  The Interior portion of the omnibus bill as currently written allows \nthe Obama administration to quickly undo two last-minute rules imposed \nby the Bush administration.\n  The first Bush administration rule, issued in December 2008, denies \nthe protections of the Endangered Species Act to the polar bear, \ndespite its threatened status. The omnibus bill language would allow \nthe Obama administration to immediately lift this ruling. This is an \nimportant first step toward fully protecting the polar bear under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  As I said, the amendment would undo the Obama administration's \nability to quickly move to change two last-minute rules imposed by the \nBush administration.\n  The first Bush administration rule, issued in December 2008, denies \nthe protections of the Endangered Species Act to the polar bear, \ndespite its threatened status.\n  The omnibus bill language would allow the Obama administration to \nimmediately lift this ruling. This is an important first step toward \nfully protecting the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The second Bush regulation, also issued in December of 2008, excludes \nindependent wildlife experts from the decisionmaking process of the \nEndangered Species Act. This is major. I think it is wrongheaded \nbecause it would leave the decisionmaking up to the Department that \nhandled whatever the project was without any input from scientists or \nbiologists on the subject. So whichever Federal agency has proposed a \nproject is given the full jurisdiction to determine whether there is an \nimpact to an endangered or threatened species, and independent \nscientists are excluded from the consultation process.\n\n  The omnibus bill, as currently written, allows the Obama \nadministration to quickly undo the Bush rule and return independent \nwildlife experts to this consultation process.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Murkowski would further prolong \nthese two Bush administration rules and require a public comment period \nof 60 days before the Bush rules can be lifted. I cannot support that.\n  In my view, right now the polar bear is not sufficiently protected. \nHere is why. Under the rule issued by the Bush administration, the \npolar bear is only protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. \nThis Federal statute only protects polar bears from direct harm. It \ndoes not address the problem of the arctic habitat of the bears, which \nis literally melting away.\n  I read books. I have watched PBS nature shows, which have shadowed \npolar bears, which have shown the deteriorating ice pack.\n  Let me quote something Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, the former \nSecretary of the Interior, said in May of last year. Here is what he \nsaid. This is a Republican Secretary of the Interior:\n\n       Because polar bears are vulnerable to this loss of [sea \n     ice] habitat, they are, in my judgment, likely to become \n     endangered in the foreseeable future.\n\n  So we know the polar bear is being jeopardized by the deterioration \nof ice. Now, some people, perhaps, do not believe the ice is really \ndeteriorating.\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nBut if you look here, this is the Arctic Sea ice loss. This whole \nthing, as shown on this chart--both the ochre color, the yellowish \ncolor, and the white--is the way it was in 2005. In 2005, this was the \nArctic. In 2007, the Arctic ice mask is 39 percent below the long-term \naverage from 1979 to 2000, and you can clearly see its deterioration in \na 2-year period.\n  So what is happening in the Arctic is actually very dramatic. It is \nactually destroying polar bear habitat, and absent that habitat, the \npolar bear cannot feed himself or herself. The polar bear starves. The \nnature show on PBS actually tracked a female polar bear. It showed her \nstarving. It showed her having two cubs. It showed one of the cubs \ndying of starvation. It showed her struggling to find food floating out \non individual pieces of ice.\n  In my view, there is no question that Secretary Kempthorne was \ncorrect, that the polar bear will very shortly meet the criteria of the \nEndangered Species Act and, therefore, I strongly believe if that is, \nin fact, the case, we should have the proper opportunity to assess it \nand move in that direction.\n  So I am fully supportive of what President Obama has done to move \nrapidly to set up the situation for that kind of consideration. The \nstatute that is in the underlying bill would ensure that melting \nhabitat of the Arctic is taken into consideration. So the omnibus bill \nwill give the Obama administration strengthened authority to quickly \nundo the Bush rule on polar bears and open the door to the process of \napplying the Endangered Species Act to the threatened polar bear.\n  Anyone who looks at the beauty of these animals recognizes their \nsignificance not only to nature but to man and woman as well. This is \nan extraordinary animal. It deserves to be protected. So I am very \nproud we have language in the bill that is supportive of what the \nPresident of the United States is attempting to do. So I thank the \nChair, and I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might briefly respond to the Senator \nfrom California regarding my amendment that deals with Indian health, \npublic safety, and water development.\n  I think it is important to remind everybody, first of all, that this \nbill we have in front of us and the appropriations bills that have been \npassed so far--three of them passed last year--nine of them are bundled \ninto this bill--this bill was written behind closed doors. There wasn't \nany participation by Members, at least that I know of, on our side when \nit came to putting this together and offering amendments at the \ncommittee level. The only opportunity we have to offer amendments is \nwhen a bill comes to the floor of the Senate.\n  Now, it shouldn't come as any surprise to anybody here in the Chamber \nor anybody who is tuning in to what is going on here that that is what \nwe do. We offer amendments. We determine priorities. We move money \naround within appropriations bills. To suggest for a minute that we \nshouldn't be offering amendments to move money from one part of this \nbill to another part of the bill, the fact is that nine appropriations \nbills have been bundled together and we are being asked to vote on $410 \nbillion in spending at one time, and then we are being told we can't \ncome down here and offer amendments. That is what we do. We have 100 \nSenators. All of them come to this Chamber with different priorities. I \ncame down here and said I wanted to offer an amendment that took a one-\ntenth of 1 percent haircut across all nine appropriations bills, evenly \ndistributed, to take $400 million and put it into a program that \nCongress authorized last fall but has not funded that would address the \nneeds of Indian health care, public safety, and water development--\ncritical needs on Indian reservations.\n  I urge any of my colleagues who haven't visited a reservation to come \nto South Dakota and see what I am talking about. I mentioned it \nearlier. The average life expectancy for males on the Oglala Sioux \nReservation in my home State of South Dakota is 56 years. It is 58 in \nIraq, 59 in Haiti, and 60 in Ghana, all higher than right here in \nAmerica. Between 2000 and 2005, Native American infants were more than \ntwice as likely to die as non-native infants. I already mentioned the \npublic safety statistics and the crime data that exist on our \nreservations because we don't have adequate law enforcement personnel, \nwe don't have cops, we don't have prosecutors, we don't have jails, we \ndon't have all the things that are necessary to keep our people safe on \nour reservations in South Dakota.\n  Here may be a budget technicality, a point of order that can be \nraised against my amendment which will require that we have to have 60 \nvotes for my amendment, but all that means is instead of getting 51, we \nneed 60. I can't imagine that we would not have an opportunity--nine \nappropriations bills being bundled together, brought to the floor of \nthe Senate, $410 billion in spending--to come down here and offer \namendments that move money around. That is what Senators do. That is \nwhat we do in the Senate.\n  I hope my colleagues will look past the point of order that is going \nto be raised and say: One-tenth of 1 percent in a bill that is being \nincreased by 8.3 percent year over year; go for this important priority \non Indian reservations across our country.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment or vote to waive \nthe point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like the opportunity to simply \nsay to the Senator from South Dakota that it is not correct there was \nno Republican input into this bill. This bill was put together last \nyear. Senator Allard was the ranking member. Senator Allard and his \nstaff participated in the committee deliberation of this bill. There is \nno question about it. I think we have to remember this is not a 2010 \nappropriations bill; it is a 2009 appropriations bill.\n  I wish to state that the reason we have a 23-percent increase in the \nbill for Indian services and Indian health care is that we recognize \nthere is a need. This is a substantial addition. So my objection to the \namendment should not be construed that I do not want to support Indian \nhealth services or Indian health care. The amendment causes a point of \norder against the bill. We exceed our allocation. It forces every one \nof the nine bills to take a cut and then adds to my bill an additional \n$372 million which forces us up over the limit.\n  This is a bill that has been discussed. It has been discussed with \nthe Republican side. We had agreement on it last year. I believe the \ncommitment should be kept and the bill should be passed. I believe \nthere is an ample increase both for Indian health care and Indian \nservices. So I wanted the opportunity to respond to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota in that regard.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, in a moment I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be set aside so I can offer an \namendment dealing with the DC scholarship program for low-income \nchildren. I wish to talk about it first and give the other side fair \nwarning, because I understand that the other side is going to object, \nwhich is very unfortunate.\n  We have had a wonderful program that recognized DC public schools are \nfailing children of the District of Columbia. Most of those children \nare low income, minority children. A few years ago, under a Republican \nCongress and President Bush, we put together a program that initiated a \nlittle experiment. In DC schools, the dropout rates are high, kids \naren't learning to read at the appropriate levels, they aren't learning \nmath at the appropriate levels; across the board the crime levels are \ntoo high in the schools. Since the vast majority of the schools in the \nDistrict of Columbia are failing the kids, Congress decided to \nexperiment here and see if something works. So we selected 1,700 kids \nand we gave their parents a $7,500 scholarship to be able to go to the \nschool of their choosing in the area. The response by the parents was \noverwhelming. A lot more people wanted to sign up for this program than \nthere were scholarships available, but we at least allowed 1,700 \nchildren to participate for the last five years, this being the sixth \nyear now.\n  In this underlying bill, there is language that effectively kills \nthis program, because it says that unless the\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\nbill is reauthorized and the DC City Council approves the program, no \nfunding shall be allowed to go toward this DC scholarship fund.\n  Now, we know Head Start and the Higher Education Act both continued, \neven though they weren't reauthorized, for many years until we were \nable to come together to reauthorize. That is not uncommon in this \nbuilding because it is difficult to get legislation reauthorized. So we \ncontinued funding Head Start. We continued funding Higher Education. \nBut the No. 1 issue for the National Education Association is to kill \nthe DC scholarship program for poor children. I ask: What are they \nafraid of? Well, as was stated today in the Chicago Tribune, they are \nnot afraid of this program because it is failing; they are afraid of \nthis program because it is actually working. Let's ask a commonsense \nquestion: If this program weren't working, would the children who have \nreceived this scholarship continue in this program? The obvious answer \nis of course they wouldn't. They would go back into their other \nschools.\n  We had a press conference earlier today with some of the parents and \nteachers who are involved in this program. Three wonderful young men \ncame together with us today. We had Fransoir, Richard, and Ronald. Two \nof them had written statements, and then there was little Richard who \ngot up and spoke off the cuff. All three of them were incredibly \narticulate. They were talking about how important this scholarship \nprogram was to them and how they didn't want to go back to the other \nschools because in the schools they are in today, they are actually \nlearning.\n  So do we put the interests of the National Education Association \nfirst, or do we put the interests of our children first? It isn't just \nthese 1,700 kids whose future is at stake. We are trying to look for \nprograms in education, reforms that actually work, because the No. 1 \npriority for our children should be about their education into the \nfuture. If they are going to compete in the 21st century, they have to \nhave a good education. It is the new civil right of our day. It is not \na civil right to stick them in failing schools that are unsafe, that \nare gang ridden, that are drug ridden, that have teachers who are not \nteaching our children in a constructive manner. It is not a civil right \nto say to them: I know other people have more money than you. They can \ngo to a good school and can learn, but we are going to trap you in this \npoor performing school simply because you don't have enough money. \nCivil rights is supposed to be about giving people opportunities, not \nbased on income, not based on race, not based on religion, but simply \nbecause they are Americans who can actually have a chance.\n  So this program is going to show, I believe, as the studies come out \non it, that these kids did better because they had an opportunity. I \nthink this is what the National Education Association is afraid of. \nThey are afraid this program is going to work and it will then be tried \nin other areas. What are we afraid of? Are we afraid we are actually \ngoing to improve education in the United States through an innovative \nprogram?\n  Even yesterday, the Secretary of Education under President Obama made \nthis comment about the DC scholarship program. He said:\n\n       I don't think it makes sense to take kids out of a school \n     where they're happy and safe and satisfied and learning. I \n     think those kids need to stay in their school.\n\n  He was talking about those 1,700 kids who are in the DC schools under \nthis scholarship program today. Two of those children actually go to \nschool with President Obama's children. Unfortunately, the majority \nparty in Congress has written into this bill that we are going to take \nthose kids out of these schools. We are going to effectively eliminate \nthe scholarship that allows them to stay in their schools. One young \nman, Ronald, who was here today is a junior in high school. Ronald is \nalso the Deputy Youth Mayor for Washington DC and has made education \nhis number one priority. Next year Ronald will be a senior. They are \ngoing to take him out of a school he has attended the last 5 or 6 years \nand make him go to a different high school for his senior year. At this \nother high school, it's likely over half the kids aren't learning at \nthe grade level they should be learning at and where about half of them \ndrop out of that school. Instead, Ronald should remain at the school \nthat gave him a future, hope, and opportunity. I wish all Americans \ncould have heard him speaking today, and then I would like to see the \nother side of the aisle vote against this amendment and vote against \nallowing this amendment to even come to a vote.\n  It is very unfortunate that the other side is not allowing us to do \nbut just a few amendments, amendments that they deem worthy to be voted \non. That is not the way the Senate has worked the last several weeks. \nIt has actually been working. As the minority, we realize we have fewer \nvotes on this side. We understand that. We understand we are going to \nlose most of these votes. Occasionally, as last week, we did win one, \nbut most of the time we are losing these votes. That is the way this \nbody is at least supposed to work, you debate amendments and you have \nvotes on the amendments.\n  Unfortunately, with regards to the bill before us, that is not the \ncase. Normally, we vote on appropriations bills one at a time and \nsomewhere around 15 amendments per bill are offered and voted on. We \nhave eight or nine bills combined together and, so far, I think we have \nhad six or seven amendments voted on. We will have a few more voted on \ntonight. That seems to be the total that the majority wants us to vote \non. By the way, the Democrats have come to an agreement that they are \ngoing to defeat them, whether they are meritorious or not, because they \nset a false deadline of tomorrow to finish the bill. They said tomorrow \nthe funding runs out for our Government. In reality, all you have to do \nis pass a continuing resolution that will fund the Government for \nanother week. We could do it on a voice vote, and then the House can do \nit on a voice vote. Then we can come back next week and debate \namendments and have votes on them.\n  This is one of the amendments that needs to be voted on. If you want \nto throw 1,700 kids out of good schools and put them into nonperforming \nschools, I want you recorded on this vote. Some have said this isn't \njust going to poor children. The limit is 185 percent of poverty and \nbelow. That is the limit of the income to qualify for this scholarship \nprogram. The average income for families qualifying for this \nscholarship is $23,000 a year.\n  The National Education Association said this is a threat to public \neducation. Oh, really? First of all, $7,500 is what we give as a \nscholarship. The average spent per student in Washington, DC, public \nschools is around $15,000. So we are spending half that. We didn't give \nthem the full $15,000, just half that. This was in addition to the \nWashington, DC, School District money. But the benefit is, every child \nyou take out of Washington, DC schools, allows money to be spent on \nother students.\n  I have a couple stories to tell you about. Sherine Robinson, the \nparent of an opportunity scholarship recipient, believes parents should \nnot have to worry about violence in their schools. That is one of the \nreasons some of the parents are taking their children out. It is not \njust the educational opportunities, it is the violence they may have to \nexperience while they are in school. She believes the parents should \nnot have to fight for their kids to learn. She believes all parents \nshould have a choice and ``the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program gives \nus a chance to find the best school possible.'' Those are the words of \na parent. She now feels her child is in a safe school and is doing \nwell. Why do we want to deprive her of that opportunity?\n  Obviously, I believe strongly in this scholarship program. I believe \nthis program is working. I believe we can prove it is working \nstatically and spread this program across the country. Let's put our \nchildren first; let's not put special interests before our children and \ntheir education. That is what this argument comes down to.\n  Let's use common sense and put compassion back into this bill. Let's \nallow amendments so we can take care of our kids and educate them in \nthe way they deserve to be educated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthat I be allowed to call up the Ensign amendment No. 615, which \nprovides an\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\nopportunity scholarship for 1,700 poor children in the District of \nColumbia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, on behalf of the leadership, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, this is most unfortunate. It is what I \nthought would happen. There was a rumor going around today that this \nwould happen. I plead with the other side to give these 1,700 children \na chance to learn, a chance to continue in the program that is working \nfor them. I would love to expand the program, but I know that is not \ndoable in this Congress. But let's at least keep these 1,700 \nschoolchildren in school with the ability to learn, in safe schools \nthat are actually giving them hope and opportunity for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 599\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak this afternoon in \nfavor of an amendment I laid down yesterday, No. 599. I wish to respond \nto some comments that have been made on the floor by several \ncolleagues.\n  The amendment I have introduced would modify section 429 of the \nOmnibus appropriations bill that allows the Secretary of the Interior \nand the Secretary of Commerce to withdraw the final rule relating to \nthe ``Interagency Cooperation under the Endangered Species Act,'' and \nthe final rule that relates to the ``Endangered and Threatened Wildlife \nand Plants: Special Rule for the Polar Bear.'' This is a special rule \nfor the polar bear.\n  These provisions allow the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior, or \nboth, to withdraw the two Endangered Species Act rules inserted under \nsection 7 of the ESA within 60 days of adoption of the omnibus bill and \nthen reissue the ESA rule without having to go through any notice or \nany public comment period, and without being subject to any judicial \nreview as to whether their actions were responsible.\n  Neither of the ESA rules that are part of this amendment were \npromulgated in the dark of night. Nothing happened in the back room. \nThe existing rules were the result of a public process that fully \ncomplied with all applicable laws. In fact, one of the rules is under \njudicial review now, as the Administrative Procedures Act allowed.\n  The polar bear 4(d) interim final rule was certainly not a ``midnight \nrule.'' Look at the process it went through. It was announced and made \navailable as a final special rule on May 15 of 2008, concurrent with \nthe announcement of the decision to list the polar bear as threatened \nunder the ESA. That announcement then triggered or opened a 60-day \npublic comment period to all interested parties to submit comments that \nmight contribute to the development of a final rule. Then those \ncomments come in throughout that period. After the comments are \nreceived, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made several appropriate \nrevisions to the final rule.\n  Nothing in this special rule changed the recovery planning provisions \nand the consultation requirements that exist under section 7 of the \nESA. The 4(d) rules that are contained are not exclusions, and they are \nnot exemptions. Under the ESA itself, section 4(d) says that for \nthreatened species, the Secretary may promulgate such regulations as he \ndeems necessary or advisable. So what happened was Secretary Kempthorne \nused this very strict authority to develop a rule that states if an \nactivity is permissible under the stricter standards of the Marine \nMammal Protection Act, it is also permissible under the Endangered \nSpecies Act with respect to the polar bear.\n  I wish to repeat a comment the Senator from California made \nyesterday. It is one I absolutely agreed with. I agree we must follow \nthe process; we must follow the law. The problem is, the House rider \ncircumvents the public process because it completely eliminates the \nlaw. Section 429 doesn't require public notice and doesn't allow public \ncomment or judicial review, as is required by the law.\n  What my amendment does is maintain the public process. It not only \nrequires that any withdrawal or repromulgation of either of these two \nrules follows the Administrative Procedures Act, with at least a 60-day \ncomment period to allow for that adequate public comment. This is the \nsame amount of time the public had to comment on the polar bear 4(d) \ninterim final rule last year.\n  Without this amendment, this provision allows the Secretaries to make \ndramatic changes in rules and regulations, without having to comply \nwith multiple, longstanding Federal laws that require public notice and \ncomment by the American public and knowledgeable scientists. These \nchallenges have the potential for far-reaching and truly unintended \nconsequences in our country.\n  The House rider we are dealing with in this omnibus bill shortchanges \nthe public process. It is certainly not my amendment that shortchanges \nanything or tries to go outside the process. What we are providing in \nthis amendment is ensuring we follow that public process.\n  I ask Members of this body to vote in favor of my amendment to \nmaintain this public process. That is what this amendment does. We owe \nit to ourselves to keep the integrity of the process intact. It is a \ndangerous precedent for this body to set. I ask Members to look very \ncarefully at this amendment and truly attempt to understand the full \nimplications if we are not successful in removing this rider from the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following amendments \nin the order listed; that prior to each vote, except as noted below, \nthere be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that no amendments be in order to any of the amendments in \nthis agreement; that after the first vote in the sequence, the \nremaining votes be limited to 10 minutes each; that prior to the vote \nin relation to the Kyl amendment No. 634, there be 10 minutes of \ndebate, with 5 minutes each for Senators Kyl and Lautenberg; Murkowski, \nNo. 599; Inhofe, No. 613; Thune, No. 635, as modified; Kyl, No. 634; \nand Crapo, No. 638.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will speak briefly about one of the \namendments pending, but first I wish to express my support for the \nfiscal year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. With all the debate here, \nwe sometimes lose sight of the fact that this is a product of months of \nbipartisan negotiation and hard work. I serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee and I watch the various subcommittees come together and meet. \nWe had both the Republican leader and the Democratic leader of the \ncommittees join together and pass most of the bills that make up the \nomnibus. It is bipartisan. They passed almost unanimously.\n  Now, we find we are getting into debate on amendments and it is \nsomewhat troubling.\n  We completed a budget process begun more than a year ago to fund the \nFederal Government and also to fund hundreds of critical programs in \nthe Federal Government.\n  It is unfortunate we are now halfway through the fiscal year. I wish \nit could have been completed through regular order. But enacting this \nlegislation means funding increases for programs that serve as a \nlifeline to many Americans.\n  I appreciate what Chairman Inouye has done, what President pro \ntempore Byrd has done, and what ranking member Thad Cochran has done. \nThese are people with whom I have served for decades on the \nAppropriations Committee. They put together a piece of legislation that \nis going to take our country forward by investing in health care, law \nenforcement, the environment, and public schools.\n  Some have argued that because we passed the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act that this legislation is not needed. That is not \ncorrect. The economic recovery plan was crafted specifically to create \nand save millions of jobs through investments, infrastructure, \neducation funding, and so forth. But the recovery plan was not intended \nto replace the regular order of\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nthe Federal budget. This is a comprehensive bill, not a targeted piece \nof legislation.\n  I have listened to the debate on this legislation throughout the week \nand heard the arguments that this bill is too expensive, it is \nunnecessary and we would save money by level funding the government for \nthe rest of the year. Those making these arguments seem to ignore the \nfact that flat funding the government would mean no additional \nassistance through child nutrition programs for hungry children whose \nfamilies struggle to put food on their tables. It would mean less \nfunding is available to help rebuild our crumbling bridges and roads, \nfewer funds for ensuring Americans have clean and safe water to drink \nand reductions in critical health prevention programs. In short, not \npassing this bill would mean turning a blind eye to the millions of \nAmericans who need their Government to extend a helping hand to pull \nthem up off the ground.\n  Some members of this body have argued that because we passed the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act this legislation is not needed. \nThat could not be further from the truth. The economic recovery plan \nwas crafted specifically to create or save millions of jobs through \nsignificant investments in infrastructure, education funding, and \npublic safety net programs. I voted for this plan and have confidence \nthat it is a necessary step to protect and strengthen our economy and \ninvest in America's future. But the recovery plan was not intended to \nreplace the regular order for the Federal Budget.\n  While the recovery plan includes numerous important priorities, it \nwas structured to be timely and targeted, not a comprehensive bill to \nfund the entire Government. Using the rationale of some on the other \nside of the aisle and passing a yearlong continuing resolution would \nmean we are less able to ensure our security both at home and abroad. \nNot passing this legislation means the FBI will not be able to hire new \nagents, intelligence analysts, and others who protect us from crime and \nterrorism. It would mean the FDA will not be able to protect us from \nunsafe food and medicine. Finally, it would mean fewer funds for \ncritical activities such as nuclear nonproliferation, military \nassistance and peacekeeping operations and security operations for our \nembassies abroad.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for \ntheir hard work in crafting this bill. It is not an easy job to weigh \nthe thousands of competing priorities of our country and produce a \ncomprehensive bill that addresses these needs. I applaud Chairman \nInouye for his work and offer my strong support for this legislation.\n  Madam President, the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus appropriations bill \ncontains $36.6 billion in discretionary budget authority for the \nDepartment of State and Foreign Operations, which is the same amount \napproved by the Appropriations Committee in July 2008.\n  This represents a $1.6 billion decrease from former President Bush's \nbudget request of $38.2 billion. I repeat--this bill is $1.6 billion \nbelow what former President Bush recommended in his budget.\n  It is a $3.8 billion increase from the Fiscal Year 2008 enacted \nlevel, not counting supplemental funds, and $968 million above the \nFiscal Year 2008 level including Fiscal Year 2008 supplemental and \nFiscal Year 2009 bridge funds.\n  The State and Foreign Operations portion of this omnibus bill does \nnot contain any congressional earmarks. It does, as is customary and \nappropriate, specify funding levels for authorized programs, certain \ncountries, and international organizations such as the United Nations \nand the World Bank.\n  I thank Chairman Inouye, President pro tempore Byrd, and Ranking \nMember Cochran for their support throughout this protracted process. \nAnd I thank Senator Gregg, who, as ranking member of the State and \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, worked with me to produce this \nbipartisan legislation that was reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee with only one dissenting vote.\n  It is imperative that we enact this bill. The alternative of a full \nyear continuing resolution would be devastating to the operations of \nthe State Department and our embassies, consulates, and missions around \nthe world, and to programs that support a myriad of United States \nforeign policy interests and that protect the security of the American \npeople. Many Senators on both sides of the aisle were encouraged that \nSenator Clinton was nominated for and confirmed to be Secretary of \nState. If we want her to succeed we must provide the tools to do so. \nThis bill supports her highest priority of rebuilding the civilian \ncapabilities of our Government.\n  The bill provides $7.8 billion for Department of State operations, a \ndecrease of $274 million below former President's Bush's request and \n$1.2 billion above the Fiscal Year 2008 enacted level, not including \nsupplemental funds. Counting emergency funds provided in Fiscal Year \n2008 for personnel, operations and security costs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the bill provides a 5.6 percent increase.\n  These increases are attributed to a major investment in personnel, \nprimarily to replace worldwide positions that were redirected to Iraq \nand invest particularly in countries of growing importance in South \nAsia. The bill supports the request of 500 additional positions, much \nof which will help posts left depleted, some by 25 percent, due to \npositions shifting to Iraq during the last 5 years. In addition, the \nbill recommends $75 million for a new initiative to train and deploy \npersonnel in post-conflict stabilization. These critical investments \nwould be lost if we do not pass this bill.\n  The bill provides $1.7 billion for construction of new secure \nembassies and to provide security upgrades to existing facilities, \nwhich is $178 million below former President Bush's request. He had \nproposed a 41-percent increase which we did not have the funds to \nsupport. But an increase of $99.5 million, or 13 percent, above the \nFiscal Year 2008 enacted level is provided considering the significant \nthreats our embassies faced last year alone, from Yemen to Belgrade. \nEven this lesser increase for embassy construction and security \nupgrades would be lost under a year-long continuing resolution.\n  Specifically, the bill provides $4.24 billion for Diplomatic and \nConsular Programs, which funds State Department personnel. This is an \nincrease of $464 million, or 12 percent, above the Fiscal Year 2008 \nenacted level and $42 million above the President's request. This funds \na major investment in personnel to increase language training and \nexpand the number of personnel in regions of growing importance. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have strongly endorsed this \ninvestment, but it would not be funded under a continuing resolution.\n  In fact, under a continuing resolution, the State Department would \nnot have the resources to fund the staff currently serving at 267 posts \noverseas, due to exchange rate losses and the increased cost of \nsecurity overseas. That means the United States would have even less \nrepresentation than we do now, which none of us here would find \nacceptable.\n  The bill provides $1.1 billion for Worldwide Security Protection for \nnoncapital security upgrades, an increase of $355 million above the \nFiscal Year 2008 enacted level and $46 million below the request. This \naccount funds all the Diplomatic Security agents at every post \nworldwide, armored vehicles, and training--all investments which, \nagain, have bipartisan support. The increases would fund additional \npersonnel for protection at high-threat embassies and oversight of \nsecurity contractors in Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel-West Bank. This \nwould not be possible under a continuing resolution.\n  Senators of both parties have expressed strong support for expanding \ninternational exchange programs, particularly in predominantly Muslim \ncountries. The bill provides $538 million for education and cultural \nexchanges, which is $15.5 million above the President's request and an \nincrease of $36.6 million above the Fiscal Year 2008 enacted level. \nThose additional funds would be lost under a continuing resolution at \nthe moment when the United States has the greatest opportunity to \nreintroduce our country, our people, and our values to the rest of the \nworld.\n  The same is true of public diplomacy. The bill provides $394.8 \nmillion for the State Department's public diplomacy activities, \nincluding outreach, media, and programs in embassies to develop\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nrelationships with people in host countries. This is $33.9 million \nabove the fiscal year 2008 level, which would not be available under a \ncontinuing resolution.\n\n  The bill provides $1.7 billion for construction of new secure \nembassies and maintenance of existing facilities, a $280 million \nincrease above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level and $83 million below \nthe President's request. Of this amount, $801 million is for embassy \nmaintenance, $40 million less than the request and $46 million above \nthe fiscal year 2008 enacted level.\n  The bill provides $770 million for planning, design, and construction \nof new embassies and office buildings worldwide, $178 million below the \nrequest and $99 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. Any \nSenator who has traveled abroad has seen the need to replace insecure \nand old embassies. There is already a long waiting list, and it would \nbe even longer under a continuing resolution.\n  Former President Bush's budget underfunded the U.S. assessed \ncontribution to UN peacekeeping in fiscal year 2009 by assuming a \nreduction in every mission except Sudan. That was pie in the sky. The \ncost of most of these missions is increasing, not decreasing. The bill \nprovides $1.5 billion for UN peacekeeping, an increase of $295 million \nabove the fiscal year 2008 enacted level and $20 million above the \nPresident's request. However, compared to the total amount enacted in \nfiscal year 2008, the bill is $173 million below the operating level in \nfiscal year 2008 including supplemental funds. These are costs we are \nobligated to pay by treaty. They support the troops of other nations in \nDarfur, the Congo, Lebanon, Haiti, and a dozen other countries.\n  The bill provides $1.5 billion for contributions to international \norganizations, the same as the President's request and $186 million \nabove the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. The account funds the U.S. \nassessed dues to 47 international organizations, including NATO, IAEA, \nOECD, the UN, and others for which, as a member of the organization, \nthe United States is obligated by treaty to contribute. We either pay \nnow or we pay later.\n  The bill provides $709.5 million for the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors, an increase of $39.5 million above the fiscal year 2008 \nenacted level and $10 million above former President Bush's budget \nrequest. This includes funding for languages which the former \nadministration proposed to eliminate in fiscal year 2009, such as \nRussian, Georgian, Kazak, Uzbek, Tibetan and the Balkans, where freedom \nof speech remains restricted and broadcasting programs are still \nnecessary to provide unbiased news.\n  For USAID, the bill provides $808.6 million for operating expenses, \n$41.4 million above former President Bush's request and $179 million \nabove the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. This continues efforts begun \nlast year to address the serious staff shortage at USAID, but under a \ncontinuing resolution USAID's staff problems would continue to worsen. \nIt would not be able to hire additional staff for Afghanistan and \nPakistan, or for other posts where there is not sufficient oversight of \ncontracting and procurement. It is a crisis situation that I and \nSenator Gregg are determined to fix.\n  For bilateral economic assistance, the bill provides a total of $17.1 \nbillion, $1.3 billion below former President Bush's request and $623.3 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2008 level. We received requests from \nmost Senators--Democrats and Republicans--for funding from within this \naccount, totaling far more than we could afford. A continuing \nresolution would make it impossible to fund many, if not most, of those \nrequests.\n  A good example is global health. The bill provides $7.1 billion for \nglobal health and child survival, an increase of $757 million above the \nrequest and $737 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. A \ncontinuing resolution would be devastating for these lifesaving \nprograms.\n  A total of $495 million is provided for child survival and maternal \nhealth, an increase of $125 million above former President Bush's \nrequest and $49 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. These \nfunds are for programs that directly decrease child and maternal \nmortality from preventable diseases, such as malaria, polio and \npneumonia. Under a continuing resolution, USAID would not be able to \nexpand its malaria control programs to other countries in Africa with a \nhigh incidence of malaria, which kills a million people, mostly African \nchildren, every year.\n  The bill provides $300 million for safe water programs, including \nincreasing access to safe drinking water and sanitation, which is a key \nfactor in improving public health.\n  Former President Bush proposed a steep cut in funding for family \nplanning and reproductive health programs, even though they are the \nmost effective means of reducing unwanted pregnancies and abortions. \nThe bill, instead, provides a total of $545 million from all accounts \nfor family planning and reproductive health including $50 million for \nthe UN Population Fund, which is $82 million above the fiscal year 2008 \nlevel. A continuing resolution would eliminate those additional funds, \nand the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions would increase.\n  The bill provides a total of $5.5 billion for programs to combat HIV/\nAIDS, $388 million above former President Bush's request and $459 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2008 level. Of this amount, $600 million \nis provided for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, which is $400 \nmillion above the request. Additionally within the total, $350 million \nis provided for USAID programs to combat HIV/AIDS, which is $8 million \nabove the request.\n  These additional funds, which pay for life-sustaining antiretroviral \ndrugs, prevention and care programs, would be lost under a continuing \nresolution, to the detriment of 1 million people who would receive \nlifesaving treatment this year. With this funding 2 million additional \nHIV infections would be prevented this year. Instead of 10 million \nlives we are saving today, we have the opportunity to save 12 million \npeople. We have the opportunity with this bill to save 1 million more \norphans or vulnerable children who are either infected with HIV or have \nbeen orphaned because a parent died from HIV/AIDS. Why would we not \nmake this investment this year?\n  The development assistance account funds energy and environment \nprograms, microcredit programs, private enterprise, rule of law, trade \ncapacity, and many other activities that Senators on both sides of the \naisle support. The bill provides $1.8 billion for development \nassistance which is $161 million above former President Bush's request \nand $176 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level.\n  The bill provides $350 million for international disaster assistance, \n$52 million above the request and $30 million above the fiscal year \n2008 enacted level, excluding supplemental funds. These funds enable \nthe United States to put its best face forward when disaster strikes, \nas it did with the tsunami, the earthquake in Pakistan, floods in \nCentral America, and famine in Africa.\n  The bill provides $875 million for the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation. This is $1.3 billion below the request and $669 million \nbelow the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. This reflects the view of the \nHouse and Senate that the Congress supports the MCC but wants to see a \nslowdown in new compacts, while $7 billion in previously appropriated \nfunds are disbursed, and while the new administration decides how it \nwants to fund the MCC in the future. The agreement provides sufficient \nfunds to continue current operations and to commence two new compacts \nof $350 million each.\n  For the Peace Corps, the bill provides $340 million, which is $9 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2008 level. Those additional funds would \nbe lost under a continuing resolution.\n  The bill provides $875 million for international narcotics control \nand law enforcement, which is $327 million below the request and $321 \nmillion above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. Those additional \nfunds for programs in Latin America, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and many \nother countries would be lost under a continuing resolution.\n  There is a total of $405 million for continued support of the Merida \nInitiative, including $300 million for Mexico and $105 million for the \ncountries of Central America. The fiscal year 2008 supplemental \nincluded $400 million and $65 million, respectively. We are all \nincreasingly alarmed by the spread of\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\ndrug-related violence and criminal gangs in Mexico, but under a \ncontinuing resolution there would be nothing for the Merida Initiative.\n  Migration and refugee assistance is funded at $931 million, which is \n$167 million above former President Bush's request and $108 million \nabove the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. That $108 million would be \nlost under a continuing resolution. This amount is already $557 million \nbelow what was provided in fiscal year 2008 including supplemental and \nfiscal year 2009 bridge funds. These funds are used for basic care and \nprotection of refugees and internally displaced persons, whose numbers \nare not expected to decrease this year.\n  The bill provides $4.9 billion for military assistance and \npeacekeeping operations, $173 million below former President Bush's \nrequest but $212.6 million above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. \nThe bill assumes $170 million provided in the fiscal year 2008 \nsupplemental as fiscal year 2009 bridge funds for military assistance \nto Israel, making the total amount for Israel equal to the President's \nrequest, $2.55 billion. The additional $212.6 million for other \nimportant bilateral relationships would be lost under a continuing \nresolution.\n  For contributions to the multilateral development institutions, which \nwe owe by treaty, the bill provides $1.8 billion. That is $503 million \nbelow the former President's request and $251 million above the fiscal \nyear 2008 enacted level. A continuing resolution would put us another \n$251 million in arrears, in addition to the arrears we already owe.\n  The bill provides the amounts requested by the former president for \nthe Export-Import Bank, an increase of $26.5 million above fiscal year \n2008. By not passing this bill, these additional resources would not be \navailable to make U.S. businesses competitive in the global \nmarketplace. At this time of economic downturn at home we should be \ndoing everything we can to support U.S. trade.\n  These are the highlights of the fiscal year 2009 State and Foreign \nOperations portion of the omnibus bill before us. It contains funding \nto meet critical operational costs and programmatic needs which support \nU.S. interests and protect U.S. security around the world.\n  A handful of our friends in the minority have criticized this omnibus \nbecause it contains earmarks. Apparently they would prefer that \nunnamed, unelected bureaucrats make all the decisions about the use of \ntaxpayer dollars. In fact, the total amount of this bill that Members \nof Congress--Democrats and Republicans--have earmarked for schools, \nfire and police departments, roads, bridges, hospitals, scientific \nresearch, universities and other organizations and programs in their \nstates and districts which would not otherwise receive funding is less \nthan 1 percent. That is what the aggrieved speeches are about. A \nwhopping 1 percent.\n  Some here complain that this omnibus--all but a small fraction of \nwhich would fund the budget requests of former President Bush--is more \nthan we can afford. Those are the same Senators who, year after year, \nrubberstamped billions and billions of borrowed dollars to fund an \nunnecessary war and reconstruction programs in Iraq that were fraught \nwith waste and abuse.\n  Some say that the intervention of the Economic Recovery and \nReinvestment Act is the reason they oppose this omnibus bill. Regarding \nthe Department of State and foreign operations, 99.6 percent of the \nomnibus has no correlation whatsoever to what was funded by the \nRecovery Act. This portion of the omnibus funds all of the United \nStates' activities overseas. All of the key new investments I have \ndescribed will not occur if this bill is not passed.\n  The funding for State and foreign operations in this omnibus bill \namounts to about 1 percent of the total budget of this country. However \none views the Economic Recovery Act, it would be the height of \nirresponsibility to oppose this bill. The damage that a continuing \nresolution would cause to the functions of our embassies, consulates \nand missions, and to the foreign service officers who serve the \nAmerican people around the world, would be devastating. The damage to \nprograms would be measured in lives.\n  We have seen the image of our country battered beyond recognition. \nThe values our country was founded on were ignored, ridiculed, and \ndiminished. Democrats and Republicans alike recognize that the United \nStates needs to reinvigorate its engagement in the world, particularly \nthrough rebuilding alliances and using diplomacy more effectively. This \nbill puts our money where our mouths are. The alternative is to retract \nand to invite others to fill the vacuum. That might save money in the \nshort term, but it will cost us dearly in the future.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 613\n\n  Madam President, I will speak briefly in opposition to an amendment \noffered by Senator Inhofe. Before I do, I might note that I have served \nhere for 35 years. Seeing the distinguished Presiding Officer, when I \nfirst came to the Senate, there were two Senators from Minnesota--\nSenator Hubert Humphrey, Senator Walter Mondale. Senator Humphrey had \nbeen Vice President of the United States; Senator Mondale was to become \nVice President of the United States. I was helped immeasurably by the \nmentoring and the friendship of those two Senators.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer and I had the opportunity to be \npresent when the distinguished former Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nMondale, or Ambassador Mondale or Vice President Mondale--he had all \nthose titles--was given one of the highest awards that the Japanese \nGovernment could give.\n  I mention this only because I still serve with the whole delegation \nfrom Minnesota, which is now presiding over the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to go back to the subject at hand, I do \nwish to speak briefly in opposition to an amendment offered by Senator \nInhofe. It is amendment No. 613. According to the unanimous consent \nagreement entered into by my dear friend, the senior Senator from \nMississippi, we are going to vote on that amendment later today.\n  His amendment prohibits any United States funding to the United \nNations if the United Nations imposes a tax on any United States \nperson. It's like: My gosh, how did we ever overlook this situation? \nBut this amendment is a textbook case of legislating when there is \nabsolutely no rhyme or reason and shooting ourselves in the foot at the \nsame time.\n  It is not a response to anything that has happened in the entire \nhistory of the United Nations. It is something that apparently the \nauthor of the amendment imagines maybe, some time, somehow, somewhere \nthis could happen.\n  The United Nations has never levied a tax on anyone. It is not a \ntaxing organization. This provision was originally put in many years \nago when anti-United Nations sentiment was high. It was a feel-good, \nchest-thumping response to a totally imagined, non-existent problem.\n  I call it the Godzilla amendment. Let's pass a law that says if \nGodzilla comes tromping down the National Mall, he is prohibited from \ncoming within 100 yards of the Nation's Capitol Building.\n  The fact is, of course, there is no Godzilla and there never will be. \nThe U.N. has no taxing authority. It does not impose taxes. There has \nnever been a U.N. tax on Americans. There is no realistic possibility \nthat there ever will be.\n  This would be like saying if the United Nations ever passes a law to \nrename the United States of America, we will cut off funding. It is not \ngoing to happen.\n  Every year each appropriations subcommittee receives requests from \nSenators for what they want included in the bill. Both the ranking \nRepublican member and the Democratic chairman look at all these \nrequests. No Senator requested the language proposed by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. The Bush administration never requested this language. \nBoth I and Senator Gregg saw absolutely no reason to continue to \ninclude it. It has no practical effect.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has had since last July, over half a year, \nto ask for its inclusion if he wanted. He never did. President Bush, \nVice President Cheney, Secretary of State Rice--none of them saw any \nreason for it.\n  This sort of falls into the ``we need to prohibit black helicopters \nfrom coming in the middle of the night from the\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nUnited Nations.'' It is fantasy. But if we did adopt it, what an \nembarrassment for this country, the only country in the world to adopt \nsuch an amendment.\n  At a time when we are trying to reestablish the reputation and \nleadership of the United States, why would we put Congress on record \nthreatening the United Nations not to do something that it is never \ngoing to do? We are not some two-bit country that wants to stand up and \nwave a flag and show how tough it is. We are not the mouse that roared. \nWe are the United States of America. And doing something like this, the \nrest of the world is going to look at us and say: Why are you doing \nsuch silly things?\n  The Senator's amendment would cut off funding for U.N. peacekeeping, \nfor the operations of the U.N. Security Council, for UNICEF, for all \nthe things we are asking the United Nations to do in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nDarfur, the Middle East, and around the world. That is what the \namendment says. It is an anachronism. It has no basis in fact.\n  Does anyone think that even if they wanted to the other members of \nthe U.N. Security Council could do that over a United States veto? It's \nimpossible.\n  We already pay our assessed dues to the United Nations. Is that a \ntax? We have to pay it. It comes out of the Federal budget, and the \nFederal budget is taxpayer money. Should we stop paying that?\n  Let's stop treating the United Nations as the enemy. Let's start \nshowing maturity and leadership. The amendment was an unnecessary piece \nof legislation years ago when it was first offered by Senator Jesse \nHelms, and it is no less so today.\n  No President, even if the U.N. had the ability to, which it does \nnot--even if it tried, whoever was President would simply instruct our \nRepresentative to the United Nations: Veto it.\n  It is a solution looking for a problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 635\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise briefly to oppose the amendment \noffered by my colleague, Senator Thune from South Dakota. I supported \nand worked with Senator Thune and Senator Kyl on Indian law enforcement \nissues and health care issues with respect to a very sizable \nauthorization bill that was passed last year. It was actually an \namendment to another bill. It was enacted into law. We now have an \nauthorization for an Emergency Fund for Indian Safety and Health that \nis very important, and it needs to get funded.\n  I had not been aware of this amendment proposed by Senator Thune. I \ndon't know with whom Senator Thune talked about it. He did not visit \nwith me.\n  In any event, his amendment would provide funding for a range of \nIndian issues, which I think are very important issues, with an across-\nthe-board reduction in other areas. His original amendment was drafted \nin a way that would have cut $90 million out of current Indian programs \nto pay for this Emergency Fund. He has since modified that amendment so \nthat it is now an across-the-board cut on a much broader array of \nprograms.\n  He makes the point that it is not a significant cut. I do not \ndisagree with that. It is, however, a cut in Indian health care \nprograms, a cut in Indian housing programs, a cut in programs that are \nso desperately in need of funding. I would be anxious to work with my \ncolleague. I think those of us who have worked so hard together, \nincluding Senator Thune and others, need to collaborate on these issues \nand determine how we can come up with some additional funding for the \nauthorization we worked together to complete last Congress.\n  As I indicated, I was surprised by this amendment, as I am sure the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, was as well. We have so many \nproblems. For example, contract health care on Indian reservations. You \nknow the word on reservations: Don't get sick after June because they \nare out of contract health care funds and you are not going to get \nadmitted to a hospital.\n  We have people with bone-on-bone health conditions, and bad knees so \npainful they cannot walk. But, it is not considered life or limb, which \nmeans they will not get funding for it.\n  In the past, I held up on the floor of the Senate a photograph of a \nwoman who showed up lying on a gurney at a hospital having a heart \nattack with an 8-by-10 piece of paper Scotch taped to her leg that said \nto the hospital: If you admit this person, understand you may not be \npaid for it because we are out of contract health care funds.\n  We are so desperately short of funds in these areas, I don't think we \nought to be cutting an account like that, even for something of great \nmerit such as adding law enforcement funding to this Emergency Fund.\n  I support law enforcement funding initiatives. We need to find \nfunding for them. We have reservations where the level of violence is 5 \ntimes, 10 times, 12 times the rate of violent crimes in the rest of the \ncountry. I have held hearings on it in Washington and on an Indian \nreservation. I fully believe we need to fund these initiatives. But \nshould we do that by taking funding out of contract health care funds? \nI don't think so. Contract health care where people cannot show up at \nthe hospital door after June, when they have run out of funds, in very \nserious trouble with something taped to their leg that says: By the \nway, you ought not admit this person because you are not going to get \npaid.\n  Full scale health care rationing is going on. Forty percent of the \nhealth care needs of American Indians are not getting met. Little kids \nare dying and elders are dying. We are desperately short of money in \nthese accounts. To cut any of these health care accounts in any amount, \nin my judgment, is wrong.\n  I am sorry I am not able to support that amendment. It is the wrong \namendment. I am anxious to work with my colleague from South Dakota. My \ncolleague has a record of working with us on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and he has a record of working on Indian reservations on \nimportant issues. I am anxious to work with him and my other \ncolleagues, including Senator Barrasso from Wyoming, who take a big \ninterest in this issue.\n  I hope as we move forward that we will be able to provide the funding \nfor the crisis that exists in health care, housing, and education on \nIndian reservations in this country. At the same time, we need to \nprovide the funding for adequate law enforcement, which we have signed \ntreaties to do and which we have a trust responsibility to do, but \nwhich we have systematically over a long period of time failed to do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 634\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I wish to talk about the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, amendment No. 634, which is a well-\nintentioned amendment fundamentally but I think a misdirected \namendment. The purpose of the amendment is to prohibit the expenditure \nof amounts of money made available under this act in a contract with \nany company that has a business presence in Iran's energy sector.\n  Effectively, what Senator Kyl is seeking to do on this appropriations \nbill--on the fly, without hearings within the appropriate committees of \njurisdiction, and without any appropriate input by the administration--\na new administration, 1 month into office, and an administration that \nalready has announced it has a new policy with respect to Iran--is to \nwalk in here and apply a unilateral sanction by the United States.\n  Now, all of us share a very deep and real concern about the course \nIran is on. We have just concluded 3 days of hearings in the Foreign \nRelations Committee on this very subject in order to get a better \nunderstanding of exactly what is happening in Iran, exactly what the \npossibilities may be, how we might avoid making the mistakes that were \nmade in the last administration by rushing to judgment, and how we can \nproceed in a deliberative, thoughtful way. To simply attach to this \nappropriations bill this amendment in this way would be to contradict \nevery single one of those legitimate interests of trying to approach a \npolicy with regard to Iran in a thoughtful way.\n  First, let us make it very clear. We all know the effect of adopting \nthis amendment, because of the procedural situation we are in, is very \nsimple. It\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\nkeeps us from enacting this bill before the current continuing \nresolution expires. And given what we have heard from the House of \nRepresentatives, that means a vote for this amendment is effectively a \nvote against the Omnibus appropriations bill and it is a vote for a \nyear-long continuing resolution at last year's funding levels. Given \nthe state of our economy, given all of the initiatives contained in \nbills we should have passed last year and that we are only now getting \nto, it would be irresponsible in the context of the current economic \nsituation of this country to deny some of these funds to flow and to \nput people back to work and to help create the future jobs for this \ncountry that we need.\n  On another level--and this is important--this amendment, if it \npassed, would actually have a very negative impact on the very office \nthe Treasury Department--the Office of Terrorism and Financial \nIntelligence--would require to enforce the amendment. Why is that? \nBecause in this omnibus bill that we want to pass is over $5 million, \nor about 10 percent over last year's budget, to help them be able to do \nthe very job this amendment seeks to have them do. So the result of \npassing the amendment would be to take away the needed resources from \nthe very people at the Treasury Department who right now are trying to \ntrack down and root out the Iranian banking and financial transactions \nthat contribute directly to Iran's nuclear missile programs.\n  I think for the first reason alone you should not vote for this \namendment, but the second reason not to vote for it is that it doesn't \nmake sense to take money away from the people who are already doing the \njob we want them to do. That doesn't make sense. But more broadly--and \nI hope colleagues will think about this--this is not the time for this \nkind of an amendment.\n  We had a secret briefing yesterday afternoon with all of the DNI and \nCIA and other folks who are doing a lot of hard work with respect to \nIran, and we spent a number of hours analyzing this. We are trying to \ncome up with a multilateral approach that reaches out to the Europeans, \nto the Russians, to the Chinese and others, and we are trying to put \ntogether an Iran policy that makes sense. Developing a more effective \nIran strategy is one of President Obama's top priorities, and getting \nit right is challenging. That is why the administration is undertaking \nthe comprehensive review of its policy options even as it works to get \nits team in place. It doesn't make sense to come careening in here in \nthe course of an afternoon, without hearings, without melding it into \nthat larger strategy, to think about putting in place something that \nnot only works against your interests but actually may wind up making \nit more difficult for our allies to be able to work with us, and \nwithout understanding how it fits into a broader strategy.\n  The President is right to open the door to direct engagement with \nIran. And a lot of us are hoping--all of us hope, I think--that a more \nproductive relationship is going to emerge, whereby we can explore \nareas of mutual interest. Believe it or not--a lot of people don't \nrealize it at first blush--when you begin to look at the region and \nunderstand the dynamics of what is happening in Afghanistan and \nPakistan and even Iraq, the fact is that Iran has the potential to be a \nconstructive partner with respect to a number of different mutual \ninterests. They do not like the Taliban, they have an interest in not \nhaving drugs come from Afghanistan across the border, they have other \ninterests with respect to the stability of Afghanistan and other parts \nof that world.\n  The fact is they helped us--a lot of people don't realize this--\nrecently, in 2001 and 2002, when the Senate made almost a unanimous \ndecision that we needed to respond to the 9/11 attacks by dealing with \nAfghanistan and a safe haven. Iran was enormously helpful to us in that \neffort. And in fact much of what we were able to accomplish with the \nnorthern alliance, with the placement of our personnel on the ground, \nand other things through other components of that relationship wound up \nbeing very constructive in helping us to achieve what we did. So there \nare possibilities of a different relationship.\n  Nobody is believing that mere talking is going to produce them, but \nyou don't know until you talk what the possibilities are. And you \ncertainly, if you ultimately are going to wind up going down a much \ntougher road, want to build your bona fides with other countries to \nshow that you have made every effort to be able to find out whether \nthere are alternatives. So I have long advocated that we take a \ndifferent approach with respect to Iran, and I think this kind of \nmeasure gets flat bang immediately plunked down right in the way of \nbeing able to take those kinds of additional new initiatives.\n  The challenge for the Obama administration now is going to be to \nchoose a series of red lines with respect to Iran's potential nuclear \nprogram. And to do that, everybody has learned we need to build \ncoalitions with the Europeans, the Russians, the Chinese, and nations \nwithin the Middle East in order to be able to pull the full weight of \nthe international community against Iran, should they defy common sense \nand the requirements of the nonproliferation treaty and the United \nNations and the IAEA. So I think for diplomacy to proceed, we don't \nwant to engage in unthought out, ad hoc efforts such as this particular \namendment, which can get in the way of our ability to put together a \nstrong multilateral coalition.\n  Here is another reality. This amendment would wind up actually making \nit more difficult to achieve that coalition, because it would \nindirectly sanction companies in some of the very countries we hope to \nenlist. That is going to be made more difficult if this amendment were \nto pass. So again, it is unwise to target unilateral sanctions at \nallies and other influential countries we need in order to help \nappropriately build a coalition to deal with Iran.\n  I mentioned earlier that the Foreign Relations Committee has been \ndoing 3 days of hearings on this very topic. Today, we heard from two \nof the most distinguished and thoughtful individuals in America with \nrespect to national security issues. They have both served as national \nsecurity advisers to Presidents of the United States--Democratic and \nRepublican. I am talking about Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski and GEN Brent \nScowcroft. Both of them made perfectly clear that this kind of \napproach--the kind of approach in this amendment--is counterproductive \nto our overall strategy of bringing tough pressure to bear on Iran in \norder to change its direction.\n  So I say to my colleagues, going it alone on Iran may make you feel \ngood, but it ain't smart, it is not playing to our strengths, and it is \nnot permitting the current President of the United States, as Commander \nin Chief and as the initiator of our foreign policy, to be able to take \nthe initiatives he wants. What is more, it is not even clear how the \nTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control would even be \nable to implement this amendment, and we haven't had any hearings to \ndetermine how they would implement this amendment.\n\n  This amendment would bar any funds provided by the bill for any new \nFederal contract with any company that has a ``business practice'' in \nIran's energy sector. Well, nobody here even knows fully what the \ndefinition of a business practice is. Does that mean CIA? What does \nthat mean in terms of anybody's understanding of what in fact is going \nto be banned? Moreover, the Office of Foreign Asset Control doesn't \neven catalogue those kinds of companies right now. So all of a sudden \nyou pass the money and you are going to ask them to start tracking, no \nmatter how small that company. It is going to distract them, frankly, \nfrom the serious work they are doing now to root out and shut down \nIran's nuclear missile-related procurement transactions around the \nworld. That is more important than diverting to this subeffort.\n  The bottom line is our challenges with Iran are plain too serious to \nbe making foreign policy on the fly in an amendment to an \nappropriations bill without hearing and without even adequately \nunderstanding fully the terms within it. The committees of jurisdiction \nhave not debated this approach. They haven't had any votes on this \napproach. There may well be a time and place for this kind of a \nprovision. Maybe this provision will fit into a series of escalating \nsanctions which we have already been talking about within the Foreign \nRelations Committee. But we ought to do that not in this ad hoc way but \nin a thoughtful and disciplined\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\nway, and I think we will have a much stronger policy if we do that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what brings me to the floor is the Kyl \namendment that is presently before us. I have listened to some of my \ncolleagues say how this is the wrong amendment at the wrong time. I \nwould simply say that, in fact, this is. I happen to agree. I happen to \nagree that it is at the wrong time.\n  I might very well agree with Senator Kyl on the underpinnings of the \namendment. I think we need to do what we must in order to ensure that \nIran does not achieve the possibility of a nuclear weapon, and whatever \nwe need to do in pursuing a two-track parallel as we engage them, at \nthe same time have them understand that if engagement is not going to \nachieve them stopping obtaining a nuclear weapon, that there are \nconsequences. But this is the wrong way to do foreign policy--in an \nomnibus bill--just as it is the wrong way to do foreign policy on the \nCuba provisions in this bill.\n  I am compelled to come to the floor because I will oppose the Kyl \namendment particularly because I think it is wrong to include it in an \nomnibus bill without going through the process--the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and others--to consider in fact whether this is the \nbest policy, to have an open and free debate about it, to be able to \nvote on it either way after such rigorous debate. But we are being \nasked to vote for an omnibus bill that has provisions that change a \nsignificant foreign policy as it relates to the United States and Cuba. \nSo there is a duality.\n  Finally, I have been reading a lot from our friends in the \nblogosphere and others, who talk about this issue on Cuba, and the \npress. What is incredible to me is that they still cannot cite one \nhuman rights activist in Cuba, one democracy activist in Cuba, they do \nnot have the name of one prisoner of conscience inside of Cuba. They \nlose track. They talk about policy, but if it were any other part of \nthe world--if we were talking about Burma, if we were talking about \nwhat happens in the Sudan--if we were talking about any other part of \nthe world, we would see the same attention being given to the human \nrights activists, the democracy activists, the political prisoners \ninside of Cuba who languish each and every day, and their crime is \nsimply to try to create a civil society with the benefits of the \nfreedoms we enjoy here in the United States--to be able to come to a \nbody like this and be able to debate; to be able to choose our elected \nrepresentatives; to worship at the altar at which we choose to worship; \nto be able to enjoy the benefits of the sweat of our labor, whether by \nbrawn or by brain. But there is silence.\n  I am a little tired that we keep reading about those who will spend \nhours listening to Castro's soliloquies but not spend 1 minute with \nhuman rights activists, with political dissidents, with independent \njournalists. There was a time when we used to help human rights \nactivists and democracy activists in the world; when we put an \ninternational spotlight on people such as Lech Walesa in Poland; when \nwe did it with Vaclav Havel in the Czech Republic; when we did it with \nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the former Soviet Union. By creating that \nspotlight on those individuals, we gave them the opportunity not to be \nharassed on a daily basis, as Cuba's democracy activists are, in jail \nand in prison and sentenced, sometimes for a quarter of a century for \nsome minor act that, in fact, we would enjoy here as one of our \nfundamental freedoms, such as wearing a simple white bracelet that says \n``cambio''--change. Change in the last election in the United States \nwould get you elected President.\n  Say ``change'' in Cuba, it sends you to jail. Yet there is silence. \nThere is silence. It is deafening. It is deafening. So I will vote \nagainst the Kyl amendment because I think it is the wrong process in an \nomnibus bill. But, by the same token, you cannot have it one way and \nsay it is wrong to have major foreign policy changes in an omnibus bill \nand then be silent about the other.\n  It is wrong to say our policies should be changed but not have one \nword about democracy, human rights, political prisoners. It is amazing \nto me that people do not know who Oscar Elias Biscetis is, an Afro-\nCuban doctor who ultimately was sent to jail for 25 years simply \nbecause he refused to perform the abortions the regime called upon him \nto do. He protested it and he was sent to jail for 25 years; or Marta \nBeatrice Roque, who, in fact, languishes with health issues, and every \ntime she goes out, most recently to visit a U.S. diplomat, gets beaten \nalong the way; or Antunes, who is on a hunger strike trying to create \nlimited openings in a civil society and protesting the beating and \nincarceration of another human rights activist.\n  I hope people will get to know their names, such as they did Vaclav \nHavel and Lech Walesa and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and others in the \nworld whose voices we hear from our colleagues who come here and talk \nabout them. I am proud of them for doing that. They need to start \nspeaking out about the voices of those who languish in Castro's jails \nand stop losing the romanticism of the regime and start talking about \nthose human rights activists, democracy activists, those who are \nsuffering simply to create an opening in civil society within their \ncountry. Then there will be some balance. Then there would be some \nequity. Then we would have an opportunity to move on broader in the \ncontext of policy.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 599\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have a series of votes. I believe the \nfirst one will be the Murkowski amendment. I rise to speak against it. \nI think if you vote for the Murkowski amendment, what you are endorsing \nis a process that is something that should not be encouraged, which is \na President in the waning hours doing a midnight regulation to overturn \na law.\n  Let me repeat that. What Senator Murkowski is doing is she is \nremoving language in this bill that reversed two midnight regulations \nthe Bush administration put into place, without proper hearing, without \ngoing through the comment period the way they should, ignoring the \npublic, ignoring the science, and, in essence, doing a backdoor repeal \nof the Endangered Species Act.\n  Now, that is not right. It happens to be that one of these dealt with \nthe polar bear, which, as you probably know, was listed as a threatened \nspecies by the Bush administration. But then people looked at the \nEndangered Species Act and said: My goodness, we do not know what can \nhappen if we now declare that the polar bear is not only threatened but \nendangered. We better take away the protection of the Endangered \nSpecies Act from the polar bear.\n  Whether you care about the survival of the polar bear, as do I, or \nwhether you do not, it seems to me what the Murkowski amendment does is \nto say that we approve of the President of any party, acting in a \ncapricious way, overturning a law that was passed by Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  She not only deals with the polar bear, but she also deals with \nanother very important rule that says, before there is a major \ndevelopment, Federal agencies have to check with the Fish and Wildlife \nService to make sure we are not destroying God's creation.\n  I do not understand the thinking behind it. We have laws in place to \nprotect endangered species. If we do not like the Endangered Species \nAct, if we have decided we do not care about polar bears or we do not \ncare about bald eagles or we do not care about any of this, we want to \ndo away with it, let Lisa Murkowski and any of my colleagues come and \nmove to overturn and\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\noverrule and abolish the Endangered Species Act.\n  But let's not send a signal tonight that Presidents of either party \ncan, at the waning hours of their Presidency--and I do not care if it \nis a Democrat or Republican--can willy-nilly, with the stroke of a pen, \ndecide to do away with the protections of an act that was a landmark \nenvironmental law.\n  If you do not like the law, come here, tell me why, let's talk. Maybe \nwe can fix parts of it, maybe we cannot. Maybe we can rework parts of \nit, maybe we cannot. But let's not allow Presidents to simply do away \nwith these laws when they may prove to be inconvenient.\n  I hope we will vote against the Murkowski amendment, whether we want \nto protect the polar bear or we do not, whether we care about the bald \neagle or we do not. That is up to us to decide. But let's not say \ntonight in this vote that we approve of an Executive doing away with \nthe protections of Federal law with the stroke of a pen without a \nhearing, without the comments, without the scientists, without working \nwith Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.\n  I hope we will have a strong vote against the Murkowski amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry to take back the time so quickly, but I want \nto place in the Record a number of editorials from around the country \nthat have come out against the Murkowski amendment. One is from the \nMiami Herald entitled ``Who needs those pesky scientists?'' Another is \nentitled ``Endangered Process, Proposed rule changes to the Endangered \nSpecies Act could do lasting harm in the natural world.'' ``Unnecessary \nESA Rewrite,'' that is from the Bangor Daily News. ``Gutting the law'' \nis from St. Louis Today. ``Endangered law: Bush rule change ignores \nscience--again.'' That is from the Salt Lake Tribune. Here is one from \nthe Seattle Post-Intelligencer: ``Endangered species: A 9-second \nrewrite.'' ``A complete sham, Public comments given curt review in rush \nto dilute the Endangered Species Act.'' That is from the Las Vegas Sun. \n``Shredder is overheating in Bush's final months.'' That is from the \nVirginian Pilot. These editorials were written when George Bush issued \nthe executive orders.\n  Senator Murkowski's amendment would say: Fine, let it stand. The \nunderlying bill reverses these midnight regulations and goes back to \nthe status quo ante and back to the regular order.\n  I ask unanimous consent the editorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Aug. 13, 2008]\n\n                   Who Needs Those Pesky Scientists?\n\n       The Bush administration continued its assault on the \n     Endangered Species Act this week with a last-minute proposal \n     that would speed up approval of construction projects that \n     could cause harm to endangered plants and animals. Maybe it \n     comes out of desperation, but whatever the motivation for the \n     change, the administration misses the mark and should \n     reconsider. If it doesn't and the change is approved, whoever \n     is in the White House next year should immediately rescind \n     the new rule.\n\n\n                        Complete projects first\n\n       Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said the change is \n     necessary to keep the Act from being used as a ``back door'' \n     means of regulating greenhouse gases that are believed to \n     cause global warming. The change would allow federal agencies \n     that are responsible for building highways, bridges, dams and \n     other projects to decide if their projects create a risk to \n     endangered species. This would drastically limit the \n     requirement for mandatory, independent reviews by the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service and other agencies that employ \n     scientists and experts to conduct the studies. It would be \n     like letting the proverbial fox guard the henhouse. Those \n     agencies' first priority is to get projects completed, not \n     protect at-risk species.\n       If the problem truly were about the time involved in the \n     review process, the solution would be to streamline the \n     process--not change the reviewer. But the administration has \n     used this gambit before. In 2003, it adopted rules to let \n     agencies approve new pesticides without hearing from \n     government scientists about the impact on endangered species. \n     The rule was overturned in court.\n       The administration's antipathy to the idea that human \n     activities contribute to global warming has been well \n     documented. In announcing the proposed change, Secretary \n     Kempthorne said, ``It is not possible to draw a link between \n     greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of the \n     impacts on species.''\n\n\n                             Public's input\n\n       If approved, the administration would accomplish with a \n     change in the rules what it has not been able to achieve in \n     Congress. The House passed a bill in 2005 that would have \n     made similar changes to the Endangered Species Act, but the \n     measure failed in the Senate. The proposed change is subject \n     to a 30-day public comment period after which it can be \n     finalized by the Interior Department.\n       Thus, it is possible that the change could take effect \n     before the next president is sworn into office, and could be \n     in place for months before a decision on rescinding is made. \n     The Bush administration showed its animus toward scientific \n     data by rejecting stem-cell research that could help people \n     with chronic diseases. Now it eschews research that protects \n     the bald eagle, grizzly bear and Florida panther.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 19, 2008]\n\n                           Endangered Process\n\n       In May, the Bush administration reluctantly listed the \n     polar bear as ``threatened'' under the Endangered Species \n     Act. The facts left it with little choice: the bear's Arctic \n     Sea ice habitat is melting because of global warming. But the \n     administration wasn't happy, because the Endangered Species \n     Act was never intended to be an instrument for coping with \n     climate change. Our sympathy was limited, since President \n     Bush spent his entire time in office resisting the adoption \n     of laws that would have been better suited to combating \n     greenhouse gas emissions. But we agreed that the Endangered \n     Species Act was the wrong tool for the problem.\n       Now, however, in what is ostensibly an attempt to deal with \n     this polar bear mismatch, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne \n     has proposed a rules change that would undermine the law's \n     fundamental work. Mr. Kempthorne suggests far-reaching \n     changes to the consultation process between the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service and \n     other agencies. The changes would render the process \n     meaningless and put all protected species at risk. Currently, \n     an agency building a highway has to consult with the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service to determine whether the project is ``likely \n     to adversely affect'' a listed species. If a determination is \n     made that such harm is likely, the service conducts a more \n     rigorous review of the project and issues a detailed opinion \n     on its effects. It is in this give-and-take between the \n     various agencies and services that modifications are made \n     that allow projects to go forward while minimizing the harm \n     to animals and to trees and other plants.\n       Under Mr. Kempthorne's plan, agencies would be able to \n     decide for themselves whether a project is likely to harm a \n     species, and not just polar bears. If an agency decided to \n     consult on the possible impact, the Fish and Wildlife Service \n     would have 60 days (with the possibility of a 60-day \n     extension) to issue an opinion. If it didn't meet that \n     deadline, the other agency could end the consultation and \n     proceed. The Fish and Wildlife Service already can't meet the \n     deadlines established in the Endangered Species Act and is \n     practically being run by judges and lawyers because of \n     litigation stemming from blown deadlines. So we don't hold \n     out much hope that Mr. Kempthorne's new deadlines would be \n     met, either. The impact could be devastating.\n       The department contends that other government agencies have \n     had years of experience with the law and know as much as the \n     Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service about how to protect listed species. This is \n     doubtful. The services are there for a reason--to safeguard \n     threatened and endangered species and to act as a check \n     against the ambitions of agencies that want to complete \n     projects. The rigor that the current consultation process \n     fosters would be lost.\n       A 30-day comment period on the new rules has begun. So, \n     here's our comment: Reissue the proposed regulations with a \n     specific, targeted policy on how greenhouse gas emissions \n     should be taken into account on federal projects under the \n     Endangered Species Act. Gutting the consultation process, \n     with all the unintended consequences of such an action, could \n     be avoided.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Bangor Daily News, Aug. 21, 2008]\n\n                        Unnecessary ESA Rewrite\n\n       The Endangered Species Act has rightly been criticized for \n     being slow and cumbersome. Eliminating a key provision of the \n     act--which requires agencies that promote development, such \n     as the Department of Transportation and the Bureau of \n     Reclamation, to consult with agencies charged with protecting \n     wildlife is not the solution.\n       The Bush administration, through the Departments of \n     Commerce and Interior, proposed such a change last week under \n     the guises of ``narrow'' updates to the act. Far from narrow, \n     this is a fundamental shift of responsibility. ``The fox \n     guarding the henhouse,'' was the favorite cliched description \n     from environmental groups. Cliche or not, they are right.\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\n       The Office of Surface Mining has more interest in allowing \n     ore to be mined than in protecting animals. The Army Corps of \n     Engineers is more concerned with seeing dredging projects \n     completed than ensuring fish habitat isn't destroyed. That's \n     why consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for \n     projects on land, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, \n     for marine projects, has long been required for work on \n     federal land, paid for with federal funds or requiring \n     federal permits.\n       Proposed new rules, published last Monday, would eliminate \n     all formal consultation, instead allowing the federal \n     agencies to decide whether proposed projects pose a threat to \n     species protected by the ESA. Informal consultations would \n     still be allowed if the federal agencies overseeing the \n     projects wanted advice or review by the wildlife or fisheries \n     service.\n       A major shortcoming of this proposal is that it aims to \n     correct a problem that is more perception than reality.\n       Between 1987 and 1996, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n     reviewed approximately 186,000 projects for possible impact \n     on listed species. In only 5046 cases--less than 3 percent--\n     were the projects deemed to adversely affect those species, \n     requiring formal consultation. Of these, 607 concluded that a \n     listed species would be jeopardized, but most could go \n     forward if modified. During this time, only 100--0.0005 \n     percent of the total reviewed by the service--were blocked \n     due to endangered species concerns.\n       In Maine, between 1990 and 2005, the service reviewed more \n     than 1,100 projects. In only eight was a formal consultation \n     warranted. In each of these cases, the service found that the \n     work could be done without harming the species in question, \n     most often bald eagles, and the projects were allowed to \n     proceed.\n       In another major overreach, the proposed rules eliminate \n     climate change as a consideration when reviewing projects and \n     their potential to harm threatened and endangered species. \n     This follows last year's Supreme Court ruling that the \n     Environmental Protection Agency had the authority to regulate \n     the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases \n     from cars. The agency had argued that carbon dioxide was not \n     a pollutant so the federal government could not regulate it.\n       Just as the EPA has refused to follow the court's ruling, \n     now the wildlife and fisheries services are saying greenhouse \n     gas emissions are beyond their reach. The proposed rule \n     basically says that because the consequences of global \n     warming are difficult to quantify and pinpoint, they \n     shouldn't be considered at all. By this rationale, no agency \n     in the U.S. is responsible for reducing America's \n     contribution to a growing global problem.\n       These changes will likely go into effect unless Congress \n     stops them, or a court does later. Congress must step in now.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From St. Louis Today, Aug. 19, 2008]\n\n                            Gutting the Law\n\n       Let's face it, the Endangered Species Act can create quite \n     a burden. If your goal is to build dams or open federal land \n     to mining, logging and oil drilling, all those threatened \n     animals and plants just get in the way.\n       Congress gets in the way, too, stubbornly insisting that \n     the Endangered Species Act be obeyed. In part, that means \n     that independent experts have to review any project proposed \n     for federal lands for its impact on endangered species.\n       So now comes the Bush administration with a parting gift to \n     its many friends in the timber, development and extraction \n     industries: An end-run around Congress.\n       In what Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne described last \n     week as a ``narrow regulatory change,'' the administration \n     has proposed changing that picky requirement that independent \n     botanists and biologists get involved in reviewing new \n     projects.\n       Instead, the projects will be reviewed by the very people \n     proposing them: Federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers or the Office of Surface Mining, whose expertise \n     lies elsewhere.\n       In May, White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten wrote a \n     memo to federal agencies outlining what he called a \n     ``principled approach to regulation as we sprint to the \n     finish'' of Mr. Bush's final term. Except under \n     ``extraordinary circumstances,'' any new regulations had to \n     be proposed--issued in draft form by publication in the \n     Federal Register--by June 1.\n       Apparently, new rules gutting an important protection in \n     the Endangered Species Act qualify as an ``extraordinary \n     circumstance.'' But Mr. Kempthorne said the new rules he \n     proposed last week are very limited in scope.\n       His new rules will ``provide clarity and certainty'' to the \n     Endangered Species Act. In fact, the law's purpose and \n     process already are clear. The administration's changes would \n     weaken it significantly.\n       This is hardly the first time the administration, having \n     failed to convince Congress to change environmental laws it \n     dislikes, has tried to recast the law by issuing new \n     regulations.\n       It took that route in 2005 to weaken parts of the Clean Air \n     Act. With a chilling Orwellian flourish, the administration \n     dubbed its new plan the ``Clear Skies Initiative.'' In 2006, \n     federal courts struck down a similar effort that would have \n     given the Environmental Protection Agency authority to \n     approve pesticides without input from Fish and Wildlife \n     Service scientists.\n       The Endangered Species Act has helped rescue the bald \n     eagle, other animals and plants from the brink of extinction \n     over the past three decades. This latest assault is certain \n     to face the same legal challenges that derailed the pesticide \n     regulations. It should suffer the same fate, too.\n       Regulations written in haste by an administration headed \n     for the exits--no matter which administration makes them--\n     make lovely parting gifts for special interests. But they \n     make for terrible government.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Aug. 12, 2008]\n\n        Endangered Law: Bush Rule Change Ignores Science--Again\n\n       It should come as no surprise.\n       The Bush administration has single-mindedly worked for \n     years to undo this country's landmark environmental \n     conservation measures. So a rule change to emasculate the 35-\n     year-old Endangered Species Act probably was to be expected. \n     After all, efforts by conservative members of Congress have \n     been thwarted for years by thoughtful senators and \n     representatives with more concern for the environment than \n     for developers, private contractors and the oil industry.\n       As his presidency grinds to a close, Bush and his \n     appointees are working overtime on roadblocks to prevent the \n     United States from taking any steps to reduce the use of \n     fossil fuels that might shrink Big Oil's bottom line. The \n     changes they're proposing would block regulation of the \n     greenhouse-gas emissions that are endangering plant and \n     animal species by eliminating science as a consideration.\n       Under the new rules, for example, the Bureau of Reclamation \n     could decide for itself whether a new dam posed a threat to \n     fish, and the Transportation Department alone could determine \n     whether a major highway threatened wildlife habitat. No \n     longer would those agencies have to consult with scientists \n     at the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service who have expertise in this complex area of \n     biology.\n       Bush has never let science get in the way of cronyism. On \n     the critical issues of global warming, in particular, Bush's \n     cohorts have soft-pedaled, ignored or simply edited out \n     scientists' conclusions.\n       When the polar bear became the first species threatened by \n     the effects of human-caused climate change, Interior \n     Secretary Dirk Kempthorne took the unprecedented step of \n     declaring the bear threatened, but also forbidding any \n     requirements to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, the primary \n     cause of climate change, in order to protect the animal.\n       Besides eliminating all basic scientific recommendations, \n     the rule change would extend the polar bear ruling to all \n     species, barring federal agencies from even considering how \n     CO2 emissions and their contribution to global \n     warming impact species and habitat.\n       These execrable rule changes threaten the ESA, but they \n     don't have to make it extinct. If the changes are approved by \n     the agencies before Bush leaves office, a new president and \n     Congress should act immediately to reverse them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer]\n\n                 Endangered Species: A 9-second Rewrite\n\n       It's a time of maximum danger for the environment. The \n     clock is winding down on the Bush administration, leaving \n     little time to fulfill its long-cherished dreams of weakening \n     endangered species protections.\n       Not known for worrying about manipulating the rules, facts \n     or common sense, the administration appears ready to go to \n     absurd lengths to rush through damaging changes. Consider how \n     the Department of the Interior is hurrying to cement into \n     federal policy the administration's highhanded disdain for \n     scientific advice, with a proposed rule that would exclude \n     greenhouse gases and the advice of federal biologists from \n     decisions about whether dams, power plants and other federal \n     projects could harm endangered species. According to an \n     Associated Press report, agency officials will review--so to \n     speak--the 200,000 comments on the policy at a pace of one \n     every nine seconds.\n       Somewhat similarly, the National Marine Fisheries Service \n     is working on a rule to expedite all environmental reviews of \n     fisheries decisions. After scheduling only three public \n     hearings around the country, the agency then cut short a July \n     hearing in Seattle, the only West Coast opportunity to \n     comment. U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott last month requested an \n     extension of the comment period.\n       The National Resources Defense Council questions whether \n     Interior's policy will even meet legal requirements. It's \n     particularly disappointing to see blatant politicization in \n     Interior, where we have admired Secretary Dirk Kempthorne and \n     thought of him as someone who could serve well in a McCain \n     administration.\n       Kempthorne's aim apparently is to finish work early enough \n     so the devastation of environmental protections can't be \n     undone by the next administration without a years long formal \n     review. There is an alternative that doesn't require waiting \n     for a new administration. If Congress returns to work for an \n     economic fix, it also should put an immediate stop to this \n     nonsense.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Las Vegas Sun, Oct. 23, 2008]\n\n                            A Complete Sham\n\n       The Bush administration is making a mockery of a long-\n     standing practice in the\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\n     federal government--to set aside substantial time for \n     reviewing public comments about major rule changes.\n       Since midsummer the Interior Department has been rushing to \n     implement a high priority of President Bush's regarding the \n     Endangered Species Act. The White House is seeking rule \n     changes that would significantly dilute the act's \n     effectiveness.\n       The administration tried to get the rule changes through \n     Congress in 2005, but failed. Now it wants to make the \n     changes administratively, which it claims it has the power to \n     do once public comments have been received and reviewed.\n       A 60-day comment period expired last week. Online responses \n     and letters numbered at least 200,000 (not counting 100,000 \n     form letters).\n       Normally, it would take months to review that many \n     comments. But the Associated Press reported that a team of 15 \n     was ordered to have the reviews completed this week. They \n     were given 32 hours, from Tuesday through Friday.\n       An analysis by the House Natural Resources Committee, led \n     by Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., concluded that each member of \n     the team would have to review seven comments each minute. \n     Many of the comments are long and technical, including one \n     submitted by a University of California law professor that \n     numbers 70 pages.\n       The rule changes would give federal agencies the power to \n     decide for themselves whether any project they were planning \n     to build, fund or authorize, including highways, dams and \n     mines, would harm endangered species. Since the Endangered \n     Species Act was passed in 1973, such projects have undergone \n     independent review by government scientists.\n       The new rules would also prohibit federal agencies from \n     assessing whether emissions from a project would intensify \n     global warming, thus harming endangered species or their \n     habitats.\n       Obviously, the administration is so hellbent on getting \n     these developer-friendly changes made that it is turning the \n     comment review process into a total sham. If the rules indeed \n     get changed, the next president should immediately work to \n     reverse them--this time after giving appropriate thought to \n     public comments.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Virginian-Pilot, Aug. 18, 2008]\n\n             Shredder Is Overheating in Bush's Final Months\n\n       Generally speaking, it is a very bad idea to enlist hungry \n     foxes to guard the chickens, since they rarely have the \n     birds' best interests at heart. In the waning days of this \n     White House, doing so is called ``streamlining,'' presumably \n     because it gets food into the foxes faster.\n       The administration is hard at work in its last months \n     gutting decades of environmental and wildlife regulation. \n     That the moves defy both the legislative and judicial \n     branches of the government is just a bonus.\n       According to the draft regulations, obtained by the \n     Associated Press, the White House intends to allow federal \n     agencies to skip an independent review designed to determine \n     whether a project threatens animals or wildlife. Instead, the \n     agencies would do the assessments themselves.\n       The whole reason that agencies were required to submit to \n     such tests was because they weren't able to see beyond their \n     own narrow interests--in building a dam, in locating a \n     military base, in expanding a highway--to the larger public \n     interest in protecting species.\n       The regulations, which don't require congressional \n     approval, would amount to the biggest changes in endangered \n     species law in decades.\n       The new rules would also forbid the federal government from \n     considering the greenhouse gas emissions of a project in \n     determining the effects on threatened species. That's nothing \n     more than a backdoor attempt to circumvent the \n     administration's own conclusion that global warming is \n     killing polar bears.\n       The Endangered Species Act isn't the only environmental \n     regulation the administration seems determined to leave in \n     tatters.\n       According to Pilot writer Catherine Kozak, the National \n     Marine Fisheries Service has proposed replacing environmental \n     impact analyses and shortening public comment periods when \n     developing or changing rules for fisheries management. The \n     goal is to shut citizens out, or at least to mute their \n     voices.\n       ``They're throwing out 40 years of case law,'' said Sera \n     Harold Drevenak, South Atlantic representative with the \n     Marine Fish Conservation Network. ``I don't see how it's \n     making anything any simpler. To start over from scratch is \n     ridiculous.''\n       Or sublime, depending on your perspective.\n       Nobody advocates unnecessary regulation that masks a \n     political agenda. But the administration seems bent on doing \n     away with environmental regulation simply because it doesn't \n     like the result, or the interpretation by regulators, \n     Congress or the courts.\n       For eight years now, there have been plenty of hints that \n     the Bush administration had no qualms about entrusting foxes \n     with keys to the White House, as when the vice president \n     encouraged oil companies to craft the nation's energy policy, \n     or when politicians were encouraged to use the Justice \n     Department to settle scores.\n       The effect of the White House push on the environment is \n     likely to be measured largely by the time opponents will \n     waste fighting them.\n       The resulting uncertainty will also paralyze precisely the \n     projects the revisions were designed to speed, because \n     whoever is elected next to guard the nation's henhouse will \n     almost certainly change the rules yet again.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Congress has a right to override a \nregulation, and in fact Congress should use this authority more often. \nExercising the right of legislative review of regulations is a key \nresponsibility of Congress. Should Congress deem a regulation \ndeficient, members should exercise their legislative authority to \nchange or override that rule. The Omnibus appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2009 includes a provision in section 429 effectively doing \nthat by giving the Secretary of the Interior the authority to withdraw \nor reissue two rules of the Bush administration related to the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  One rule, relating to Interagency Cooperation under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, weakens the requirement that Federal agencies consult with \neither the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries \nService, the agencies that have expertise in matters related to \nendangered and threatened species. Giving Federal agencies the \npermission to bypass the consultation with these expert agencies harms \nthe purpose of the Endangered Species Act.\n  The other rule includes a special provision that would prohibit the \nuse of the Endangered Species Act from activities that occur outside of \nthe current range of the species. I agree that it is better that \ngreenhouse gas emissions should be controlled through a national \neconomy-wide scheme rather than through the Endangered Species Act. \nHowever, the language isn't mandatory and I also understand that even \nif the Secretary of the Interior rescinds this rule, an interim final \nrule protecting the polar bear would still be in effect and would also \ninclude the reasonable limitations provided in section 4(d) of this \nrule.\n  Finally, we are in a unique procedural situation where the passage of \nany amendment will push us to a year-long continuing resolution instead \nof appropriations. That outcome needs to be avoided.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it might be easier to read the two \nsentences in the law that were there before:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     under any title of this Act may be made available to make any \n     assessed contribution or voluntary payment of the United \n     States to the United Nations if the United Nations implements \n     or imposes any taxation on any United States persons.\n\n  It has been there since 1996. It had broad support. Nobody knows why \nit was taken out, but in this law that language was taken out that has \nbeen there for 13 years. So I encourage us to support this amendment to \nput that language back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is an unnecessary amendment. The \nSenator from Oklahoma asked an obvious question: Why is this language \nnot in there? Nobody wanted it. No Republican asked for it. No Democrat \nasked for it. The Bush administration didn't ask for it. We constantly \nremove outdated, unnecessary language from these bills to clean them \nup.\n  The United Nations has no power to tax the United States or any \nperson in the United States. It would be like saying we want to pass a \nlaw that says that if the U.N. were to launch several divisions of \nsoldiers against us, we will cut off their funding. They can't do that \nany more than they can impose a tax against us. They are not a taxing \norganization.\n  So we deleted provisions like this that serve no purpose, and which \nno senator requested. It has no practical effect. The Bush \nadministration didn't want it. No Republican asked for it. No Democrat \nasked for it. Let's focus on the real problems such as Darfur, the \nMiddle East, and Afghanistan where we are asking United Nations \npeacekeepers and aid workers to risk their lives to support our goals.\n  I oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, lest there be any confusion, I filed this \namendment on Monday and made it pending on Tuesday, and I spoke to it \nthen. It is simple. Last July, the Senate, in the debate on the PEPFAR \nbill, voice voted an amendment to that bill that created a $2 billion, \n5-year authorization for an emergency fund for Indian health and \nsafety. All my amendment does is fund it, $400 million. It wasn't \nfunded in the bill. I paid for it by taking a one-tenth of 1 percent \nacross-the-board reduction in the entire bill to put the $400 million \ninto this fund, which is necessary to fund this important program for \nIndian health and safety. That means the increase in the bill won't be \n8.3 percent, it will be 8.2 percent. Contrary to what was stated, it \nincreases Indian health care by $23 million. It was stated that it \nwould reduce the health care account by a little over a million \ndollars. Congress authorized it last summer.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to waive the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Thune amendment and ask \nthis body to vote against it.\n  Last year's Interior appropriations bill provided $5.6 billion for \nNative American programs. This year, the regular appropriations bill \nand the recently enacted Recovery Act will provide $6.9 billion for \nIndian health. That is an increase of 23 percent over the 2008 level. \nThe Thune amendment would increase the funding an additional 6 percent, \nor $400 million, paid for by an across-the-board cut in every account \nin this omnibus bill. That would cause the Interior bill to exceed its \nallocation; consequently, a point of order would rest against the \nentire Interior bill and it would be dead.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. THUNE.

On this vote, the yeas are 26, the nays are \n68. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 634\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 10 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 634 offered by the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if my colleagues on the other side are \nwilling, I am willing to cut this time in half.\n  My amendment is actually very simple. If my colleagues would give me \na moment to explain, all this amendment says is that none of the money \nthat is spent in this bill can go to companies that are helping Iran; \nthat is to say, they are doing business with Iran in the export or \nimport business.\n  In the campaign, the President noted that the kind of sanction we \nneed to impose is on the companies, for example, that are providing \nrefined gasoline to Iran. One of the first reports to the President by \nnonproliferation expert, David Albright, said:\n\n       At a first step, the Obama administration should ask all of \n     Iran's gasoline suppliers to stop their sales to Iran, \n     followed by an initiative to seek agreement among supplier \n     nations not to provide Iran gasoline.\n\n  The President has all of the authorities he needs to engage in this. \nThe one thing that Congress can do that we have not done yet is with \nthe power of the purse; that is, to make sure none of the money in the \nomnibus bill would go to any of the companies that are doing business \nwith Iran.\n  One quick example of why it is necessary: Senator Lieberman and I \nsent a letter to the Eximbank. Eximbank gets money. That money can go \nto companies. Once they got the letter, those companies stopped sending \nrefined gas to Iran. I don't know if that is because of our letter. \nThat is the kind of stuff we need to stop with this amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues agree we do not need to send this money to \ncompanies that do business with Iran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strenuous \nobjection to the amendment that is being offered by the Senator from \nArizona. The amendment has a purpose, no doubt, but it is particularly \nand solely political.\n  Let there be no doubt, we have to stop companies from doing business \nwith Iran. Iran's nuclear technology program grows stronger every day, \nand it represents a serious threat to our country, to Israel, and to \nmankind. It is known that Iran also funds terrorist organizations, such \nas Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why we have to deal with this threat \nseriously whenever we can do so.\n  Over the last few years, I have offered three amendments to block \nAmerican companies from helping Iran to develop its nuclear technology \nand promote terrorist actions. But when the chips were down, my \nRepublican colleagues voted against three amendments.\n  My amendment would have closed the loophole in our laws that allows \nAmerican-owned companies to use sham offshore subsidiaries to do \nbusiness with Iran. Three times I brought amendments for a vote on the \nSenate floor to shut down this loophole. But each and every time, the \nRepublican Members of the Senate voted against commonsense legislation. \nThey voted to keep Iran open for business. They voted to allow American \ncompanies to help the regime in Tehran, as the Senator said, to produce \noil, to produce revenues they sent to Iraq to help those guys kill our \ntroops.\n  So I ask, why now are these Members so interested in stopping \ncompanies from doing business with Iran? We know why. Raw political \nshowmanship. But we have to stop Iran's serious nuclear threat from \ncontinuing to try to wipe Israel off the map and to attack the United \nStates and other democratic nations. Our national security is at stake, \nand we should have a serious debate on how to block Iran's nuclear \nprogram. That is why we have to object to Senator Kyl's amendment.\n  There is another problem with his amendment. My legislation would \nhave closed the ``business with terrorists'' loophole, and this \namendment does not. I checked with the Congressional Research Service. \nCRS says this amendment will not have any effect on present sanctions. \nIt will have little or no influence on the mad stream of threats and \nthe ugly hatred that comes from Iran.\n  If the Senator wants us to work together to get a decent approach to \nget at this problem, I would be happy to work with him on it in the \ndays ahead. But this amendment before us does nothing to stop their mad \ndash to build a nuclear threat to humankind. I hope we can work \ntogether to come up with a strong piece of legislation to end this \npractice once and for all.\n  The amendment simply is a gimmick to attack the omnibus bill, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a little over a minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield a minute to my friend from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly--and I say this because I \nhappen to agree with, and I think most of our colleagues agree with, \nthe intent of the Senator from Arizona--this has been a matter before \nthe Banking Committee. In fact, in the last session of Congress, by a \nvote of 19 to 2, the Banking Committee--with Senator Shelby as ranking \nmember--approved Comprehensive Iran sanctions legislation, that went \nfar beyond the scope of the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nArizona. But when the legislation was sent to the Senate floor, it was \nblocked by the Senate minority. I thank my colleagues on the committee \nwho supported it.\n  Right now, however, the administration is conducting a policy review \non Iran at the very time we are gathering here to engage in this \ndebate. I think before considering new legislation, it would be wise to \nhave some hearings, after the administration completes its review and \ndecide the appropriate course of action, in consultation with the \nappropriate federal agencies.\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\n  Clearly, sanctions dealing with Iran's energy sector, as Senator Kyl \npointed out, have great merit, as Congress has determined in years \npast. But I think there is a time and a place for deciding major \nchanges in our sanctions policy--probably not this evening at 7 \no'clock, at the end of a long debate on this omnibus bill, when so much \nis at stake. Such changes should not be added to this underlying bill. \nSpeaker Pelosi has made clear she would pursue a year-long Continuing \nResolution if this bill is changed in any way the day before funds for \nthe government expire. If that happens, the amendment would essentially \nkill or potentially delay critical funding, including an additional $5 \nmillion slated for the Department of the Treasury's Terrorism and \nFinancial Intelligence unit to enforce our sanctions against Iran.\n  I say respectfully, while there is no disagreement that something \nmust be done to stop Iran's efforts to promote terrorism and \nproliferate weapons of mass destruction, we must do so in close \ncoordination with the new Administration, much as we worked with the \nBush administration in fashioning our sanctions bill last year. Let the \nObama Administration's Iran review be completed. Once we have an \nopportunity to examine it, we may then consider a new approach to our \nIran policy. At that time, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle to address these critical \nmatters. I therefore, urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the aim and intent of the Kyl \namendment that prohibits any omnibus funding being spent on new \ncontracts with companies that do business with Iran's energy sector. \nIran's energy resources provide massive amounts of petro-dollars to \nthis regime.\n  In 2008 alone, Iran made over $65 billion in profits from exporting \noil. Make no mistake where these dollars are spent--these profits \ndirectly contribute to Iran's ability to arm, train, and fund \nHezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups that seek to do Israel, \nthe United States, and our allies harm.\n  Although I support the intent of the Kyl amendment, I oppose it today \nbecause it is legislating in an appropriations bill and it would \nfurther delay the delivery of $2.48 billion in urgently needed security \nassistance to Israel which is contained in the bill.\n  Tough, targeted, and enforceable sanctions against Iran must be \nimplemented. I look forward to working on a comprehensive Iran \nsanctions policy with the Obama administration this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, actually, I am not proposing a new regime of \nsanctions or anything that needs to be studied. My amendment simply \ngoes to this Omnibus appropriations bill and says what I think all of \nus intend, which is none of the money shall be spent or shall go to \ncompanies that are doing this kind of business with Iran, the kind of \nbusiness that is already subject to sanctions. That is already the law.\n  All we are saying is, nothing in this bill can get money to those \ncompanies. It is the kind of thing we had to do with the Eximbank \nbecause as they, in their letter back to us said, we do not allow \npolitical considerations to determine whether we make a loan to a \ncountry. That is why they were able to make the loan to Iran and why we \ncould do nothing to stop that. Once we wrote the letter, however, and \npointed out this was a violation of our sanctions, then mysteriously, \nthe effort of the company ceased.\n  All we want to make sure is that nothing in this bill, none of the \nmoney in this particular bill goes to those companies. So it is not a \nnew sanctions regime or anything new that I think has to be studied.\n  With all due respect, this is not for political showmanship. Had this \nbill gone through a little different process, we could have worked this \nout. But under the circumstances, that wasn't possible. As a result, I \nthought it was important to make sure none of the money in this bill is \nspent on these companies.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator have time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think there is time here, if there is more \ntime needed for everybody on this amendment. If there is more time \nneeded, why don't we extend the time for a little bit.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Massachusetts for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate the Senator doing that.\n  I wish to point out a couple things to the audience. First of all, we \nhave had 3 days of hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee on Iran. \nToday, GEN Brent Scowcroft and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski made it clear \nthis is the not an advisable way to approach the current situation in \nIran; that we need to think carefully about the overall record of the \ntype of sanctions we develop or that will be interpreted, as a result, \nas taking an effort unilaterally by the Senate outside the \nadministration's review process and outside its foreign policy.\n  Moreover, the Foreign Assets Control Office, which is responsible now \nfor rooting out Iran's program, actually loses money under this \namendment and would, therefore, not be able to do the job it is doing \ntoday with respect to it.\n  Thirdly, there is no definition here of what a business presence is. \nThe fact is, the administration right now is working with a bunch of \nmoderate Arab countries, as well as some of our allies in Europe, in \norder to put together a sanctions regime that has bite, if we need it. \nThis, in fact, could prevent some of those countries from feeling good \nabout joining in that effort or ultimately joining in it.\n  I would ask my colleague if he would be willing to come together with \nus. There isn't anybody in this body who doesn't understand the \nseriousness of what Iran is doing. We had classified briefings on it \nyesterday. But we owe the administration the opportunity to decide what \nit believes is the proper regime for sanctions, and so I ask my \ncolleague if he would consider that it might be better, rather than \neven having a vote, to give us the opportunity to do that, and we will \nwork together and see if we can't come up with a sensible, unified \nbipartisan approach to Iran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Given the fact that I think my remaining 2 minutes have \nexpired, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute of time to \nrespond to my colleague's question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I were proposing some new sanctions \nregime, that would be an entirely appropriate request, and of course I \nwould accede to it. I am not asking for any new sanctions or any new \nlaw. All this amendment does is to say that the money in this \nappropriations bill doesn't go to a country that is doing these kinds \nof exports or imports to Iran. That is all. We have the power of the \npurse, and surely we can restrict our own expenditure of money to \ncountries that are cooperating with us in dealing with Iran, rather \nthan dealing with Iran.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this. It is a very limited amendment. \nIt is not a new policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Republican leader and I be \nallowed to offer a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of the pending amendments, no further amendments be in \norder this evening; that the vote on the motion to invoke cloture occur \nat 8:15 p.m. tonight, and that the time until then be equally divided \nand controlled between the leaders or their designees; that if cloture \nis invoked, then all postcloture time be\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\nconsidered yielded back, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate \nthen proceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nConrad), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Johanns) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. \nSessions).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 638, offered by \nthe Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this amendment would strike section 626 \nfrom the bill. This is a section that gives the Federal Trade \nCommission authority to expedite rulemaking over mortgage loans that \nare now overseen by not only the FTC but Federal banking and credit \nunion regulators. This grant of increased authority to the FTC is not \nappropriate because we already have Federal regulators over both the \nbanking and credit union industries. I think everyone agrees we do not \nwant to see this extended regulatory authority changed. I have been \nworking with our Banking Committee chairman, Senator Dodd, and with \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Inouye, to see if we can address this.\n  It is my understanding we have an agreement and Senator Dodd will \ndiscuss that agreement and enter into a colloquy for the Record that \nwill establish that we do not want to change the regulatory authority \nand the jurisdictional structures we now have for our Federal \nregulators over our depository institutions, and that we will, in a \nvery expedited manner in the next available option for a legislative \nvehicle, make statutory changes to correct that. In the meantime we \nwill make it clear the intent of this legislation is not to have the \nFTC engage in rulemaking that would seek to assert jurisdiction over \nany of the institutions over which it does not now have authority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I seek time of my own time. My colleague is \nexactly right and I thank him immensely for his involvement. We thank \nSenator Inouye as well as others who were part of this exchange, a \ncolloquy which we will submit for the Record, which explains exactly \nwhat the Senator from Idaho has described. He has it exactly right. \nThis is an expanded removal of jurisdiction from one area to another. \nThere are a lot of very serious questions raised by it.\n  Our intent is at the earliest possible time we will have legislation \nto correct what is in this bill and change that. I thank him for his \ncooperation on this. I thank Senator Inouye and the staff and other \npeople who could have objected to this. Senator Dorgan and others have \nhad some strong views on this and I am very grateful to him as well, \nunderstanding our concerns on this matter. We will have a chance to \ncome back to it. I again thank my colleague who helped us craft this \ncolloquy which allowed us to move beyond this particular point. There \nmay be others who want to object to what we want to do, but we feel \nstrongly about the language of the amendment that Senator Crapo has \ncrafted here and we will hopefully get to that quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Idaho and \nmy colleague from Connecticut. The Federal Trade Commission does not \nhave jurisdiction over FDIC-insured banks. There was no intention in \nany legislation drafted here to give them that jurisdiction and I think \nthis colloquy clarifies that. If there is any lack of clarity going \nforward, I certainly want to work with my colleagues from Idaho and \nConnecticut to make certain there is no confusion at all about what \nthis applies to. This does not apply to FDIC-insured banks.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I seek clarification from the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee about the \nintent and effect of section 626 of Division D of the bill. Will the \nSenators confirm that section 626 was designed to enhance the FTC's \nability to impose new standards only on those mortgage industry \nparticipants that are currently subject to the FTC's rulemaking \njurisdiction?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, that is correct. Section 626 is not intended to \nalter the allocation of responsibility for the Federal oversight of \nlenders under current law. The FTC is currently authorized, under the \nFederal Trade Commission Act, to issue regulations defining unfair and \ndeceptive acts and practices by mortgage industry participants that are \nregulated at the Federal level by the FTC, such as nonbank mortgage \nbrokers. Section 626 directs the FTC to initiate such a rulemaking \nwithin 90 days, using procedures widely used by all agencies under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, instead of more protracted procedures \nspecified for FTC unfair and deceptive practices rulemaking under \nsection 18 of the FTC Act. Section 626 is not intended to apply to \ninstitutions including banks, thrifts and credit unions that are \noutside the FTC's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur with Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DODD. With respect to the provisions granting the states \nauthority to take enforcement action, is it your intent the states \nlimit their enforcement actions under the new mortgage standards \npromulgated by the FTC, or under TILA, only to those mortgage industry \nparticipants that are not currently supervised by the federal banking \nagencies or are not Federal credit unions?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, the Senator from Connecticut is correct. Our \nintention was to permit state attorneys general to bring civil actions \nonly against mortgage industry participants that are not supervised by \nthe Federal banking agencies or are not Federal credit unions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, I concur with Senator Dodd and Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask the Senators to work with me to add an amendment to \nthe next appropriate legislative vehicle that clarifies the scope of \nthis provision to reflect the gentlemen's intent and that provides \nappropriate participation by state attorneys general in enforcement of \nfederal mortgage standards.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree, and commit to work with the Senator from \nConnecticut to clarify this provision as expeditiously as possible on \nthe next appropriate vehicle.\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I, too, will work with the Senator to clarify this \nprovision.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that there is \nconsensus that section 626 goes too far and that it is not the \nintention of the chairman of the Banking Committee and the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee to provide the Federal Trade Commission \nauthority in its rulemaking over mortgage loans overseen by the Federal \nbanking and credit union regulators. However, if the intention is \nmerely to expedite the FTC rulemaking process over nonbanks then the \nlanguage should be clear on that account. Unfortunately, that is not \nthe case.\n  It is important to remember that once this legislation is signed into \nlaw, the FTC is directed to initiate rulemaking within 90 days. Rather \nthan agreeing to clarify this issue at a later point, it is my strong \npreference that the Senate would have deleted this section and agreed \nto working out compromise language at a later point. That is what my \namendment would have accomplished by striking the section.\n  Per the colloquy of Senators Dodd, Inouye, and Dorgan, I will follow \nup with the FTC that it is the clear intent of the Senate that the \nprovision does not expand the FTC's regulatory jurisdiction and that \nthe required FTC rulemaking will not attempt to include insured \ndepository institutions. I will also note that there is a bi-partisan \nagreement that the Senate will shortly take up legislation to clarify \nthe scope of the legislation to that effect. Additionally, in light of \nthe focus by the Federal Reserve Board on mortgage lending, the FTC \nshould be required to consult with the Federal Reserve Board in \ndeveloping their rule. I would encourage my colleagues to send similar \nletters to the FTC.\n  If the initial FTC proposed rule attempts to go beyond this scope, it \nis my understanding that there is agreement that the Senate would \nimmediately take up legislation and stop that from occurring. It would \nbe a terrible mistake to add another patchwork of conflicting \nauthorities and interpretations of Federal laws for insured depository \ninstitutions as it relates to home loans and other types of consumer \nfinance transactions. This type of regulatory uncertainty and \ncomplexity will only further complicate the resurrection of our \nmortgage market, harming consumers who are having a difficult enough \ntime obtaining appropriate mortgage loans.\n  I intend to closely monitor how the FTC proceeds and work with my \ncolleagues to craft a narrow legislative clarification. If we cannot \nshortly come to agreement on this front, then I will push for a vote to \neliminate this authority in the next appropriate vehicle before the \nSenate.\n  With that clarification and explanation, the FTC rulemaking that will \nbe able to proceed under this legislation will not seek to extend to \nthe FDIC depository institutions and credit union regulated \ninstitutions, then I--and our agreement that we would on an expeditious \nbasis statutorily seek to correct that and make that clear in the \nCongressional Record, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                     Restoring Nominal Drug Prices\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman \nof the Committee on Finance, Senator Max Baucus. Senator Baucus, I am \nvery pleased to see that the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus appropriations \nbill corrects an unintended consequence of a provision in the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005, DRA. Section 6001(d) of the DRA, which is Public \nLaw 109-171, caused family planning clinics that do not receive Federal \nfunding and university-based clinics to sustain increases in the price \nof oral contraceptives as much as tenfold over the past 2 years. This \nis because drug manufacturers stopped offering discounts to these \nclinics in response to changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program made \nby the DRA. While discounts remained perfectly legal, drug companies \nwere concerned about the impact of their Medicaid rebate liability for \nthe continued offering of discounts to certain family planning and \ncollege- or university-based clinics. The price increases have put a \nterrible strain on our country's first line of defense against \nunintended pregnancies. We have the highest unintended pregnancy rate \nof any advanced industrial country.\n  With enactment of this critical legislation, these clinics will once \nagain have access to nominally priced drugs, should private sector \nmanufacturers choose to provide these discounts. This access should \nbegin immediately upon enactment, and manufacturers should feel \nconfident that they can extend discounts to family planning clinics \nsuch as Planned Parenthood and college and university clinics without \nit affecting the rebates they must provide under Federal law to State \nMedicaid programs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I share the Senator's views on this \nmatter. It has taken too long to correct what all parties agree was an \nunintended outcome of the DRA. I had asked the previous administration \nto use the discretion provided in the DRA to designate additional \nhealth providers as entities to whom the sale of nominally priced drugs \nis appropriate. The Bush administration chose not to make these \ndesignations when it promulgated final regulations on July 17, 2007, \nand so Congress is acting now to correct this error. The Senate \nincluded this provision in last year's Iraq supplemental appropriations \nbill, but the administration objected to its inclusion so it did not \nbecome law.\n  It is my understanding that, once this provision is enacted into law, \ndrug manufacturers will immediately be able to restore the nominal drug \nprices they provided to these types of clinics--family planning clinics \nand college and university health centers--for decades.\n  This provision simply restores the original policy in place since the \nenactment of the Medicaid rebate program in the Omnibus Reconciliation \nAct of 1990. Then, as now, no administrative action is necessary for \nmanufacturers to commence offering deep discounts to the entities \ndescribed in this provision.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator. I hope that the manufacturers will \ndo this and that women will have access to affordable birth control and \nother critical health services.\n\n\n                         Transportation Funding\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I wish today to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague, the Senator from Washington and the chairman of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. As the chairman is aware, \nlanguage was included in the explanatory statement accompanying the \nbill before us to help address an issue that has plagued the Milwaukee \narea for several years.\n  Due to a longstanding dispute between city and county officials, \nunobligated transportation dollars have lost value with each passing \nyear. In an effort to spend down those funds on much needed transit \nprojects, the report resolves this dispute by dividing the funding. I \nhave spoken with Congressman Obey, the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee, to confirm the intent of the language \nincluded in the explanatory statement. I would ask the Senator from \nWashington, is it your understanding that it is the expectation of both \nthe House and Senate committees that 60 percent of the funding in \nquestion should be made available to the city of Milwaukee for a \ndowntown fixed-rail corridor while 40 percent of the funding should be \nmade available to the county of Milwaukee for energy efficient buses?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. To the Senator from Wisconsin I would say, yes, that is \nour expectation.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee for her help and for engaging in this colloquy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and \nRelated Agencies, I rise to clarify an error that we have found in the \nexplanatory materials accompanying H.R. 1105, the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act. Included within the Transportation-Housing Division \nof the bill is an appropriation of $570,000 within the TCSP program for \ntransportation improvement in the Antelope Valley in Lincoln, NE. The \nattribution table that accompanies the explanatory statement to the \nbill inadvertently omits the name of the Senate sponsor of that \nappropriation. Mr. President, the Senate sponsor of the project is my \ncolleague, Senator Ben Nelson.\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus \nappropriations bill would provide $5 million for design and real estate \nactivities and pump supply elements for the Yazoo Basin, Yazoo \nBackwater Pumping Plant and for activities associated with the Theodore \nRoosevelt National Wildlife Refuge. I want to clarify that nothing in \nthe language is intended to: (1) override or otherwise affect the final \ndetermination that was effective August 31, 2008, and published in the \nFederal Register on September 19, 2008, of the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency under section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act that \nprohibits the use of wetlands and other waters of the United States in \nIssaquena County, MS, as a disposal site for the discharge of dredged \nor fill material for the construction of the proposed Yazoo Backwater \nArea Pumps Project, (2) create or imply any exception with respect to \nthe project to the requirements of the Clean Water Act, including any \nexceptions from the prohibitions and regulatory requirements of the \nClean Water Act under section 404(r); or (3) affect the application of \nany other environmental laws with respect to the project.\n  As chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the Clean Water \nAct and authorizations for the civil works program of the Corps of \nEngineers, I believe it is critical that our environmental laws be \nadhered to in the planning, construction, and operation and maintenance \nof all Corps of Engineers' projects.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish briefly to discuss an amendment that \nI filed related to the royalty collection of coal and other leasable \nminerals. I want to be clear that I am in favor of having coal \ncompanies and other mining companies pay the royalties they are \nrequired to pay. I believe that they should pay them on time and I \nbelieve that they should face the consequences if they do not pay them \non time.\n  The provision in the omnibus bill is arbitrary. It attempts to apply \nthe penalty sections of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act \nto coal leases. The provision comes out of nowhere and, to my \nknowledge, has not been studied by the Senate Energy Committee nor the \nHouse Natural Resources Committee. This is a policy change, not a \nfunding matter, and therefore, it should be considered in the normal \nlegislative process--not slipped into an omnibus appropriations bill.\n  I have put forth this amendment to take a more considerate approach. \nMy amendment would strike this provision and replace it with a study by \nthe Minerals Management Service, MMS, the Government's royalty \ncollection agency. The MMS would examine the current royalty system and \nprovide a report back to Congress within 180 days that includes any \nrecommendations with ways that royalty collection process can be \nimproved. Doing so would then give the Senate the appropriate amount of \nbackground to consider making these changes and would ensure that we do \nnot make a change that has unintended consequences.\n  Again, I want to reiterate that I fully support companies making \nroyalty payments on time and if they don't, I support them being \npunished. I do not, however, support the process by which the majority \nhas stuck this legislative provision in an appropriations bill. Rather \nthan shooting from the hip, the Senate should give it proper \nconsideration.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as chairwoman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, I rise \ntoday to clarify for the Senate the sponsorship of three \ncongressionally designated projects, recipient name of one \ncongressionally directed project, and locations of three \ncongressionally designated projects included in the Joint Explanatory \nStatement to accompany H.R. 1105, the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act. Specifically:\n  Senator Bill Nelson should be listed as having requested funding for \nthe Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, RAINN, Washington, DC, for \nnational anti-sexual assault programs funded through the Department of \nJustice;\n  Senator Ben Nelson should not be listed as having requested funding \nfor the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, RAINN, Washington, DC, \nfor national anti-sexual assault programs funded through the Department \nof Justice;\n  Senators Ben Nelson and Crapo should not be listed as having \nrequested funding for the National Police Athletic League, Jupiter, FL, \nfor National Police Athletic League Programs funded through the \nDepartment of Justice;\n  ``Union Springs YMCA'' should be listed as ``Union Springs Recreation \nProgram'', Union Springs, AL, for youth mentoring and juvenile justice \nprograms funded through the Department of Justice;\n  Location of the Citizenship Trust at American Village should be \nlisted as Montevallo, AL, for youth mentoring and juvenile justice \nprograms funded through the Department of Justice;\n  Location of the Scottsboro Police Department should be listed as \nFlorence, AL, for the Scottsboro Police Department funded through the \nDepartment of Justice; and\n  Location of the Alabama 4-H Foundation should be listed as \nColumbiana, AL, for juvenile justice prevention programs funded through \nthe Department of Justice.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a longtime advocate of greater \ntransparency in our government, I am pleased that the Omnibus \nappropriations bill includes several key provisions to strengthen the \nFreedom of Information Act--FOIA--and to protect Americans' privacy and \ncivil liberties.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill provides $1 million in funding to \nestablish the new Office of Government Information Services--OGIS--in \nthe National Archives and Records Administration. When Congress enacted \nthe Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act of 2007, which made the first \nmajor reforms to FOIA in more than a decade, a key component of that \nbill was the creation of the OGIS to mediate FOIA disputes, review \nagency compliance with FOIA, and house a newly created FOIA ombudsman. \nEstablishing this new FOIA office within the National Archives is \nessential to reversing the troubling trend of lax FOIA compliance and \nexcessive government secrecy during the past 8 years. The OGIS will \nalso play a critical role in meeting the goals of President Obama's new \ndirective on FOIA. I thank Senators Cornyn, Inouye and Cochran for \ntheir support of funding for this critical new office. I also thank the \nmany FOIA and open government groups, including OpenTheGovernment.org, \nthe Sunshine in Government Initiative and the National Security \nArchive, who have advocated tirelessly for a fully operational OGIS.\n  The bill also includes much-needed funding to reconstitute the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. When Congress enacted the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act in 2004, it \nimplemented a 9/11 Commission recommendation to establish an \nindependent board to help protect Americans' privacy and civil \nliberties. Since then, I have worked hard to make sure that the Privacy \nand Civil Liberties Oversight Board has the resources and personnel to \nfulfill this important mission.\n  During the last Congress, I worked with Senators Lieberman and Durbin \nto further strengthen this Board in the 9/11 reform bill. \nUnfortunately, the last administration left the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board with no members or staff. The Board is too \nimportant for us to let it fall by the wayside. The funding in the \nomnibus bill will help to reconstitute the Board so it can get back to \nwork. Now that this initial funding is in place, I hope the President \nwill promptly name qualified nominees so that the Board can carry out \nits important work.\n  Both of these provisions will help to make our government more open \nand accountable to the American people. That is something that \nDemocrats, Republicans and Independents alike can--and should--\ncelebrate. Again, I commend the bill's lead sponsors and the President \nfor their demonstrated commitment to open and transparent government.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I filed an amendment that would help \nmillions of small businesses that receive valuable technical assistance \nand support through the Small Business\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\nAdministration's, SBA's, technical assistance and business development \nprograms. The challenges facing America's small businesses are real. In \ntoday's economic climate, small businesses are fighting for survival. A \nDecember 2008 CNN survey found that 49 percent of small business owners \nexpressed serious concerns about going out of business.\n  To that end, I humbly request my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support the measure I am offering to provide essential \nresources to the Small Business Administration's crucial technical \nassistance and business development programs. This effort will help \nensure that small businesses--our Nation's true job generators--will \nnot be shortchanged at a time when the economy is struggling to grow \nand create jobs.\n  My amendment would direct that a small fraction, $16.8 million of the \nexisting funding provided in the omnibus appropriations bill for the \nSBA, be used to increase funding levels for vital SBA programs, \nincluding Veterans Business Outreach Centers, VBOCs, Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, SBDCs, Women Business Centers, WBCs, SCORE, the \nHistorically Underutilized Business Zone, HUBZone, program, and the \nAgency's international trade programs. These programs are some of the \nmost successful job creators within the Federal Government, but they \nwere woefully underfunded under the previous administration. Now is the \ntime to reverse that trend, by ensuring that SBA devotes sufficient \nresources to support small business technical assistance and business \ndevelopment.\n  The SBA's programs are proven job creators--just look at the \nstatistics! In 2006, clients of the SBDC program generated a total of \napproximately $7.2 billion in sales and 73,377 new full time jobs as a \nresult of the assistance received. The average cost of generating each \njob was a paltry $2,658. Moreover, based on SBDC client assessments, an \nadditional $8.8 billion in sales and 93,449 jobs were saved due to SBDC \ncounseling in that same year. My amendment would direct that $6.5 \nmillion in SBA funding be used to fund SBDC veterans and energy grants, \nin addition to the $110 million for core funding provided in the bill \nto support SBDCs nationwide.\n  Furthermore, the SCORE program has proven time and again to be one of \nthe most cost-effective programs within the Federal Government. In \nfiscal year 2008 SCORE received $4.95 million from the Federal \nGovernment and provided 357,637 clients with free technical assistance. \nEntrepreneurs assisted by SCORE created 25,000 new jobs in 2006, and \none in seven new clients created a job. SCORE also provides American \ntaxpayers with a great buy, as it is operated by volunteers--all of \nwhich are retired business experts. In fact, in fiscal year 2008 these \nvolunteers donated 1.3 million hours valued at $195 million when using \na standard hourly consulting fee of $150. My amendment would direct \nthat an additional $2 million be directed to the SCORE program for a \ntotal of $7 million.\n  Additionally, my amendment would direct an additional $1.1 million to \nSBA's Veterans Business Outreach Centers, a modest increase to account \nfor additional responsibilities taken on from the Vets Corps Centers, \nwhich no longer receive Federal funding. An additional $3.35 million \nwould be directed to the WBC program, one of SBA's most diverse, far-\nreaching entrepreneurial development efforts. In 2007, WBCs trained and \ncounseled 148,123 clients who reported 8,751 new jobs and 3,304 new \nbusinesses.\n  My amendment also would direct additional funds to two programs, \nwhich I consider to be important business development programs, the \nSBA's International Trade programs and the HUBZone Program. With \nexports being one of the few bright spots in our economy last year, \nexporting by small firms has considerable room for growth. The \namendment would direct that $8 million in SBA funds be used for these \nexport assistance programs, an increase of $2 million over the current \nomnibus level. For the HUBZone program, which provides contracting \npreferences to small firms in economically disadvantaged areas, the \namendment provides an additional $1.85 million for urban and rural \ndevelopment under this program.\n  To reiterate, under my amendment, the increased funding for these \nprograms comes from amounts already provided in the omnibus \nappropriations bill for the SBA. No additional funding is required; it \nsimply directs the SBA to allocate adequate resources to these \nprograms. For more than 50 years, the SBA has been a vital resource to \nsmall businesses, helping millions of Americans start, grow, and expand \ntheir businesses. I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this \namendment to provide the SBA's technical assistance and business \ndevelopment programs with the resources to expand their proven success \nand economic value during this economic crisis.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against this Omnibus \nappropriations bill, which contains thousands and thousands of \nunjustified, unexamined earmarked spending provisions, and which is \nbeing rushed through the Senate. By one estimate, the total cost of \nthose items is nearly $8 billion. Even under ordinary circumstances it \nwould be hard to defend those earmarks but there is certainly no \ndefense for them at a time when the Nation is contending with this deep \nrecession and millions of families are struggling to make ends meet.\n  The hundreds of pages of tables in the report accompanying the bill, \neach listing multiple earmarks, is probably the best rationale I have \nseen for earmark reform. I have been pleased to work with a number of \nmy colleagues on a proposal to establish a new point of order against \nunauthorized earmarks, and on another proposal to provide the President \nwith authority similar to a line item veto to cancel earmark spending. \nWe certainly need to enact something like those reforms because we \ncannot afford to continue this abusive process. After all the talk of \nreform last year, and after the promising beginning made by keeping the \nstimulus legislation free of earmarks, we have quickly slid back to \nbusiness as usual. We are considering a bill that has nearly $8 billion \nin earmarks. And that is just one bill. We haven't even begun the \nappropriations process for fiscal year 2010.\n  The President deserves great credit for keeping the stimulus bill \nfree of earmarks. He should build on that achievement by insisting this \nomnibus appropriations bill be stripped of the earmarks currently in \nit. If that means vetoing the bill and sending it back to Congress for \nfurther work, then that is exactly what he should do.\n  I strongly prefer that Congress address this issue and clean up its \nown earmark mess. But right now there is little indication that \nCongress act without some tough leadership from the President.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased to support amendments offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, that sought to eliminate some of the \nearmarks in the bill. I did not, however, support other efforts to cut \noverall funding levels in the bill. While I believe that Congress needs \nto be extra vigilant in ensuring that taxpayer dollars are well-spent, \nthose efforts failed to specify where the funding would be cut. We \nshould be making those tough decisions ourselves, and ensuring that any \ncuts are targeted and appropriate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know everyone is anxiously awaiting the \n8:15 time to arrive. I have had a number of conversations with Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Kyl, and Senators on my side of the aisle. It \nappears at this time that we are going to have to continue to work on \nthis bill. I have had calls from a number of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, including conversations with my colleague from \nNevada, and there are a number of amendments they feel strongly about, \nthat they want the opportunity to offer. I wish that were not the case. \nWe have had a significant number of amendments. But ``enough'' is in \nthe eye of the beholder. As a result of that, we would probably be a \nvote short of being able to invoke cloture on this bill. My being a \nvote counter for a long time, discretion is the better part of valor.\n  I have not only heard from my friend from Nevada but other Senators. \nThey have certain amendments they want to offer, and others have no \namendments to offer but they want to be part of the team on the other \nside of the aisle, and if some of their colleagues want certain things \ndone, they are going to go along with that. I don't criticize that.\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\nI am not happy about it, but that is the way things work.\n  I have worked with Senators Kyl and McConnell, and by 11 o'clock \ntomorrow we will have a finite list of amendments, hopefully 10. There \ncould be as many as 12. I doubt if we will need votes on all those. \nSenator Kyl, who is the mechanic working through this process, is going \nto try to squeeze that down as much as he can.\n  With that brief statement, it would be wasted time to have a cloture \nvote tonight. We are not going to have a cloture vote tonight. We would \njust go back into a quorum and spend the rest of the night looking at \neach other.\n  We have had pleasant conversations with each other. No one is trying \nto game the system. I wish we could finish this bill. The House is \ngoing to send us a CR that will take us to midnight Tuesday, as I \nunderstand it.\n  If we get that finite list of amendments, the Senate certainly could \nbe open tomorrow for people to offer amendments. We could have votes on \nsome of these Monday night when we come back. I could schedule votes on \nMonday, but that would really make for an unhappy group of people. So I \nthink we would be better off starting the votes at 5 or 5:30 Monday \nnight if, in fact, people lay these amendments down.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for an observation.\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me underscore what the majority leader has \nindicated. The votes would not have been there tonight. We would be \nmore than happy to have the vote, but since the majority leader and I \nconcur that 60 votes are not there tonight, I think the way forward as \nhe outlines is going to be widely acceptable on our side because we \nwant amendments. There are additional amendments, probably, as he \nindicated, 10 or 12, which, as he indicates, I think would make sense \nto vote on on Monday.\n  I want to say to my Republican colleagues, we appreciate their \naccommodation, their requests of others of our Members to have a \nreasonable number of amendments on a bill of this magnitude. This is a \nhuge appropriations bill. At the end of the day, we will not have had \nan unusual number of amendments voted on on a bill of this magnitude.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say in response to my friend, at quarter \nto 8 tonight, we had 59\\1/2\\ votes. If we can have consent, I could \nround that off--I don't think I could get that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the cloture vote now pending.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I could simply inquire of the majority \nleader through the Chair, I would be happy to offer consent if I had \nassurance that my amendment that I have been trying to call up, that I \nhave been trying to get a vote on all week, which heretofore has been \nblocked, if I can have absolute assurance that will be on the list of \namendments offered and voted on.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think he should direct that to his \nassistant leader, Senator Kyl.\n  Is his amendment going to be on the list?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it seems to me if the Senator from Louisiana \nhas indicated he will object to the unanimous consent unless his \namendment--No. 621, I gather?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Is on the list, that is a question, then, for the leader to \naddress.\n  I wanted to indicate that we have a number of Members who have \namendments they want to offer, and we are going to work hard to make \nsure all our Members who want to offer amendments can do so. At the \nsame time, we are going to do our best to ensure that is not an \nunreasonable list of amendments. Obviously, Members who insist on \nhaving an amendment as a condition to the unanimous consent request can \nmake that point clear.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it is clear from my friend--the \nconversations, plural, that we have had--that the list we are talking \nabout is a list of 10 or 12 amendments; is that right?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to the leader that I think that \nis correct. That is going to require a lot of effort on this side to \nreduce the number of amendments that are pending, as the leader is well \naware.\n  Mr. REID. You think you are going to have to work hard, think how \nhard I am going to have to work to defeat those amendments. I have more \nwork than you have.\n  Mr. KYL. In response to my friend, the leader, he has worked very \nhard, and he has been very successful. But I do, in all seriousness, \nwant to note that in order to try to limit the number of amendments--\nbecause there is a list of 36--it is going to require a lot of work on \nour side. We are going to, in good faith, do the best we can, but I \njust want to reiterate as far as I am concerned the Senator from \nLouisiana will have to be on the list because otherwise he will object \nto the vitiation of the cloture vote. As far as I am concerned, his \namendment is on the list, but at some point the majority leader will \nhave to agree to the list that we offer.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it is fair that we have a finite \nlist. We are now up to 35 amendments?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as I told the leader, we had a list of 36 \namendments filed. I told the majority leader that I thought we could \nget that list down to 10 or 12, and that is still my intention.\n  Mr. REID. What I think would be fair, Mr. President--I know the \nSenator from Arizona is going to act in good faith to cut the number \ndown to as small a number as he can, but we can still come back with \nanother cloture vote if there is a lot of unnecessary amendments in \nthat number, if you can't get people to work reasonably with you.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the cloture vote, and that a \nsubsequent cloture vote occur----\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I didn't mean to cut off the majority leader, if he wants \nto finish. I just wanted to reiterate--having spent the week trying to \nget this one amendment up--that my top priority is my amendment will be \nrecognized, and I get a vote on that. And having heard speeches on the \nfloor that the floor was open to amendments, yet having been blocked \nconsistently in my attempts to get this amendment up, I have not yet \nheard any guarantee that will happen.\n  So given that, I regretfully will object to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. REID. We are familiar with his amendment. Basically, as I \nunderstand the amendment, Members would never get a COLA again. So we \nare willing to debate that. That basically is what it is; is that \nright?\n  Mr. VITTER. That is not correct. If I could advise the Chair, the \namendment would be to require votes for any future pay raises or COLAs. \nIt would require Member votes to not have that be on autopilot and to \nhappen automatically, particularly given the state of the economy and \nthe income losses and the job losses that are being suffered around the \ncountry.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Louisiana, we will \nmake sure that Senator McConnell has a vote in relation to the \namendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. With that assurance, Mr. President, I lift my objection.\n  Mr. REID. I renew my unanimous consent request to vitiate the pending \ncloture vote; that we not have the vote tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Members, we apologize \nfor having Senators from all sides leave. I hope those Senators who are \nworking with Senator Kyl and want to offer these amendments will do so \ntomorrow or, if not, on Monday. We want to have some of these votes \nMonday night. We can have a series of votes Monday\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\nnight and work toward completing this stuff.\n  So I think that is about all I have to say, except that I appreciate \neveryone's cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 615\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up amendment No. \n615.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself, Mr. \n     Voinovich, Mr. Kyl, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. \n     Cornyn, proposes an amendment numbered 615.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as we contemplate this 2009 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act before us this week, I wish to look ahead to \nPresident Obama's proposed 2010 budget.\n  As a proud member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am \nparticularly pleased by the significant increase in funding that the \nadministration is seeking for the Department of Veterans Affairs, led \nby its Secretary, GEN Eric Shinseki.\n  In the proposed 2010 budget, the Department of Veterans Affairs will \nsee a $25 billion increase over the next 5 years. This additional \nfunding will be directed toward a major expansion of benefits for those \nwho serve our Nation in uniform.\n  The 2010 budget will directly assist veterans by expanding access to \nhigh-quality care for approximately 5\\1/2\\ million veteran patients and \nensuring that care is delivered in a timely manner. More remarkable, \nthis funding establishes VA Centers of Excellence to provide veteran-\noriented care in specialized areas, such as prosthetics, vision, spinal \ncord injury, aging, and women's health.\n  The President's budget also reaches out to veterans with moderate \nincomes, bringing an additional half million veterans into the VA \nsystem by 2013, while maintaining or expanding existing care for low-\nincome and disabled veterans.\n  At the same time, the new budget enhances services related to mental \nhealth care and broadens access and treatment areas throughout rural \nAmerica. America's veterans have earned through their service the very \nbest care we can offer, and the 2010 VA budget is a promising start.\n  During a recent tour through Illinois, I had the remarkable \nopportunity to visit with both veterans of past service, as well as \nmeeting the young recruits training to wear the American uniform in the \nyears ahead.\n  During that trip, I visited the 1082nd Airlift Wing of the Illinois \nAir National Guard located in Peoria, IL, and spoke with many fine \nairmen from this wing, including MSG Warren McCray. Master Sergeant \nMcCray is an air guardsman who trained as a joint terminal attack \ncontroller. He deploys with Army troops on the ground ensuring that \nairpower can be employed against enemy positions when needed.\n  This courageous young man has recently returned from a tour of duty \nin Afghanistan and was awarded a Bronze Star with Valor. While speaking \nwith Master Sergeant McCray, he told me of the multiple tours he had \nserved as an air guardsman mobilized in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Afghanistan. I was deeply impressed by his professionalism \nand dedicated service to this country. Even more so by his dedication \nto his fellow service men and women of the 1082nd Airlift Wing.\n  As we consider our mission abroad and weigh the cost in terms of \ntroops and treasure, it is our duty to also consider the capacity at \nwhich these young men and women are serving us.\n  It doesn't matter whether they are a soldier, sailor, airman, marine \nor Coast Guard, or whether they are Active Duty, Guard, or Reserve. We \nmust never forget the personal toll and sacrifice of these brave \nAmericans and the effects made on their lives, their future, their \nspouses, and their children.\n  We must ensure that our veterans receive superior accessible care in \nreturn for their service and sacrifice, and we have an obligation to \nhonor our veterans by serving them in the same way they have served us \nso selflessly.\n  The administration's 2010 budget for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs recognizes this. And in addition to expanding health benefits \nand high quality of care, the budget provides for comprehensive \neducational benefits, particularly the post-9/11 GI bill so that \nfollowing their service, veterans can have access to unprecedented \nlevels of educational support to complete their schooling.\n  In the same week, I visited the Naval Station Great Lakes and the \nNorth Chicago VA Medical Center. During my visit to these sites, I \nlearned about plans for the Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes, the North \nChicago VA Medical Center to merge and expand over the next couple of \nyears. This merger will be extensive and costly, but also essential for \nsailors and veterans of Illinois, many of whom spend much of their \nlives at these facilities.\n  At the North Chicago VA Medical Center, I met with veterans of all \nages and backgrounds. I heard their stories, their hopes, and their \nneeds. At the Recruiting Training Command, I met with both naval \nofficers and naval recruits and was given a tour of the barracks by LT \nEllen McElligott.\n  I was particularly impressed with Lieutenant McElligott, a Chicago \nnative, who serves as the ship's officer for the USS Arizona. Her \nprofessionalism, discipline, and enthusiasm for her work are qualities \nshe shares with countless young service men and women across this great \ncountry of ours.\n  While touring the facility with Lieutenant McElligott, I saw the \nfaces of hundreds of young sailors training so that they may one day \nserve this country.\n  It is so very important that LT Ellen McElligott and the young men \nand women like her receive adequate care and compensation while on \nActive Duty, Guard, or Reserve, and, most importantly, that they \nreceive the care and resources they deserve when they return from \nserving their country.\n  As a nation, we have a moral obligation to serve and care for those \nbrave individuals as they work so hard to serve us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2821-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2821-S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant Daniel Tallouzi\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, today I rise to honor two \nAmerican heroes. The first is Army SGT Daniel Tallouzi. Sergeant \nTallouzi was the kind of soldier who hated getting injured--not because \nof the pain, but because it stopped him from doing his job. A fellow \nsoldier describes meeting Dan when Dan was recovering from an injury at \nFort Hood. The soldier recalls:\n\n       Another person might have been seriously injured, but Big \n     Dan Tallouzi shook it off,\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\n     refused any pain meds, and only wanted to get back to his \n     crew and back to the job that he loved.\n\n  On September 25, 2006, Dan Tallouzi had just gotten off duty at Camp \nTaji in Baghdad when a mortar exploded nearby. A single piece of \nshrapnel--roughly the size of a quarter--reached the spot where he \nstood. It hit him behind his right ear and entered his brain.\n  Big Dan Tallouzi would never be the same. He returned to the United \nStates in an ``eyes open'' coma, unable to speak, walk, or even eat on \nhis own. Last week, he died in Albuquerque, NM, the town where he was \nraised.\n  The other hero I want to honor today is Mary Tallouzi, Dan's mother. \nWhen our soldiers serve in harm's way, the burden is borne by families, \nnot just individuals. Dan Tallouzi understood this as well as anyone. \nHe adored his family, and they adored him. Mary remembers Dan coming \nhome on leave with flowers for his sister and hugs for the whole \nfamily. Home videos show him clowning for his cousins, infecting those \naround him with his warmth and his joy.\n  When Dan returned from Iraq after his injury, his mom quit her job to \nfollow him through his treatment. First, she left New Mexico for a \nhospital in Germany. When Dan was transferred to Walter Reed, Mary \nfollowed. Then in search of a miracle, she had Dan transferred to the \nKessler Institute in New Jersey.\n  At Kessler, Mary spent 12-hour days by her son's bed. In the morning, \nshe would shave Dan's face, brush his teeth, and put on his favorite \ncologne. Nurses knew that Mary was watching her son's care like a hawk.\n  When I met Mary last May, she was back in New Mexico with Dan. After \ntraveling for more than a year, Mary had lost her home and was \nstruggling to find a place that could accommodate her son's needs.\n  What struck me about Mary was the satisfaction she felt in Dan's \nachievements. After all she had experienced, all she had suffered, Mary \nTallouzi would still light up when she talked about her son. You could \nsee her picturing the old Dan, and you could feel how proud she was.\n  Mary should be proud of Dan, and she should be proud of herself. She \nraised a good soldier, a good son, a good man. She bore the sacrifice \nthat war brings, and she bore it well.\n  Please join me in recognizing the sacrifice of Dan, Mary, and the \nentire Tallouzi family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2822-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERSHIPS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, at a time when the world seems to finally \nbe speaking in one voice about the need for dramatic action to stop \nglobal warming, an article in the Jakarta Post on February 13 reminds \nus that many difficult obstacles lie ahead.\n  It is well known that Indonesia's forests, and particularly its peat \nswamps, store huge amounts of carbon. When the trees from these areas \nare cut and burned, which is happening due to illegal logging and to \nmake way for the cultivation of oil palm, they emit even larger amounts \nof carbon into the atmosphere.\n  These forests are also home to one of the world's four species of \nendangered great apes, the orangutan, whose survival in the wild is far \nfrom certain.\n  President Yudhoyono has spoken of the importance of protecting the \nhabitat of the orangutan. The U.S. Agency for International Development \nhas been supporting this effort for years, and it is finally beginning \nto show results. It is focused on improving law enforcement and \naddressing the economic needs of the people living in areas of Borneo \nand Sumatra where the orangutans live, so they do not cut down the \nforests.\n  While illegal logging remains a problem in Indonesia, it is less of \none than it was not long ago thanks to President Yudhoyono's \ngovernment. What looms as potentially an even greater threat to the \norangutan, and to climate change, is the expansion of oil palm \nplantations.\n  The Jakarta Post article says Indonesia's Minister of Agriculture \nplans to permit the cultivation of oil palm in millions of hectares of \npeat swamps. The article indicates that the Minister appears to believe \nthat this would not contribute to global warming because while cutting \nthe peat forests would result in emissions of greenhouse gases, oil \npalm trees would absorb carbon.\n  As convenient as that might sound, it defies both logic and science. \nIndonesia is already among the largest emitters of carbon in the world \nand the peat swamps are the primary cause. Any significant expansion of \ncutting and burning of peat forests would contribute to climate change. \nIt would put Indonesia on the wrong side of an issue of critical, \nglobal importance at a time when it should be setting an example for \nresponsible forest management. It would put Indonesia on the wrong side \nof history.\n  The United States deserves its share of criticism for consuming, and \nwasting, vast amounts of fossil fuels and being a major contributor to \nglobal warming. Many years have been squandered debating whether human \ndevelopment is a significant cause of climate change, even though the \noverwhelming view of scientists is that it is.\n  Fortunately, we are past that point. Today there is almost universal \nrecognition that we must act together, and urgently, to stop the \ndestruction of forests and the wasteful use of energy that contribute \nto climate change.\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nPresident Obama has made clear that he intends to make this issue a \npriority and invest in alternative energy technologies that do not emit \ngreenhouse gases.\n  Indonesia, like Brazil and Central Africa, is fortunate to possess \namong the last significant expanses of tropical forests on Earth. The \nexample set by President Yudhoyono and his government will profoundly \naffect the lives of people everywhere, as well as future generations. I \njoin those in the environmental and scientific communities in urging \nthe Minister of Agriculture to reconsider his position.\n  Finally, it is important to note that American companies are among \nthose that import Indonesian palm oil. China and Singapore are other \nmajor importers. They should consider the consequences of using a \nproduct that is produced in a manner that causes serious harm to the \nenvironment. It is time for corporate America to review its \nmanufacturing and marketing practices to ensure they are consistent \nwith our collective responsibility to stop global warming.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Jakarta Post article printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Jakarta Post, Feb. 13, 2009]\n\n                   Govt To Allow Peatland Plantations\n\n                        (By Adianto P. Simamora)\n\n       The Agriculture Ministry will issue a decree to allow \n     businesses to dig up the country's millions of hectares of \n     peatland for oil palm plantations.\n       Gatot Irianto, the ministry's head of research and \n     development, said his office was currently drafting a \n     ministerial decree that would explain in detail the mechanism \n     to turn the peatland areas into oil palm plantations, a move \n     that many say will further damage the country's environment.\n       ``We still need land for oil palm plantations. We must be \n     honest: the sector has been the main driver for the people's \n     economy,'' he said Thursday on the sidelines of a discussion \n     about adaptation in agriculture, organized by the National \n     Commission on Climate Change.\n       The draft decree is expected to go into force this year.\n       ``We've discussed the draft with stakeholders, including \n     hard-line activists, to convince them that converting \n     peatland is safe,'' he said.\n       ``We promise to promote eco-friendly management to ward off \n     complaints from overseas buyers and international \n     communities.''\n       Indonesia is currently the world's largest crude palm oil \n     (CPO) producer, and is expected to produce about 19.5 million \n     tons this year.\n       Overseas buyers, however, have complained about Indonesia's \n     CPO products, saying they are produced at the expense of the \n     environment.\n       Activists point to the massive expansions of plantations, \n     including in peatlands, for the deaths of large numbers of \n     orangutans in Kalimantan and Sumatra and for releasing huge \n     amounts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.\n       Indonesia has about 20 million hectares of dense, black \n     tropical peat swamps--formed when vegetation rots--that are \n     natural carbon storage sinks.\n       A hectare of peatland can store between 3,400 and 4,000 \n     tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), but emits a much \n     larger amount when burned.\n       Asked about the contribution to global warming, Gatot said \n     trees planted in peatlands would absorb greenhouse gas \n     emissions.\n       ``The peatland will produce emissions only in the opening \n     of the land, but this will be reabsorbed after new trees are \n     planted,'' he said.\n       However, a World Bank report from 2007 showed Indonesia was \n     the world's third biggest carbon emitter after the US and \n     China, thanks mainly to the burning of peatlands.\n       A Wetlands International report from 2006 said Indonesia's \n     peatlands emitted around 2 billion tons of CO2 a year, far \n     higher than the country's emissions from energy, agriculture \n     and waste, which together amount to only 451 million tons.\n       The country would have ranked 20th in the global carbon \n     emitter list if emissions from peatlands were not counted.\n       The ministerial decree is being drafted at a time when \n     President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is still preparing a \n     decree on peatland management in an effort to help combat \n     global warming.\n       The draft of the presidential decree, drawn up in 2007, \n     calls for tightened supervision on the use of peatlands \n     across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2823-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2823-S2824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the abuses perpetrated against civilians by \nthe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, popularly known as the \nFARC, are too numerous to list. From kidnappings to bombings, torture \nand summary executions, the FARC have lost whatever credibility and \npopular support they may once have had. They are a criminal enterprise, \ndespised by the vast majority of Colombians, funded with proceeds from \nthe production and sale of cocaine, who show no respect for the laws of \narmed conflict.\n  The FARC have kidnapped hundreds of people, many of whom remain in \ntheir custody, their health and welfare unknown. From what we have \nlearned from the few who have escaped or been released, they suffer \nsevere hardship and deprivation.\n  The FARC have also targeted Colombia's vulnerable indigenous people, \nwhose traditional lands are often located in conflict zones. They have \nalso been victimized by other armed groups, including the Colombian \narmy.\n  Two recent incidents illustrate the dangers these people face. \nAccording to the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia, on \nFebruary 11, 2009, the FARC killed 10 members of the Awa tribe in \nNarino department. This followed the killing of 17 Awa on February 4, \nalso in Narino, and also reportedly carried out by the FARC. There are \nreports that an unknown number of Awa have been abducted.\n  The killing of defenseless indigenous civilians can best be described \nas a crime against humanity. It is utterly without justification, and \nthose who engage in such atrocities should pay for their crimes.\n  For years I have worked to help improve respect for human rights in \nColombia and to strengthen Colombia's judicial system. I have also \nsupported efforts to protect the rights of Colombia's indigenous \npeople. When we get reports of the FARC attacking and summarily \nexecuting members of the Awa, including women and children, we are \nreminded how much remains to be done to protect these vulnerable groups \nand before real justice and peace can come to Colombia.\n  In recent years there have been notable improvements in security in \nsome parts of Colombia, particularly Bogota, Medellin, and other \ncities. There has also been progress in expanding the presence of the \nstate into areas which previously had been ungoverned. We are seeing \nsome promising results from projects that provide coca farmers with \ntitles to land, technical assistance to grow licit crops like coffee \nand cacao, and access to markets, in return for voluntarily stopping \ngrowing coca. These projects deserve our continued support.\n  But many rural areas remain conflicted or controlled by the FARC or \nother armed groups, some of whose members are demobilized \nparamilitaries. After more than $7 billion in U.S. aid and 8 years \nsince the beginning of Plan Colombia, the amount of coca under \ncultivation is close to what it was before. It is now grown in smaller, \nmore isolated plots, in many more parts of the country. More than \n200,000 rural Colombians were displaced from their homes as a result of \ndrug-related violence last year alone.\n  Another issue that requires the attention of the Colombian Government \nis reparations for victims of the conflict. There are tens of thousands \nof people who had members of their families killed or injured by \nparamilitaries, the FARC, or the army. Many had land or other property \nstolen by paramilitaries who often had the active or tacit support of \nthe army. The Colombian Government established mechanisms for returning \nstolen assets, but for the most part it has not yet happened. Very \nlittle of the land has been returned to its previous occupants. This \nprocess needs to be urgently invigorated if reconciliation is to \nsucceed in Colombia.\n  Whether a family member was killed or their property stolen by the \nFARC, paramilitaries, or members of the army, the loss is the same. The \njudicial process in Colombia is wholly incapable of adjudicating the \nlarge number of cases or claims. It is critical that, as was finally \ndone in the United States when Congress appropriated funds to \ncompensate victims of the Japanese internment camps during World War \nII, the Colombian Government take the necessary steps to provide \nreparations for the victims so they can rebuild their lives.\n  The issue of extra judicial killings, or ``false positives'' as they \nhave been called, is another major concern.\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nHuman rights groups warned repeatedly that Colombian soldiers were \nluring poor young men with the promise of jobs, summarily executing \nthem, and then dressing the bodies to appear as FARC combatants in \norder to obtain higher pay, time off, promotions, or other benefits. I \nalso expressed concern about this. Instead of investigating, top \nColombian officials, including the President, responded by accusing the \nhuman rights groups of being FARC sympathizers. After the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Human Rights confirmed these crimes and it was \nrevealed that they were the result of official army policy, the \ngovernment acknowledged the problem, but the verbal attacks against \nhuman rights defenders and journalists who wrote articles about the \nissue have continued.\n  To his credit, the Minister of Defense has taken some steps to \naddress it, including issuing decrees disavowing the policy of \nrewarding body counts and dismissing army officers who were implicated \nin some cases. But few if any have been prosecuted and punished, and \nthere are reportedly hundreds of these cases.\n  Throughout this period, despite report after report that these \natrocities were occurring, former Secretary of State Rice continued to \ncertify that the Colombian army was meeting the human rights conditions \nin U.S. law. That was as shameful as the Colombian Government blaming \nhuman rights defenders. The Congress had no responsible alternative to \nwithholding a portion of the military aid for Colombia. Whether or when \nthose funds are released will depend, in part, on how thoroughly the \ngovernment addresses the problem of false positives, whether the \nofficers involved are held accountable, and whether those who had the \ncourage to report these crimes continue to be the target of government \nattacks.\n  I also want to mention the recently appointed Army Chief of Staff, \nGEN Gonzalez Pena, who replaced General Montoya. General Montoya \nresigned under pressure due to the false positives scandal and was \n``punished,'' as too often occurs in Colombia, by being appointed an \nambassador. Not long ago, General Gonzalez Pena commanded the 4th \nBrigade in Antioquia which has one of the worst rates of reported extra \njudicial killings. It is difficult to believe that he was unaware of \nwhat his troops were reportedly doing, and it raises a concern about \nhis qualifications for such an important position.\n  This year, the Appropriations Committee will again review our aid \nprograms in Colombia. We want to continue helping Colombia because we \nshare many interests--in addition to stopping the traffic in illegal \ndrugs to the United States which has not succeeded to the extent some \nhad predicted. We need to determine what has worked and deserves \ncontinued U.S. support, whether the Colombian Government is meeting the \nconditions in U.S. law and what costs should be shifted to the \nColombian Government as U.S. aid is ratcheted down in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2824-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2824-S2825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CENTENNIAL OF THE RUSSELL SENATE OFFICE BUILDING\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute not to a \nperson, or an agency, or an institution, but to a building. That \nbuilding, the Russell Senate Office Building, turns 100 years old \ntoday.\n  The Russell Building has graced Capitol Hill for a century. Some of \nus have been fortunate to have our Senate office located in Russell. \nBut all of us have had an occasion to attend a hearing, a meeting, or \ngathering in one of the building's rooms. If we take the time to stop \nand consider what is before us, we are struck by the beauty of an \nearlier era in American history. Step into the Russell Rotunda, the \nCaucus Room, the Rules Committee hearing room, or any of other \ncommittee hearing rooms or special function rooms in the building. You \ncan't help but feel that you are stepping back in time when you gaze at \nthe high ceilings, the columns, the marble, the crystal chandeliers, \nand the mahogany and walnut furniture.\n  Architects refer to its style as beaux arts, a design popular in \nAmerica in the early 20th century. Many Government buildings \nconstructed during the late 1800s through the 1920s were of this \ndesign, and the Russell Building stands today as an excellent example \nof this style of architecture.\n  To commemorate this centennial, the curatorial staff of the Secretary \nof the Senate's office has created an outstanding exhibit in the \nRussell Building and a booklet about its history. I urge you to visit \nthe display of original Russell furniture in the Russell rotunda \nbasement or stop by the information kiosks in the rotunda basement, the \nsecond floor of the Rotunda area outside the Caucus Room, SR-318, the \nRules Committee hearing room, SR-301, the Veterans Affairs' Committee \nhearing room, SR-418, the basement visitors entrance on Delaware \nAvenue, and the 2nd floor visitors entrance on Constitution Avenue. \nAlong the way, you'll learn about the naming of the building, the old \nsubway, and the hearings held in the committee rooms.\n  As a New Yorker, I am especially pleased that there are so many \nconnections between the Russell Building and my home State. New York \narchitects, Carrere & Hastings, designed the building; New York \ncabinetmaker Thomas Wadelton manufactured full-scale models of ``very \nAmerican'' furniture in his studio located in Tuckahoe, NY; New Yorker \nGeorge W. Cobb, Jr., was awarded the furniture contract for the \nbuilding; and much of the original mahogany furniture was manufactured \nby the Standard Furniture Company of Herkimer, NY. The New York \nassociation continued when in 1933 the last wing of the building \nopened, equipped with walnut furniture manufactured by three New York \nfirms--the W.H. Gunlocke Chair Company, the Company of Master \nCraftsmen, Inc., and the Sikes-Cutler Desk Corporation.\n  New York is not alone in being represented in the design, \nconstruction, and furnishing of the building. From the Vermont marble \nto the Indiana limestone, to the Pennsylvania steelwork, to the Kansas \ncement, and to the elevators manufactured in Ohio, many states \ncontributed their natural resources and the industry of their people to \nthis historic place. It's a testament to the skills of these early 20th \ncentury architects and craftsmen that the building and its furniture \nand furnishings are still in use today.\n  The Russell Building was constructed because of the growing challenge \nin the early 1900s to find suitable office space to accommodate the \nneeds of Senators. Prior to the opening of the Russell Building in \n1909, Senators and their staffs conducted the business of the Nation in \nwhatever space was available--the aisles of the Senate Chamber, the \nCapitol's marble hallways, nearby hotel lobbies, and local boarding \nhouses. Constituents waited in the corridors of the Capitol when they \ncame to meet their Senators and Congressman. As more States joined the \nUnion, the number of lawmakers working in Washington grew. By the turn \nof the century, the Capitol was literally overflowing with people. The \nneed for space to house Senators and their growing staffs was finally \nrecognized in 1903, when the sites for the first congressional office \nbuildings were acquired and construction of the buildings were \nauthorized. One of these building so authorized would later become the \nRussell Senate Office Building. Once construction was complete, it was \nconsidered to be one of the grandest and most impressive buildings in \nall of Washington. It would later be named in honor of a former \ncolleague from Georgia, the Honorable Richard Russell, who served in \nthe Senate for 38 years.\n  There is an old saying there is nothing new under the Sun. And when \nit comes to the Senate and space, how true the saying is. As one of its \nareas of jurisdiction, the Rules Committee, on which I have the honor \nof serving as chairman, continues to search for space to meet the needs \nof Senators, committees, and support offices to this day--an \nadministrative task not unlike the struggle to find space for the \nSenate in 1909.\n  During the past century, much has happened to us as a country. We \nadded four States to the United States of America. We have experienced \nworld wars, international conflicts, and tough economic times again and \nagain. We have landed a man on the Moon and saw the beginning of the \ninformation age. Through all this time, the American people have \npersevered and thrived.\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\n  Like its occupants and visitors over the past century, the building \nhas adapted itself for the 21st century. The Russell Senate Office \nBuilding on its 100th birthday is a working building, alive with \nSenators and staff doing the business of our Nation, well equipped and \nready to face the challenges of the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2825-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2825-S2826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for soliciting our opinions regarding the energy \n     crisis. I truly value this opportunity to communicate my \n     concerns to you.\n       Gas prices have certainly been on the rise and like most \n     Idahoans, I have been affected by this increase. I also \n     remember the words of President Bush when he stated that we \n     as a nation are ``addicted'' to oil. I am a psychologist and \n     I know that when an addict is feeling the pain of their \n     addiction (as we are with gas prices), it is not helpful to \n     find them a cheaper way to get a drink.\n       What I am saying by that analogy is that I do not think \n     increasing exploration for oil in Alaska or off the coast of \n     Florida will help us in the long term. Fossil fuels are a \n     limited resource and we'll feel the pain of those limitations \n     sooner or later. I do not support further exploration to \n     temporarily fix this problem. I do support the idea that we \n     invest heavily in renewable, environmentally sustainable, \n     energies.\n       For example, rather than giving huge tax breaks to oil \n     companies to promote more gas production, let us give those \n     tax cuts to the car manufacturers to produce cars that run on \n     less gas or better yet, run on non-fossil based fuels. \n     American companies are way too far behind Japanese companies \n     in this effort and to remain competitive, I think we'll have \n     to invest in the technologies of the future rather than \n     scraping the bottom of the barrel for what oil remains.\n       Thank you.\n     Rick, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Why are we saving the oil in the United States? The oil \n     fields in the lower 48 could alone make us self-sufficient; \n     that is without the biggest oil field in the world which is \n     in Alaska. Why are we being so dependent on foreign oil when \n     there is no need to be? Our economy is going the wrong way \n     and can be fixed by getting the price of gas back down where \n     it should be. My wife and I are retired and live in the \n     country outside of Midvale, Idaho. It is a long ways to the \n     grocery store and department stores. I hope you can get \n     something started in the Senate that will open some eyes. \n     Most of the members of the Congress and Senate are \n     financially set so the price of gas does not affect them. \n     However, they have a lot of constituents that are hurting. \n     Thanks for your time.\n       God Bless America.\n     Brent and Peggy, Midvale.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have a very sincere feeling that the Congress has been \n     waffling on the oil and gasoline price rise. It is my hope \n     that they will soon begin to realize they are hurting the \n     complete economy. We are all hurting because of the higher \n     gasoline price but it trickles down to everything we buy. It \n     burns me up to hear people complain about President Bush and \n     how he has started the whole thing. Just yesterday he \n     explained to the public that the Congress has not given him a \n     bill to sign.\n       I certainly wish Congress could stick its neck out and \n     demand that all new electricity generation plants be nuclear \n     plants. We are wasting our natural gas on firing electricity \n     generation and coal is causing emissions which I believe are \n     not good for the world. Nuclear plants are so efficient and I \n     wish we had not allowed France and Germany to outdo us with \n     the technology to make safe atomic plants.\n       Next, I would wish that Congress would mandate a term of \n     time that would allow us to get weaned from oil and give us a \n     good alternative engine for automobiles, for example. We are \n     a wide ranging country and traveling from one area to another \n     is necessary. We do not have anything but busses to move us \n     in most areas. I do not like the fact that corn is getting so \n     high priced because of the ethanol push. I know that I cannot \n     use ethanol because it will ruin all the components in my \n     autos I presently own. I do not think enough thought has gone \n     into ethanol use and I feel it is going to ruin our food \n     product prices. I have been associated with agriculture all \n     my life and I cannot believe the prices some the these crops \n     were bringing last year.\n       Right now we need to be drilling off shore and ANWR for \n     oil. I believe an oil company or two needs to build a new \n     refinery or two to help out in the meantime. I think the oil \n     companies have held us hostage all my life and they still \n     are!\n       God Bless you and your good work.\n     Gordon, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to let you know how energy \n     prices are affecting me. I was forwarded your email from a \n     friend who is on your mailing list.\n       I am a 56-year-old widow. My husband has been gone for 6 \n     years. We lived a middle-class lifestyle, but now that he is \n     gone, I am struggling to make ends meet and be able to remain \n     in the home that my husband built for our family. Even though \n     all my children are gone from home, I still have one child in \n     college that I need to help. I live 7 miles west of Rigby, \n     and 10 miles north of Idaho Falls, so I have to do a lot of \n     driving just to get anywhere. I have drastically reduced my \n     driving, and I still pay way more than I used to for gas.\n       One of the biggest areas I have been affected is with my \n     heating costs. Natural gas is not available where my home is, \n     so 10 years ago we put in a propane furnace, thinking it \n     would be fairly inexpensive to operate. At the time propane \n     was 65 cents a gallon. Last fall I filled my tank for $1.69 a \n     gallon. When I went to refill it in February, the price had \n     jumped to $2.40 a gallon in just a few months. I cannot \n     afford that price to heat my home. I decided to turn my heat \n     down to 62 degrees on my thermostat, and just wear a sweater. \n     If I want to work in one room I run a small electric heater \n     to stay warm. I never thought I would have to be cold in my \n     own house because I cannot afford to run my furnace.\n       I think it is time to drastically increase our own \n     production of oil. We need to drill in Alaska, and wherever \n     else it is feasible. Is the environment more important than \n     people's well being? I do not think so. It is time we told \n     the environmentalists to be quiet. I think the oil companies \n     need to be putting their huge profits into finding more \n     sources of oil. And let us get busy and find alternatives to \n     oil. It is about time.\n       Thanks for letting me express my views.\n     Phyllis, Rigby.\n                                  ____\n\n       First of all, I am glad to see that your head is screwed on \n     correctly. I am sick and tired of our Congress saying that \n     oil companies must pay ``wind-fall profit'' taxes. As if this \n     will fix the problem. Why are so many of our lawmakers \n     ignorant of how economy really works? Why is supply and \n     demand so hard to grasp for some?\n       Now, how is the current price of gas hitting me and my \n     family. Rather hard, I must say. Now, I grew up in a rural \n     area and, for that reason, I live outside of Boise. I do not \n     care for crowds and I like to have space (though, honestly, \n     where I live still does not have enough space). For this \n     reason, I spend a good deal on gas. This is not the fault of \n     the government, nor am I looking for the government to solve \n     my problems. (They have not solved any yet, and now they're \n     talking about universal health care, HA! do not make laugh. \n     But I digress.)\n       In an effort to curb the fuel pain, last year I purchased a \n     gas-sipping 4-banger that gets 45 mpg (I bought that when I \n     anticipated gas @ $3/gal.). However, my wife and I have a \n     large family and a large vehicle is a must. We have a \n     Suburban to cary our family of 7 (including my wife and I). A \n     large vehicle is simply a must, and given where we live, a \n     vehicle with 4wd capability is a must too. This Suburban gets \n     17 mpg, and with a 42 gallon tank, it is getting rather \n     painful to fill this beast. Assuming an empty tank, it would \n     take $168 to fill that behemoth, but I need it and we keep \n     the driving on that to a minimum.\n       Some of our circumstances are due to where we live and we \n     chose to live there. I do not seek empathy for this. However, \n     compassion for our people would be good. Congress could make \n     significant strides forward if they would stop catering to \n     special interest groups and drill in our oil reserves. There \n     is no reason not to. Drilling in ANWR is not going to make \n     extinct the animals that live there.\n       Also, there is no reason we cannot make more refineries. We \n     cannot refine the oil we import fast enough, to say nothing \n     about the oil that we could be drilling from our own soil and \n     water. We should make more nuclear power, or cut our thirst \n     for energy. It is one or the other, and since we are not \n     cutting energy, we have got to produce more.\n     Andy.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am the Service Coordinator at Community Action \n     Partnership in Clearwater County. We are the agency that \n     distributes the Energy Assistance Funds (LIHEAP) for North \n     Central Idaho. I must tell you that I am extremely concerned \n     about our low income people this coming winter, especially\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\n     the ones on fixed incomes, such as the elderly. If congress \n     does not increase the benefit amount of LIHEAP considerably, \n     I am seriously afraid that some people will literally freeze \n     to death.\n       Of the 500 or so LIHEAP applications I do, about 300 of \n     them are elderly (60+). Of that 300, probably more than half \n     heat with oil or propane. Many of them were talked into \n     converting to an oil stove (such as TOYO) several years ago, \n     because they were considered very energy efficient, however \n     no one could have predicted that the price of oil would \n     quadruple in a few years time. To make matters worse, many \n     oil and propane company's require a minimum delivery of 100 \n     gallons, that is over $400, and in many cases that could be \n     half or more of their monthly income!\n       I intend to work with Clearwater County Social Services, \n     and our local churches to see what can be done at the local \n     level. I am hoping to be raise funds to purchase the most \n     efficient electric heaters I can find to give out to our most \n     vulnerable citizens. It certainly does not solve the overall \n     energy problem facing this country, but at least it might \n     keep a few people from freezing this winter.\n       Thank you for your interest and concern in this matter, and \n     good luck!\n     Barbara.\n                                  ____\n\n       The American public is lazy! We should be holding all our \n     elected officials responsible for OPEC and Big Oil's price \n     gouging of the country through its outrageous fuel prices. We \n     all should be continuously writing, emailing, and faxing our \n     city councilpersons, county supervisors, state legislators, \n     congressmen, and presidential candidates to make them support \n     a comprehensive, alternative energy program.\n       It is OPEC and the Big Oil companies that are preventing \n     the development of ethanol. And they will continue to not \n     allow the development of ethanol unless they can monopolize \n     that, too. It is common knowledge that they contribute \n     thousands of dollars to congressmen so that our elected \n     officials will drag their feet and not push through a \n     comprehensive plan.\n       Brazil became energy self-sufficient within five years by \n     converting sugar cane into ethanol. Sweden is also developing \n     plants to turn grass and hay into ethanol. There should be \n     laws enacted here, too, requiring every gas station to offer \n     at least one pump for ethanol. The construction of ethanol \n     plants should be subsidized by the government, and job tax \n     credits should be given to those plants for hiring new \n     workers. Our country should be ambitiously working to wean \n     itself off gasoline so we can tell OPEC where to stick its \n     oil.\n       Auto manufacturers should be mandated to sell an increasing \n     percentage of flex fuel cars each year. Of course, it will \n     not do you any good to buy a flex fuel car if you cannot find \n     a station in your town that sells ethanol (I am told that \n     there is only one station in all of San Diego that sells \n     ethanol). And, forget it if you are traveling anywhere out of \n     town!\n       You would think that with the internet, everyone would come \n     together, pool their ideas and resources, and actually get \n     something done. Instead, we just sit back and take whatever \n     is dished out to us. The American public has clout it does \n     not even realize! If this nation's work force banded together \n     and refused to go to work until the price of gasoline went \n     down, you can bet we would bring this country to its knees in \n     a week or less! I am tired of working for nothing! I am tired \n     of seeing my children not be able to make ends meet.\n       When the working public goes bankrupt from channeling its \n     hard-earned money into fuel, we will be ripe for another \n     country to come in and take us over.\n       Legislate ambitiously for off-shore drilling! Stop the \n     export of oil from Alaska. Enough is enough! Do something \n     about it!\n     Josie, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not have much of a different story than many other \n     Idahoans. I work hard each day 11 to 12 hrs. I live in a \n     rural area of Canyon County so ride sharing or car pooling is \n     not a viable option for me. I have to drive 18 miles to work \n     so riding a bike is not an option especially after putting in \n     a 12 hr day. I drive a small pick up Chevy S-10 to help \n     reduce my gas usage (as I mow lawns and do small pruning jobs \n     on the weekends to make a few extra dollars), my wife in I \n     traded in our ford tarsus for a KIA Spectra last November to \n     help save money and protect our budget of the current (Nov \n     07) high gas prices.\n       What I can say is that the only way out of our current \n     situation is for our congress needs to show OPEC, that we are \n     willing to take back control of our oil dependence.\n       1. Congress must do something positive about drilling oil \n     in the U.S., no arguing, no debating, no pork added to the \n     bills, just action.\n       2. We need to open up oil drilling anywhere that will have \n     minimal environmental impact, there is no place to drill that \n     will have no environmental impact, but we have the technology \n     to reduce any impact to the environment that will not cause \n     permanent damage. It is off the east coast, west coast, Gulf \n     of Mexico or Alaska we need to start drilling.\n       3. We need to build refineries through the country, but \n     especially on the west coast. The west coast refineries need \n     to be able to process the high sulfur oil from Alaska. These \n     actions should put a halt to the escalating oil prices from \n     OPEC, but they are only the first steps.\n       4. Big Oil Tax breaks for exploration and research, I do \n     not believe that these tax cuts are ever going to go away, \n     but I heard a news report over the weekend the Exxon Mobil \n     was exploring off the coast of the Philippines. This is \n     totally insane they are spending our money in tax cuts \n     outside the U.S.? If we are going to allow large profits and \n     tax breaks for exploration and research then they can do in \n     the U.S.\n       5. One of the biggest projects big oil could be spending \n     our money on is research for liquefying oil shale to minimize \n     any environmental effects of this process, but again there is \n     no way not to have some impact on the environment, but as a \n     country we must give a little to survive in this world \n     situation.\n       6. To reduce using our oil, coal and natural gas reserves \n     to generate electricity, we need to build Nuclear Power \n     Plants where the need is and where is will cause minimal \n     impact on the environment.\n       7. Long term measures would be to develop wind, water and \n     solar and other alternative power satrapies, it is too late \n     right now to impact the strategies hold OPEC has on our \n     country, and in the long term these straggles could play an \n     important role in our overall energy policy.\n       8. Please relay to your fellow Congressmen that if #1 and \n     #2 are not acted on immediately there will be a lot on \n     incumbents who will lose their seats in November. As the \n     American public and trucking industry can afford the daily \n     gas price increases. If the trucking industry falters then \n     our whole economy will collapse. This is not a idle threat by \n     one voter but a culmination of our elected officials doing \n     nothing about our energy policy for the last 30 years, and \n     within the last 6 years ignoring all the signs that OPEC now \n     has us by the neck in a strangle hold. The big oil companies \n     really do not care as they make money either way.\n     Robert.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for the opportunity to respond to your newsletter on \n     energy costs. My view, as expressed even before \\9/11\\, was \n     that we were subconsciously willing to sacrifice our children \n     due to our selfishness, NIMBY mentality, and uncompromising \n     positions regarding siting of energy facilities and \n     development of energy resources. Our inability to develop a \n     unified, effective energy policy is reflected in our \n     addiction to oil, and just like a drug addict, we are selling \n     out our country to those who least care about the future and \n     security of our children. Like street drugs, the demand \n     driven by our oil addiction is pushing up the price that \n     further enhances the wealth of many rouge nations that \n     support terrorism against us and would like nothing more than \n     to see our demise. I attribute the deaths of our beloved \n     service members on the battlefields in the Middle East to \n     this issue. The cost to me in terms of high gas prices \n     lowering my standard of living is nothing compared to the \n     sacrifice of their lives caused by our ineptness to come \n     together as a nation with a program for energy independence \n     with an urgency akin to President Kennedy's national \n     commitment to put a man on the moon in a decade. Anything \n     short of that is treating a symptom and not the disease.\n       There are no quick fixes. It took several decades of \n     selfishness to get us into this predicament, and it will take \n     at least a decade of committed effort to fix it. We, as a \n     nation, have the intellect and the resources to achieve \n     energy independence if we unleash our federal and private \n     institutions from excessive regulation. Decisions of such \n     national importance must be based on sound technical and \n     economic evaluation, not on how we can siphon more tax \n     dollars to benefit our constituents and enrich our political \n     standing or how we can enhance our personal wealth. The \n     future of our nation and our children is in our hands.\n     Noel, Idaho Falls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2826-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2826-S2827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MILLARD FULLER\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Millard \nFuller, a great American entrepreneur who dedicated his life to \nsheltering the poor. Millard passed away on February 3, 2009. He leaves \nbehind a great legacy of leadership and of service to the world's most \nvulnerable residents.\n  Millard was born in 1935 in Lanett, AL. It was in this town that \nMillard, at only 6 years old, earned his first profit by selling pigs \nand chickens. His entrepreneurial spirit would certainly carry him far. \nAfter some time working as a door-to-door salesman selling silk hosiery \nand underwear, Millard attended Auburn University to study economics. \nFollowing his graduation, Millard attended my alma mater, the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law, and it was there that he married \nhis wife Linda.\n  While a law student at the University of Alabama, Millard expanded \nhis entrepreneurial horizons and began selling Christmas trees and \nmistletoe with\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\nour fellow student, Morris Dees. Together, they would go on to form a \nlucrative direct marketing business selling cookbooks and other items. \nThis business would make Millard a millionaire by the time he reached \nthe young age of 29. When his work and devotion to monetary success \nbegan to threaten his personal relationships, however, Millard and \nLinda made the decision to simplify their lives by selling their \npossessions and dedicating their lives to their Christian values.\n  In 1965, Millard and Linda moved to Koinonia Farm in south Georgia. \nIt was there that Millard and Linda met and became close friends with \nthe farm's founder, Clarence Jordan. Clarence and Millard had much in \ncommon and together they developed the concept of a housing program \nthat would provide no-interest loans to people to build modest homes. \nThis idea eventually grew into Habitat for Humanity.\n  In 1976, from a tiny house in Americus, GA, Millard and Linda \nestablished Habitat for Humanity. Today, the organization has built \nmore than 300,000 houses around the world, providing more than 1.5 \nmillion people in more than 3,000 communities with safe, decent, \naffordable shelter. In April 2009, Habitat for Humanity's Alabama State \nSupport Organization will celebrate the completion of its 1,500th \nhouse.\n  Millard is loved and will be missed by his wife Linda and their four \nchildren. He will also be missed by the thousands of volunteers who \nfound inspiration through his dedication. It is because of Millard that \nthousands of people across the world have a place to call home. I ask \nthis entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of \nMillard Fuller.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2827-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING MAINE OXY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, at a time when our Nation is \ninvolved in a global war on terrorism, thousands of lives are disrupted \nas members of our armed services head off to war. One aspect that is \noften overlooked is the profound impact a deployment can have on a \nservicemember's civilian career. I wish today to commend a small \nbusiness from my home State of Maine that has made a veritable \ncommitment to ensuring that those serving our country are seamlessly \nreintegrated into the workforce upon their return from Active Duty, and \ntheir families taken care of while they are gone.\n  Maine Oxy is an Auburn-based company that specializes in welding, as \nwell as industrial and specialty gases. A third generation family \nmanaged firm, Maine Oxy was founded in 1929 by Joseph W. Albiston as \nMaine Gas Service, which at that time provided sales and service to \nhome propane customers. Six years later, Maine Oxy began providing \nwelding supplies and industrial gases for customers throughout \nAndroscoggin County, in central Maine. Since that time, Maine Oxy has \nexpanded to serve three States in eight locations, including a state-\nof-the-art acetylene production facility. It has also established a \ncutting-edge Spec Air gas manufacturing laboratory, as well as the New \nEngland School of Metalwork, with programs in welding and \nblacksmithing, as part of its sustained growth.\n  As a company that truly looks after its own, Maine Oxy has excelled \nin assisting its employees who serve in the military. Three such \nmembers from Maine Oxy's Auburn facility--Robert Smith, Kirby \nTouchette, and Scott St. Pierre--were all recently called up to Active \nDuty as combat engineers. During their deployment, Maine Oxy assisted \nthe servicemembers by sending them care packages, and also aided their \nfamilies by helping them with various chores, including chopping \nfirewood for one the families that needed it. Even now, Maine Oxy \ncontinues to send dozens of care packages to troops in Iraq.\n  Upon their return, the three deployed employees were encouraged to \nmake use of their maximum allocated 90-day entitlement of time off \nbefore returning to work. Moreover, the company was flexible in \nallowing for follow-up medical appointments. Finally, the firm rehired \nthe employees and promoted them to new positions, thereby allowing \ntheir replacement workers to maintain employment as well.\n  Maine has one of the highest percentages of veterans in the country \nat roughly 16 percent of the State's population. Our State is seeing \nhundreds of new veterans each year returning from combat in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. As such, it is heartening to see companies like Maine Oxy \nstanding ready to assist its veteran employees in such a broad and \naltruistic manner. Thank you to Bruce Albiston, Maine Oxy's Chief \nExecutive Officer, and everyone at Maine Oxy for their selfless support \nof their colleagues, and best wishes for their future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2827-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1127.

A bill to prevent voter caging; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, the Nation commemorates the 49th \nanniversary of ``Bloody Sunday,'' a day which marked a crucial turning \npoint in securing the right to vote for all Americans. On March 7, \n1965, in Selma, Alabama, John Lewis and his fellow civil rights \nactivists marched for their right to vote but were brutally attacked by \nstate troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We remember the acts of \ncourageous Americans who fought through the years for equality. We \nhonor their legacy by reaffirming our commitment to protect the right \nto vote for all Americans.\n  On the week of this important anniversary, I am pleased to join Sen. \nWhitehouse in introducing the Caging Prohibition Act of 2009. This \nlegislation contains commonsense reforms to strengthen the Nation's \nability to combat organized efforts to suppress the right to vote and \nbetter protect the voting rights of countless Americans.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I introduced a similar bill two years ago in \nan effort to bring urgent election reform to protect voters during the \n2008 presidential election. Although the Rules Committee held a hearing \non the measure, the bill was not reported out of Committee before the \nSenate adjourned last year. I hope the Senate will do its part to \nprevent shenanigans from disenfranchising voters during the next \nFederal election, by promptly passing this bill.\n  During my three decades in the Senate, I have devoted a considerable \nportion of my work to improving democratic participation and make our \ngovernment more accessible to all Americans. For the past two years, I \nhave been delighted to have Senator Whitehouse as a partner on this \nimportant issue. I thank him for his leadership on preserving and \nstrengthening our voting rights.\n  In recent years, we have seen a surge in a particularly alarming form \nof voter suppression known as voter caging. In voter caging, a \npolitical organization sends mail to addresses on voter rolls, compiles \na list of returned mail, and uses that list as grounds for partisan and \nunjustified purges or challenges of voters' eligibility. During the \nlast two presidential election cycles, we have seen evidence of voter \ncaging efforts emerge in numerous States, including Ohio, Florida, \nMichigan, and Pennsylvania.\n  Chief among the problems with voter caging is that it threatens to \ndisenfranchise voters in an unreliable manner. Rather than preventing \nvotes cast by ineligible voters, far too often the practice prevents \nlegitimate voters from casting their ballots. According to a recent \nreport from the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, ``[V]oter \ncaging lists are highly likely to include the names of many voters who \nare in fact eligible to vote.'' Of course, since government databases \nare often riddled with typos and clerical errors, these findings are \nhardly surprising.\n  Even more troubling, voter caging often aims to disenfranchise \nminority voters. I recall during a Senate race in Louisiana, in 1986, a \nmemorandum from the Republican National Committee concluded that hiring \na consultant to distribute 350,000 mailings marked ``do not forward'' \nto mostly African-American districts would ``eliminate at least 60-\n80,000 folks from the rolls . . . [and] could keep the black vote down \nconsiderably.'' That is unacceptable. That is wrong. No one's right to \nvote should be abridged, suppressed, or denied in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The practice of voter caging chips away at core protections in our \ndemocracy. The right to vote, and have your vote count, is a \nfoundational right because it secures the effectiveness of all other \nprotections. Indeed, the very legitimacy of our government is dependent \non the access all Americans have to the political process. That is why \nvoting is the cornerstone of our democracy. Any infringement on this \nright harms the fabric of America.\n  All too often, voter caging efforts have partisan goals. For example, \nthe Judiciary Committee's investigation last Congress into the mass \nfirings of U.S. Attorneys for political reasons shed light on how Tim \nGriffin, a former Bush White House aide, participated in a voter caging \nscheme aimed at disenfranchising African-American voters in Florida. He \nwas later appointed interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nArkansas.\n  Rooting out partisan voter caging tactics requires us to give Federal \nofficials the tools and resources they need to investigate and \nprosecute organized efforts to suppress the right to vote. This bill \nwill do exactly that.\n  This legislation would prohibit challenging a person's eligibility to \nvote--or register to vote--based on a voter caging list, an unverified \nmatch list, or foreclosure status. A challenged voter may feel \nintimidated or discouraged, and may leave a polling site and not vote. \nIn America, a person should not lose their fundamental right to vote, \nnor have that vote challenged, on the sole basis of a mistake, error, \nor because their mail failed to reach them. Similarly, as the current \neconomic crisis reminds us, Americans should not have their fundamental \nright to vote jeopardized simply because they lose their jobs to \nlayoffs or their homes to foreclosure.\n  The bill would also require any private party who challenges the \nright of another citizen to vote--or register to vote--to set forth in \nwriting, under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds for the alleged \nineligibility. This provision deters illegitimate challenges to voters \nby requiring, at a minimum, a showing of good cause. It properly \nbalances legitimate efforts to clean voting rolls with forbidding \nunreliable voter purges.\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of civil rights and \nvoting rights organizations such as the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, the Lawyers Community for Civil Rights under Law, the Brennan \nCenter for Justice, and the People for the American Way. They \nunderstand that voter caging is a modern-day barrier to the ballot box \nthat has created unique problems for legitimate voters for many years, \nand that a Federal ban on these undemocratic practices is necessary.\n  I hope that this year all Senators will support this important \nlegislation and take firm action to stamp out this intolerable voter \nsuppression tactic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Udall, of New \n        Mexico, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Kerry, and \n        Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 529. A bill to assist in the Conservation of rare fields and rare \ncanids by supporting and providing financial resources for the \nconservation programs of countries within the range of rare felid and \nrare canid populations and projects of persons with demonstrated \nexpertise in the conservation of rare felid and rare canid populations; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr President, I rise to speak about the Great Cats and \nRare Canids Act, which I am introducing today along with my friends\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\nSenators Sam Brownback and Tom Udall. This bipartisan legislation \ncontinues our tradition of protecting threatened and endangered species \naround the world and comes at a critical time in the survival of these \nanimals.\n  Of the 37 wild felid species worldwide, all are currently recognized \nas species in need of protection under the World Conservation Union, \nIUCN, Red List, the lists of species in CITES appendices I, II, and \nIII, or the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Of the 35 wild canid \nspecies worldwide, nearly 50 percent are recognized as in need of such \nprotection in one of these categories.\n  This legislation would create the Great Cats and Rare Canids \nConservation Fund and builds on the success of the Multinational \nSpecies Conservation Fund, NSCF, which presently provides funding to \nprotect tigers, rhinoceroses, elephants, great apes, and marine \nturtles. The Great Cats and Rare Canids Conservation Fund would support \nthe conservation of wild felid and canid populations outside the United \nStates by providing financial resources to conserve 15 such species \nthat are vital for their ecological value and are listed as endangered \nor threatened on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. The great \ncats and rare canids included in this bill are umbrella species that, \nif conserved appropriately, protect their corresponding landscapes and \nother species dependent on those ecosystems.\n  Among the species protected under this act are the majestic jaguar of \nSouth and Central America, the elusive snow leopard, the cheetah, the \nAfrican wild dog, and other rare carnivore species. These species are \nthreatened by habitat loss, poaching, disease, and pollution.\n  The struggle of the African wild dog is one example of the plight \nthese large carnivores face. The less than 2,500 adults that remain not \nonly have to combat the widespread misconception that they are \nlivestock killers, but are extremely susceptible to diseases common in \ndomesticated animals. They have lost 89 percent their habitat and are \nnow found in only 14 of the 39 countries that comprise their historic \nrange.\n  The snow leopard is another example. Like all great cats, the snow \nleopard needs a large tract of uninterrupted land in which to live, but \nthe snow leopard's habitat in China has been fragmented due to human \nencroachment. The cats are also under extreme poaching pressures as \ntheir fur is sold on the black market.\n  In addition to protecting the species already listed in the Act, the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been mandated to complete a study \nwithin two years of the bill's enactment to determine what other \ncritically endangered species could become eligible for conservation \nassistance. The findings of this study will enable the United States to \nprovide conservation assistance to protect additional great cat and \nrare canid species that are determined to need conservation assistance \nin the future.\n  Our bill would authorize $5 million in annual spending for the \nconservation of more than a dozen species of great cats and rare \ncanines. The Great Cats and Rare Canids Conservation Fund would \nleverage private conservation dollars from corporate and non-government \nsources in order to address the critical need to conserve these \nthreatened large carnivores. Historically, for every $1 invested by the \nFederal Government in the programs that are part of the Multinational \nSpecies Conservation Fund, there is at least a $3 match by private \ndonations.\n  These funds enable the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to partner with \nnonprofit groups and foreign entities to undertake a range of \nconservation programs where threatened and endangered species live. \nTypical activities to protect the different species in the \nMultinational Species Conservation Fund include new educational \nprograms for local populations to increase awareness of these species \nand prevent interactions that could be harmful to people and animals, \nas well as increased monitoring and law enforcement activities to \nprevent poaching and illegal animal trafficking. Great cats are \nparticularly at risk from hunting for trade purposes while rare canids \nare susceptible to disease, and this bill will allow the establishment \nof programs to address these species-specific threats.\n  The genesis of the Great Cats and Rare Canids program is nearly a \ndecade old, and the bill under consideration today was also introduced \nin the past two Congresses. In that time, these species have continued \nto decline in numbers. I do not think our children and grandchildren \nwill forgive us if we stand by and let these magnificent animals drift \ninto extinction. With a relatively small investment, we can invigorate \nongoing conservation efforts around the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 531. A bill to provide for the conduct of an in-depth analysis of \nthe impact of energy development and production on the water resources \nof the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, with \nSenator Murkowski's support, that will improve our understanding of the \ninterdependence of energy and water and begin integrating decision-\nmaking for both resources. The relationship between energy and water is \nan often overlooked but serious issue that is growing in importance.\n  Energy and water are crucial components of modern life. Production of \nenergy and freshwater are inextricably linked. Each is required for the \nproduction of the other, and neither resource is routinely considered \nin developing management policies for the other. As population density \ncontinues to increase in already water-stressed regions, it is crucial \nthat the United States develop new policies that integrate energy and \nwater solutions so that one resource does not undermine the use of the \nother.\n  Thermal power generation, coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear, \naccounts for 39 percent of freshwater withdrawals in the U.S., second \nonly to agriculture-related withdrawals. Water use can range from 7,500 \ngallons of water per megawatt-hour produced, gal/MWhr, for natural gas \nplants, to 60,000 gal/MWhr for some nuclear facilities. Petroleum \nrefineries also use a significant amount of water, and the water \ndemands of the transportation sector will only increase as the U.S. \nseeks to reduce its reliance on foreign oil. The two primary options \nfor reducing gasoline use--plug-in hybrids and biofuels--are both more \nwater intensive than gasoline. By some estimates, plug-in hybrids \nconsume three times more water per mile traveled than conventional \ngasoline vehicles. If the entire production cycle is considered, some \nbiofuels can consume as much as 20 times more water per mile traveled. \nThree provisions of the bill attempt to highlight and further analyze \nthese issues: a National Academies study of water use in transportation \nfuel production and electricity generation; the development of power \nplant water use guidelines by the Department of Energy; and a directive \nto the Secretary of Energy to finalize an energy-water research and \ndevelopment roadmap to guide policy efforts in the future. Better data \nwill lead to integration of water considerations in the development of \nenergy policy.\n  Just as our energy consumption uses large amounts of water, the \nacquisition, treatment, and delivery of water supplies consumes massive \namounts of energy. For example, 19 percent of California's electricity \nconsumption is for water-related energy uses. Overall, treatment and \ndelivery of municipal water supplies consume 3 percent of the nation's \nelectricity. The bill addresses the issue of water-related energy \nconsumption by directing the Bureau of Reclamation to evaluate energy \nuse in Reclamation projects and identify ways to reduce such use. The \nbill also directs the Energy Information Administration to gather data \nand report on the energy consumed by water treatment and delivery \nactivities. Once again, better data will lead to improved decision-\nmaking by State, local, and Federal water managers. Furthermore, the \nbill establishes research priorities for the Bureau of Reclamation's \nBrackish Groundwater Desalination Facility, including renewable energy \nintegration with desalination technologies. To the extent that \nrenewable energy can be integrated\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\nwith water treatment and delivery facilities, public acceptance of new \nwater supply proposals is likely to increase.\n  The bill being introduced today is a good first step towards \nintegrating energy and water policy. Such efforts will become \nincreasingly necessary as growing populations, environmental needs, and \na changing climate continue to affect both energy and water resources. \nI look forward to this legislation increasing the dialogue on these \nissues and hope that we can incorporate additional ideas as the \nlegislative process proceeds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 531\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to \nestablish a grant program to ensure waterfront access for commercial \nfisherman, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that \nwill improve the lives of our Nation's fishermen who are struggling to \nmake a living at sea.\n  The fishing industry in New England is an important part of our \nheritage. From our nation's earliest days, fishing has served as an \neconomic driver that has allowed our nation to prosper. Maine's proud \nfishing heritage is woven deeply into the cultural fabric of our state. \nSadly, the global economic downturn and heavy-handed federal \nregulations threaten the economic stability of this venerable industry. \nTo attempt to assist our fishing families, I am pleased to be joined by \nmy colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing the \nWorking Waterfront Preservation Act and the Commercial Fishermen Safety \nAct.\n  All along our Nation's coasts there are harbors that were once full \nof the hustle and bustle associated with the fishing industry. \nUnfortunately, there is an erosion of the vital infrastructure known as \nour working waterfronts that is so critical to our commercial fishing \nindustries. I have drafted legislation that will help combat the loss \nof commercial access to our waterfronts and support the fishing \nindustry's role in our maritime heritage.\n  When constituents first called asking me to help them in their \nefforts to stop the loss of their fishing businesses and the \ncommunities built around this industry, I learned that no Federal \nprogram exists that supports preserving or increasing waterfront access \nfor the commercial fishing industry. This is especially disheartening \nbecause every week we are losing more of our working waterfronts in \nthis country. Quite simply, once lost, these vital economic and \ncommunity hubs of commercial fishing activity cannot be replaced.\n  That is why I am introducing the Working Waterfront Preservation Act. \nThis legislation would create a program to support our Nation's \ncommercial fisherman and the coastal communities that are at risk of \nlosing their fishing businesses.\n  The need for such a program is demonstrated by the loss of commercial \nwaterfront access occurring in Maine. Only 25 of Maine's 3,500 miles of \ncoastline are devoted to commercial access. We are continually seeing \nportions of Maine's working waterfront being sold off to the highest \nbidder--with large vacation homes and condominiums rising in places \nthat our fishing industry used to call home.\n  The reasons for the loss of Maine's working waterfront are complex. \nIn some cases, burdensome fishing regulations have led to a decrease in \nlandings, hindering the profitability of shore-side infrastructure, \nlike the Portland Fish Exchange. In other cases, soaring land values \nand rising taxes have made the current use of commercial land \nunprofitable. Property is being sold and quickly converted into private \nspaces and second homes that are no longer the center of economic \nactivity. With each conversion of commercial waterfront access to \nprivate development, a piece of Maine's proud maritime tradition is \nirretrievably lost.\n  Maine's lack of commercial waterfront prompted the formation of a \n``Working Waterfront Coalition.'' This coalition was comprised of an \nimpressive number of industry associations, nonprofit groups, and State \nagencies, who came together to preserve Maine's working waterfront.\n  I am pleased to note that the Working Waterfront Coalition was \nsuccessful in contributing to the creation of two programs in Maine. \nThe first is a tax incentive for property owners to keep their land in \nits current working waterfront state. The second is a pilot program for \ngrant funding to secure and preserve working waterfront areas. Since \n2006, the Working Waterfront Access Pilot Program has secured 11 \nproperties totaling more than 25 acres of\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nland that supports more than 300 boats, 400 fishing industry jobs, and \nmore than $26 million in income directly associated with our working \nwaterfronts. The State of Maine has taken positive action to save its \nwaterfronts and is a model for other States in the country facing this \nproblem.\n\n  This work is not, however, finished. The loss of commercial \nwaterfront access affects the fishing industry throughout all coastal \nstates. And a modest Federal investment could do so much to save these \nareas. Preservation of the working waterfront is essential to protect a \nway of life that is unique to our coastal States and is vital to \neconomic development along the coast. Fishermen are being pushed out of \nthe waterfront as their profitability shrinks and land values soar. Our \nlegislation targeting this exact problem, as no Federal program exists \nto assist States like Maine, Florida, Washington, and Louisiana.\n  The Working Waterfront Preservation Act would assist by providing \nFederal grant funding to municipal and State governments, non-profit \norganizations, and fishermen's cooperatives for the purchase of \nproperty or easements or for the maintenance of working waterfront \nfacilities. The bill contains a $50 million authorization for grants \nthat would require a 25 percent local match. Applications for grants \nwould be considered by both the Department of Commerce and State \nfisheries agencies, which have the local expertise to understand the \nneeds of each coastal State. Grant recipients would agree not to \nconvert coastal properties to noncommercial uses, as a condition of \nreceiving Federal assistance.\n  This legislation also includes a tax component. When properties or \neasements are purchased, sellers would only be taxed on half of the \ngain they receive from this sale. This is a vital aspect of my bill \nbecause it would diminish the pressure to quickly sell waterfront \nproperty that would then, most likely, be converted to noncommercial \nuses, and would increase the incentives for sellers to take part in \nthis grant program. This is especially important given that the \napplication process for Federal grants does not keep pace with the \ncoastal real estate market.\n  This legislation is crucial for our Nation's commercial fisheries, \nwhich are coming under increasing pressures from many fronts. This new \ngrant program would preserve important commercial infrastructure and \npromote economic development along our coast.\n  Second, I am introducing the Commercial Fishermen Safety Act of 2009, \na bill to help fishermen purchase the life-saving safety equipment they \nneed to survive when disaster strikes.\n  Every day, members of our fishing communities struggle to cope with \nthe pressures of running a small business, complying with burdensome \nregulations, and maintaining their vessels and equipment. These \nchallenges have been made worse by the growing economic crisis, which \nonly adds to the dangers associated with fishing.\n  Year-in and year-out, commercial fishing ranks among the nation's \nmost dangerous occupations. Fatality rate data compiled by the Census \nof Fatal Occupational Injuries program for 2007 has, once again, listed \nfishing as having the highest fatality rate among selected occupations. \nWhile I am encouraged that 2007 saw a drop in the number of \noccupational-related fatalities in the fishing industry, we must be \ndoing more to save lives at sea.\n  The New England fishing community is no stranger to tragedy. Just \nthis year, the Patriot, a 54-foot fishing boat out of Gloucester, MA, \nsunk off the coast of Massachusetts without warning. The ship's captain \nMatteo Russo and crew member John Orlando, who were lost in the \nincident, were unable to send a mayday call in the early morning of \nJanuary 3, 2009. The unexplained circumstance of their deaths offers \nlittle solace to the families and communities that loved them. What is \nclear is that preventing further loss of life requires that we do all \nwe can to promote safety at sea.\n  Coast Guard regulations require all fishing vessels to carry safety \nequipment. The requirements vary depending on factors such as the size \nof the vessel, the temperature of the water, and the distance the \nvessel travels from shore to fish. Required equipment can include a \nliferaft that automatically inflates and floats free, should the vessel \nsink. Other life-saving equipment includes: personal flotation devices \nor immersion suits which help protect fishermen from exposure and \nincrease buoyancy; EPIRBs, which relay a downed vessel's position to \nCoast Guard Search and Rescue Personnel; visual distress signals; and \nfire extinguishers.\n  When an emergency arises, safety equipment is priceless. At all other \ntimes, the cost of purchasing or maintaining this equipment must \ncompete with other expenses such as loan payments, fuel, wages, \nmaintenance, and insurance.\n  The Commercial Fishermen Safety Act of 2007 provides a tax credit \nequal to 75 percent of the amount paid by fishermen to purchase or \nmaintain required safety equipment. The tax credit is capped at $1500. \nItems such as EPIRBs and immersion suits cost hundreds of dollars, \nwhile liferafts can reach into the thousands. The tax credit will make \nlife-saving equipment more affordable for more fishermen, who currently \nface limited options under the federal tax code.\n  We have seen far too many tragedies in this occupation. Please, let \nus support fishermen who are trying to prepare in case disaster \nstrikes. Safety equipment saves lives. By providing a tax credit for \nthe purchase of safety equipment, Congress can help ensure that \nfishermen have a better chance of returning home each and every time \nthey head out to sea.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n   S. 536. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to modify the definition \nof the term ``renewable biomass''; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there is an old saying about ``not seeing \nthe forest for the trees'' that applies to the current myopic policies \non biomass from Federal lands. Right now, instead of helping to provide \npart of the solution to our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, biomass \nfrom Federal lands allowed to build up in the woods or worse become \nfuel for catastrophic fires. Instead of being part of the solution for \nenergy independence, it is creating a problem for forest management and \ncommunities that border on Federal forests.\n  I rise today to introduce a bill that would allow woody debris and \nplant material--or ``biomass''--from Federal lands to become part of \nthe solution to America's energy problems and to create new economic \nopportunities to help sustain our rural communities. This legislation \nwould amend the Clean Air Act to modify the definition of the term \n``renewable biomass'' contained in the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard \nso that biomass from Federal lands is eligible as a fuel source under \nthis standard.\n  Today, biomass from Federal lands cannot be counted as a renewable \ntransportation fuel. The change I am proposing would help tackle a \nnumber of critical problems--expanding the universe of biomass that can \nbe used for fuel, helping pay for programs to reduce dangerous levels \nof dead and dying trees that fuel wildfires, thinning unhealthy, second \ngrowth forests, providing low-carbon fuels to address climate change, \nand create jobs in increasingly difficult economic times.\n  The reason we need this legislation goes back to the 2007 energy \nbill--the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. In that \nlegislation, the Congress dramatically expanded the Federal mandate for \nthe use of renewable biofuels, such as ethanol from corn and cellulose, \nand biodiesel. Unfortunately, this legislation included a definition of \nrenewable biomass that is now part of the Clean Air Act which excluded \nslash and thinning byproducts from Federal lands--all Federal lands. \nThis occurred despite the bipartisan work we had undertaken here in the \nSenate and in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to come up \nwith a more commonsense definition. The result is that biomass from \nmillions of acres of Federal lands are arbitrarily excluded from \nserving as feedstock for the very renewable biofuels that the mandate \nrequires.\n  Changing the definition of ``renewable biomass'' for the renewable \nfuels standard is very important to states like Oregon, where the \nFederal Government owns much of the land and where our forests are \nchoked and overstocked. Critical work needs to take\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\nplace in these forests and utilizing the excess biomass--small diameter \ntrees, limbs and debris--for energy will help us get that work \naccomplished while getting us the added benefit of green energy. These \nbyproducts are often a critical energy source for rural Americans, who \nuse them in environmentally-friendly wood pellet stoves. But more \nimportantly, they are part of the future of clean, renewable fuels--as \nfurther development of cellulosic ethanol will allow us to use these \nwaste materials reclaimed literally from the forest and mill floors. \nConversely, by excluding biomass from Federal lands, the existing \nmandate places ever more weight on the use of biomass from other \nsources, including the use of food-based corn and grains and private \nforests.\n\n  My bill seeks to utilize biomass from Federal lands in an \nenvironmentally responsible way. It will protect those natural \nresources that need to be protected, while allowing renewable biomass \nfrom Federal lands to contribute to our Nation's energy mix. First, my \nbill would allow biomass from National Forests and Bureau of Land \nManagement forests to qualify as renewable biomass under the Federal \nRenewable Fuels Standard, but it would continue to exclude old growth \nand biomass from National Parks, Wilderness Areas and other \nenvironmentally protected areas. Second, the bill would require Federal \nland managers to ensure that the quantities of biomass harvested even \nfrom these eligible National Forest and BLM lands are sustainable. \nWhile biomass holds great potential as a clean source of energy, I want \nto ensure that it gets harvested at levels that are truly sustainable \nand that biofuels and bioenergy projects dependent on renewable biomass \nare sized appropriately so that we protect our forests and natural \nresources and ensure that biofuels production facilities will not \nwither and die because of inadequate feedstock supplies.\n  I want to be clear that my legislation only addresses the question of \nhow the Renewable Fuel Standard treats biomass from Federal lands. It \ndoes not and it is not intended to reopen or overhaul the Renewable \nFuels Standard as a whole. It is simply a targeted fix for our Federal \npublic lands.\n  As we move forward with new energy legislation and work on developing \nadditional green energy solutions, I want to ensure that renewable \nbiomass is genuinely one of those solutions, including biomass from \nFederal lands. It is my hope that beyond fixing the definition in the \nClean Air Act for the Renewable Fuels Standard, Congress will include a \ncomparable definition in legislation addressing climate change and \nrenewable electricity production requirements.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate and \nin the House of Representatives to advance a biomass definition that \nbalances sound energy policy with practical and sensible use of our \nforests.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The result of this abuse, which often \ncomes in the form of sealed settlement agreements, is to keep important \nhealth and safety information hidden from the public.\n  This problem has been recurring for decades, and most often arises in \nproduct liability cases. Typically, an individual brings a cause of \naction against a manufacturer for an injury or death that has resulted \nfrom a defect in one of its products. The injured party often faces a \nlarge corporation that can spend a virtually unlimited amount of money \ndefending the lawsuit, prolonging the time it takes to reach \nresolution. Facing a formidable opponent and mounting medical bills, a \nplaintiff often has no choice but to settle the litigation. In exchange \nfor the award he or she was seeking, the victim is forced to agree to a \nprovision that prohibits him or her from revealing information \ndisclosed during the litigation.\n  Plaintiffs get a respectable award, and the defendant is able to keep \ndamaging information from getting out. Because they remain unaware of \ncritical public health and safety information that could potentially \nsave lives, the American public incurs the greatest cost.\n  This concern about excessive secrecy is warranted by the fact that \ntobacco companies, automobile manufacturers, and pharmaceutical \ncompanies have settled with victims and used the legal system to hide \ninformation which, if it became public, could protect the American \npeople from future harms. Surely, there are appropriate uses for such \norders, like protecting trade secrets and other truly confidential \ncompany information. This legislation makes sure such information is \nprotected. But, protective orders are certainly not supposed to be used \nfor the sole purpose of hiding damaging information from the public, to \nprotect a company's reputation or profit margin.\n  One of the most famous cases of abuse of secrecy orders involved \nBridgestone/Firestone tires. From 1992-2000, tread separations of \nvarious Bridgestone and Firestone tires caused accidents across the \ncountry, many resulting in serious injuries and even fatalities. \nInstead of owning up to their mistakes and acting responsibly, \nBridgestone/Firestone quietly settled dozens of lawsuits, most of which \nincluded secrecy agreements. It was not until 1999, when a Houston \npublic television station broke the story, that the company \nacknowledged its wrongdoing and recalled 6.5 million tires. By then, it \nwas too late. More than 250 people had died and more than 800 were \ninjured as a result of the defective tires.\n  If the story ended there, and the Bridgestone/Firestone cases were \njust an aberration, one might argue that there is no urgent need for \nlegislation. But, unfortunately, the list of abuses goes on. There is \nthe case of General Motors. Although an internal memo demonstrated that \nGM was aware of the risk of fire deaths from crashes of pickup trucks \nwith ``side saddle'' fuel tanks, an estimated 750 people were killed in \nfires involving trucks with these fuel tanks. When victims sued, GM \ndisclosed documents only under protective orders, and settled these \ncases on the condition that the information in these documents remained \nsecret. This type of fuel tank was installed for 15 years before being \ndiscontinued.\n\n  Evidence suggests that the dangers posed by protective orders and \nsecret settlements continue. On December 11, 2007, at a hearing before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition \nPolicy and Consumer Rights, Johnny Bradley Jr. described his tragic \npersonal story that demonstrates the implications of court endorsed \nsecrecy. In 2002, Mr. Bradley's\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\nwife was killed in a rollover accident allegedly caused by tread \nseparation in his Cooper tires. While litigating the case, his attorney \nuncovered documented evidence of Cooper tire design defects. Through \naggressive litigation of protective orders and confidential settlements \nin cases prior to the Bradleys' accident, Cooper had managed to keep \nthe design defect documents confidential. Prior to the end of Mr. \nBradley's trial, Cooper Tires settled with him on the condition that \nalmost all litigation documents would be kept confidential under a \nbroad protective order. With no access to documented evidence of design \ndefects, consumers will continue to remain in the dark about this life-\nthreatening defect.\n  In 2005, the drug company Eli Lilly settled 8,000 cases related to \nharmful side effects of its drug Zyprexa. All of those settlements \nrequired plaintiffs to agree ``not to communicate, publish or cause to \nbe published . . . any statement . . . concerning the specific events, \nfacts or circumstances giving rise to [their] claims.'' In those cases, \nthe plaintiffs uncovered documents which showed that, through its own \nresearch, Lilly knew about the harmful side effects as early as 1999. \nWhile the plaintiffs kept quiet, Lilly continued to sell Zyprexa and \ngenerated $4.2 billion in sales in 2005. More than a year later, \ninformation about the case was leaked to the New York Times and another \n18,000 cases settled. Had the first settlement not included a secrecy \nagreement, consumers would have been able to make informed choices and \navoid the harmful side effects, including enormous weight gain, \ndangerously elevated blood sugar levels, and diabetes.\n  This very issue is currently before a Federal judge in Orlando, FL. \nThere, the court is faced with deciding whether AstraZeneca can keep \nunder seal clinical studies about the harmful side effects of an \nantipsychotic drug, Seroquel. Plaintiffs' lawyers and Bloomberg News \nsued to force AstraZeneca to make public documents discovered in \ndismissed lawsuits. Late last month, the court unsealed some of the \ndocuments at question, and is still deciding whether to unseal the \nremainder of the documents. This is exactly the sort of case where we \nneed judges to consider public health and safety when deciding whether \nto allow a secrecy order.\n  There are no records kept of the number of confidentiality orders \naccepted by State or Federal courts. However, anecdotal evidence \nsuggests that court secrecy and confidential settlements are prevalent. \nBeyond General Motors, Bridgestone/Firestone, Cooper Tire, Zyprexa and \nSeroquel, secrecy agreements have also had real life consequences by \nallowing Dalkon Shield, Bjork-Shiley heart valves, and numerous other \ndangerous products and drugs to remain in the market. And those are \nonly the ones we know about.\n  While some states have already begun to move in the right direction, \nwe still have a long way to go. It is time to initiate a Federal \nsolution for this problem. The Sunshine in Litigation Act is a modest \nproposal that would require federal judges to perform a simple \nbalancing test to ensure that in any proposed secrecy order, the \ndefendant's interest in secrecy truly outweighs the public interest in \ninformation related to public health and safety.\n  Specifically, prior to making any portion of a case confidential or \nsealed, a judge would have to determine--by making a particularized \nfinding of fact--that doing so would not restrict the disclosure of \ninformation relevant to public health and safety. Moreover, all courts, \nboth Federal and State, would be prohibited from issuing protective \norders that prevent disclosure to relevant regulatory agencies.\n  This legislation does not prohibit secrecy agreements across the \nboard. It does not place an undue burden on judges or our courts. It \nsimply states that where the public interest in disclosure outweighs \nlegitimate interests in secrecy, courts should not shield important \nhealth and safety information from the public. The time to focus some \nsunshine on public hazards to prevent future harm is now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the recruitment and retention of school \ncounselors, school social workers, and\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\nschool psychologists by low-income local educational agencies; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, on behalf of children in lower-income \nschools across our nation, I rise today to introduce the Increased \nStudent Achievement through Increased Student Support Act.\n  Each day, teachers in our schools are tasked not only with addressing \nthe academic needs of students, but also with the behavioral, social, \nand emotional needs of the children in their classrooms. When they are \nleft to address these emotional and behavioral issues, they have less \ntime to deliver high quality academic instruction to the rest of the \nstudents in their class. Additionally, teachers often do not have the \ntraining or expertise to deal with many of the emotional issues their \nstudents face. Children overcoming mental illness or family issues such \nas the deployment of a parent to a war zone, homelessness, or domestic \nabuse, need the assistance of a trained professional, such as a school \npsychologist, school counselor, or school social worker.\n  While student support services provided by these support personnel \nare readily available in many school districts, other low-income \nschools often lack access to these support personnel. Too many schools \nin low-income rural and urban areas have to share school counselors, \nsocial workers, and psychologists with many schools in the area, \nlimiting their students' access to these services and placing an \nunnecessary burden on our teachers and our students.\n  That is why I rise today along with my colleagues Senators Cochran, \nLeahy, Menendez, and Pryor to enthusiastically offer the Increased \nStudent Achievement through Increased Student Support Act. This bill \nwill authorize grant funding to form partnerships between higher \neducation institutions that train school guidance counselors, social \nworkers, and psychologists and qualified rural and urban low-income \nLocal Education Agencies to train and place these important school \nsupport professionals in under-served schools across the country.\n  This bipartisan bill also authorizes grant funding to universities to \nrecruit and hire faculty to train graduate students to become school \ncounselors, school social workers, and school psychologists. \nAdditionally, it provides tuition credits to such graduate students, \nand offers student loan forgiveness to program graduates employed as \nschool counselors, social workers, or psychologists by rural or urban \nlow-income Local Education Agencies for a minimum of five years.\n  By increasing the number of student support personnel in our \ncountry's under-served schools, we will provide students with the \nsocial and emotional support they need to succeed in the classroom. We \nwill also provide teachers the assistance they need so they can \nconcentrate on providing the academic instruction our children need.\n  By taking these steps to improve student access to school counselors, \nschool social workers, and school psychologists, I am confident we can \nmake strides in raising academic achievement in schools across the \ncountry.\n  As we move forward, I want to encourage my colleagues to support \nAmerica's children by supporting this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 538\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Increased Student \n     Achievement Through Increased Student Support Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Research shows that socioeconomic status and family \n     background characteristics are highly correlated with \n     educational outcomes, with a concentration of low-performing \n     schools in low-income and under-served communities.\n       (2) Teachers cite poor working conditions, student \n     behavior, lack of student motivation, and lack of \n     administrative support as key reasons why they choose to \n     leave the teaching profession.\n       (3) Teachers and principals working for low-income local \n     educational agencies are increasingly tasked with addressing \n     not only the academic needs of a child, but also the social, \n     emotional, and behavioral needs of a child that require the \n     services of a school counselor, school social worker, and \n     school psychologist, and these needs often interfere with \n     delivering quality instruction and raising student \n     achievement.\n       (4) Rates of abuse and neglect of young children in \n     military families have doubled with the increased military \n     involvement of the United States abroad since October 2002; \n     likewise, adolescents with deployed parents report increased \n     perceptions of uncertainty and loss, role ambiguity, negative \n     changes in mental and behavioral health, and increased \n     relationship conflict, raising concerns about the impact of \n     deployment on military personnel and their families and \n     whether schools that serve a large number of children with \n     deployed parents have sufficient staff and expertise to meet \n     these challenges.\n       (5) Children of military families in rural communities are \n     often geographically isolated, and schools that were already \n     experiencing understaffing of school counselors, school \n     social workers, and school psychologists face even greater \n     challenges meeting the increased needs of students enduring \n     the stress that comes along with having a deployed parent or \n     parents.\n       (6) Schools served by low-income local educational agencies \n     suffer disproportionately from a lack of services, with many \n     schools sharing a single school counselor, school social \n     worker, or school psychologist with neighboring schools.\n       (7) Too few school counselors, school social workers, and \n     school psychologists per student means that such personnel \n     are often unable to effectively address the needs of \n     students.\n       (8) The American School Counselor Association and American \n     Counseling Association recommend having at least 1 school \n     counselor for every 250 students.\n       (9) The School Social Work Association of America \n     recommends having at least 1 school social worker for every \n     400 students.\n       (10) The National Association of School Psychologists \n     recommends having at least 1 school psychologist for every \n     1,000 students.\n       (11) Recent research of victimization of children ages 2 to \n     17 suggests that more than one-half of the children \n     experienced a physical assault in the study year. More than 1 \n     in 4 experienced a property offense, more than 1 in 8 \n     experienced a form of child maltreatment, 1 in 12 experienced \n     a sexual victimization, and more than 1 in 3 had been a \n     witness to violence or experienced another form of indirect \n     victimization. Only 29 percent of the children had no direct \n     or indirect victimization.\n       (12) Principals and teachers see signs of trauma-related \n     stress in many students including hostile outbursts, sliding \n     grades, poor test performance, and the inability to pay \n     attention.\n       (13) It is estimated, based on recent data on the number of \n     children in foster care, that more than 500,000 children are \n     in the foster care system each year, with 289,000 exiting the \n     system each year due to aging out or adoption.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to increase the recruitment and \n     retention of school counselors, school social workers, and \n     school psychologists by low-income local educational agencies \n     in order to--\n       (1) support all students who are at risk of negative \n     educational outcomes;\n       (2) improve student achievement, which may be measured by \n     growth in academic achievement on tests required by the \n     applicable State educational agency, persistence rates, \n     graduation rates, and other appropriate measures;\n       (3) improve retention of teachers who are highly qualified;\n       (4) increase and improve outreach and collaboration between \n     school counselors, school social workers, and school \n     psychologists and parents and families served by low-income \n     local educational agencies;\n       (5) increase and improve collaboration among teachers, \n     principals, school counselors, school social workers, and \n     school psychologists and improve professional development \n     opportunities for teachers and principals in the area of \n     strategies related to improving classroom climate and \n     classroom management; and\n       (6) improve working conditions for all school personnel.\n\n     SEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL \n                   COUNSELORS, SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS, AND SCHOOL \n                   PSYCHOLOGISTS EMPLOYED BY LOW-INCOME LOCAL \n                   EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Grant Program Authorized.--The Secretary of Education \n     shall award grants on a competitive basis to eligible \n     partnerships that receive recommendations from the peer \n     review panel established under subsection (d), to enable such \n     partnerships to carry out pipeline programs to increase the \n     number of school counselors, school social workers, and \n     school psychologists employed by low-income local educational \n     agencies by carrying out any of the activities described by \n     subsection (g).\n       (b) Grant Period.--A grant awarded under this section shall \n     be for a 5-year period and may be renewed for additional 5-\n     year periods upon a showing of adequate progress, as the \n     Secretary determines appropriate.\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\n       (c) Application.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     this section, an eligible graduate institution, on behalf of \n     an eligible partnership, shall submit to the Secretary a \n     grant application, including--\n       (1) an assessment of the existing ratios of school \n     counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists \n     to students enrolled in schools in each low-income local \n     educational agency that is part of the eligible partnership;

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to require the \nPresident to designate certain geographical areas as national renewable \nenergy zones, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as John F. Kennedy said about 50 years ago, \n``The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word `crisis.' One \nbrush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, \nbe aware of the danger--but recognize the opportunity.''\n  America has not one crisis, but at least three crises that loom large \nbefore us. The economy is in obvious turmoil, pollution is causing the \nclimate to change, and we are far too dependent on oil, particularly \noil from unfriendly places around the world. These challenges hamper \nour security in profound ways.\n  Fortunately, with a new President and a bipartisan mandate in \nCongress, the opportunities to change direction and turn crisis into \nopportunity have never been more abundant. Now is the time to focus our \nresources on investments that will create jobs today and sustainable \neconomic growth into the future.\n  I know that we have the technology to use less oil tomorrow then we \nused today, and even less the day after. We can move quickly toward \ngreater energy independence, but only if we make major investments now \nin clean energy, like natural gas and electric vehicles and much more \nefficient fleets, and all produced right here in America and with \nAmerican jobs.\n  President Obama's economic recovery plan is a giant step in the right \ndirection. It provides $11 billion for smart grid technology and \nexpanding transmission to renewable rich areas, as well as hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to promote greater use of alternative fuel \nvehicles, including plug-in hybrids and fueling insfrastructure.\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\nThat plan is a massive infusion to help Americans become more energy \nefficient, including $300 million for energy efficient appliance \nrebates.\n  But even if we stopped wasting nearly one-third of the country's \nannual current energy consumption unnecessarily spending trillions of \ndollars and sending billions of tons of pollution up into the air we \nwould still need new supplies of clean energy for sustainable economic \ngrowth.\n  Fortunately, Nevada and other parts of the desert southwest have \nenough solar energy potential to power our country seven times over. If \nthat potential is combined with the wind energy from the Great Plains \nand the hundreds of thousands of megawatts of geothermal energy deep \nbeneath the earth, the whole country could have cost-free fuel for many \ngenerations to come.\n  Innovators and entrepreneurs in every state have already begun to \nharness this power. But the field is in its infancy and it will only \nmature with significant and sustained support and attention at the \nFederal level.\n  But we must also focus our attention and investments on planning and \nsiting new electricity transmission and breaking down barriers to a \ntruly national approach. Otherwise, the vast clean renewable power in \nthe sun, wind and geothermal resources of Nevada, off the country's \ncoasts in the oceans, in the biomass on our lands, forests and in our \ncities, and in the remote and rural areas of the country, will never \nget to consumers.\n  Our transmission system and its regulations have been built up over \nmany decades with the main target of assuring reliability and \navailability. Yet the grid is still fragile and not well equipped to \nmeet the demands of this century's smart technologies or our \nenvironmental or national security challenges.\n  These issues were the topic of focused discussion last week at a \ngenuinely important event a National Clean Energy Summit hosted by the \nCenter for American Progress, CAP. This followed up on a similar \ngathering that I hosted in Las Vegas last August with John Podesta and \nthe CAP Action Fund and the University of Nevada Las Vegas.\n  Last week's event was no ordinary meeting. It was admirably moderated \nby former Senator Tim Wirth and included President William Jefferson \nClinton, Vice President Al Gore, Energy Secretary Steven Chu, Interior \nSecretary Ken Salazar, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Jeff \nBingaman, Representative Ed Markey, energy executive T. Boone Pickens, \nand leaders from government, business, labor, and the non-profit \ncommunities.\n  In particular, I would like to note the very constructive \nparticipation of the country's State regulatory commissions and \nauthorities, ably represented by Fred Butler of New Jersey, President \nof the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. They \nhave extremely difficult jobs maintaining reliability, keeping costs \ndown, and being held responsible for the utilities' every move.\n  The outcome of our discussion was clear--reforming our energy \npolicies to build a cleaner, greener national transmission system--an \nelectric superhighway--must be a top national priority. However, \nequally clear was the sense that it will not be easy and will require \neveryone to work together with common purpose and through a strong \npublic-private partnership to be effective in addressing our grave \nnational challenges.\n  The need for reform is very clear. That is why I am introducing a \nbill today that charts a course to a cleaner, greener, and smarter \nnational energy transmission system without sacrificing reliability or \naffordability. This will ensure a more secure and sustainable energy \nfuture for America.\n  Though this bill is loosely based on my legislation from the last \nCongress, this new and broader version is the product of input and a \nshared vision from many important stakeholders. In particular, the \nCenter for American Progress and the Energy Future Coalition must be \ncongratulated for their hard work and leadership in this complicated \npolicy area. They have helped make it understandable to many in \nWashington, D.C.\n  But no one can beat T. Boone Pickens in explaining to the American \npeople how critically important it is to transform the nation's \nelectricity grid to accelerate the use of renewable energy. He is a \nsource of immense renewable energy and really helping to drive this \nissue home.\n  My legislation will require the President to designate renewable \nenergy zones with significant clean energy generating potential. Then, \na massive planning effort will begin in all the interconnection areas \nof the country to maximize the use of that renewable potential by \nbuilding new transmission capacity. The states would propose cost \nallocation means to fund the new lines in the green transmission grid \nplans. If either process falters, then the federal government would be \ngiven clear authority to keep things moving and get the new \ntransmission built on schedule and funded equitably.\n  This bill is not perfect and has ample room for improvement. But as \nthe bill works its way through the legislative process, I am hopeful \nthat people will come together in good faith and propose revisions that \nwill help solve the problems that we tried to identify at the Summit. \nThere has already been a great deal of non-partisan, thoughtful work \nthat Congress can draw upon in legislating and I look forward to the \nhearing that Chairman Bingaman has scheduled on this topic for next \nweek.\n  Here are just a few of the organizations that provided valuable input \nin the drafting process for this bill: The Energy Future Coalition; the \nCenter for American Progress; the Pickens Plan; Energy Foundation; \nSierra Club; Natural Resources Defense Council; National Wildlife \nFederation; Audubon Society; The Wilderness Society; Bonneville Power \nAdministration; Western Area Power Administration; Tennessee Valley \nAuthority; Bureau of Land Management; Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission; Department of Energy; North American Electric Reliability \nCorporation; National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners; \nCalifornia PUC; Working Group for Investment in Reliable and Economic \nElectric Systems; Florida Power & Light; Midwest Independent System \nOperator; PJM Interconnection; ITC Transmission; Trans-Elect \nTransmission; Pacific Gas & Electric; American Electric Power; American \nPublic Power Association; Large Public Power Council; Salt River \nProject; National Rural Electric Cooperative Association; Solar Energy \nIndustries Association; Bright Source Energy; RES-Americas; American \nWind Energy Association; Iberdrola Renewables; Colorado River Energy \nDistributors Association; Electric Power Supply Association; National \nElectrical Manufacturers Association; and many more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsupport material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 539\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Renewable Energy and \n     Economic Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) electricity produced from renewable resources--\n       (A) helps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other \n     air pollutants;\n       (B) enhances national energy security;\n       (C) conserves water and finite resources; and\n       (D) provides substantial economic benefits, including job \n     creation and technology development;\n       (2) the potential exists for a far greater percentage of \n     electricity generation in the United States to be achieved \n     through the use of renewable resources, as compared to the \n     percentage of electricity generation using renewable \n     resources in existence as of the date of enactment of this \n     Act;\n       (3) the President has set out a goal that at least 25 \n     percent of the electricity used in the United States by 2025 \n     come from renewable sources;\n       (4) many of the best potential renewable energy resources \n     are located in rural areas far from population centers;\n       (5) the lack of adequate electric transmission capacity is \n     a primary obstacle to the development of electric generation \n     facilities fueled by renewable energy resources;\n       (6) the economies of many rural areas would substantially \n     benefit from the increased development of water-efficient \n     electric generation facilities fueled by renewable energy \n     resources;\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\n       (7) more efficient use of existing transmission capacity, \n     better integration of resources, and greater investments in \n     distributed renewable generation and off-grid solutions may \n     increase the availability of transmission and distribution \n     capacity for adding renewable resources and help keep \n     ratepayer costs low;\n       (8) the Federal Government has not adequately supported or \n     implemented an integrated approach to accelerating the \n     development, commercialization, and deployment of renewable \n     energy technologies, renewable electricity generation, and \n     transmission to bring renewable energy to market, including \n     through enhancing distributed renewable generation or through \n     vehicle and transportation sector use;\n       (9) it is in the national interest for the Federal \n     Government to implement policies that would enhance the \n     quantity of electric transmission capacity available to take \n     full advantage of the renewable energy resources available to \n     generate electricity, and to more fully integrate renewable \n     energy into the energy policies of the United States, and to \n     address the tremendous national security and global warming \n     challenges of the United States; and\n       (10) existing transmission planning processes are \n     fragmented across many jurisdictions, which results in \n     difficult coordination between jurisdictions, delays in \n     implementation of plans, and complex negotiations on sharing \n     of costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Renewable Energy Zones: This bill directs the \n     President to designate renewable energy zones, which are \n     areas that can generate in excess of 1 gigawatt of \n     electricity from renewable energy, include rural areas or \n     Federal land, and have insufficient transmission capacity to \n     achieve their renewable energy generation potential. This \n     bill excludes environmentally sensitive and culturally \n     significant areas from renewable energy zones.\n       Electricity from renewable energy is defined to include \n     solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, biogas, incremental \n     hydroelectric capacity and hydrokinetic resources.\n       Some areas, especially the Western U.S., already have \n     processes in place to identify renewable energy zones. \n     Recognizing the ongoing efforts in the Western U.S., this \n     bill allows the President to use zones designated through \n     existing processes, and sets deadlines on designating \n     renewable energy zones for the Western Interconnection of 90 \n     days after enactment of the bill and 270 days after enactment \n     of the bill for the Eastern Interconnection.\n       Sec. 403. Interconnection-Wide Green Transmission Grid \n     Planning: Transmission planning today is a geographically \n     fragmented, lengthy process that does not address the types \n     of projects needed to integrate renewable energy into the \n     transmission grid. The U.S. electric transmission network is \n     divided into three interconnections, the West, the East, and \n     Texas. This bill requires participatory and transparent \n     transmission planning on an interconnection-wide basis for \n     green transmission projects to integrate renewable \n     electricity resources from renewable energy zones into the \n     transmission grid. The objective of the planning process is \n     to enhance transmission access for electricity from renewable \n     energy in renewable energy zones, while recognizing national \n     economic, reliability, and security goals. The planning \n     process established in this bill must be based on established \n     and projected Federal and State renewable energy policies and \n     targets. This bill requires the planning process to solicit \n     input from all stakeholders, including transmission owners, \n     regional transmission organizations, independent system \n     operators, State commissions, electricity generators, \n     prospective developers of new transmission and generation \n     resources, regional reliability organizations, and \n     environmental protection and land, water, and wildlife \n     conservation groups.\n       This bill requires the plan to consider alternatives to new \n     transmission, including\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\n     energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, \n     and cost-effective energy storage.\n       To expedite building transmission to meet the President's \n     renewable energy goal, this bill requires the \n     interconnection-wide green transmission plans to be submitted \n     to the Commission within 1 year of the deadline for \n     designation of renewable energy zones.\n       If a regional planning entity does not organize a planning \n     process, or does not complete a plan by the deadlines \n     established by FERC, this bill gives FERC backstop planning \n     authority to establish a planning process and conduct \n     planning, in consultation with DOE, federal power marketing \n     authorities, the electric reliability organization and \n     regional reliability organizations. This bill also gives FERC \n     backstop planning authority for any state that does not \n     participate in an interconnection-wide planning process.\n       To cover costs of regional planning entities and states \n     participating in interconnection-wide planning, this bill \n     establishes a surcharge on all transmission customers. The \n     funds from the surcharge will be distributed to regional \n     planning entities and to states whose governors certify that \n     they are participating in green transmission planning for the \n     first year, and subject to timely submission of a green \n     transmission grid plan in subsequent years. State Governors \n     are also required to demonstrate that planning entities are \n     able to effectively represent a wide spectrum of \n     stakeholders, including the protection and conservation of \n     land, consumer protection, and fish and wildlife protection.\n       Sec. 404. Federal Siting of Green Transmission Grid Project \n     Facilities: Transmission line siting is currently conducted \n     through a separate process in each state, which can cause \n     lengthy delays for multi-state transmission lines. This bill \n     allows transmission project developers to apply to FERC for \n     federal backstop siting for green transmission projects that \n     are part of the green transmission grid plan and integrate \n     renewable energy resources from renewable energy zones, or \n     for transmission projects that FERC determines are needed to \n     integrate renewable generation resources. For states that \n     participate in interconnection-wide planning, this bill \n     requires FERC to consider state recommendations in siting the \n     line, and to work with states to resolve differences. This \n     bill gives FERC the authority to issue a construction permit, \n     including the right of eminent domain, for green transmission \n     projects that meet specific conditions, including a minimum \n     renewable requirement, optimizing transmission capacity, and \n     providing transmission access to states the project passes \n     through. To coordinate the process of siting transmission on \n     Federal lands, this bill sets FERC as the lead agency for \n     environmental reviews, with a single environmental review \n     document, and directs affected agencies to develop a \n     memorandum of understanding, including a schedule for \n     environmental review and a budget necessary to carry out the \n     schedule.\n       This bill ensures that green transmission projects are \n     truly green by requiring transmission line siting to consider \n     and use alternative routes where possible to avoid \n     environmentally sensitive or culturally significant areas. In \n     addition, this bill requires transmission projects that use \n     federal siting authority to ensure that at least 75% of the \n     capacity of transmission project is available to renewable \n     generation, or the maximum possible amount of renewable \n     generation that can be reliably interconnected. In addition, \n     to ensure that renewable generation resources have access to \n     transmission, transmission providers for green transmission \n     projects that use federal siting must give priority to load-\n     serving entities contracting with renewable generators, or to \n     renewable generation developers, when offering firm \n     transmission rights.\n       As a condition for federal siting, each transmission \n     project developer must demonstrate that it has sufficient \n     capacity to connect multiple renewable generation resources \n     in the renewable energy zone(s) to which it connects, based \n     on reliability criteria, land use limitations, economic \n     considerations and the potential generation capacity of the \n     renewable energy zones interconnected to the project. This \n     will allow future renewable generators to connect to the \n     transmission system without building multiple transmission \n     lines through an area.\n       Large transmission lines may pass through states without \n     providing any benefit to the state. This bill requires green \n     transmission projects that use federal siting authority to \n     provide transmission access to load or generation in each \n     state they pass through. If a project cannot provide \n     interconnection to a state, that state will be eligible for \n     additional funds through DOE grants.\n       Sec. 405. Grants for green transmission grid project plans: \n     This bill authorizes the DOE, in consultation with FERC, to \n     make grants to states and planning entities to implement the \n     planning and siting described in this bill, for transmission \n     improvements including smart grid investments, for training \n     for state public utility commission staff, for mitigation of \n     landowner concerns, for habitat and wildlife conservation, \n     for security upgrades to the transmission system, for energy \n     storage, for reliability projects, transmission business \n     development, and for distributed generation projects. These \n     grants are funded through the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009, and in the future through sale of \n     carbon allowances if a carbon allowance system is \n     implemented. These grants are available only to states that \n     participate in green transmission grid planning and implement \n     green transmission grid projects in a timely fashion.\n       Sec. 406. Cost Allocation: This bill encourages the States \n     and participants in a green transmission plan to agree on and \n     propose a cost allocation to FERC. If no cost allocation is \n     filed, this bill allows FERC to determine a just and \n     reasonable cost allocation that takes account of the widely \n     distributed impacts of the transmission project. This bill \n     allows FERC to allocate costs to all users, owners, and \n     operators of the bulk power system in a region of an \n     interconnection or throughout an interconnection.\n       This bill provides that costs of a green transmission \n     project initially built with extra transmission capacity to \n     multiple renewable generators can initially be allocated with \n     the cost allocation. As new generation projects interconnect, \n     they will pay their share of the transmission grid project, \n     reducing the effect on rates of the transmission provider's \n     customers.\n       Sec. 407. Encouraging Clean Energy Development in Renewable \n     Energy Zones: To ensure that transmission projects needed to \n     integrate renewable energy resources get built in a timely \n     manner, this bill allows federal transmitting utilities to \n     construct projects if no privately-funded entity commits to \n     financing them within 3 years. This bill extends bonding \n     authority of federal transmitting utilities to finance \n     construction of transmission.\n       Sec. 408. Federal power marketing agencies: This bill \n     directs federal power marketing agencies to promote renewable \n     energy and energy efficiency, by developing wind, solar and \n     geothermal integration programs, and directs the federal \n     transmitting utilities to undertake renewable electricity and \n     energy security projects.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to liability under State and local requirements respecting \ndevices; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy once \nagain in the introduction of this important legislation. The bill that \nwe introduce today will correct the Supreme Court's decision in Riegel \nv. Medtronic, which misconstrued the intent of Congress and cut off \naccess to our Nation's courts for citizens injured or killed by \ndefective medical devices.\n  Last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a series of hearings \nto examine the way in which the Supreme Court's decisions in the areas \nof retirement benefits, consumer product safety, workplace \ndiscrimination, and personal finance have consistently trended against \nthe rights of consumers and in favor of big business. In many cases \nthat have profound effects on the lives of ordinary Americans, the \nCourt has either ignored the intent of Congress, deferred to corporate \ninterests, or sided with a Federal agency's flawed interpretation of a \ncongressional statute's preemptive force to disadvantage consumers. The \nimpact of the decisions that were the focus of those hearings continues \nto be felt by Americans today, whether they are prohibited from seeking \nredress in the courts for an injury caused by a defective product, \npaying exorbitant credit card interest rates and fees with no relief \nfrom the laws of their own State, or subjected to the unscrupulous \npractices of some in the mortgage lending industry.\n  These hearings raised awareness in Congress, and among Americans, \nabout the impact the Supreme Court has on our everyday lives. And I am \nespecially proud that following on these hearings,\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\nand through the efforts of a determined and principled congressional \nmajority, we witnessed our constitutional democracy at work when \nPresident Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I am heartened \nthat Congress reclaimed the intent of its original legislation and \noverrode the Supreme Court to restore the rights of Americans to be \nfree from discrimination in the workplace.\n  Just yesterday in the case of Wyeth v. Levine the Supreme Court \nforeclosed the need for Congress to act in another important area when \nit validated the views of many by rejecting the Bush administration and \nthe Food and Drug Administration's extravagant views of a regulatory \nagency's ability to pre-empt State law. I am glad the Court spoke \nclearly and decisively on this issue. The Court's decision was not only \na vindication of Congress's primary authority to pre-empt State law, \nbut a victory for every American who relies upon pharmaceutical drugs \nand entrusts the manufacturers of those drugs with insuring their \nsafety. The Court's decision also vindicated the laws and courts of the \nState of Vermont, and I am proud to have expressed my views to the \nCourt as to Congress's intent in this area and on behalf of Diana \nLevine.\n  The bill we introduce today is another important step to correct an \nerroneous reading by the Court of Congress's intent in enacting the \nmedical device amendments of 1976. This legislation will make explicit \nthat the preemption clause in the medical device amendments upon which \nthe Court relied does not, and never was intended to preempt the common \nlaw claims of consumers injured by a federally approved medical device.\n  The extraordinary power to preempt State law and regulation lies with \nCongress alone. Where the Court reaches to the extent it did in the \nRiegel decision to find Federal preemption contrary to what Congress \nintended, Congress is compelled to act, just as it was in the case of \nLilly Ledbetter. I hope all Senators will join us in this effort.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nreintroducing the Medical Device Safety Act. This legislation reverses \nthe Supreme Court's erroneous decision in Riegel v. Medtronic. There, \nthe Court misread a statute designed to protect consumers by giving the \nFood and Drug Administration, FDA, the authority to approve medical \ndevices as preempting State tort claims when a medical device causes \nharm. Riegel prevents consumers from receiving fair compensation for \ninjuries sustained, medical expenses incurred and lost wages, and it \nmust be reversed.\n  Congressional action should be unnecessary. When Congress passed the \nMedical Device Amendments, or MDA, in 1976, it did so ``[t]o provide \nfor the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human \nuse.'' In other words, Congress passed the MDA precisely to protect \nconsumers from dangerous medical devices. Towards that end, Congress \ngave the FDA the authority to approve, prior to a product entering the \nmarket, certain medical devices. For over 30 years the MDA has been in \neffect, and over that period FDA regulation and tort liability have \ncomplimented each other in protecting consumers.\n  Given the MDA's purpose, and the fact it has operated successfully \nfor 30 years, I was disheartened to find the Court twist the meaning of \nthe statute to strip from consumers all remedies when a medical device \nfails. In contorted logic, the Court found that the FDA's requirements \nin approving a medical device preempted State laws designed to ensure \nthat manufacturers marketed safe devices. In other words, the Court \nbelieves that a company's responsibility to its patients ends when it \nreceives FDA approval. I strenuously disagree.\n  In fact, there is absolutely no evidence that Congress intended that \nunder the MDA consumers would lose their only avenue for receiving \ncompensation for injuries caused by negligent or inadequately labeled \ndevices. Not a single Member or committee report articulated the view \nthat the statute would preempt State tort law.\n  Nevertheless, because of the Court's decision, it is imperative that \nCongress act to ensure that those harmed by flawed medical devices can \nseek compensation. The bill introduced today addresses the Court's \naction by explicitly stating that actions for damages under State law \nare preserved. Specifically, it amends section 521 of the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act to state that the section shall not be construed \nto modify or otherwise affect any action for damages or the liability \nof any person under the law of any State. And the bill applies \nretroactively to the date of the enactment of the MDA, consistent with \nCongress's intent when it passed that act over 30 years ago. \nPractically, that means that it applies to cases pending on the date of \nenactment of this legislation or claims for injuries sustained prior to \nenactment.\n  The harm from Riegel, unless Congress acts, cannot be more real. In \nthe year since Riegel was decided alone, courts across the country have \ndismissed product liability claims. Take Charles Riegel. During an \nangioplasty, a catheter burst and caused him serious injuries and \ndisabilities, and a State jury found Medtronic negligent. Because of \nthe Supreme Court's decision, however, Mr. Riegel's wife will receive \nno compensation for the defective design and inadequate warning. Take \nGary Despain. A defective hearing aid caused severe damage to his right \near, and he became disabled and unemployed. Because of the Supreme \nCourt's decision, Mr. Despain has no ability to see remedies for his \ninjuries.\n  Recently, a court dismissed the claims of almost 1,500 patients who \nbrought suit arising from Medtronic's Sprint Fidelis defibrillator--\nspecific models of thin wires that connect an implantable cardiac-\ndefibrillator directly to the heart. In October 2007, the product was \nrecalled after lead fractured in several cases and was thought to \ncontribute to deaths and serious injuries. Again, because of the \nCourt's ruling, injured plaintiffs have no recourse against the company \nthat caused the harm.\n  While FDA approval of medical devices, moreover, is important, it \ncannot be the sole protection for consumers. FDA approval is simply \ninadequate to replace the longstanding safety incentives and consumer \nprotections State tort law provides.\n  As a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension \nCommittee, which has oversight over FDA, I have worked hard to ensure \nthat the FDA performs its job. No matter how effective the FDA is, \nhowever, the FDA simply cannot guarantee that no defective, dangerous, \nand deadly medical device will reach consumers. As the former Director \nof the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health acknowledged, \nthe FDA's ``system of approving devices isn't perfect, and that \nunexpected problems [with approved devices] do arise.'' In 1993, a \nHouse report identified a ``number of cases in which the FDA [had] \napproved devices that proved unsafe in use.''\n  The fact is, the FDA conducts the approval process with minimal \nresources and simply does not have adequate funds to genuinely ensure \nthat devices are safe or to properly and effectively reevaluate \napprovals as new information is available.\n  Further, the FDA approval process is based on partial information. A \nprincipal shortcoming is that the device's manufacturer compiles the \nstudies and data supporting an application, and the data is often \nunreliable. And the FDA does not conduct independent investigations \ninto a device's safety. A manufacturer, moreover, is not required to \nsubmit information about development of the device, including \nalternative designs, manufacturing methods, and labeling possibilities \nthat the manufacturer considered but rejected.\n  In 1993, an FDA committee found flaws in the design, conduct, and \nanalysis of the clinical studies used to support applications that were \n``sufficiently serious to impede the agency's ability to make the \nnecessary judgments about [device] safety and effectiveness.'' It \nadded, ``[o]ne of the main reasons [problems arise after approval] is \nthat the data upon which we base our safety and effectiveness decisions \nisn't perfect.'' Likewise, in 1996, the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services reported ``serious deficiencies \n. . . in the clinical data submitted as part of pre-market \napplications.''\n  Moreover, there is very little FDA oversight once a device reaches \ndoctors\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\nand patients. In fact, even the best designed and most reliable \nclinical studies by their very nature cannot duplicate all aspects and \nhazards of everyday use. Moreover, while manufacturers are supposed to \nreport defects and injuries, the FDA has admitted that there is \n``severe underreporting'' of defects and injuries.\n  Given the FDA's limitations, it is crucial that an individual have a \nright to seek redress. When defective medical devices reach the market, \nwhether or not approved by the FDA, patients are often injured. Those \ninjured are often left temporarily unable to work or to enjoy normal \nlives, and in many cases never fully recover. State tort law provides \nthe only relief for patients injured by defective medical devices and \nshould not be foreclosed.\n  Not only does access to State court mean that a person injured can \nreceive fair compensation, but there are other advantages. Such suits \naid in exposing dangers and serve as a catalyst to address their \nconsequences. Through discovery, litigation can help uncover previously \nunavailable information on adverse effects of products that might not \nhave been caught during the regulatory system. Litigants can demand \ndocuments and information on product risks that might not have been \nshared with the FDA. In this way, the public as a whole is alerted to \ndangers in medical products.\n  Finally, providing the ability to sue when injured provides an \nimportant incentive to manufacturers to use the utmost care. \nAdditionally, threat of product liability suits creates continuing \nincentives for product manufacturers to improve the safety of their \ndevice, even after FDA approval.\n  As the Supreme Court recognized this week, in Wyeth v. Levine, in \nholding that failure to warn claims involving FDA approved drugs are \nnot preempted, ``[s]tate tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and \nprovide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks \npromptly. They also serve a distinct compensatory function that may \nmotivate injured persons to come forward with information.'' The Court \ncontinued, ``the FDA has long maintained that state law offers an \nadditional, and important, layer of consumer protection that \ncomplements FDA regulation.''\n  The same consumer protection that State courts provide which the \nCourt recognized as important in the context of faulty drug warnings is \nequally important for those consumers harmed by faulty medical devices.\n  In conclusion, sadly the Court fundamentally misread Congress's \nintent in passing the Medical Device Amendments in 1976, and Reigel \nappears to represent yet another victory by big business over \nconsumers. That is not, however, the final say on the matter. To quote \nChief Justice Roberts, ``every area involving an interpretation of a \nstatute, the final say is not with the Supreme Court, the final say is \nwith Congress. And if they don't like the Supreme Court's \ninterpretation of it, they can change it.''\n  Make no mistake, moreover, it can be done. Last year, Congress passed \nand the President signed the ADA Amendments Act, reversing decisions in \nwhich the Court consistently misconstrued the will of Congress and held \nthat the ADA does not protect many people with serious disabilities \nfrom discrimination. This year, we were successful in reversing the \nCourt's draconian Lilly Ledbetter decision, making clear that those \ndiscriminated against do have a recourse in law.\n  Those injured by faulty medical devices deserve to have their day in \ncourt and are entitled to compensation when they are injured by faulty \nmedical devices, have medical expenses to pay and lost wages, \nregardless of whether the FDA approved a device. We must reverse this \nerroneous decision and ensure that those who have suffered serious \ninjury at the hands of others receive justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Corker, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 541. A bill to increase the borrowing authority of the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have been approached, along with my \ncolleague Senator Shelby and leaders of the House Financial Services \nCommittee, by the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, Sheila Bair, with a request to increase substantially the \nFDIC's borrowing authority from Treasury from the current $30 billion \nto $100 billion, for use by the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund and for \ntemporary additional borrowing authority to help weather the economic \ncrisis. In response to her request, I am introducing the Depositor \nProtection Act of 2009, which provides this authority. We are taking \nthis step out of an abundance of caution and to meet any contingencies \nthat the fund may face in the coming months.\n  The FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund DIF absorbs losses that result from \nthe corporation's obligation to protect insured deposits when FDIC-\ninsured financial institutions fail. Insured financial institutions pay \npremiums that support the DIF and under current law those premiums can \nbe increased to cover any losses to the fund.\n  Today, the House passed legislation to substantially and permanently \nincrease this borrowing authority as part of H.R. 1106, the Helping \nFamilies Save Their Homes Act of 2009. Last month, Treasury Secretary \nGeithner and Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve Board wrote to me \nto underscore their support for the FDIC's increased borrowing \nauthority.\n  Since the FDIC's borrowing authority was last increased in 1991, the \nasset size of banks has tripled. Even more important, the financial \nsystem is under considerable stress, and the level of thrift and bank \nfailures has been rising. This line of credit is designed strictly to \nserve as a backstop to cover potential losses to the DIF.\n  Though this statutory borrowing authority has historically never been \ntapped, and Chairman Bair has made clear she does not anticipate doing \nso, I agree with Chairman Bair, Secretary Geithner, and Chairman \nBernanke that under current economic circumstances such an increase in \nborrowing authority is both prudent and necessary. It is important that \nwe increase this line of borrowing authority so that the FDIC has the \nfunds available which might be needed to meet its obligations to \nprotect insured depositors and to reassure the public that the \nGovernment continues to stand firmly behind the FDIC's insurance \nguarantee.\n  Additionally, on Friday, February 27, the FDIC Board voted to impose \na one-time special assessment of 20 basis points on insured depository \ninstitutions because of concern about the level of the DIF. This \nspecial assessment is in addition to the regular premiums, which were \nincreased on February 27 to a range of 12 to 16 basis points. The DIF \nis significantly below the statutory minimum reserve ratio of 1.15. As \nof December 31, 2008, the DIF ratio stood at .4. The FDIC has informed \nus that with the increased borrowing authority provided in this \nlegislation, it believes it can reduce the size of the special \nassessment while still maintaining appropriate assessments at a level \nthat supports the DIF with funding from the banking industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 541\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The Depositor Protection Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASED BORROWING AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT \n                   INSURANCE CORPORATION.\n\n       Section 14(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1824(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``$30,000,000,000'' and inserting \n     ``$100,000,000,000'';\n       (2) by striking ``The Corporation is authorized'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--The Corporation is authorized'';\n       (3) by striking ``There are hereby'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Funding.--There are hereby''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Temporary increases authorized.--\n       ``(A) Recommendations for increase.--During the period \n     beginning on the date of enactment of this paragraph and \n     ending on December 31, 2010, if, upon the written \n     recommendation of the Board of Directors (upon a vote of not \n     less than two-thirds of the members of the Board of \n     Directors) and\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (upon a \n     vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of such \n     Board), the Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with \n     the President) determines that additional amounts above the \n     $100,000,000,000 amount specified in paragraph (1) are \n     necessary, such amount shall be increased to the amount so \n     determined to be necessary, not to exceed $500,000,000,000.\n       ``(B) Report required.--If the borrowing authority of the \n     Corporation is increased above $100,000,000,000 pursuant to \n     subparagraph (A), the Corporation shall promptly submit a \n     report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services \n     of the House of Representatives describing the reasons and \n     need for the additional borrowing authority and its intended \n     uses.''.\n                                  ____\n\n         Federal Deposit\n\n\n                                        Insurance Corporation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2009.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       1Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my support for \n     the Depositor Protection Act of 2009, legislation to increase \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's borrowing \n     authority with the Treasury Department if losses from failed \n     financial institutions exceed the industry funded resources \n     of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF).\n       As you know, the FDIC's borrowing authority was set in 1991 \n     at $30 billion and has not been raised since that date. \n     Assets in the banking industry have tripled since 1991, from \n     $4.5 trillion to $13.6 trillion. As I indicated in my \n     previous letter of January 26, 2009, the FDIC believes it is \n     prudent to adjust the statutory line of credit \n     proportionately to leave no doubt that the FDIC can \n     immediately access the necessary resources to resolve failing \n     banks and provide timely protection to insured depositors.\n       The legislation would include important additional \n     authority for the FDIC and would rationalize the FDIC's \n     current borrowing authority. Under current law, the FDIC has \n     the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from Treasury to \n     cover losses incurred in insuring deposits up to $100,000. In \n     addition, when Congress temporarily increased deposit \n     insurance coverage to $250,000, it temporarily lifted all \n     limits on the FDIC's borrowing authority to implement the new \n     deposit insurance obligation.\n       The bill would permanently increase the FDIC's authority to \n     borrow from Treasury from $30 billion to $100 billion. In \n     addition the bill also would temporarily authorize an \n     increase in that borrowing authority above $100 billion (but \n     not to exceed $500 billion) based on a process that would \n     require the concurrence of the FDIC, the Federal Reserve \n     Board, and the Treasury Department, in consultation with the \n     President.\n       Because the existing borrowing authority for losses from \n     bank failures provides a thin margin of error, it was \n     necessary for the FDIC recently to impose increased \n     assessments on the banking industry. These assessments will \n     have a significant impact on insured financial institutions, \n     particularly during a financial crisis and recession when \n     banks must be a critical source of credit to the economy.\n       The size of the special assessment reflected the FDIC's \n     responsibility to maintain adequate resources to cover \n     unforeseen losses. Increased borrowing authority, however, \n     would give the FDIC flexibility to reduce the size of the \n     recent special assessment, while still maintaining \n     assessments at a level that supports the DIF with industry \n     funding. While the industry would still pay assessments to \n     the DIF to cover projected losses and rebuild the Fund over \n     time, a lower special assessment would mitigate the impact on \n     banks at a time when they need to serve their communities and \n     revitalize the economy.\n       In conclusion, the Depositor Protection Act would leave no \n     doubt that the FDIC will have the resources necessary to \n     address future contingencies and seamlessly fulfill the \n     government's commitment to protect insured depositors against \n     loss. I strongly support this legislation and look forward to \n     working with you to enact it into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila C. Bair,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Board of Governors of the\n\n\n                                       Federal Reserve System,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to join the Secretary of \n     the Treasury in expressing my agreement that the authority of \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to borrow \n     from the Treasury Department should be increased to $100 \n     billion from its current level of $30 billion. While the FDIC \n     has substantial resources in the Deposit Insurance Fund, the \n     line of credit with the Treasury Department provides an \n     important back-stop to the fund and has not been adjusted \n     since 1991. An increase in the line of credit is a reasonable \n     and prudent step to ensure that the FDIC can effectively meet \n     potential future obligations during periods such as the \n     difficult and uncertain economic climate that we are \n     currently experiencing.\n       I also support legislation that would allow the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, in consultation with the Chairman of the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System if Congress \n     believes that to be appropriate, to increase the FDIC's line \n     of credit with the Treasury in exigent circumstances. This \n     mechanism would allow the FDIC to respond expeditiously to \n     emergency situations that may involve substantial risk to the \n     financial system.\n       The Federal Reserve would be happy to work with your staff \n     on this matter, as well as on the other amendments under \n     consideration that would allow the FDIC more flexibility in \n     the timing and scope of assessments that it charges to \n     recover costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund in the event that \n     the systemic risk exception in the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act has been invoked.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ben S. Bernanke,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my support for \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) current \n     request to increase its permanent statutory borrowing \n     authority under its line of credit with the Treasury \n     Department from $30 billion to $100 billion. Since the last \n     increase in that authority in 1991, the banking industry's \n     assets have tripled. More importantly, the financial and \n     credit markets continue to be under acute stress, and the \n     level of thrift and bank failures has been rising. Although \n     the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund remains substantial at $35 \n     billion, and the FDIC has never needed to tap the existing \n     line of credit with the Treasury Department in the past, the \n     proposed increase in the limit is a reasonable and prudent \n     step to ensure that the FDIC can effectively meet any \n     potential future. obligations.\n       The Treasury Department also supports the FDIC's request to \n     make future adjustments to the line of credit based on \n     exigent circumstances, but recommends that such future \n     adjustments require the concurrence of both the Secretary of \n     the Treasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of \n     the Federal Reserve System. This future adjustment mechanism \n     would provide an additional layer of protection for insured \n     depositors and enhance the confidence of financial markets \n     during this turbulent period.\n       The Treasury Department also supports the FDIC having \n     authority to determine the time period for recovering any \n     loss to the insurance fund resulting from actions taken after \n     a systemic risk determination by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n       I hope that you find our views useful in the Committee's \n     consideration of the FDIC's request. Thank you for the \n     opportunity to share these views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Timothy F. Geithner,\n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2849-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2849-S2850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 65--HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF FORT MCCOY IN \n                           SPARTA, WISCONSIN\n\n  Mr. KOHL submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, today I honor the 100 year legacy of Fort \nMcCoy and the men and women who have worked and trained at the fort.\n  On June 8th, 1909, the United States Army began training on a tract \nof land that would eventually become Fort McCoy. Named for Major \nGeneral Robert McCoy, the fort has embodied his commitment to military \nservice for 100 years. Providing training to more than 100,000 reserve \nand active duty soldiers per year, Fort McCoy is the only facility \nfocused on supporting total force training. As a pioneer for field \nartillery and maneuver training, the fort has developed into one of the \nlargest and most modern artillery camps in the nation. Fort McCoy has \nsupported and trained our troops through every major military action of \nthe twentieth and twenty-first centuries and has truly remained an \nunwavering presence for the United States Armed Services.\n  I am proud to recognize the 100 year anniversary of Fort McCoy and \nthe enduring commitment that its troops have given to the United States \nof America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2850-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 66--DESIGNATING 2009 AS THE ``YEAR OF THE \n       NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER CORPS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY''\n\n  Mr. BOND submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Res. 67\n\n       Whereas participants in the school breakfast program \n     established by section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1773) include public, private, elementary, middle, \n     and high schools, as well as schools in rural, suburban, and \n     urban areas;\n       Whereas access to nutrition programs such as the school \n     lunch program, established under the Richard B. Russell \n     National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) and the \n     national school breakfast program helps to create a stronger \n     learning environment for children and improves children's \n     concentration in the classroom;\n       Whereas missing breakfast and the resulting hunger has been \n     shown to harm the ability of children to learn and to hinder \n     academic performance;\n       Whereas students who eat a complete breakfast have been \n     shown to make fewer mistakes and to work faster in math \n     exercises than those who eat a partial breakfast;\n       Whereas implementing or improving classroom breakfast \n     programs has been shown to increase breakfast consumption \n     among eligible students dramatically, doubling, and in some \n     cases, tripling numbers of participants in school breakfast \n     programs, as evidenced by research in Minnesota, New York, \n     and Wisconsin;\n       Whereas providing breakfast in the classroom has been shown \n     in several instances to improve attentiveness and academic \n     performance, while reducing absences, tardiness, and \n     disciplinary referrals;\n       Whereas studies suggest that eating breakfast closer to the \n     time students arrive in the classroom and take tests improves \n     the students' performance on standardized tests;\n       Whereas studies show that students who skip breakfast are \n     more likely to have difficulty distinguishing among similar \n     images, show increased errors, and have slower memory recall;\n       Whereas children who live in families that experience \n     hunger are likely to have lower math scores, receive more \n     special education services, and face an increased likelihood \n     of repeating a grade;\n       Whereas making breakfast widely available in different \n     venues or in a combination of venues, such as by providing \n     breakfast in the classroom, in the hallways outside \n     classrooms, or to students as they exit their school buses, \n     has been shown to lessen the stigma of receiving free or \n     reduced-price school breakfasts, which stigma sometimes \n     prevents eligible students from obtaining traditional \n     breakfast in the cafeteria;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 2008, 8,520,000 students in the \n     United States consumed free or reduced-price school \n     breakfasts provided under the national school breakfast \n     program;\n       Whereas less than half of the low-income students who \n     participate in the national school lunch program also \n     participate in the national school breakfast program;\n       Whereas at least 16,000 schools that participate in the \n     national school lunch program do not participate in the \n     national school breakfast program;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 2008, 60 percent of school lunches \n     served, and 80 percent of school breakfasts served, were \n     served to students who qualified for free or reduced-priced \n     meals;\n       Whereas the current economic situation, including the \n     increase of nearly 3 percent in the national unemployment \n     rate in 2008, is causing more families to struggle to feed \n     their children and to turn to schools for assistance;\n       Whereas studies suggest that children who eat breakfast \n     take in more nutrients, such as calcium, fiber, protein, and \n     vitamins A, E, D, and B-6;\n       Whereas studies show that children who participate in \n     school breakfast programs eat more fruits, drink more milk, \n     and consume less saturated fat than those who do not eat \n     breakfast;\n       Whereas children who do not eat breakfast, either in school \n     or at home, are more likely to be overweight than children \n     who eat a healthful breakfast on a daily basis;

and\n       (6) recognizes that National School Breakfast Week helps \n     draw attention to the need for, and success of, the national \n     school breakfast program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2850-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2850-S2851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 665.

Res. 67\n\n       Whereas participants in the school breakfast program \n     established by section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1773) include public, private, elementary, middle, \n     and high schools, as well as schools in rural, suburban, and \n     urban areas;\n       Whereas access to nutrition programs such as the school \n     lunch program, established under the Richard B. Russell \n     National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) and the \n     national school breakfast program helps to create a stronger \n     learning environment for children and improves children's \n     concentration in the classroom;\n       Whereas missing breakfast and the resulting hunger has been \n     shown to harm the ability of children to learn and to hinder \n     academic performance;\n       Whereas students who eat a complete breakfast have been \n     shown to make fewer mistakes and to work faster in math \n     exercises than those who eat a partial breakfast;\n       Whereas implementing or improving classroom breakfast \n     programs has been shown to increase breakfast consumption \n     among eligible students dramatically, doubling, and in some \n     cases, tripling numbers of participants in school breakfast \n     programs, as evidenced by research in Minnesota, New York, \n     and Wisconsin;\n       Whereas providing breakfast in the classroom has been shown \n     in several instances to improve attentiveness and academic \n     performance, while reducing absences, tardiness, and \n     disciplinary referrals;\n       Whereas studies suggest that eating breakfast closer to the \n     time students arrive in the classroom and take tests improves \n     the students' performance on standardized tests;\n       Whereas studies show that students who skip breakfast are \n     more likely to have difficulty distinguishing among similar \n     images, show increased errors, and have slower memory recall;\n       Whereas children who live in families that experience \n     hunger are likely to have lower math scores, receive more \n     special education services, and face an increased likelihood \n     of repeating a grade;\n       Whereas making breakfast widely available in different \n     venues or in a combination of venues, such as by providing \n     breakfast in the classroom, in the hallways outside \n     classrooms, or to students as they exit their school buses, \n     has been shown to lessen the stigma of receiving free or \n     reduced-price school breakfasts, which stigma sometimes \n     prevents eligible students from obtaining traditional \n     breakfast in the cafeteria;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 2008, 8,520,000 students in the \n     United States consumed free or reduced-price school \n     breakfasts provided under the national school breakfast \n     program;\n       Whereas less than half of the low-income students who \n     participate in the national school lunch program also \n     participate in the national school breakfast program;\n       Whereas at least 16,000 schools that participate in the \n     national school lunch program do not participate in the \n     national school breakfast program;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 2008, 60 percent of school lunches \n     served, and 80 percent of school breakfasts served, were \n     served to students who qualified for free or reduced-priced \n     meals;\n       Whereas the current economic situation, including the \n     increase of nearly 3 percent in the national unemployment \n     rate in 2008, is causing more families to struggle to feed \n     their children and to turn to schools for assistance;\n       Whereas studies suggest that children who eat breakfast \n     take in more nutrients, such as calcium, fiber, protein, and \n     vitamins A, E, D, and B-6;\n       Whereas studies show that children who participate in \n     school breakfast programs eat more fruits, drink more milk, \n     and consume less saturated fat than those who do not eat \n     breakfast;\n       Whereas children who do not eat breakfast, either in school \n     or at home, are more likely to be overweight than children \n     who eat a healthful breakfast on a daily basis; and\n       Whereas March 2 through March 6, 2009 is National School \n     Breakfast Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of the school breakfast \n     program established under section 4 of the Child Nutrition \n     Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) and the positive impact of the \n     program on the lives of low-income children and families and \n     on children's overall classroom performance;\n       (2) expresses strong support for States that have \n     successfully implemented school breakfast programs in order \n     to alleviate hunger and improve the test scores and grades of \n     participating students;\n       (3) encourages all States to strengthen their school \n     breakfast programs, provide incentives for the expansion of \n     school breakfast programs, and promote improvements in the \n     nutritional quality of breakfasts served;\n       (4) recognizes the need to provide States with resources to \n     improve the availability of adequate and nutritious \n     breakfasts;\n       (5) recognizes the impact of nonprofit and community \n     organizations that work to increase awareness of, and access \n     to, breakfast programs for low-income children; and\n       (6) recognizes that National School Breakfast Week helps \n     draw attention to the need for, and success of, the national \n     school breakfast program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/05/senate-section/article/S2853-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--H.R. 44\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.
