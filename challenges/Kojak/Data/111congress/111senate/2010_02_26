Mr. President, when the great-great granddaughter of \nU.S. Chief Justice John Marshall established a safe place for \nLouisville's troubled and indigent children in 1910, few perhaps could \nhave imagined the impact her actions would make a century later. Yet as \nThe Cabbage Patch Settlement House celebrates its centennial year, the \ncontributions of its alumni to our community and Nation will stand as \nLouise Marshall's legacy for another 100 years.\n  Named after the 1901 best-selling novel, ``Mrs. Wiggs and the Cabbage \nPatch,'' which was written by fellow Louisvillian Alice Hegan Rice, The \nPatch now serves 1,100 children and their families through a variety of \neducation and counseling programs. Included among its alumni are: an \nNFL Super Bowl coach, public officials and community leaders, military \nofficers, teachers, coaches, firefighters, and police officers. \nThousands of alumni credit their involvement with The Cabbage Patch as \na critical factor in their development of strong values and strong \nfaith.\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal recently recounted the impact this \ninstitution has had on my home city, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, \n                             Feb. 15, 2010]\n\n               The Cabbage Patch: A Beacon for 100 Years\n\n                          (By Larry Muhammad)\n\n       Sherman Lewis won Super Bowl rings coaching for the San \n     Francisco 49ers and Green Bay Packers, was a college football \n     All-American at Michigan State University and finished third \n     in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy in 1963.\n       The duPont Manual High School graduate partly credits his \n     career success to the character-building sportsmanship he \n     learned as a teenager at Cabbage Patch Settlement House, \n     which is celebrating its 100th anniversary.\n       ``My first year there, in the ninth grade, I even won a \n     turkey trot,'' said Lewis, most\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\n     recently an offensive consultant for the Washington Redskins. \n     ``They had a big turkey in a crate, and you had to run to get \n     it, but I won that race going away. I had never run that fast \n     in my life, but we had a lot of mouths to feed in our family \n     and nobody was going to catch me.\n       ``And Cabbage Patch was the first time I ever played on an \n     integrated team,'' he said. ``They had great coaches there, \n     great role models, and I think that's part of the reason I \n     went into coaching. I owe that place a lot.''\n       Founded in 1910 to help troubled and indigent children, the \n     nonprofit Christian agency now serves 1,100 children and \n     their families through recreation, education and counseling \n     programs. It recently launched a yearlong birthday observance \n     that includes an alumni reunion (date and place yet to be \n     announced).\n       ``We are having a series of birthday parties with some of \n     our partner churches this spring,'' said Cabbage Patch \n     spokeswoman Angela Hagan. ``We had one at Highland \n     Presbyterian Jan. 10. We will be at Southeast Christian Feb. \n     21, and several others are scheduled. Our golf fundraiser at \n     Valhalla (Golf Club) on July 12 will have a 1910 twist--think \n     attire, for one example--and our auction event Sept. 23 at \n     the Muhammad Ali Center will be a big birthday party. On \n     Sept. 25 we celebrate in our own neighborhood (1413 S. Sixth \n     St., Old Louisville) as a beneficiary of the St. James Art \n     Show Gala.''\n       A function of the art show's philanthropic arm, the St. \n     James Court Charitable Foundation, the gala previously has \n     benefited Kosair Charities and the Louisville Orchestra.\n       ``This year, we decided to do the Cabbage Patch,'' said Don \n     Keeling, the Louisville businessman and president of the St. \n     James Court Association who, as a youth, played after-school \n     sports there. ``They raised a substantial amount of money for \n     their renovation, but they still have more to go so we're \n     going to help them retire some of that debt.''\n       The centennial year of The Patch, as it has become known \n     over the years, happily coincides with completion of the \n     $7.5-million structural upgrade to its Sixth Street \n     facilities, including a renovated gymnasium, kitchen and \n     classrooms, plus 19,000 square feet of new construction \n     adding a glass breezeway between buildings and a two-story \n     carriage house.\n       Also, starting Friday, Blue Sky Kentucky, the nonprofit \n     group promoting appreciation of American roots music, is \n     launching an education component that ties into ongoing music \n     instruction at The Patch. ``Our objective is to bring the art \n     and business end of music directly to the kids,'' said Greg \n     Handy, a Blue Sky Kentucky founder. ``Once a month, artists \n     will come give a brief performance, talk to the kids about \n     what it means to be a professional, working musician, and how \n     they got where they are now. We've developed a syllabus that \n     covers the art of songwriting and also the business of \n     music.''\n       Formerly an 8th Ward alderman who grew up in Old \n     Louisville, Handy remembers hanging out at The Patch, he \n     says, ``probably starting at 8 or 9 years old until the time \n     I got my driver's license. I would meet friends there after \n     school, and actually played a little softball for them. Our \n     family was a lot more fortunate than others in the \n     neighborhood. And The Patch was a place where children could \n     go, be safe and learn life's lessons--just a great place.''\n       For as long as anyone can remember, Cabbage Patch \n     Settlement House has been a beacon of hope to inner-city kids \n     and their families.\n       During the 1937 flood, when the Ohio River submerged 70 \n     percent of Louisville and forced 175,000 people from their \n     homes, The Patch, which was situated on the edge of an \n     irregularly shaped dry area, became a refuge for dislocated \n     residents and a clearinghouse for food, clothes and other \n     necessities. It underwent a major program expansion after \n     World War II, adding a game room, various athletic programs, \n     adult activities, and dances. During the 1950s it began one \n     of Louisville's first private desegregation initiatives that \n     by 1963 encompassed the entire operation.\n       During its early years, founder Louise Marshall often \n     scoured the surrounding neighborhood for troubled and less \n     fortunate children, promoting the value of education and \n     inviting them to the Patch. Although from a well-to-do \n     family--her great-great grandfather was U.S. Chief Justice \n     John Marshall--Marshall as a young woman taught a \n     neighborhood Bible school class, felt compelled to help the \n     poor and was influenced by the success of places like \n     Chicago's Hull House to help the less fortunate. She based \n     Cabbage Patch's founding principles on the biblical \n     injunction for charity in the Book of Matthew: ``For I was \n     hungry and you gave me something to eat: I was thirsty and \n     you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger and you \n     invited me in; I was naked and you clothed me.''\n       The agency was named for a neighborhood running along \n     tracks of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, inhabited by \n     L workers and truck gardeners growing cabbages--thus the \n     Cabbage Patch. The area was immortalized in a sentimental \n     best-selling 1901 novel, ``Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch,'' \n     by Louisville writer Alice Hegan Rice.\n       Today, it has the legacy of Marshall, who died in 1981, and \n     the example of dedication set by the late Roosevelt Chin, \n     longtime family services director, whose ashes are buried at \n     center court in the renovated gym named in his honor.\n       It has programs like the vegetable-growing and cooking \n     initiative From Seed to Table, begun by Kathy Cary, chef/\n     owner of Lilly's Bistro. It consistently turns out winning \n     produce at the Kentucky State Fair, taking second place last \n     year for Roma tomatoes, cabbage and corn, and 10 first-place \n     ribbons in 2000, including best hot pepper collection.\n       It has volunteers extraordinaire such as Lea Fischbach, who \n     in 2007 received the President's Volunteer Service Award from \n     President George W. Bush for her 11 years and more than 4,000 \n     hours of charity work.\n       ``Those who participated in our programs tell the story of \n     our mission,'' the agency's executive director, the Rev. \n     Tracy Holladay, said in a statement. ``When we celebrate 100 \n     years of service, we're celebrating the hope and potential of \n     all those who have come through our doors, past and present, \n     and those who will come in the next 100 years.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/26/senate-section/article/S818-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last night a number of Senators stayed on \nthe floor until almost midnight--I thank the staff and pages for their \nendurance and patience.\n  This was over an issue that was critically important to our Nation. \nIt is an issue which relates to this recession we are in and the fact \nthat literally millions of Americans in every State across America are \nout of work and doing their very best to find jobs. It is not easy. \nThere are as many as four unemployed workers for every available job. \nPeople are taking jobs that pay substantially less than what they are \nused to earning in the hopes of keeping their family together and \nweathering this economic storm.\n  Some of the sacrifices that are being made will literally change \nlives and families forever. People are losing their homes because of \nthe loss of jobs. Folks are finding their kids have to drop out of \ncollege and come home because the families can no longer help them \nafford to pay for tuition and the expense of higher education. So many \nfamilies in desperate straits are turning to the food banks in cities \nacross America. As I visit these food banks, they tell me there is a \ndramatic increase in the number of people who come in looking for the \nbasic food they need to put on the table to keep their families \ntogether.\n  Some of these families have lost their health insurance. It is one of \nthe first casualties of losing a job. Unless you have lived as a father \nof a sick child without health insurance, you cannot imagine what goes \nthrough his mind in that circumstance. It happened to me when I was \nfirst married and did not have health insurance. I had a sick baby. My \nwife and I just prayed we could find the care she needed when we did \nnot have health insurance to cover it.\n  For millions of Americans, that is not only a threat, it is a \nreality. When you look at this hardship many Americans are facing, \nthrough no fault of their own and despite their heroic efforts to put \ntheir lives back on track, I believe it is unthinkable, unforgivable \nthat we would cut off unemployment insurance payments to these people; \nthat we would cut off COBRA payments which help them to pay for their \nhealth insurance while they are unemployed.\n  Yet that is what is going to happen Sunday night. It is because the \nSenator from Kentucky has objected to extending unemployment insurance \npayments and COBRA health insurance payments for 30 days. In my State, \nthere are 15,000 people who do not realize this morning but will come \nto realize Monday morning that their lives have dramatically changed. \nThey are not only out of work and they are struggling to survive, but \nthat one lifeline, that unemployment check that keeps them together, \nthat provides $250 a week so they can get on with life and try to turn \nthe corner, is going to disappear.\n  You say: Well, why? What is it that has brought us to the point where \nwe\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\nas a nation would cut off help for our own people? The Senator from \nKentucky explained last night it is because he wants to balance the \nbudget. He wants to cut the deficit. He is concerned about the debt.\n  Well, I share his concerns. What was said last night by so many \nMembers on this side of the aisle, which is, for goodness' sake, find a \nway to express your political views that is not at the expense of \nhelpless people.\n  That is why so many Members stayed here until almost midnight talking \nabout it. Senator Stabenow from Michigan, what a terrible economic \nsituation in her State. One out of six people in her State is on food \nstamps. They have had high unemployment for the longest time because of \nthe loss of manufacturing jobs and other employment opportunities.\n  It is an awful situation, repeated in Rhode Island, where they have \none of the highest unemployment rates in the Nation. They were the \nfirst in the recession and are struggling to get through it. It is a \nsmall State in comparison to Illinois or Michigan. But when Senator \nJack Reed and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse came to the floor, they talked \nabout hundreds of people in their State who will be cut off from \nunemployment checks as of Sunday night because of the objection of one \nSenator who says we have to learn our lesson about deficits.\n  The simple fact is, this is an emergency situation and should be \ntreated as such. If the floodwaters were rising in Kentucky or Illinois \nand people were displaced from their homes, desperate to survive, we \nwould not sit down and do a calculation about whether to send them \nemergency aid, we would do it because we are a nation that cares and a \nnation that responds and we believe helpless victims deserve a helping \nhand. These are helpless victims of the recession, and their helping \nhand is an unemployment check that will be cut off Sunday night because \nof the objection of one Senator.\n  Some came to the floor last night--Senator Corker of Tennessee, whom \nI respect--and said: I do not think you ought to be doing this. I do \nnot think this is the way the Senate should work, that we should come \nand renew the unanimous consent request to extend unemployment for 30 \ndays.\n  I would say to Senator Corker, whom I respect, and Senator Bunning, \nwhom I respect very much: We were caught by surprise last night. We \ncould not believe we would actually have the Senate go home to our home \nStates, to the loving arms of our families, to a relaxing weekend, and \nknow that, Sunday night, unemployment checks were going to be cut off \nacross America for hundreds of thousands of people.\n  That came as a surprise to me last night. That is why we gathered on \nthe floor and talked about the economy and this issue. We talked about \nthe deficit, and we pointed out to the Senator from Kentucky that he \nhas voted for tax cuts that were not paid for, obviously that added to \nthe Nation's deficit. He has voted for programs not paid for that added \nto the Nation's deficit.\n  Yet now he has decided to make his stand, not when it comes to tax \ncuts for the wealthy but unemployment benefits for the poorest \nstruggling families in America. It is a stark contrast. Last night, we \nbegged him to save this debt debate for a different day and a different \nissue and please do not victimize these helpless people who are \nstruggling to get by. We were not successful in that effort.\n  I do not know if the Senator has had a change of heart today. I hope \nhe has. I am going to renew my unanimous consent request that I made \nlast night. I hope we can agree to go forward. I certainly would say to \nthe Senator from Kentucky, we have ample opportunity in the days ahead \nto debate this deficit and debt, in the budget resolution, in our \nappropriations process, in virtually every bill that comes before us.\n  Why did he pick the unemployed families of America, falling behind, \nlosing their homes, struggling to survive, to make his political point \nabout debt and deficit?\n  One of the Senators said: Oh, in a week or so we will probably send \nthose benefits along. I guess that is true. I hope it is true. We may \neat up 3 or 4 days on the floor of the Senate to get it done, instead \nof instantly doing it this morning, as we can in the process.\n  In my State, the State of Virginia, the State of Kentucky, there will \nbe unemployed people who will not receive their checks and will go \nthrough the anxiety of wondering what happened in Washington that \ncaused them to lose that check they needed so desperately to keep their \nhome, to care for their kids, and to try to turn their lives around and \nget another job.\n  That, to me, is an unacceptable approach to governing. It is one I \nhope we do not do in the future. It is the reason we stayed so late \nlast night to speak to this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4691, a 30-day extension of the \nprovisions which expire on Sunday, February 28: unemployment insurance, \nCOBRA, flood insurance, Satellite Home Viewer Act, highway funding, SBA \nbusiness loans, and small business provisions of the American Recovery \nAct, SGR, and poverty guidelines, received from the House and at the \ndesk; that the bill be read three times, passed and the motion to \nreconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. First of all, let me say this, that I believe the \nSenator from Illinois is correct that everybody in this Chamber wants \nto extend unemployment benefits, COBRA health care benefits, flood \ninsurance, the highway bill assistance, medical doc fix, small business \nloans, and rural satellite television for our viewers who cannot get \ncable.\n  I will not object if the Senator from Illinois amends his unanimous \nconsent request to adopt my amendment or any amendment that pays for \nthe bill--we had a pay-go vote last week, and the Senate voted to pay \nfor all the bills that come through--or I will not continue my \nreservation, I will not object if the Senator from Illinois would spend \nthe $10 billion it costs to renew these extenders for 30 days.\n  For example, we could do an across-the-board rescission of the \nbloated Omnibus appropriations bill that was passed for this fiscal \nyear, which increased appropriations by 10 percent. That is just one, \nbesides my pay-for, which you have objected to. If we cannot find $10 \nbillion somewhere for a bill that everybody in this body supports, we \nwill never pay for anything.\n  I continue my objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senator from \nKentucky made the same request. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, \nsaid to the Senator from Kentucky: I will give you a chance to come to \nthe floor with your paid-for amendment, fully debate it, and put it up \nfor a vote.\n  If you can convince a majority of the Senate to do that, you will \nprevail.\n  If you can't, then we will treat this as we have so often, as \nemergency spending, and proceed to help these unemployed people. The \nSenator from Kentucky rejected that and said he did not want to bring \nthis matter to the floor for a vote because he might lose. I think it \nis possible he might lose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If he has a way to pay for this and wants to offer it as \nan amendment on the floor, we have given him the opportunity to do \nthat. But for him to say he wants to dictate how this is going to be \npaid for from sources that, frankly, many of us believe are not \nrealistic in any way whatsoever--he wanted to take the money from the \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act that has already been committed to \nconstruction projects and to tax cuts across America; he wants to take \nthat money and reduce tax cuts for working families--I would vote \nagainst that. I think that is very shortsighted and would hurt the \neconomy rather than help it. If he wants to make across-the-board cuts \nin appropriations bills, he ought to have an opportunity to offer\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\nthat amendment, and he has had that opportunity. But he doesn't choose \nto do that. He wants to be guaranteed he will win. There are no \nguarantees you can win.\n  There is a guarantee, because of his objection, that hundreds of \nthousands of unemployed Americans will lose. Come Sunday night, they \nwill have their checks cut off. To be told people have a beating heart \nand care about unemployed people and to cut off their unemployment \nchecks just doesn't track. I don't think it is any comfort to these \nfamilies to believe you care, but you are going to cut off their checks \nanyway. What point are we making--how hard we can be, how tough we can \nbe? At what expense? The most vulnerable families in America are going \nto suffer because of this political decision by one Senator. I think \nthat is unfortunate. I am sorry he has objected.\n  I promised I would not renew the request this morning, but we will be \nback. We will try to get this done. I say those families, hang in \nthere. After the politicians are finished with speeches and debates, \nAmerica will not give up on you. It is going to be tough for a while, \nwhile we work out this political difference, but, unfortunately, that \nreflects the Senate and where it is today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4691; that the amendment \nat the desk, which offers a full offset, be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid on the table.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BUNNING. We have tried to work this out with the majority, \nparticularly after the pay-go vote last week. When 100 Senators are for \na bill and we can't find $10 billion to pay for it, there is something \nthe matter, seriously the matter with this body. I said that last \nnight. I don't wish to repeat myself. I have offered several ways to \npay for it. If everybody in this Chamber--and there are no Senators \nexcept me here right now, but there are 100 Members of this body--\nbelieves, as the Senator from Illinois does, that this is essential and \nwe should pass it, then we should pay for it. There are going to be \nother bills brought to the floor that are not going to be paid for, and \nI am going to object every time they do it. I don't much agree with the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, but it was striking yesterday when he \nsaid if the present level of debt and the present administration's \nbudget is passed, the debt of the United States will be unsustainable. \n``Unsustainable'' to me means there is a chance of one of the rating \nagencies downgrading the rating on our debt. We cannot allow that to \nhappen. I have too many young grandchildren who want America to be the \nsame America I grew up in. I am worried to death that will not be the \ncase.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we talk a lot in the Senate about procedure. \nOur debates sometimes relate only to procedure, and often that is \nappropriate. As we know, sometimes these procedural rules we have in \nthe Senate are complex. But the issue before us today is not something \nthat is arcane, very ritualistic, or very complex. It is very simple. \nIt is clear that it is going to be a lot more noticeable by people \nMonday morning because it is going to affect the lives of thousands of \nAmericans and their livelihoods.\n  The issue before us is this: Our country is in a state of economic \nturmoil. Lots of people are out of work. Lots of people have been out \nof work for a long time. They are trying to make ends meet drawing \nunemployment compensation, which is something we have had in effect in \nthis country for a long time. By Monday morning, tens of thousands of \nNevadans and more than a million Americans who rely on unemployment \ninsurance and health benefits will simply lose them.\n  We have traditionally, during times of stress, automatically given \nunemployment benefits, and we should do that. These people are getting \npoorer every day. They are out of work for long periods of time. \nUnemployment is rampant in every single State in the country, some \nworse than others. So many of those unemployed have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  Those opposed to helping people who are down and out, at a time of \ntheir greatest need, should not have to talk about process. If you \ncan't afford to feed your kids, process doesn't mean a thing. If you \ncan't make your car payment, it doesn't mean one thing to talk about \nprocess. If you can't make your house payment, if you can't go to the \ndrugstore and buy a prescription that needs to be filled, process \ndoesn't matter.\n  If we do not act, these benefits will expire, but the need to buy \ngroceries, medicine, make a car payment or house payment does not \nexpire. Those benefits will expire but the need to heat their homes--it \nis wintertime--or put gas in their cars doesn't expire. They do not \ncare about the procedure or process. Those benefits will expire. I \nrepeat, the need to take their medicine does not or the need to take \ncare of an aging parent or to take care of their children does not \nexpire. They don't care a thing about process.\n  The catch here is that these benefits do not need to expire. We have \nthe ability right now to extend them for just a\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\nshort time until we work out a longer term solution. We are going to \nstart working on that on Monday. It is irresponsible and basically it \nis immoral.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was not on the floor after the vote last \nnight, but I did get a chance to read some of the transcript of the \nback-and-forth between Senator Bunning and Senator Durbin and others. I \nunderstand that Senator Durbin retained the floor for the most part and \nyielded for questions, but basically the procedure denied Senator \nBunning and Senator Corker, who I know also weighed in, an opportunity \nto explain precisely what was going on.\n  I have seen some news reports this morning that have suggested that \nbecause of the objection to more deficit spending in order to pay for \nthis temporary extension of benefits--that this was an unreasonable \nthing to do, to actually insist that Congress pay for benefits it is \nproviding.\n  I would like to put it in a little bit of context. I think if there \nare two things that are causing the lack of approval of the American \npeople of Congress these days it boils down to two things. One is a \nlack of fiscal discipline, and the second is a complete lack of \ncredibility whatsoever when it comes to fiscal matters.\n  Let me give one example. Pay-go, the so-called pay-as-you-go \nrequirement that was passed about 2 weeks ago, in the jobs bill that \nwas passed earlier this week, $15 billion, the Senate voted to waive \nthose pay-as-you-go rules that it passed 2 weeks ago and the President \nsigned into law with great fanfare.\n  But the problem goes further than that. It is not just the Senate \nbeing unwilling to live by the very law that it passed 2 weeks earlier \nand was signed by the President. It is the illusion of fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Let me tell you what I mean by that. For example, within the pay-go \nrequirement itself, I think most Americans would be surprised to learn \nthat discretionary spending, which is about a third of the Federal \nbudget, is exempted completely. In other words, the senior Senator from \nNew Hampshire frequently calls this the Swiss cheese pay-go because it \nis so full of holes, it is not what it would otherwise appear to be, \nand you can see why, if it exempts discretionary spending. Nor does \npay-go apply to current entitlement spending--baseline. For example, \nmany of us talked about the $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities for \nMedicare itself which is not fixed, which was actually made worse by \nthe health care proposals which have been made by the President most \nrecently and which passed the Senate on Christmas Eve. The pay-go rules \ndon't even apply to current entitlement spending. So under the rules \nthat give the illusion of fiscal responsibility but not the reality, \nentitlement spending can continue to grow 6 percent annually.\n  Suffice it to say as well that the problem the majority leader just \ngot through talking about, which is the inability to pass these \nbenefits because they are not paid for, is really a product of his own \ncreation. You recall a couple of weeks ago Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley were working on a large jobs bill, which was a bipartisan \nbill, which was rejected in its entirety by the majority leader in \nfavor of a partisan bill. He did not allow any amendments, did not \nallow any other suggestions. That was the very jobs bill that was \npassed by waiving the pay-go requirement.\n  All the Senator from Kentucky has asked for is that we do what every \nAmerican family has to do and what every small business has to do; that \nis, be honest in our accounting of the public's money and to not \ncontinue a sham, which is to pretend as if we are being fiscally \nresponsible when, in fact, we are not--by waiving the requirements, by \ncreating the perception or patina of fiscal responsibility with these \npay-go rules but which are so fraught with exceptions that they really \ndo not mean what they are sometimes represented to be.\n\n  We know there is broad bipartisan support for the legislation that is \npending before this body. All the Senator from Kentucky has asked for \nis that it be paid for, that we not add $10 billion more to the Federal \ndeficit. That is on top of the roughly $1.6 trillion that already \nexists. That is just the deficit. That is not dealing with the unfunded \nliabilities of the Federal Government.\n  I am advised that there is about $100 billion left in discretionary \nspending from the stimulus bill that was passed the first part of last \nyear--$100 billion. Using those funds, using $10 billion of that to pay \nfor this extension of jobless and other benefits does not seem like an \nunreasonable request at all. It does raise the question, again, of \nwhether Congress is continuing to say one thing and do another.\n  I remember when we talked about the stimulus funds that it was \nadvertised as being targeted, timely, and temporary. We know it was \nnone of those things because now there is still $100 billion left in \ndiscretionary spending here a year later, along with the TARP which is \nused as sort of a revolving charge account by Congress--again, more \ndeficit spending. This has been anything but fiscal responsibility when \nit comes to doing the people's business here in the Congress.\n  If there is one message I hear from my constituents in Texas and \nother people around the country it is this: Stop the spending and be \nresponsible when it comes to these unmet liabilities, whether they be \nannual deficits or when it comes to unfunded Federal liabilities.\n  But while Congress purports to be fiscally responsible on a number of \nfronts, you see small bills such as this benefits extension, not paid \nfor, $10 billion a clip, which continue to add up, and pass the burden \nof paying for that on to our children and grandchildren, because that \nis what they are going to inherit, huge deficits, huge unfunded Federal \nliabilities, that they are going to pay for, not the present \ngeneration. That is not right.\n  I want to say I admire the courage of the junior Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Bunning. It is not fun to be accused of having no \ncompassion for the people who are out of work, the people for whom \nthese benefits should be forthcoming, and I believe will be \nforthcoming.\n  But somebody has to stand up finally and say enough is enough: No \nmore intergenerational theft from our children and grandchildren by not \nmeeting our responsibilities today. That is what I interpret him to \nhave done. If the majority leader and the majority wanted to have this \ntaken care of, they could have had it done in the Baucus-Grassley \nbipartisan bill that the majority leader shelved in favor of his \npartisan jobs bill.\n  I anticipate that next week when we do take up further legislation, \nwe will take care of these requirements that are now being objected to \nbecause of deficit spending. That is appropriate. But I hope, unlike \nthis current proposal, we will do the right thing by the American \npeople and by our children and grandchildren and not borrow or, \nprobably more correctly stated, steal from future generations. We will \nmeet our responsibilities by making sure that any legislation we pass \nis paid for by an offset, unlike the current bill that has been \nobjected to.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

FONTAINE AND THERESA A. GULLO\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Peter H. Fontaine \nand Theresa A. Gullo for 25 years of outstanding service to the \nCongress as staff at the Congressional Budget Office. My colleagues \nunderstand the important work done by CBO, providing Congress with \nhigh-quality, objective, nonpartisan, and timely analyses. The success \nof CBO and the respect it has built up over the years is the result of \nthe hard work and dedication of employees such as Mr. Fontaine and Ms. \nGullo.\n  Mr. Fontaine started at CBO in February 1985 as an analyst for energy \nissues in the Natural and Physical Resources Cost Estimates Unit in the \nBudget Analysis Division. He was promoted to unit chief of the Natural \nand\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\nPhysical Resources Cost Estimates Unit in 1995, to deputy assistant \ndirector for budget analysis in September 1999, and to assistant \ndirector for budget analysis in August 2007, where he oversees the \nstaff who prepare the cost estimates for legislation and baseline \nbudget projections that are so instrumental to the work of Congress.\n  Ms. Gullo gained her first experience working at CBO as a summer \nintern in 1982, before returning in February 1985 as an analyst for \nnatural resources programs in the Natural and Physical Resources Cost \nEstimates Unit in the Budget Analysis Division. In 1995, she became the \nfirst unit chief of the newly established State and Local Government \nCost Estimates Unit, and in September 2007, she was promoted to the \nposition of deputy assistant director for budget analysis.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee, I greatly appreciate the \nsacrifices that Mr. Fontaine and Ms. Gullo--as well as their families--\nmake in assisting the Budget Committees and Congress. This sacrifice \nhas never been truer than over the past year, where CBO has faced an \nunprecedented work load, with the staff working endless nights and \nweekends under extraordinary time pressures on an array of complex \nissues. As assistant director and deputy assistant director for budget \nanalysis, Mr. Fontaine and Ms. Gullo oversee much of that work. I thank \nthem for their dedication and professionalism.\n  The outstanding work being done behind the scenes by public servants \nlike Mr. Fontaine and Ms. Gullo rarely gets the recognition it \ndeserves. But their efforts are critical to the functioning of our \ngovernment. They are providing a tremendous service to Congress and the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Mr. Fontaine and \nMs. Gullo on their 25 years of outstanding service to Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/26/senate-section/article/S822-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTENTION TO OBJECT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, consistent with Senate standing orders and \nmy policy of publishing in the Congressional Record a statement \nwhenever I place a hold on legislation, I am announcing my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request to proceed to legislation \nextending any expiring laws that does not include extension of \nunemployment benefits and COBRA health insurance benefits.\n  Last night, there was an attempt to extend some laws that expire at \nthe end of the month without extending the enhanced unemployment \ninsurance and COBRA health insurance benefits that were enacted as part \nof the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. I objected to that \nattempt.\n  I did so because Oregon currently has one of the highest unemployment \nrates in the Nation with an unemployment rate of 11 percent. Extension \nof unemployment benefits is critical for many unemployed Oregonians who \nare in jeopardy of running out of benefits if they are not extended \nbefore the end of this month. What's worse, many jobless Oregonians and \nunemployed workers in other States lose their health benefits when they \nlose their jobs, leaving them without either income or health care. In \norder to ensure unemployed workers in Oregon and other States will not \nbe left without these critical, lifeline benefits, I am announcing my \nobjection to any unanimous consent to extend other expiring laws, \nunless extension of unemployment benefits and COBRA benefits are \nincluded as part of the legislation.\n  I have no objection to the Senate proceeding to H.R. 4213 to provide \nfor certain extenders because extension of unemployment and COBRA \nbenefits are included as part of that legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/26/senate-section/article/S822-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S822-S823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONFRONTING THE LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a \nbill that I introduced a year ago with Senator Sam Brownback to \nconfront Africa's longest running rebel group, the Lord's Resistance \nArmy. This bill was passed unanimously by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in November and it is now cosponsored by 63 members of this \nChamber, a supermajority. According to the Congressional Research \nService, no bill specifically on sub-Saharan Africa has had this many \ncosponsors since at least 1973, which is as far back as our online \nrecords go. This demonstrates an unprecedented bipartisan consensus to \naddress an issue that was called ``the world's worst neglected crisis'' \njust a few years ago.\n  This historic consensus should not go unnoticed and it must \nultimately translate into action.\n  For two decades, the LRA and its brutal leader Joseph Kony terrorized \nthe people of northern Uganda. They filled their ranks by abducting \nchildren--some estimates suggest over 66,000 of them--and forced them \nto fight as child soldiers. Meanwhile, the people of northern Uganda \nwere forced into displacement camps with little protection from their \nown government, where they were vulnerable to attacks, disease and \nstarvation. In 2007, I visited those camps and saw first hand the \nterrible conditions people were forced to endure.\n  In recent years, the LRA have been pushed out of northern Uganda and \nfortunately many people have been able to leave those camps. But that \nhas not meant an end to the LRA's terror; it has just shifted to a new \ntheater. Under pressure in 2005 and 2006, the rebels moved into the \nporous border region of northeastern Congo, southern Sudan and the \nCentral African Republic, where they have recently resumed their \nattacks and abductions. According to the United Nations, between \nSeptember 2008 and June 2009, the LRA killed some 1300 civilians, \nabducted 1400 more, and displaced 300,000 others. That level of \nviolence persists today. The stories are jarring: families locked \ninside huts and burned alive; people having their lips and ears cut \noff; people hacked to death with machetes; villages massacred as they \ngathered for church on Christmas Day.\n  This continuing violence is senseless and it is horrific. It shocks \nour collective conscience. That is why Senator Brownback, Senator \nInhofe, and I, along with 60 of our colleagues, leading human rights \ngroups, and thousands of young idealistic Americans have come together \naround this bill. We may not agree on all the specifics of how the \nUnited States should go about addressing this issue and what role our \ngovernment should play, but we all agree the ongoing atrocities \ncommitted by the LRA demand more attention, more resources and a more \nproactive strategy.\n  Our bill would require the Obama administration to develop such a \nstrategy for how the United States will work more actively with \nregional governments, the U.N. and others to bring a lasting end to \nthis war. That strategy would need to integrate all elements of U.S. \npolicy--economic, political, intelligence and military--and coordinate \nour efforts regarding the LRA across the four affected countries. Our \nbill also authorizes a modest amount of additional funding, $40 million \nover 3 years, so we can better support peace and reconciliation in \nnorthern Uganda and help meet the humanitarian needs of communities \noutside Uganda that are currently affected by the LRA's violence.\n  Unfortunately, one Senator has objected to passage of this bill \nbecause of the authorization of funds. Now let me be clear: I share \nconcerns about our record deficits and believe we have a responsibility \nto our children and our grandchildren to control reckless spending. \nThat is why I make a point to include an offset whenever I introduce a \nbill that authorizes funds. This bill was no different. When it was \nintroduced, it included an offset to reduce excess secondary inventory \nfor the Air Force; inventory that the GAO found wasteful and the Air \nForce acknowledged it didn't need. Unfortunately though, some objected \nto this offset and it was removed in committee.\n  Now, I have offered to stipulate that the bill should use already \nauthorized funds, rather than authorizing new funds. Apparently that's \nnot sufficient. While I am disappointed that the offset was removed \nfrom this bill, I do not believe it is sufficient cause to stop this \nbill from moving forward. We should keep in mind that passing this \nlegislation would not automatically trigger increased spending. This \nbill authorizes funds, but appropriating them is a different matter. I \nam more than willing\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\nto work with lead cosponsors of this bill and others, during the \nappropriations process, to ensure this bill does not increase our \noverall budget. In fact, I'd like to work with all of my colleagues in \ngeneral to eliminate wasteful spending.\n  We need to pass this bill. We have a unique opportunity right now as \nmembers of Congress to make a statement that the mass killing of \ninnocent life by the LRA is unacceptable, and that we as a country will \nnot stand by as it continues to happen. By passing this bill, we can \ncharge our government with looking seriously at how we can do more to \nhelp bring these atrocities to an end. When we look back at Rwanda in \nApril of 1994, I think each and every one of us wishes we had done more \nto save lives. The same can be said about the brutal massacres by the \nRUF in Sierra Leone or by Charles Taylor's army in Liberia. But we need \nto not only acknowledge those regrets; we need to learn from them.\n  Mr. President, the LRA's massacres are taking place now. They are on \nour watch. This time, let us not look back and wish we had done more. I \nurge all my colleagues to come together to pass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/26/senate-section/article/S823-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on today, February 26, 2010, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3961.

Res. 426\n\n       Whereas the importance of school social work through the \n     inclusion of school social work programs has been recognized \n     in the current authorizations of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) and the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 \n     et seq.);\n       Whereas school social workers serve as vital members of a \n     school educational team, playing a central role in creating a \n     positive school climate and vital partnerships between the \n     home, school, and community to ensure student academic \n     success;\n       Whereas school social workers are especially skilled in \n     providing services to students who face serious challenges to \n     school success, including poverty, disability, \n     discrimination, abuse, addiction, bullying, divorce of \n     parents, loss of a loved one, and other barriers to learning;\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\n       Whereas there is a growing need for local educational \n     agencies to offer the mental health services that school \n     social workers provide when working with families, teachers, \n     principals, community agencies, and other entities to address \n     emotional, physical, and environmental needs of students so \n     that students may achieve behavioral and academic success;\n       Whereas, to achieve the goal of the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) of helping all children \n     reach their optimal levels of potential and achievement, \n     including children with serious emotional disturbances, \n     schools must work to remove the emotional, behavioral, and \n     academic barriers that interfere with student success in \n     school;\n       Whereas fewer than 1 in 5 of the 17,500,000 children in \n     need of mental health services actually receive these \n     services, and research indicates that school mental health \n     programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, \n     decreasing discipline referrals, and improving academic \n     achievement;\n       Whereas school mental health programs are critical to early \n     identification of mental health problems and in the provision \n     of appropriate services when needed;\n       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school \n     social workers recommended by the School Social Work \n     Association of America is 400 to 1; and\n       Whereas the celebration of ``School Social Work Week'' \n     highlights the vital role school social workers play in the \n     lives of students in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of February 28 through March 1, \n     2010, as ``School Social Work Week'';\n       (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of school \n     social workers to the success of students in schools across \n     the Nation; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``School Social Work Week'' with the appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities that promote awareness of the vital role of \n     school social workers, in schools and in the community as a \n     whole, in helping students prepare for their futures as \n     productive citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/26/senate-section/article/S824-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDER FOR THE RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.
