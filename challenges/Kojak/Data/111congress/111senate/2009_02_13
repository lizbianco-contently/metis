Mr. President, I object to the 10-minute time restraint. \nThis is a very difficult issue. We are talking about hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of stimulus. I hope my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle would understand that more than 10 minutes may be required \nfor some statements.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, this is a very important \nmatter, and complex, and we are not going to limit the Senator from \nArizona. We would like to have rough parity in terms of the time given \nto both sides of the aisle to explain this matter, but we are not going \nto limit or even try to limit, under the standing rules, any speech by \nthe other side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend. I ask we keep track of the timing on \nboth sides as both sides talk so we can try to make sure there is \nparity on timing throughout the day. Obviously, it will be dictated by \nthe number of speakers who want to speak on either side, but we should \ntry to preserve parity throughout the day.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to Senator McCain, I am sorry to interrupt him \nagain. Could we enter a consent to that effect, that we will divide the \ntime?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would agree with the Senator from Illinois, but I think \nit is pretty clear there are going to be more speakers on this side \nthan that side. I would like to have our leader, the Republican leader, \nagree to that before I could.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am informed by the Senate staff that it is already part \nof the agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will pass a $789 billion bill, $1.1 \ntrillion with interest added in--and we do, when we calculate the costs \nof these appropriations bills, count in the interest. It is the so-\ncalled stimulus bill, and it is under the guise of a bipartisan \ncompromise.\n  Let me reiterate what I have so often stated during the past 2 weeks: \nThe Nation needs a stimulus bill. The Nation expects the Congress and \nthe President to act in a truly bipartisan manner to address this \ncrisis. But, unfortunately, this measure is not bipartisan. It contains \nmuch that is not stimulative and is nothing short--nothing short--of \ngenerational theft.\n  At times of great challenge, history tells us our Nation will work \ncollectively to remedy the problems we face. Working on this measure \ntogether was that opportunity. Republicans offered a good-faith \nalternative to the measure that is before us. Our alternative provided \nthe American taxpayers with a stimulus bill devoid of porkbarrel \nprojects and excessive spending programs that fail to create jobs.\n  Our bill was not simply to advocate policies we could not otherwise \npass; our bill, in fact, was a real stimulus proposal. Instead, \npartisan legislation was pushed through.\n  Sadly, when we could be uniting to assist hurting Americans, we have \nexacerbated our differences and burdened our children and grandchildren \nwith a debt the proportions of which have never been seen before.\n  Mr. President, before I go too much further, the bill is 1,071 pages. \nWe got it last night, I believe, at 10:20 p.m. That was the first \nmoment a copy was made available. It was not numbered correctly. At 11 \np.m. we received notification it had just become available on the House \nWeb site.\n  Compare the process that we have been through with the Web site that \nis from the Obama campaign. The Web site of the Obama campaign stated, \nand I will quote in a second--this is a quote from the Obama Web site:\n\n       End the practice of writing legislation behind closed \n     doors. As President, Barack Obama will restore the American \n     people's trust in their Government by making Government more \n     open and transparent. Obama will work to reform congressional \n     rules to require all legislative sessions, including \n     committee markups and conference committees, to be conducted \n     in public.\n\n  What happened in the last few days--law and sausages--it is certainly \na long way from the Obama Web site that said:\n\n       Reform congressional rules to require all legislative \n     sessions, including committee markups and conference \n     committees, to be conducted in public.\n\n  All day yesterday the media made different reports about the process \nthat was going on, in which, by the way, there was no Republican \nleadership anywhere in the vicinity.\n  I recognize this will be greeted as a victory for the administration \nand the Democrats today. I recognize that, and it is a victory. But I \nam not sure it is the right kind of victory. I think words which will \nhaunt us for a long period of time were uttered by the Speaker of the \nHouse: ``We won, we write the bill.'' ``We won, we write the bill.''\n  I think on both sides of the last campaign there was a commitment not \nto use those words: ``We won, we write the bill.'' That commitment was \nto sit town together in a bipartisan fashion and work together to come \nup with solutions to the enormous domestic and foreign policy and \nnational security challenges we face. I understand who won. I think I \nunderstand it about as well as anybody in this body. I have often said \nelections have consequences. This is one of the consequences of my side \nof the aisle losing. But it was not the promise that was made to the \nAmerican people.\n  I understand the other side of the aisle--and many in the media--will \nsay: Well, Republicans are recalcitrant. Republicans are trying to \nblock it. Republicans don't want anything.\n  We had a provision, we had a proposal of over $420 billion. We had a \nproposal that got 44 votes for a trigger that, once our economy begins \nto recover and is in recovery, the spending stops. One thing that \nMilton Friedman said, among many others I have always appreciated, was: \nNothing is so permanent as a temporary Government program. There is \nnothing more permanent than a temporary Government spending program. So \nI think we had an opportunity and, hopefully, there will be \nopportunities in the future, to sit down, Republican and Democrat \ntogether--and at the beginning, not the end. If you are not in on the \ntakeoff, then you are certainly not going to be in on the landing.\n  This bill took off with the Speaker of the House saying: We won, we \nwrite the bill. That was repeated on several occasions by the President \nof the United States.\n  Now, I want to say again, my side of the aisle, for 8 years, did not \ninclude the other side of the aisle. We were guilty. We were guilty of \nnot observing the rights and privileges of the minority party. I do not \nexcuse it, nor do I rationalize it. But I do believe that some Members \ndid work in a bipartisan fashion and that times are different. The \ntimes are different. The American people spoke.\n  So yesterday, not the Republican leadership, not the majority of my \ncolleagues sat by while the bill was finally written, and that is why \nthe final legislation here will have three Republican votes, probably, \nout of all of the Republicans in the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. It may pick up a couple in the House. But to call this \nbipartisan is clearly an inaccurate and false description of the \nlegislation that will pass sometime this evening.\n  So we passed up an opportunity. I hope we will, in the future, since \nthere will be TARP III somewhere--some estimates, $500 billion; some \nestimates, $1 trillion; no one knows. The Secretary of the Treasury \ntestified the day before yesterday before the Senate. He had no idea. \nHe could give us no clue as to how much the next TARP was going to be. \nBut I hope that will then present us with another opportunity to work \ntogether from the beginning, not at the end.\n  Again, this side of the aisle is not blameless on partisanship. But \nthis was an opportunity for all of us to join together.\n  USA Today stated in an editorial: Republican opposition seems more \nlike partisan positioning than a sincere effort to reach compromise \nwith the White House at a time of severe economic distress.\n  I cannot speak for all of my colleagues, but I can, I know, speak for \nthe majority of them. That is a false\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\nstatement. That is a false statement. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Every Senator here wants a reasonable, workable stimulus bill \nthat will help turn our economy around and put people to work. That is \nwhy 40 Republican Senators voted for an alternative that sought to fix \nour housing crisis--remember, it was housing first, and it is housing \nthat is going to restore our economy. The stimulus package has not a \nlot of it to start with and comes out of the ``conference'' with less--\ninvest in our Nation's infrastructure through effective and restrained \nspending; put money immediately back in the hands of all Americans \nthrough a payroll tax holiday; allow businesses to keep more of their \nprofits to hire new employees, invest in capital, or expand their \nbusinesses; finally begin to focus our attention on entitlement \nreforms; and then, most importantly, put a halt to the spending once \nour economy turns around. And the total cost of our alternative \nproposal was about half the cost of this conference report.\n  There are a couple of cautionary tales. One was a study by John \nTaylor of Stanford and the Hoover Institution that showed that the last \ntime we gave Americans a paycheck--and that is one of the big parts of \nthis stimulus package, checks of $400 to $800--it had no effect on the \neconomy. It is also a cautionary tale as to what the Japanese did over \nthe last decade, and I am afraid some of this stimulus package repeats \nthat.\n  We missed an enormous opportunity to rein in excessive spending \ndespite the support of 44 Senators eager to get our fiscal house in \norder when our amendment that would have required unobligated funding \nto be returned to the taxpayer upon two consecutive quarters of \neconomic growth greater than 2 percent of inflation-adjusted GDP was \ndefeated.\n  We have seen time after time stimulus packages at other times when we \nwere in fiscal difficulty, financial difficulty--not to the degree of \nthis one--but much of the spending has taken place after the economy \nrecovered and contributed enormously to the deficit and consequently \nputting burdens on future generations of Americans. Why would we not \nagree that once the economy has recovered, we should proceed on a path \nto a balanced budget and stop some of these spending programs that are \ngoing to be adopted tonight in the way of stimulus? Why wouldn't we \nbring them to a stop? Could it be that some want these spending \nprograms to be permanent?\n  I repeat, Milton Friedman said, ``There is nothing so permanent as a \ntemporary Government program,'' and I am sure we will see many of these \nprograms in the stimulus live a long, long life.\n  In a recent Washington Post op-ed entitled ``$800 billion Mistake,'' \nMartin Feldstein, an economic professor at Harvard University and \npresident emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research, wrote: \nThe fiscal package now before Congress needs to be thoroughly revised. \nIn its current form, it does too little to raise national spending and \nemployment. It would be better for the Senate to delay legislation for \na month or even two if that is what it takes to produce a much better \nbill. We cannot make an $800 billion mistake.\n  Of course, it is a $1.1 trillion mistake. We cannot make that \nmistake. By passing this conference report, we are essentially engaging \nin an act of generational theft. How can anyone ignore the cold hard \nfacts? The current national debt is $10.7 trillion. The 2009 projected \ndeficit is $1.2 trillion. The cost of this stimulus is $1.124 trillion; \nthat is, $789 billion plus interest. The expected omnibus spending bill \nto fund the Federal Government through September 30, 2009, is $400 \nbillion. The expected supplemental request for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan the Armed Forces Committee staff estimates at $80 billion. \nThe appropriations bills for 2010 that we will consider this year are \nuntold billions. Tarp I and II are $700 billion, and TARP III is \npossibly upwards of $1.5 trillion. These numbers are staggering. These \nnumbers are staggering. We have never dealt with numbers such as this, \nnot in the Great Depression, not in any other era in time of our \ncountry. Every dollar of spending in this conference report will be \nadded to our national debt, which now stands, as I said, at $10.2 \ntrillion or 70 percent of GDP.\n  According to the Center for Data Analysis, if Congress borrows the \nfunds for its economic stimulus package--which, of course, it will do--\ntotal debt could grow to $13 trillion in fiscal year 2009 or 92 percent \nof our gross domestic product. By 2010, the total debt could grow to \n$14 trillion or 95 percent of our GDP. The center further finds that \nthe stimulus package will add about $30,000 in new Federal debt per \nAmerican household.\n  Remarkably, while we are on the brink of saddling our children and \ngrandchildren and great grandchildren with this enormous debt load, the \nconference report before us does little to actually address the core \nissue that brought us to the point of needing a stimulus bill in the \nfirst place, and that is the housing crisis.\n  I would remind my colleagues that history shows us that if you run up \nenough debt, the answer to it is to print more money, which is the \nbasis of the currency, which inevitably leads to inflation, which is \nthe greatest enemy of the middle class in America.\n  I see my colleague from New York who is going to talk on many things, \nincluding the terrible tragedy that has taken place in the crash of the \nairliner in New York. But I also want to, while he is on the floor, \nstrongly disagree with his comment that the American people do not care \nabout little porky projects. Americans care. I can only speak for my \nconstituents in Arizona, who have flooded my office with calls. They \ncare about little porky projects that are to the tune of millions of \ntheir tax dollars.\n  Just yesterday, the National Association of Realtors reported the \nlargest drop in home prices--12.4 percent--since the Association \nstarted gathering such data in 1979. Prices declined in almost 9 out of \nevery 10 cities. Despite the fact that this extremely sobering \nstatistic was released yesterday, this bill cuts almost half of the \nonly significant housing provision in the conference report.\n  This provision, written by Senator Isakson, a former real estate \nagent, and approved by all Republicans and Democrats would have allowed \nany homeowner to take a nonrepayable tax credit of $15,000 or 10 \npercent of the purchase price of a house used as a principal residence. \nSenator Isakson argued that such a generous tax credit would help the \nmarket recover swiftly. As a real estate agent during the economic \ncrisis of the 1970s, he saw tax credits spur the purchase of many \nhomes, which served to reduce the glut of vacant homes in the market, \nthereby allowing home values to stabilize, the housing inventory to \ndrop, and the market to recover. We could have achieved a similar \nresult here, I believe. But, instead, it was cut--the only housing \nprovision in the report that was roundly supported by both Republicans \nand Democrats and millions of potential home buyers. Instead, they \ndecided to cut the tax break to $8 thousand and limit it to only first-\ntime buyers. My belief is that this will not produce any real change to \nour sagging housing market.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the stimulus bill \nwould create anywhere from 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. At $789 \nbillion, 1.3 million jobs would work out to cost $506,923 per job, and \nfor 3.9 million jobs, the cost would be $202,308 per job. If you add \nthe cost of interest to the price tag, it comes to $1 trillion. Every \neconomic estimate I have seen lately falls within the category of 1.3 \nto 3.9 million jobs. The administration says it could be 4 million or \nmore.\n  In a new letter from CBO dated February 11 providing a year-by-year \nanalysis of the economic effects of spending of the pending stimulus \nlegislation, CBO finds:\n\n       Beyond 2004 the legislation is estimated to reduce GDP by \n     between 0 and 0.2 percent. The reduction in GDP is therefore \n     estimated to be reflected in lower wages rather than lower \n     employment. The increased debt would tend to reduce the stock \n     of productive private capital. In economic parlance, the debt \n     would ``crowd out'' private investment. Workers will be less \n     productive because the capital stock is smaller. The \n     legislation's long-run impact on output also would depend on \n     whether permanently changed incentives to work are saved. The \n     legislation would not have any significant permanent effects \n     on those incentives.\n\n  I know my colleagues are going to say we are going to do other \nthings.\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\nAnd we need to do other things--reform entitlements. We should have, in \nthis legislation, put ourselves on a path to entitlement reform by \nsetting up commissions for both Social Security and Medicare reform, \nbut we did not, just as we should have had a trigger to stop spending \nand put us on a path to a balanced budget once our economy recovers.\n  It is unfortunate that even in these difficult economic times, \nMembers of Congress couldn't resist the temptation to lard up this bill \nwith billions of dollars in unnecessary spending that will do nothing \nto stimulate the economy. What makes this most disturbing, in order to \ninclude these questionable provisions in the final measure, the \nconferees cut some of the few truly important spending provisions that \nhad been included in the House and Senate bills.\n  For example, I don't understand how, on the one hand, the conferees \ncan cut close to $3 billion from the Senate bill for Department of \nDefense and veterans hospital and medical facilities and, on the other \nhand, add funding above either House- or Senate-passed bills for State \nDepartment information technology upgrades, totaling $290 million. \nInformation technology may be worthwhile, but I am dumbfounded as to \nthe conferees' rationale for adding funding for information technology \nprograms that exceeds either Chamber's recommendations and cuts defense \nand veterans. We all talk about our commitment to veterans. Certainly \nVA hospital and medical facilities are badly needed, as we found in the \nscandal of Walter Reed.\n  Just as egregious, the conference report provides $1 billion for \nprevention and wellness programs that were previously struck by the \nSenate and reported to be for smoking cessation programs and STD \nprevention. Why is this added back in, even though it may be worthy, at \nthe expense of military members, families, and veterans whose funding \nwas cut?\n  The conference report provides more funding for grants to provide \nhigh-speed Internet to Americans, $7.2 billion, than it does for \nmilitary and veterans affairs construction--again, at the expense of \nour Nation's bravest and most worthy. The conference report falls short \nin addressing the needs of our military and veterans who have given so \nmuch in support of this country and our democratic values.\n  Again, these are not tiny, porky amendments. The American people do \ncare what we are talking about. If the American people don't care, then \non behalf of the American people, we should take out these little tiny, \nporky items that will provide questionable stimulative effects.\n  I have a long list, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Examples of Questionable Provisions in the Conference Report--\n                              Stimulative?\n\n       $200 million to consolidate the DHS headquarters in \n     Washington, DC.\n       $15 million for historic preservation grants for \n     historically black colleges and universities.\n       $25 million for the Smithsonian.\n       $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n       $5.55 billion for the Federal Buildings Fund, including \n     $750 million for Federal buildings and U.S. Courthouses;

$8.2 \n     billion for the Office of the Director; $500 million for \n     buildings and facilities for Bethesda, MD.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Among these are $200 million to consolidate the DHS \nheadquarters in Washington, DC; $15 million for historic preservation \nof Historically Black Colleges and Universities; $25 million for the \nSmithsonian; $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts; $5.55 \nbillion for the Federal Buildings Fund, including $750 million for \nFederal buildings and U.S. courthouses.\n  The list goes on: $300 million for new energy-efficient vehicles for \nthe Federal Government; $100 million for grants to small shipyards; \n$7.2 billion to accelerate broadband deployment in unserved and \nunderserved areas and to strategic institutions. By the way, certainly \nthe Presiding Officer knows we cannot spend within the next year $7.2 \nbillion or anything like it to accelerate broadband deployment because \nof the nature of the challenge. There is $50 million to upgrade the \ncomputer systems at the Farm Service Agency; $50 million for \naquaculture producers; $300 million in grants for a diesel emission \nreduction program; $50 million to build biomass plants; $150 million \nfor USGS stream gauges and volcano monitoring systems; $200 million to \nrepair leaking\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\nunderground storage tanks under the Leaking Underground Storage Tank \nTrust Fund; $1 billion for the Bureau of the Census. We will be talking \nmore about this issue. We can't have the census taken from the \nDepartment of Commerce and put in the White House. We can't politicize \nthe process of the system. We will be talking more about that later on.\n  There is $230 million for operation, research, and facilities at the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. You can make arguments \nfor all these programs as worthwhile. You cannot make arguments that \nthey stimulate the economy in a short period. There is $150 million for \naeronautics at NASA; $2.5 billion for the National Science Foundation, \nof which $300 million is for the Major Research Instrumentation Program \nand $200 million for academic research facilities modernization; $275 \nmillion for the Mississippi River and tributaries; $10 million for \nprogram direction funding in fossil energy research and development; \n$1.6 billion for DOE science program; $2.25 billion to install new \nwindows and furnaces in HUD homes; $8 billion for high-speed rail.\n  The high-speed rail program is very interesting. It started out at $2 \nbillion and now has been raised to $8 billion, a remarkable increase in \nfunding, when we think about it. There are media reports that state \nthis could probably be used for the Las Vegas-Los Angeles high-speed \nrail. The list goes on.\n  The fact is, there are also policy provisions. The conference report \nstill includes the protectionist ``Buy American'' provisions that will \ndamage the ability of U.S. corporations to export and create jobs at \nhome. If passage of this bill triggers retaliatory trade action by \nforeign countries against the United States, Congress will have \nsucceeded in deepening one of the worst recessions of our time.\n  There is an article in this week's Economist magazine entitled ``The \nreturn of economic nationalism, A specter is rising. To bury it again, \nBarack Obama needs to take the lead.'' It talks about the ``Buy \nAmerican'' provisions. At the end it states:\n\n       Once again, the task of saving the world economy falls to \n     America. Mr. Obama must show that he is ready for it. If he \n     is, he should kill any ``Buy American'' provisions. If he \n     isn't, America and the rest of the world are in deep trouble.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Economist, Feb. 5, 2009]\n\n                   The Return of Economic Nationalism\n\n       Managing a crisis as complex as this one has so far called \n     for nuance and pragmatism rather than stridency and \n     principle. Should governments prop up credit markets by \n     offering guarantees or creating bad banks? Probably both. \n     What package of fiscal stimulus would be most effective? It \n     varies from one country to the next. Should banks be \n     nationalised? Yes, in some circumstances. Only the foolish \n     and the partisan have rejected (or embraced) any solutions \n     categorically.\n       But the re-emergence of a spectre from the darkest period \n     of modern history argues for a different, indeed strident, \n     response. Economic nationalism--the urge to keep jobs and \n     capital at home--is both turning the economic crisis into a \n     political one and threatening the world with depression. If \n     it is not buried again forthwith, the consequences will be \n     dire.\n\n\n                        Devil take the hindmost\n\n       Trade encourages specialisation, which brings prosperity; \n     global capital markets, for all their problems, allocate \n     money more efficiently than local ones; economic co-operation \n     encourages confidence and enhance security. Yet despite its \n     obvious benefits, the globalised economy is under threat.\n       Congress is arguing about a clause in the $800 billion-plus \n     stimulus package that in its most extreme form would press \n     for the use of American materials in public works. Earlier, \n     Tim Geithner, the new treasury secretary, accused China of \n     ``manipulating'' its currency, prompting snarls from Beijing. \n     Around the world, carmakers have lobbied for support (see \n     article), and some have got it. A host of industries, in \n     countries fro India to Ecuador, want help from their \n     governments.\n       The grip of nationalism is tightest in banking (see \n     article). In France and Britain, politicians pouring \n     taxpayers' money into ailing banks are demanding that the \n     cash be lent at home. Since banks are reducing overall \n     lending, that means repatriating cash. Regulators are \n     thinking nationally too. Switzerland now favours domestic \n     loans by ignoring them in one measure of the capital its \n     banks need to hold; foreign loans count in full.\n       Governments protect goods and capital largely in order to \n     protect jobs. Around the world, workers are demanding help \n     from the state with increasing panic. British strikers, \n     quoting Gordon Brown's ill-chosen words back at him, are \n     demanding that he provide ``British jobs for British \n     workers'' (see article). In France more than 1m people stayed \n     away from work on January 29th, marching for jobs and wages. \n     In Greece police used tear gas to control farmers calling for \n     even more subsidies.\n       Three arguments are raised in defence of economic \n     nationalism: that it is justified commercially; that it is \n     justified politically; and that it won't get very far. On the \n     first point, some damaged banks may feel safer retreating to \n     their home markets, where they understand the risks and \n     benefit from scale; but that is a trend which governments \n     should seek to counteract, not to encourage. On the second \n     point, it is reasonable for politicians to want to spend \n     taxpayers' money at home--so long as the costs of doing so \n     are not unacceptably high.\n       In this case, however, the costs could be enormous. For the \n     third argument--that protectionism will not get very far--is \n     dangerously complacent. True, everybody sensible scoffs at \n     Reed Smoot and Willis Hawley, the lawmakers who in 1930 \n     exacerbated the Depression by raising American tariffs. But \n     reasonable people opposed them at the time, and failed to \n     stop them: 1,028 economists petitioned against their bill. \n     Certainly, global supply-chains are more complex and harder \n     to pick apart than in those days. But when nationalism is on \n     the march, even commercial logic gets trampled underfoot.\n       The links that bind countries' economies together are under \n     strain. World trade may well shrink this year for the first \n     time since 1982. Net private-sector capital flows to the \n     emerging markets are likely to fall to $165 billion, from a \n     peak of $929 billion in 2007. Even if there were no policies \n     to undermine it, globalisation is suffering its biggest \n     reversal in the modern era.\n       Politicians know that, with support for open markets low \n     and falling, they must be seen to do something; and policies \n     designed to put something right at home can inadvertently eat \n     away at the global system. An attempt to prop up Ireland's \n     banks last year sucked deposits out of Britain's. American \n     plans to monitor domestic bank lending month by month will \n     encourage lending at home rather than abroad. As countries \n     try to save themselves they endanger each other.\n       The big question is what America will do. At some moments \n     in this crisis it has shown the way--by agreeing to supply \n     dollars to countries that needed them, and by guaranteeing \n     the contracts of European banks when it rescued a big \n     insurer. But the ``Buy American'' provisions in the stimulus \n     bill are alarmingly nationalistic. They would not even boost \n     American employment in the short run, because--just as with \n     Smoot-Hawley--the inevitable retaliation would destroy more \n     jobs at exporting firms. And the political consequences would \n     be far worse than the economic ones. They would send a \n     disastrous signal to the rest of the world: the champion of \n     open markets is going it alone.\n\n\n                             A time to act\n\n       Barack Obama says that he doesn't like ``Buy American'' \n     (and the provisions have been softened in the Senate's \n     version of the stimulus plan). That's good--but not enough. \n     Mr Obama should veto the entire package unless they are \n     removed. And he must go further, by championing three \n     principles.\n       The first principle is co-ordination--especially in rescue \n     packages, like the one that helped the rich world's banks \n     last year. Countries' stimulus plans should be built around \n     common principles, even if they differ in the details. Co-\n     ordination is good economics, as well as good politics: \n     combined plans are also more economically potent than \n     national ones.\n       The second principle is forbearance. Each nation's stimulus \n     plan should embrace open markets, even if some foreigners \n     will benefit. Similarly, financial regulators should leave \n     the re-regulation of cross-border banking until later, at an \n     international level, rather than beggaring their neighbours \n     by grabbing scarce capital, setting targets for domestic \n     lending and drawing up rules with long-term consequences now.\n       The third principle is multilateralism. The IMF and the \n     development banks should help to meet emerging markets' \n     shortfall in capital. They need the structure and the \n     resources to do so. The World Trade Organisation can help to \n     shore up the trading system if its members pledge to complete \n     the Doha round of trade talks and make good on their promise \n     at last year's G20 meeting to put aside the arsenal of trade \n     sanctions.\n       When economic conflict seems more likely than ever, what \n     can persuade countries to give up their trade weapons? \n     American leadership is the only chance. The international \n     economic system depends upon a guarantor, prepared to back it \n     during crises. In the 19th century Britain played that part. \n     Nobody did between the wars, and the consequences were \n     disastrous. Partly because of that mistake, America bravely \n     sponsored a new economic order after the second world war.\n       Once again, the task of saving the world economy falls to \n     America. Mr Obama must show that he is ready for it. If he \n     is, he should kill any ``Buy American'' provisions. If he \n     isn't, America and the rest of the world are in deep trouble.\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Of course, we know about Davis-Bacon that will inflate \nthe construction costs of the bill by $17 billion. Section 604 requires \nthat only domestic apparel and textile products may be procured by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, unless the Secretary of DHS determines \nthe quality and quantity cannot be procured in the United States at \nmarket prices, whatever ``market prices'' means. There is a provision \nwhich states that within 45 days of enactment, the Governor of each \nState shall certify that they will request and use taxpayer funds \nprovided in the bill. It goes on to say that if any of the money \nprovided by this bill is not accepted by the Governor, then that \nState's legislature can simply pass a resolution to bypass the Governor \nand receive those funds. I have never seen a provision such as that in \nthe Congress.\n  I repeat, if the Governor of a State says his State doesn't need the \nmoney, then the State's legislature can simply pass a resolution to \nbypass the elected Governor of the State and receive the funds. What \ndoes that say about States rights and States electing their Governors \nto lead. It is remarkable. Every Governor in America should be on \nnotice that we may have established a precedent that if you don't want \nto take taxpayer money, then you can be bypassed by your legislature. \nIt is unconstitutional and should be challenged in court.\n  It adds a new far-reaching policy with respect to unemployment \ncompensation entitled ``Unemployment Compensation Modernization''--an \ninteresting description. The new policy would allow a person to collect \nunemployment insurance for leaving his job to care for an immediate \nfamily member's illness, any illness or disability as defined by the \nSecretary of Labor. This provision stems from legislation introduced in \nthe Senate during the 110th Congress that was not approved. Each State \nwould need to amend their unemployment insurance in order to receive a \nportion of the $7 billion added to the bill for this additional \nunemployment compensation program. It provides a total waiver of cost \nsavings related to inland waterways projects; 50 percent of the cost is \nsupposed to be carried by private companies that utilize the waterways.\n  The report establishes the Federal Coordinating Council for \ncomparative effectiveness research. The bill text does not use the term \n``clinical'' when referring to comparative effectiveness research, \nleading to the possibility that the bill does not protect against the \nresearch being used to make coverage decisions based on cost-\neffectiveness rather than clinical effectiveness.\n  It includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and \nClinical Health Act, a massive overhaul of our health IT infrastructure \nthat deserves more consideration.\n  It is 1,071 pages and a 41-page statement of the managers, a total of \n1,492 pages. It was negotiated in a partisan fashion, behind closed \ndoors, in direct contradiction to President Obama's commitments during \nthe campaign. I understand his spokesman yesterday said it was ``an \nemergency.'' It may have been an emergency, but that was not mentioned \nduring the commitments made by then-candidate Obama.\n  Among other things, the conference report contains $450 million for \nAmtrak security grants through the Department of Transportation. It \nwasn't in the House bill, wasn't in the Senate bill. It duplicates a \nprogram that already exists.\n  I urge my colleagues, when they have a few spare moments, to look at \nthe history of Amtrak, a railroad that was taken over by the Federal \nGovernment with the intent to turn it over to the private sector in a \nshort period. We have propped it up with billions and billions of \ntaxpayer dollars, funding that will never become profitable.\n  A provision recreates the slush fund that was unanimously rejected by \nboth the House and Senate. The slush fund allows agency heads to move \nmoney around between programs as they see fit without any real \noversight by Congress.\n  I mentioned high-speed rail. That is $8 billion. The Senate included \n$2 billion for these programs, and the House didn't include anything. \nThe conference now has added $6 billion. I mentioned earlier the \nveterans and military construction spending has been cut by over $3 \nbillion below both the House and Senate bills. Of course, the \nconference report, among many other items, contains $50 million for \nNEA, a worthwhile endeavor, but I don't see how you can make the \nargument it creates jobs.\n  A commitment was made that the spending would be done quickly. The \nconference agreement drops provisions that require all funds in the \nbill to be awarded within 30 to 120 days of enactment. Instead, the \nreport allows numerous programs to have 3 years or more to actually \nbegin spending the funding.\n  I know many of my colleagues, including my friend from Illinois, are \nhere. I don't want to take too much time, as many of my colleagues wish \nto discuss the legislation. I wish to mention there is $2 billion for a \nneighborhood stabilization program which could go for money for groups \nsuch as ACORN. You could make arguments about whether ACORN should be \nfunded. I do not see how that possibly creates jobs.\n\n  I understand this bill will be passed this evening. I hope the next \ntime--maybe with TARP--because there are going to be other issues of \nenormous consequence that the Congress and the President of the United \nStates will face in the coming weeks and months. I do not believe \nthings are going to get better in the world real soon. We see \nactivities around the world, from the behavior of the Russians to the \nIranian testing of a missile, to renewed aggressive rhetoric by North \nKorea, to others, including developing a strategy for Afghanistan. But \nthere are also enormous economic challenges here at home.\n  The American people would like us to, and the message they have sent \nus is, that they want us to sit down and work together. As I said, this \nbill began with a statement by the Speaker of the House: We won. We \nwrite the bill. We need to sit down together before the bill is \nwritten, outline the principles, turn those principles we share into \nconcrete legislation, and work together. I hope we never again have a \nrepetition of a bill that has such enormous consequence that would pass \nthrough both bodies with literally no Republican support--three \nSenators out of 178 Members in the House and 40 in the Senate. That is \nnot bipartisanship.\n  I think we passed up an opportunity this time. I hope the American \npeople will respond again by sending us the message. They want us to \naddress the economic woes we face, but they want us to address them \ntogether. This legislation, in my view, is very bad for the economic \nfuture of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the lives and the \nmemories of the victims of the tragic crash of Continental Airlines \nFlight 3407 in Clarence, NY, last night. Our Nation woke up this \nmorning to the deeply saddening news that 50 lives were lost in this \ninexplicable tragedy, and our hearts, our prayers, and our minds are \nwith the families and friends who lost a loved one, the first \nresponders at the scene, and the residents of Clarence.\n  I was deeply saddened to hear that one of the victims was Beverly \nEckert, whose husband Sean Rooney perished in the tragic events of \nSeptember 11. I knew Beverly. I worked with her and so admired her \nfight to make sure another 9/11 never happens again.\n  Beverly was a national role model who turned tragedy into \ninspiration. She was traveling to Buffalo for what would have been her \nhusband's 58th birthday, to take part in a presentation of a \nscholarship award in his memory at Canisius High School. She, and all \nthe victims of this accident, will be greatly missed. Of course, the \nfamily members of the other victims, whose names have not been made \npublic yet, will relate in the future episodes of quiet strength and \nbravery of their loved ones as well.\n  I spoke with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood early this morning, \nand he reassured me that the Department of Transportation is taking \nquick action to figure out what caused this accident. Secretary LaHood \ntold me the first responders who rushed to the\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\nscene immediately last night have been remarkably brave in their \nefforts to save lives.\n  To all the brave men and women who risked their lives to protect the \nfamilies who live in the area of the accident and to the many who are \nstill on the ground fighting the fires that remain, thank you for your \nservice.\n  I also spoke, this morning, with Congressmen Chris Lee and Brian \nHiggins, county executive Chris Collins, and Clarence supervisor Scott \nBylewski to offer help. I am comforted that everyone at the Federal, \nState, and local levels stands ready to provide whatever help is \nneeded.\n  Our thoughts and prayers also go out to the people of Clarence and \nthe entire Buffalo area who were, no doubt, leaving for work and school \nwith very heavy hearts this morning.\n  As a Senator, I am proud to serve the people of western New York. \nThey are a resilient community, and if there is any comfort to this \ntragedy, it is in knowing that their outreach to the victims' families \nwill be generous and loving.\n  Just last month, the world exalted when flight 1549 landed on the \nHudson River without a single loss of life. Yet today we are faced with \nthis horrible tragedy. At times such as this, the only thing that helps \nus is our faith that there is a greater wisdom that, at times such as \nthis, is hard to understand.\n  Again, I offer my deepest condolences to the victims' families and \nfriends as we continue to learn more about the cause of this tragic \naccident.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New York that \nall of us join in expressing sympathy and sorrow at the loss of these \nwonderful Americans.

Mr. President, Senator McCain is a friend of mine and \nsomeone I respect. We came to the House of Representatives together 27 \nyears ago. He came to the Senate before me, and we have served together \nfor over 12 years. I respect him very much, and I know he speaks from \nthe heart when he addresses this stimulus package. But I would like to \ntake a few moments to reflect on some of the arguments he has made, and \nat any point in my presentation invite the Senator, if he is nearby, to \ncome join me on the floor to discuss this matter in debate. Sadly, the \nSenate no longer debates in the old style. We give speeches and many \ntimes are like ships passing in the night. So I hope, if he is \navailable--and I know he may not be; he has a busy schedule, too--I \nhope he will return to the floor, and we can talk about some of the \narguments he made, and he can address them directly. In the meantime, I \nwould like to speak to a few of them myself.\n  Senator McCain argues that spending $790 billion, which the President \nhas suggested for a recovery and reinvestment, is too much money. He \nargues the bill is too large, there is too much money in this bill. \nKeep in mind, this money is going to be spent out over a 2-year, maybe \n3-year period, most of it on the front end, most of it in the first 18 \nmonths, but much of it over a longer period of time. So we are talking \nabout roughly $350 billion to be spent, for example, in the first year, \nmaybe as much as $600 billion or $700 billion by the end of the second \nyear. It is a huge sum of money. It may be the largest bill we have \never considered, certainly the largest stimulus bill we have ever \nconsidered, on the floor of the Senate.\n  But I will tell you that most economists, in looking at this bill, \nraise the question about whether it is enough, considering the size of \nthe American economy, No. 1. It is an economy that generates more than \n$14 trillion a year in the production of goods and services. It is an \neconomy that is flat on its back. It is an economy deep in recession, \nwith high unemployment, with businesses failing, with families losing \ntheir health insurance, with a lot of misery being spread across the \ncountry. The obvious question is: What can we do to change it?\n\n  Last year, President George W. Bush saw this coming, and he suggested \nthe way to change it was to offer tax breaks, tax rebates to families. \nThe Democratic Congress said to the Republican President: If this is \nwhat you want us to do to try to turn the economy around, we will do \nit. We enacted bipartisan legislation to give President Bush about $150 \nbillion to send back to families in checks of $300 or $600 in the hopes \nthat would breathe some life back into the economy, cause people to go \nout and spend more money, buy more goods and services, invigorate \nbusinesses, save and create jobs. We did it. We signed up for that \napproach. It did not work. Mr. President, $150 billion was spent for \nindividual families. There was the $300 or $600 check, which I am sure \nprovided some relief. But at the end of the day, when we took a look at \nthe economy, it continued to cascade downhill. Simply doing $150 \nbillion in tax cuts did not do it.\n  Then President Bush came to us and said: I need $700 billion. It was \na staggering amount of money, but we were told by Secretary Paulson, \nSecretary of the Treasury, Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, and others, that if we did not do it and do it quickly, the \neconomy could go into a crisis which could be felt worldwide.\n  It was the most sobering meeting I ever attended as a Member of \nCongress when I heard this, and I felt duty-bound to do everything I \ncould to cooperate with the Republican President, to give him the \nresources he wanted to try to breathe life back into this economy, to \nget the credit institutions moving forward, and I voted for it. At the \nend of the day, $350 billion was spent and, I am afraid to say, very \nlittle positive occurred. In fact, we are still trying to get an \naccurate accounting of what happened to that money.\n  These were the first two attempts by the previous Republican \nadministration; first, a $150 billion tax cut, then a $700 billion TARP \nfunding they called it--the Troubled Asset Relief Program--which the \nDemocrats cooperated in and said: Mr. President, though we are of a \ndifferent political party, this is a national crisis, and we will work \nwith your best minds to try what we can to turn this economy around.\n  We debated it, and we changed parts of it. We are expected to. That \nis what Congress has as a responsibility. But there was no question \nfrom the beginning that the Democratic Congress was going to cooperate \nwith the Republican President because we had a national emergency on \nour hands.\n  Now comes the new President, President Barack Obama, sworn in a \nlittle over 3 weeks ago. The crisis, which we had hoped would have \nturned, in fact, had worsened. He inherited the worst economic crisis \nin 75 years. You have to go back to President Franklin Roosevelt and \nthe awful Depression he saw to find another President faced with this \nkind of an economic challenge. President Obama came to office and said: \nWe have to do something. We have to try to find a solution. We need to \nput the best minds, the best economists, and the best leaders together \nto come up with an approach which will stop this recession from growing \nand getting worse and will turn this economy around. He said, similar \nto President Bush: I would like the help of both political parties to \ndo it.\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\n  Well, it is natural a President would ask for that. Because the \ncrisis that faces us is not a Democratic crisis or a Republican crisis. \nFamilies who do not vote, families who are Independents, families of \nboth political parties are being affected.\n  President Obama made a presentation of this recovery and reinvestment \nprogram, and he estimated the cost to be around $750 to $800 billion. \nThe Senator from Arizona thinks that is an unnecessarily large sum. I \nmight say to the Senator that he knows, as well as I do, that last year \nthe U.S. stock market lost $7 trillion in value. You can see it in the \nDow Jones index--now somewhere near 8,000. At one point, it was near \n15,000. Mr. President, $7 trillion in lost stock market value is $7 \ntrillion in lost savings and lost retirement plans.\n  To argue that spending $350 billion to try to stop this slide is \noverspending, overlooks the obvious. With $7 trillion lost in stock \nmarket value, to do nothing, to allow this to continue, is to run the \nrisk that even more value will be lost and the dreams and plans of \nfamilies across America will have to be changed.\n  There is something else we know as well. Because of the state of the \neconomy, we have what the economists call the paradox of thrift. If you \nlook to your near future for your family, and you are worried about \nyour job or your wife's job or your children, you are likely to say: We \nbetter be careful. We shouldn't make big purchases now until things are \npretty clear. Put more money in savings and hold back a little. Be \nthrifty. That is a natural reaction. It is a defensive mechanism when \npeople see a troubling economy. Although it makes sense on an \nindividual family basis, it creates in the overall economy exactly the \nopposite of what we need. What we need is more confidence and people \nstepping forward and saying, I think we are through this; I think we \nwill be through this soon, and I need to make some purchases that I \nhave held off making. As they buy things, they create more economic \nactivity, businesses flourish, and jobs are created and saved. So as \npeople are thrifty in an economy and hold back, it deepens the \nrecession. Deflation is what they call it. This year we will lose $1 \ntrillion in spending in America. We estimate that families holding \nback, consumers holding back will spend $1 trillion less. Remember, our \noverall economy is about $14 trillion, so that represents about 7 \npercent of our economy which will contract because of fear, concern \nabout our future.\n\n  What President Obama has said is at this moment we need to inject \nmoney into this economy. We need to show the American people we can \nsave and create jobs. We need to have more economic activity so that \nbusinesses will survive, and we need to see our way through this \ncrisis. That is what he has come forward with. So the critics of \nPresident Obama's plan have no alternative. They are not proposing \nanything that will stimulate this economy to this measure. They offered \na plan which I think was at least thoughtful in one respect which tried \nto address the housing crisis, but it didn't come close to investing \nthe money in this economy that we need to try to turn it around. So I \nsay to my friends on the Republican side: If you can't come up with a \nviable alternative, if you can't come up with a solution, then being \ncritical of President Obama's plan doesn't have much credibility. You \nneed to acknowledge we have a problem and work with us to try to solve \nit.\n  It is interesting too that there is this argument on the Republican \nside--and I heard it from the Senator from Arizona--that this is too \nmuch money. If we don't do something, if the recession continues and \ngets worse, here is what happens: Fewer people are working, fewer \ndollars are collected for income tax, fewer dollars are being spent, \nless sales tax is collected, values of real estate continue to go down, \nproperty tax receipts go down, and we find that the receipts and \nrevenues of the Government start getting fewer and constricted. At the \nsame time, the demands for government services go up. Unemployed people \nneed a helping hand. They need a hand to feed their families and keep \nthem together. They need a hand to provide some kind of health \ninsurance. So the demands for government services go up and revenues go \ndown, and it is a perfect recipe for deficit.\n  It is no surprise--and I think this chart, if I am not mistaken, \nshows it--across America 46 States are now facing budget deficits, and \nit could get worse. It shows a cumulative budget deficit of $350 \nbillion through 2011. So failing to respond to this situation will mean \neven deeper deficits. To argue that spending about $790 billion now \nwill add to the deficit is to ignore the obvious. Doing nothing and \nallowing the recession to occur and get worse will give us deficits not \nonly this year but for years to come, not to mention the suffering that \nfamilies and businesses will go through in the process.\n  If I came to Senator McCain and said to him: I know of your interest \nin national defense. You are a war hero from Vietnam and I respect you \nso much for it, and I know you have focused on Americans' national \nsecurity more than any other issue. If I told you there was a threat to \nAmerica, whatever it might be, and that we had better prepare ourselves \nto defend ourselves, would you stop and say first tell me how much it \ncosts, or would you first say keep America safe, that is our first \nobligation; we will talk about the cost later? I expect that would be \nhis reaction. It might be my reaction as well--it probably would be my \nreaction as well. So here, when we face a national economic crisis, for \nany Senator to stand up and say, You know, there is only a limited \namount of money we can spend on this, is to ignore the fact that if you \ndon't make the right investment and turn this economy around, we will \npay dearly for years to come.\n  Now, there was also talk about the way this bill was written. It is \ntrue that much of the negotiation for this bill occurred behind closed \ndoors, but there was a conference committee, which is a rarity on \nCapitol Hill, where Members of both political parties came forward to \ntalk about the bill. Why did so much of it happen outside of the \nconference committee? Well, it reflects the reality of how business is \ndone most of the time here on Capitol Hill. I know it needs to get \nbetter, Senator McCain does, and I am sure President Obama agrees, but \nthis is what we came down to. This is the dilemma we came down to: \nPresident Obama reached out to House Republicans and Senate Republicans \nand said join me in writing this bill, and only three stepped up. Three \nRepublican Senators said we will join you in writing the bill. They \nhave played a major role, those three Republicans, in writing this \nbill. They have changed priorities in spending. They have eliminated \nsome programs. They have pushed forward with more money in some areas \nand less in others. They have made a profound difference in the bill \nbecause they started with the premise that if we can bring this bill to \na point where they can accept it, they would vote for it. Now, that is \nnot an unreasonable thing to ask.\n  If someone wants to sit down and amend the bill and change the bill, \nthe obvious question is--and at the end of the day we are successful \nand make the changes you asked for--will you help us pass the bill? For \nmany Republicans, the answer has been: No; we want it both ways. We \nwant to change this bill, but we are never going to vote for it.\n  I recall an amendment offered by a Republican Senator from Iowa in \nthe Senate Finance Committee which added $70 billion in costs to this \nbill for a tax cut I personally approve of but wasn't in the original \nbill. So he added $70 billion in costs to the bill and then came to the \nfloor and said I can't vote for this bill because it costs too much. \nNow, wait a minute. You can't have it both ways. You can't add to the \ncost of the bill in the committee and then come to the floor and say I \ncan't vote for the bill because it costs too much. It happened.\n  Another Senator on the floor offered what I thought was a valuable \nidea. It needed some changes here and there but a valuable idea: Create \ntax incentives for people to buy homes. I like it. I believe we have \nimproved it in this bill, but it was at least a sound idea to start \nmoving the housing market forward. Well, it turns out that Senator as \nwell added between $11 billion and $30 billion to the cost of the bill \nwith his amendment which was adopted, and then said I can't vote for \nthe bill; it costs too much. Again, you can't have it both ways. If \nmany Republican Senators wonder why they aren't in the\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\nroom talking about the ultimate bill, it is because they have already \nmade a public pronouncement that no matter what you do to the bill, we \nare not going to vote for it. How much time should we spend talking to \nthose Senators? We are never going to pass a bill if we spend our time \nagreeing to amendments they like so they can vote against the bill. \nThat is the case, unfortunately, too many times.\n  There is also this notion Senator McCain raised that Speaker Pelosi \nsaid, We won the election; we wrote the bill. Well, I can tell my \ncolleagues the American people did speak on November 4 and there was a \ndecision in the election, but President Obama could not have reached \nout more to try to bring in Republicans in the House and Senate to help \nwrite this bill. Three stepped forward. Those three were in on the \nnegotiations. Those three had a profound impact on the bill. I respect \nthem very much; the two Senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan \nCollins, and the Senator from Pennsylvania, Arlen Specter. If you would \nask them today: Did you influence this bill, the answer is obvious. \nThey did. They made a big impact on this bill because they were \nprepared to sit down and work with us and said, If we can find an \nagreement, we will vote for it. So, in fact, we did win the election, \nbut we know we need the help of both political parties to solve our \nNation's problems, and we are trying our best.\n  Senator McCain also raised questions about the cost per job. If you \ntake the overall cost of the bill--$790 billion, roughly--and the \nprojected increase in jobs--anywhere from 1 million to 3.9 million--he \ndoes simple math and comes to the conclusion that we are spending too \nmuch money for each job we are creating. What the Senator did not note \nwas that about a third of this bill goes to tax cuts to everyone. It \nisn't in the creation of a single job, but in trying to help all \nfamilies--at least those in income categories that we characterize as \nmiddle-income families, working families--so that is about a third of \nthe bill.\n  The second thing he didn't acknowledge was the money spent in \ncreating a job has to be looked at in the long term. If you create a \njob for a worker in Illinois and that worker ends up getting paid \n$50,000 a year, that worker is going to take his or her paycheck and \nspend it. In spending that paycheck, it is going to put more money back \ninto the economy. At the shops and stores they go to there will be \nreceipts, profits, more people working, and the people who are working \nthere will take their paychecks and go on and spend them as well. It is \nthe so-called multiplier effect which I am sure the Senator from \nArizona is well aware of. So to assign the value of each job as being \n$100,000, $200,000, whatever the cost is, is to overlook the fact that \nthat money, through the workers, is spent and respent time and again. \nThat is what helps us rebuild the economy.\n  We also had some criticism from the Senator from Arizona about the \n``Buy American'' provisions. I have to tell my colleagues something. I \nrespect him, because I know he believes this in his heart of hearts. I \ncertainly do not stand here and endorse isolationism, protectionism, or \neconomic nationalism, but shouldn't our priority with America's tax \ndollars be in putting Americans to work, creating good-paying jobs \nright here at home, buying as many goods and services within our \neconomy as we can?\n  Senator Dorgan of North Dakota offered an amendment which was a very \nthoughtful amendment and it said: We are going to buy American, but \nwhatever we do will be consistent with our international trade \nagreements. That is a reasonable approach. I think as far as we can go \nunder existing law and treaties, we need to try to help American \nfamilies get back on their feet and Americans back to work. There is \nnothing unreasonable about that. I think it may go a little too far \nwith this economist's article and others who argue we are getting back \ninto some era of protectionism. Senator Dorgan's amendment I think was \na thoughtful one and will help us address that issue.\n  There was also some concern about Governors. I can tell my colleagues \nwhy there is a provision in this bill relative to the power of \nGovernors. We have this amazing situation where there are literally \nGovernors--only a handful--across the Nation who are saying we don't \nwant the money. We don't need the money for our States. I don't know \nwhy you are going to force us to take this money.\n  Well, that is their political point of view. Most States are having \ntrouble. So what we said at the outset is we want Governors to request \nthe funds. Literally billions of dollars will be coming to their States \nand they should request it. That is not unreasonable. We went on to say \nthat if your Governor doesn't request the funds, doesn't ask for the \nfunds to help people in their States, that the legislature in each \nState can do it. Why did we put that in there? Because some of the \nmoney will not go through the Governor's office, but will go directly, \nfor example, to school districts. Take an example in my State. In my \nhometown of Springfield, IL, the school district there will get \nadditional funds for IDEA. That is the Federal program that provides \nmoney to school districts so they can educate and help children with \nspecial needs. It is an expensive commitment and it is one the Federal \nGovernment has not done its share of over the years. That money would \ngo to the school district to help them meet their needs for teachers \nand classrooms, and it would also suppress the need to raise property \ntaxes which no one wants. Also, money will go to the schools in my \nhometown that have a larger percentage of disadvantaged kids, kids from \nlow-income families. It is called title I. That money is coming from \nthe Federal Government down to my local school district. Well, the \nGovernor in my State is going to accept the funds, I can assure my \ncolleagues, but what if we were in a State where the Governor said we \ndon't need this money. I don't know why Washington did it. I am not \ngoing to sign up and ask for it. There ought to be a way that school \ndistrict can still benefit even if the Governor sees it differently, \nand that is the reason for the provision Senator McCain raised.\n  Senator McCain also said that bill was done in a partisan fashion, \nbehind closed doors. I can tell you the Republican Senators who were \nengaged in this process on the Senate side made it as bipartisan as \npossible. They were involved--all three of them--in very detailed \ndiscussions about what was included in the bill. Yes, it is true, some \nwere discussions behind closed doors, but, ultimately, this bill is \npublic for those interested in reading and carefully looking through \nit, and they should. That is part of the process.\n  I might add, there is more to follow. This bill has no earmarks in \nit. There is no specific project that is appropriated funds in this \nbill. That was our promise. There is increased funding in all the \nagencies receiving more funds for oversight so the inspectors general \ncan keep an eye on the money being spent. There will be an \naccountability and transparency board to coordinate and provide regular \nreports to Congress. We are going to have a recovery Web site where \npeople across America can follow the expenditures of these funds, so \nthey can see what is happening nationally and in their States.\n  I think it also is going to protect State and local whistleblowers. \nThese are tax dollars collected for people who work hard for them. \nThese dollars should be spent in a responsible way, with transparency.\n  Senator McCain also spoke about Amtrak. Senator McCain is on the \nrecord for a long time against Amtrak. Again, I respect his position \nbut disagree with it completely. We found in Illinois and across the \nNation when the price of gasoline went over $4, millions of Americans \nrediscovered, or discovered for the first time, Amtrak. You need a \nreservation to get on a train in Illinois because they are packed with \npeople who realize it is a lot cheaper to use the train. Of course, in \nusing a train, there is less traffic congestion and less pollution. \nUltimately, expanding Amtrak--even high-speed rail, which is part of \nthis--is part of the future. Senator McCain sees it differently. I \nrespect him for that, but I think the investment in Amtrak is money \nwell spent, jobs right here in America building tracks, expanding \nAmtrak service, and providing train service that will benefit our \ncountry for a long time to come.\n  I might say, as well, to my friend from Arizona that this bill, \nthough he and his fellow Senators may vote against it, is going to \ncreate or save\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\n70,000 jobs in Arizona over the next 2 years. It will provide a tax cut \nof up to $800 for more than 2 million workers and their families in the \nState of Arizona--a tax cut they will greatly appreciate, I am sure. \nAnd 75,000 Arizona families will now be eligible, under this bill, to \ndeduct college education expenses for their kids in a way to give them \na helping hand so the kids can stay in college, get their degrees, and \ngo on to be employed profitably and successfully in their lives. It is \ngoing to provide additional money for the unemployed in Arizona of $100 \na month and give them a helping hand in paying for health insurance.\n  So whether the Senators voted for this or not, there are benefits \ncoming directly to their States, which most people would agree are \nimportant. It will provide funding sufficient to modernize at least 193 \nschools in Arizona so the children will have laboratories and libraries \nand modern classrooms for the 21st century. Money will be invested in \nrenewable energy so we will have less dependence upon foreign oil. We \nare going to move toward the computerization of health records in every \nState, including Arizona, Illinois, and Virginia, because we believe \nthat means doctors can do a better job. They can see the background of \na patient when making a diagnosis. It means there are fewer medical \nerrors. Though that was criticized as being part of the bill, I think \nit is money well spent.\n  If we are talking about health care reform, we need to modernize the \nway we capture and hold health records. Also, the Veterans' \nAdministration's system already has computerized records. It is the way \nto go. This bill moves America in that direction. This bill, when it \ncomes to the VA, has $1.2 billion for VA hospital and medical facility \nconstruction and improvements. Money that otherwise would not have been \nspent on the VA will be spent because of the stimulus bill. There is \n$2.3 billion for Department of Defense facilities such as housing, \nhospitals, and childcare centers. There is $555 million to expand the \nDOD homeowners assistance program. There is $150 million that will be \nused for more personnel to process disability claims--something we need \nin Illinois, and I bet other States need as well.\n  These are things I think are critically important to put spending in \nthis economy, to breathe life into it, to create and save up to 3 \nmillion or 4 million jobs, to try to stem the tide of this recession.\n  Again, at the end of the day, we may only have three Republican \nSenators voting for it, but unless we stand and act together, we are \nnot going to solve this problem.\n  When President Bush needed help last year with his economic stimulus \nplan, we stood together, Democrats and Republicans, and gave it to \nhim--first, the $150 billion in tax cuts and then the President's \nrequest for the so-called TARP funds of $700 billion. We gave the \nPresident the bipartisan support he wanted, even though some of us may \nhave questioned whether it was exactly the right thing to do. We knew \nwe had to act together.\n  Now there is a different mood. President Obama's plan is facing a \ndifferent standard by some of the Senators on the other side of the \naisle. I think we need to jumpstart this economy and not only bring us \nto recovery but reinvest in this economy so we have less dependence on \nforeign oil, better sources of energy that don't pollute the \nenvironment, modernize our health care system, modernize our school \nsystem, prepare it for the 21st century, and do all these things by \ncreating jobs in America. That is what this is all about. That is why \nit is so critically important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as we come to the final vote on the \nstimulus package, I express my great regret that I am going to be \nunable to vote for it because we clearly need a stimulus package that \nworks. The economy is in serious trouble, and we need to do the very \nbest we can to restore confidence in our economy and in our future.\n  Indeed, confidence is the basic issue. Confidence is what it is all \nabout. We have had glimpses that have led us to believe some sense of \nconfidence could be restored. Unfortunately, in my view, we have \nsquandered the opportunity.\n  Let me put it in context. Let's go back to the time when President \nObama was newly inaugurated and people were looking forward to the \nstimulus package and the activity with respect to banks and what would \nhappen in the financial industry. If I can quote from an editorial that \nappeared in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend of February 7 and \n8, they were talking about the gamble that the stimulus package \nrepresents. This is what they had to say:\n\n       The biggest gamble with this stimulus is what it means if \n     the economy doesn't recover. Monetary policy is already as \n     stimulative as it can safely get, and the Obama \n     administration is set to announce its big financial fix on \n     Monday.\n\n  That Monday was the Monday of this week, Mr. President. It goes on to \nsay:\n\n       Stocks rallied Friday on expectations of the latter, \n     despite the job loss report, with big bank stocks leading the \n     way. If done right, this will help reduce risk aversion and \n     gradually restore financial confidence.\n\n  Again, confidence is what we need to get the economy going in the \nright direction. Continuing to quote:\n\n       We hope it does, because the size and waste of the stimulus \n     means we won't have much ammunition left. The spending will \n     take the U.S. budget deficit up to some 12 percent of GDP, \nabout double the peak of the 1980s and into uncharted territory. The \ntragedy of the Obama stimulus is that we are getting so little for all \nthat money.\n\n  What did they mean when they talked about getting so little? Picking \nout a few examples, again quoting from the Wall Street Journal on the \nsame day and an editorial on that issue, they point out:\n\n       The Milwaukee public school system, for example, would \n     receive $88.6 million over two years for new construction \n     projects under the House version of the stimulus--even though \n     the district currently has 15 vacant school buildings and \n     declining enrollment. Between 1990 and 2008, inflation-\n     adjusted MPS spending rose by 35 percent, per-pupil spending \n     increased by 36 percent and state aid grew by 58 percent. \n     Over the same period, enrollment fell by a percentage point \n     and is projected to continue falling, leaving the system with \n     enough excess capacity for 22,000 students.\n\n  Yet they are going to receive $88.6 million to build new capacity. Do \nthe schools they represent have difficult conditions? Back to the \neditorial and quoting:\n\n       In general, MPS facilities have been described by school \n     officials as being in good to better-than-good condition--\n\n  Reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel--\n\n     the kind of situations that create urgent needs for \n     renovation or new construction in some cities have not been \n     on the priority list for MPS officials in recent years.\n\n  So we are going to spend money to build Milwaukee schools and they \ndon't have students to fill them. That is the kind of thing the Wall \nStreet Journal was talking about.\n  Let's look at what happened this week. Now, I go not to an American \npublication but to the Economist, printed in Great Britain, which has \nperhaps a more objective view than a publication focused on American \npolitics:\n\n       There was a chance that this week would mark a turning \n     point in an ever-deepening global slump, as Barack Obama \n     produced the two main parts of his rescue plan. The first, \n     and most argued-over, was a big fiscal boost.\n\n  They are referring to the stimulus package.\n\n       The second, and more important, part of the rescue was team \n     Obama's scheme for fixing the financial mess. . . .\n\n  They refer there to the unveiling of the program that Secretary \nGeithner gave us on Tuesday of this week. They go on to describe the \nsituation:\n\n       America cannot rescue the world economy alone. But this \n     double offensive by its biggest economy could potentially \n     have broken the spiral of uncertainty and gloom that is \n     gripping investors, producers and consumers across the globe.\n\n  Again, Mr. President, they are pointing out that we have a \nsignificant crisis of confidence. They say it applies to investors, \nproducers, and consumers. Then they gave their judgment:\n\n       Alas, that opportunity was squandered. Mr. Obama ceded \n     control of the stimulus to the fractious congressional \n     Democrats, allowing a plan that should have had broad support \n     from both parties to become a divisive partisan battle. More \n     serious still was Mr. Geithner's financial-rescue blueprint \n     which, though touted as a bold departure from the \n     incrementalism and uncertainty that plagued the Bush \n     administration's Wall Street fixes, in fact looked \n     depressingly like\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\n     his predecessor's efforts: timid, incomplete and short on \n     detail. Despite talk of trillion-dollar sums, stock markets \n     tumbled. Far from boosting confidence, Mr. Obama seems at \n     sea.\n\n  These are comments not of an American publication, or of a Republican \nor Democratic partisan, but the comments of an objective observer from \noverseas. They go on:\n\n       The fiscal stimulus plan has some obvious flaws. Too much \n     of the boost to demand is backloaded to 2010 and beyond. The \n     compromise bill is larded with spending determined more by \n     Democrat lawmakers' pet projects than by the efficiency with \n     which the economy will be boosted.\n\n  I will give you an example that fits that category. Quoting from the \nWall Street Journal of today:\n\n       An obscure Commerce Department office with a $19 million \n     budget and fewer than 20 grant officers would end up in \n     charge of $7 billion in grants to expand Internet access in \n     rural areas.\n\n  Mr. President, you have had executive responsibility at the State \nlevel. I have had executive responsibility in the private sector. Think \nfor a moment about the workings of this situation. There is an office \nwith 20 employees administering a $19 million budget that is going to \nreceive, under this stimulus package, a check for $7 billion and then \nbeing told: Spend it wisely in expanding Internet access in rural \nareas.\n  Mr. President, $7 billion does not get spent by 20 people overwhelmed \nby the task. It does not get spent expanding Internet access in rural \nareas without careful studies and an intelligent plan laid out.\n  That is an example of what ``The Economist'' is talking about when \nthey say, and I go back to their quote:\n\n       The bill is larded with spending determined more by \n     Democrat lawmakers' pet projects than by the efficiency with \n     which the economy will be boosted.\n\n  They go on to talk about more details of the stimulus plan, as well \nas the Geithner plan, but they summarize it this way under the heading, \n``A great failure of nerve.'' They say:\n\n       How serious is this setback? One interpretation is that Mr. \n     Obama's crew mismanaged expectations--that they promised a \n     plan and came up with a concept. If so, that is a big \n     mistake. Managing expectations is part of building confidence \n     and when so much about these rescues is superhumanly complex, \n     it is unforgivable to bungle the easy bit.\n       More worrying still is the chance that Mr. Geithner's \n     vagueness comes from doubt about what to do, a reluctance to \n     take tough decisions, and a timidity about asking Congress \n     for enough cash. That is an alarming prospect.\n\n  I wish I could support this stimulus package. I am more than happy to \nreach out to the administration and do whatever I can to help solve \nthis problem because our country is in serious difficulty and the \nworld, as a whole, is in even more.\n  I regret, in the words of ``The Economist,'' that this is an \nopportunity that has been squandered. I hope in the coming weeks we can \ndo something to regain the opportunity and regain the momentum we need \nin order to get to where we need to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, like my colleague from Utah, I too wish \nI had something I could vote for, something I believe would stimulate \nthe economy, would get the job done. But on this package, based on its \nsize, based on its magnitude, and based on what I believe are \nfundamental flaws in it, like my colleague, I will also need to vote \nno.\n  The other day I was on a local radio station in Casper, WY, KTWO, \n``Brian Scott in the Morning.'' Brian said: How do we know, how are we \ngoing to judge the success or failure of this bill? And I said, because \nthis is statewide in Wyoming: Ultimately the people of America will \njudge the success or failure of this bill. If the people believe the \nGovernment is working for them, then it is going to be a success. But \nif, on the other hand, the people of America believe they are working \nfor the Government because of the debt and they feel burdened by this \npackage through increased taxes, through inflation, through less buying \npower, through more Government regulations, then people will judge this \na failure. I want it to work. I want something that is going to make a \ndifference in the lives of the people of Wyoming and the people of \nAmerica.\n  Brian then specifically said: How will it work? How is the program \nactually going to work?\n  That is where I have to turn to the headlines and the sort of things \nSenator Bennett was talking about because I don't think anyone knows. \nThe Members of this body don't know. The Members of the House don't \nknow. The program is much too big. As Alice Rivlin, the former adviser \nto Senator Bill Clinton said, we should go with something half the \nsize. Take a look and do the emergency spending now, and then let these \nother programs, whether it is energy, environment, education, health \ncare--let's discuss those in a deliberate manner.\n  But the headlines from the Washington Post say, ``Trim to Stimulus \nCarves Into Goals For Job Creation.'' Are we not trying to create jobs? \nIsn't that what this is supposed to be all about? Not these backed-up \nprojects people have had as their pet projects for years.\n  Another headline, same page: ``Despite Pledges, Package Has Some \nPork.'' ``Sifting Through Details of the Deal,'' as the Members of this \nbody are still waiting for the copies to come to the floor.\n  Investors Business Daily: ``Stimulus Bill Funds Programs Deemed \n`Ineffective' by [Office of Management and Budget].'' Page 1 headline: \n``Stimulus Bill Funds Programs Deemed `Ineffective' by the [Office of \nManagement and Budget].'' Then why are those programs still here? That \nwas yesterday's Investors Business Daily.\n  Today's headline: ``$789.5 Bill Stimulus Coming, But Will It Revive \nEconomy?''\n  We are going to spend all of this money, and every dollar we spend \nthat does not actually work to contribute to reviving the economy is an \nextra dollar our children and their children are going to owe to \nforeign nations because we did not have the self-control to limit our \nspending now.\n  And then the front page of the Wall Street Journal today, the big \nquestion: ``Next Challenge on Stimulus: Spending All That Money.''\n  Senator Bennett talked about a very expensive proposal that is going \nto be spent, and the Wall Street Journal said it would probably take \nthem about 8 years. By then, this economy is going to have changed \ndramatically.\n  This ``Next Challenge on Stimulus: Spending All That Money'' talks \nabout the Department of Energy. What does it have to say?\n\n       [Department of Energy] is going to have to dramatically \n     change how it does business if it hopes to push all this \n     money out the door. . . .They are going to need more people, \n     more oversight and more freedom to waive regulations.\n\n  If they are going to spend all this money in a timely manner, because \nthat is what this program is supposed to be--timely, temporary, and \ntargeted--if they are going to be able to spend this money in a timely \nmanner, they are going to have to waive regulations.\n  We will see how they do. This is the Department of Energy that has a \nhistory of delays and of letting costs spiral during the delay process. \nAnd that is today's Wall Street Journal.\n  Is there waste in this program? Absolutely. I think the people of \nWyoming get it right. I have had telephone townhall meetings. I have \nbeen home every weekend for the past three weekends. But the Powell \nTribune in Powell, WY, has a headline that says: ``Stimulus: Take time \nto get it right.''\n  If you live in Powell, WY, and you write for the paper in Powell, WY, \nyou are not one to ever want to quote the New York Times. Yet in this \neditorial they do. They talk about the New York Times. They said: A New \nYork Times editorial said, ``A bill that is merely better than nothing \nwon't be nearly good enough.''\n  ``A bill that is merely better than nothing won't be good enough. The \neconomy is too fragile. And the numbers are too huge.''\n  What I think we should do is people should, once the bills get to \ntheir desks, pack them up, take them home with them, read them on the \nplane, read them in the car, read them on the train, read them as they \ngo home, and then talk with people about what is in the bill, and then \ncome back and vote on it. Then I think this Senate and the House would \nknow what the people of America would say. Take the time to get it \nright. This bill is too big. It spends too much. The cost is too great.\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\nThe risk is too high. And for somebody from Wyoming, it seems to me as \nthough we are firing all our bullets at once, spending close to $1 \ntrillion on a package that we don't know whether it is going to work, \nand if additional help is needed, we will have run out of ammunition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today we will pass an economic \nrecovery bill designed to create and save jobs. There are many reasons \nour economy is in trouble. One can point to the housing bubble and \nbust, failure to properly regulate financial markets, two wars that we \nhave not paid for, and a global credit crunch. But whatever the causes \nfor our economic crisis, a common thread running through the fabric of \nour economy is energy. I believe that a decade of shortsighted energy \npolicies and missed opportunities has contributed to the economic \ncrisis we face today.\n  I also believe a way out of this crisis can be found if we develop a \nsmart energy policy. That is what I want to talk about today.\n  Investments in energy technology, energy conservation, and \nsustainable energy will be an important part of the path to economic \nrecovery. We need to get on that path soon. One way we can move forward \nis to pass legislation establishing a national renewable electricity \nstandard, which is known as an RES. This week, I am joining Senator Tom \nUdall from New Mexico in introducing such a bill.\n  Establishing a national renewable electricity standard is a goal I \nhave been striving to achieve for many years. In 1997, as a Colorado \nState legislator, I introduced several bills designed to advance \nrenewable energy, including a State renewable portfolio standard. While \nmy bills were voted down in committee and never reached the full House \nfloor, my work in the Colorado House laid a path for action.\n  In 2004, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I traveled \nacross Colorado with our then-State House Speaker, Republican Lola \nSpradley, campaigning for the Nation's first statewide RES ballot \nmeasure.\n  Despite well-publicized objections from Colorado's electricity \nproviders, Colorado voters approved amendment 37, which required 10 \npercent renewable energy production for our State by the year 2015. \nAfter we easily reached that goal within a few years, the Colorado \nlegislature increased this RES to 20 percent by the year 2020, this \ntime with the support of those very electricity providers who opposed \nthe measure initially because they came to realize the bottom line \nbenefits of utilizing renewable sources of energy.\n  I have continued this work at the Federal level since being elected \nto the House of Representatives. In 2003, again along with my cousin \nTom Udall, I introduced a bill to create a national RES. This bill \nbecame the basis for a measure we passed out of the House in 2007. This \nmeasure would have created an RES of 15 percent by the year 2020 for \nour entire Nation.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment did not make it through the Senate. It \nfailed by one vote and was not included in the 2007 Energy bill. But \nnow thankfully, under the leadership of Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, and with the growing support of a \nnumber of new Senators, we will have opportunities in this Congress to \nagain pursue a national RES.\n  Early this week, Chairman Bingaman held a hearing on his draft \nlanguage for an RES of 20 percent by the year 2020. I would like to \nthank Chairman Bingaman for holding this important hearing and for his \nleadership on this issue. I look forward to working with him to get a \nstrong bill through the committee, through both Houses of Congress, and \nto the President's desk.\n  My desire to win this fight and to help the chairman is why I joined \nwith Senator Tom Udall to introduce this Udall-Udall RES bill that \nwould require 25 percent of our electricity produced from renewable \nenergy sources by 2025. RES is important for many reasons. As demand \nfor energy continues to grow in this country, we need to make sure we \ncontinue to have affordable and reliable electricity supplies.\n  As demand for energy continues to grow in this country, we need to \nmake sure that we continue to have affordable and reliable supplies. \nAnd, most importantly, as we move to more competition in the delivery \nof electricity, we must make sure consumers and the environment are \nprotected. So it makes sense to put incentives in place to ensure that \nless polluting and environmentally responsible sources of energy can \nfind their way into the marketplace. That is what a renewable \nelectricity standard, or RES, would help to do.\n  Not least, our bill would reduce air pollution from dirty fossil fuel \npowerplants that threaten public health and our climate.\n  But this bill is also about addressing two of the greatest challenges \nfacing our country--national security and economic growth. With almost \nall of the new electricity generation during the last decade fueled by \nnatural gas, our domestic supply cannot sustain our needs.\n  Just think, Iran, Russia, and Qatar together hold 58 percent of the \nworld's natural gas reserves. As demand for power continues to grow, we \nshould not be forced to rely on these unstable regions to sustain our \neconomy, nor do we have to.\n  The best way to decrease our vulnerability and dependence on foreign \nenergy sources is to diversify our energy portfolio.\n  Half of the States in our great Union have already figured this out \nand have made the commitment to producing a percentage of their \nelectricity using renewable energy.\n  But all of our States will benefit from a national standard, which \nwill lower natural gas costs nationwide, create new economies of scale \nin manufacturing and installation, and offer greater predictability to \nlong-term investors. By reducing the cost of new clean technologies and \nmaking them more available, as a national RES would do, it would help \nrestrain natural gas price increases.\n  This bill will spur economic development with billions of dollars in \nnew capital investment and new tax revenues for local communities, as \nwell as millions of dollars in new lease payments for farmers and rural \nlandowners.\n  For those not yet convinced of the benefits of an RES, I would ask \nthem to look at what has happened in Colorado. Vestas, a major wind \nturbine supplier, identified our State RES as a determining factor in \nlocating 2,500 jobs in Colorado for its wind turbine manufacturing \nheadquarters. Additionally, Colorado Governor Bill Ritter has estimated \nthat just the solar component of the RES has brought 1,500 new solar \njobs to Colorado.\n  Now, Mr. President, some have argued that a national RES would burden \nsome regions of the country at the expense of other regions. I would \nargue the opposite. A national RES would, in fact, create public \nbenefits for all.\n  The bill's definition of ``renewables'' is broad, including biomass \nsuch as cellulosic organic materials; plant or algal matter from \nagricultural crops, crop byproducts, or landscape waste; gasified \nanimal waste and landfill gas, otherwise known as biogas; and all kinds \nof crop-based liquid fuels. The definition includes incremental \nhydropower; solar and solar water heating; wind; ocean, ocean thermal, \nand tidal; geothermal; and distributed generation. Every State has one \nor more of these resources.\n  Further, the argument that the Southeast would be disadvantaged by a \nnational RES--that the Southeast has no renewable resources--has been \nshown to be inaccurate. In fact, the Southeast is one of the regions of \nthe country that would see the most benefit from this proposal. \nAccording to the Department of Energy's Energy Information \nAdministration, the technology that does best under a national RES is \nbiomass. Already, 2,500 megawatts of generation come from biomass in \nthe Southeast, and much of the waste from pulp and paper mills has yet \nto be used for generating electricity.\n  In summary, a national renewable electricity standard will reduce \nharmful air and water pollution, provide a sustainable, secure energy \nsupply now,\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\nand create new investment, income and jobs in communities all over our \ncountry. That is why I look forward to working closely with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to ensure the adoption of a national renewable \nelectricity standard.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nif it is necessary, to be fair to the other side, I will take it out of \nthe time I have over here, or equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Friday the 13th, there is \nsuperstition that says we shouldn't be walking under ladders, we should \navoid black cats crossing our paths, and certainly you wouldn't \npurposely break mirrors, would you. But since this is the first \nsignificant piece of legislation in this Congress, and under our new \nPresident, we ought to take a look in the legislative mirror at what we \nare doing when we vote here today.\n  If you look at the developments of this legislation, you will see \nsome patterns. No. 1, House Democrats put together their priorities and \ndrove their priorities through the House of Representatives. They \ndidn't pretend to take any Republican input and they left out 11 of \ntheir own Members in the House of Representatives, as we saw from the \n11 Democrats who voted against it. In the Senate, Republicans were \nconsulted, and that is a very positive thing, but we were never invited \nto the negotiating table.\n  We saw this pattern repeat itself at committee levels and on the \nfloor here and, of course, the most obvious one, at the conference \nstage. When Republicans offered ideas, generally they were rejected. \nThere were a few exceptions, and the chart behind me will show what \nthose few exceptions were.\n  The chart deals with one of the improvements--the alternative minimum \ntax. This is 2006 return data, so it might understate its impact, but \nyou can see that every State would add up to about 20 million for the \nyear 2006. If the 2008 patch were not passed, it would probably add up \nto 23 million, 24 million middle-class Americans who would be hit if we \ndidn't do something on the alternative minimum tax. Each one of us can \nlook at our own individual State. But you can see that there are high \npercentages of middle-class people who would be hit by the alternative \nminimum tax. That needs to be done.\n\n  I heard detracting remarks on whether we ought to do that in a \nstimulus package. It is not as stimulative as some parts of it. I think \nI heard some figures from the other side that it might be 2 cents on \nthe dollar--or $1.02 of stimulus as opposed to other places where, as \nwith food stamps, you might get a $3 or $4 return on the investment \nfrom a stimulus. But it needs to be there for the simple reason that in \neach of the last 2 years, we have waited a long period of time to do \nit, and it has created problems for the IRS to do their form work when \nyou do the alternative minimum tax in November.\n  I pushed this amendment, an extension of the alternative minimum tax \npatch. I thank the conferees for retaining it in conference. Many in \nthe Democratic leadership--most particularly the senior Senator from \nIllinois--argued that I should support the package based upon that \namendment alone. I agree with my friend from Illinois that the package \nwas improved with that amendment. I also point out that all these \nfamilies in his State--and you can look at Illinois, where there is a \nfabulous number of middle-income taxpayers, 909,000 right now, before \nthis bill is signed by the President--would be obligated to pay that \nalternative minimum tax. In my State of Iowa, it is a large number; not \nquite that big.\n  We need to point out that all the families from his State and \nfamilies from my State will get a tax cut averaging $2,300 due to the \namendment. We on this side pushed for that.\n  I do not get what the senior Senator from Illinois was saying. I only \nheard him say it last night because I was on the floor at that \nparticular time. I don't get why he doesn't accept the improvements \nbased on merits alone and not whether it has anything to do with who \nsupports this bill or who does not. Why he feels the need to continue \nto criticize me by name for improving the bill is beyond my \ncomprehension.\n  Now, instead of repeatedly criticizing me by name, I hope the senior \nSenator from Illinois would listen to what I have to say and reflect on \nit. We do not need to be partisan, cutout cartoon characters. We can \nactually engage in some real debate. In that vein, many on my side \ncould probably support the conference agreement before us, with more \nimprovements such as the one the senior Senator from Illinois has \ncriticized me for offering, the alternative minimum tax. President \nObama could get the 80 votes he wanted and still have a stimulus bill.\n  But on this side we will supply those additional votes, maybe pushing \nthe total to 80, only if we believe the bill as a whole would improve \nthe economy. To that end, House and Senate Republicans offered \namendments in committee and on the floor to improve this bill the \nfollowing ways. I have about four examples.\n  No. 1: to tie the spending of this bill to the period in which the \neconomy is sagging. That was Senator McCain's trigger amendment. If \nSenator McCain had prevailed, taxpayers would know their tax dollars \nwould be protected once the economy recovered. It was a good, fiscally \nresponsible idea. It was rejected largely along party-line votes.\n  No. 2 example: to ensure that the huge amount of State aid money, \nalmost $87 billion for Medicaid alone, was used by the States to \nprevent tax increases or cuts in important services. We had amendments \nto do that. The amendments required States to maintain their efforts on \nkeeping taxes low and not cutting services. That was rejected largely \nalong party lines.\n  Another example was to build on the individual tax relief in the \npackage. On this side, we offered amendments to expand the relief in \namount and by the number of taxpayers. Those amendments also were \nlargely rejected along party lines.\n  The last example: we tried to divert some of the over $1 trillion in \nthis bill--that is $1 trillion when interest on this debt is included--\nto home mortgages and housing problems. We offered amendments to do \nthat. Senator Isakson prevailed with his amendment to provide a robust \ntax credit for home purchases. How was that amendment received in the \nconference committee? The answer is it was dumped and new social \nspending, the priority of a lot of House Democrats, was added back.\n  These are just a few examples. I would like to remind my colleagues \nthat we would cut back the cost of the bill. Ask Senator McCain. I am \nsure he will explain, in detail, the large amounts of money that could \nbe saved.\n  The true test is in the press reports. They note the conference \nreport is not too far off from the basic plans laid out by the \nDemocratic leadership. The bottom line is the basic outlines of the \nplan did not move all that much between what was originally passed in \nthe House, originally passed in the Senate, and what comes out of \nconference. It goes back to my basic point--to be bipartisan you have \nto have a real offer to negotiate and a sincere objective to entertain \neach other's point of view. There is no better evidence of that kind of \npattern than the record Senator Baucus and I have established in the \ncommittee, the Finance Committee, during the years I chaired the \ncommittee and during the years he has chaired the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is 10 minutes for morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask to be notified after 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I truly believe the legislation before us is a \nhistoric piece of\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\nlegislation. It is a piece of legislation that changes the course the \nUnited States has steered throughout its history, by moving us rather \nsignificantly and precipitously toward a European model of an economy. \nThe Government's share of GDP has historically been about 20 percent \nfor the last 34 years, up and down, 17, 21, 22. One score--when you put \nall the stimulus money, all the bank money and all the bailout money \nand what we may expect to see in the future--one score indicated that \nit could reach 39 percent. In 1 year, we go from 21 or so percent of \nGDP to 39 percent of GDP. They say this is a temporary stimulus \npackage. But it is not a temporary stimulus package. It has all kinds \nof permanent expenditures, creates new Government programs, and spends \nmore money on things such as IDEA, special education--$14 billion on \nthat existing program. Does anybody think we are going to reduce that \nin the future by any significant degree?\n  This bill funds program after program that will be increased in size, \nand the Government spending will then account for a larger percentage \nof our economy.\n  As George Will wrote--he is frequently, I think, thoughtful and \nwise--recently:\n\n       If this is not a matter that ought to be politically \n     discussed, what is?\n\n  So we want to be nonpartisan, bipartisan, and work together. But if \nyou realize that we are undertaking an expenditure, the largest in the \nhistory of the Republic, the largest in the history of any nation in \nthe world, in one fell swoop, and if you believe that is going to move \nus significantly in a way that alters the historic principle of this \nNation that believes in limited Government, then you need to be here \ntalking about it and opposing it and voting against it.\n  I think it is pretty clear. I know a lot of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, a lot of new Senators who came in recently, \nthey are uneasy about this legislation. But they have been led along, I \nam afraid, by the leadership and some of the others and listened to the \nSiren songs and are going along with this legislation.\n  I do not think, in years to come, they are going to be that proud of \nit. I just don't think so. I wish that some way, even in these last \nmoments, we could stop this train, go back and look at a piece of \nlegislation that might be better. The House proposed legislation. \nSenator Thune offered it here. Some folks have taken a look at \nChristina Romer's work. She is the Obama administration's top economic \nadviser.\n  She put a model out on how to evaluate a stimulus-type legislation \nlast year. They believe their legislation, following her model of what \ncreates jobs, following her analysis, would create twice as many jobs \nat half the cost and not create so many permanent Government \nbureaucracies and programs that are going to absorb more and more of \nAmerica's wealth.\n  I think this is a big deal, and I do not like the process. The bill \ngot out in the middle of the night, and now we are supposed to vote \ntoday. There is hardly time to read it. It is $1 billion per page, 700, \n800 pages, maybe more in there, and almost $1 billion per page. If you \nadd up the minutes between now and the time we will be voting, it is \nalmost $1 billion a minute. One professor at Hillsdale College notes \nthat this represents--$789 billion is almost equal to all the currency \nin circulation in America today. It is a stunning piece of legislation.\n  I want to repeat something that I have spoken about before. In my \nview, there was a deliberate plan that was hatched to create a \nperception that something would be done in this legislation that would \nrequire any business that obtained money out of this program, any \ncontractor, to use the Government E-Verify Program. All you have to do \nwith this program is punch into the computer the Social Security number \nof the people who seek employment and have it checked by the Department \nof Homeland Security. And we are finding that a considerable number of \npotential new hires--not too many but a considerable number--are here \nillegally. Now, let me ask my colleagues, is it the desire of the \nMembers of this body that the stimulus money to create jobs--that those \njobs should be given to people illegally in the country? People who are \nhere lawfully, green card holders or temporary workers, if they are \nlawfully here, they can have a job under the program. I am not \nobjecting to that. But the Government has a computer system, and 2,000 \nbusinesses a week are signing up to use it voluntarily. Nobody has \nrequired them to do that. Those businesses are finding that some of the \npeople who apply are not here legally, and they are not hiring them, as \na good citizen company should do. They are not supposed to hire \nillegals--in fact, it is a criminal offense if they knowingly hire \npeople who are in the country illegally. So why would we not do that? \nWhy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Why would we not include this simple requirement? Well, let me tell \nyou, the American people want us to do it, overwhelmingly, and I think \nthe leaders of this body know that. So a clever plan was hatched. I \nbegan to get the feel for it when I began to offer this amendment. \nThree or four times I offered the amendment. Many amendments were voted \non on the floor during this debate. The leadership was most proud of \nthat: Oh, we had a lot of votes. But some did not get voted on. This \nwas one that did not. Why? It passed the House last year. One part of \nmy amendment was passed on a floor vote of 407 to 2 to extend the E-\nVerify Program, which is set to expire in March. The other part was \naccepted in the Appropriations Committee, without objection, and that \npart would say that if you get a contract under this jobs bill, you \nwould use E-Verify. So the House passed it. It was in their bill. All \nbut 11 Democrats voted for the overall bill, so they voted for the E-\nVerify provision. And I am sure that the Republicans and the 11 \nDemocrats, had they been asked to vote on just this provision, would \nhave voted for it too. So it was virtually unanimous in the House.\n  So I kept pushing it here, and if it had passed here, using the same \nlanguage our House colleagues used, it would have--absent skullduggery, \nwhich sometimes happens--been in the final bill because it would have \nbeen in the House bill and the Senate bill and become law.\n  So the House Members are most proud. They voted for it. They voted \nwith their constituents. They voted for common sense. They voted for \nAmerican jobs. And they are proud of themselves.\n  The Senate, however, did not get to vote on it--sorry, Jeff, we just \ncouldn't find time to get your vote. We had all the other votes, but we \ndid not have time for yours.\n  No Senator is now on record as having voted against E-Verify. But \njust as I predicted, they went to conference and they got with Speaker \nPelosi and Majority Leader Reid, who control the conference--both of \nthem pick the conferees; a majority of Democrats on both the House and \nSenate side, and they had the power to write the bill as they chose--\nand lo and behold, surprise, they took it out. They did not want it in \nfrom the beginning. They systematically maneuvered around to get a plan \nto take it out, and they think they can pass the bill without it, and \nperhaps they will. And who is to lose? Low-skilled, honest, decent \nAmerican workers out looking for a job.\n  Let me tell you about E-Verify. Doris Meissner, who is the former \nhead of the Immigration Service under President Clinton, in a report \nlast week, February 2009, said this:\n\n       Mandatory--\n\n  That is what we are doing, requiring these companies to use E-Verify, \nnot mandatory now--\n\n     employer verification must be at the center of legislation to \n     combat illegal immigration . . . the E-Verify system provides \n     a valuable tool for employers who are trying to comply with \n     the law. E-Verify also provides an opportunity to determine \n     the best electronic means--\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. She goes on to say that:\n\n       E-Verify also provides the best opportunity to determine \n     the best electronic means to implement verification \n     requirements. The administration--\n\n  She is talking about the Obama administration--\n\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\n\n     should support reauthorization of E-Verify and expand the \n     program.\n\n  Alexander Aleinkoff, a Clinton administration official, called it a \n``myth'' that there is ``little or no competition between undocumented \nworkers and American workers.''\n  And I would say, I am disappointed. I am not surprised, I could see \nhow this was headed for the last week or so. I hoped it was not so. I \nraised openly my concern with the majority leader and the bill managers \nthat this would happen, and I am now seeing it happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today all over the country, millions \nof Americans went to work unsure whether they would bring home a \npaycheck or a pink slip. Today, millions of Americans got up, put on \ntheir suit, left the house, not go to work, but for another interview, \nanother visit to the unemployment office, another spot in the long \nhiring line. Today, millions of Americans will have that late-night \nsession at the kitchen table trying to figure out how they are going to \nmake ends meet on their stressed family budget. And today, millions of \nAmericans worried how they could afford it if a child or an elderly \nparent were to get sick. In my home State of Rhode Island, where the \nunemployment rate is the highest it has been in decades, the second \nhighest in the country, I hear stories like this over and over again.\n  This past Sunday, I had one of our community dinners that we hold. \nThis one was at the Tri-City Elks Lodge in Warwick. More than 200 \npeople came from all over the State to talk to me about their struggles \nto afford health care in this economy. From them all, the message was \nthe same: We are trying to get by, but times are tough and we feel the \ndeck is stacked against us so we just can't make ends meet. What can \nyou do to help?\n  Our economy, our country, is in crisis. Americans are urging us to \ntake action now, before things get worse, before it is too late. So \nthis week, the Senate took action. It was not easy, it is not perfect, \nand it will not be cheap. But it was the right thing to do. The bill we \npassed on Tuesday will create or save 12,000 jobs just in Rhode Island \nover the next 2 years. Many of those jobs will come from new \ninvestments in Rhode Islands's infrastructure, including millions for \nroad and bridge repair, to improve drinking water and sewer systems, \nand to help families weatherize their homes and cut their energy bills.\n  The recovery plan will provide a refundable tax credit, a downpayment \non the middle-class tax cut President Obama promised this country. That \ncredit will reach 470,000 Rhode Island workers and families, giving as \nmuch as $800 worth of breathing room in a family's budget in this year \nwhen every little bit counts.\n  I am also proud that the recovery bill will provide a one-time $250 \npayment to those living on Social Security or SSDI. In the Ocean State, \nwe know that for vulnerable seniors, that little bit of extra help from \nthe Federal Government can make the difference between housing and \nhomelessness, between health and sickness. Approximately 138,000 Rhode \nIslanders receive Social Security, so this bill will mean more than $34 \nmillion into Rhode Island's economy for Rhode Island seniors and those \nwho are disabled.\n  The recovery plan will send an additional $100 a month in \nunemployment insurance benefits to 86,000 Rhode Island workers who have \nlost their jobs, and it will provide extended unemployment benefits to \nan additional 17,000 laid-off Rhode Island workers.\n  The bill we passed does not stop there. It increases Pell grants so \npeople who cannot find work can go to college, improve their skills, \nand come back into the workforce better trained, and in better days. It \nincreases funding for food stamps, for Head Start and other early \nchildhood education programs, and for Medicaid--all to help struggling \nfamilies just weather this storm.\n  It includes $18 billion in Medicare and Medicaid incentives to build \nhealth information infrastructure to improve the quality and safety and \nefficiency of our health care system.\n  The bill we passed will put people back to work. It will jump-start \nour faltering economy, and it will support struggling families. It is \nnot a perfect bill, but at this moment, in this crisis, it is \nnecessary.\n  We tried to do this together with our Republican friends. President \nObama reached out his hand in unprecedented ways. George Bush never \nonce came to the Senate to talk to us, to Senate Democrats. President \nObama traveled to Congress to meet with the House Republicans; he came \nover here to meet with the Senate Republicans; he did individual calls \nand meetings. Three Republican Senators, Senators Snowe and Collins of \nMaine and the distinguished ranking member of our Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Specter, heard his call, put their country first, and helped us \npass this bill. I do not agree with all of the compromises that they \nrequired, but without them, we might have had no bill at all.\n  But from the vast majority of Republicans in Congress, from every \nRepublican Member of the House of Representatives, what did President \nObama get for his pains? They slapped away his hand of friendship, and \nthey gloated about it, saying, ``The goose egg you laid on the \nPresident's desk, [the goose egg meaning zero Republican votes in the \nHouse of Representatives] was just beautiful.''\n  They claimed--hold your horses here--to take inspiration from the \nTaliban. They said their boycott of President Obama's bill was a \npolitical shot in the arm going forward.\n  And their party leader said this:\n\n       You and I know that in the history of mankind and \n     womankind, government--federal, state or local--has never \n     created one job.\n\n  I guess his history book ended at the chapter on Herbert Hoover. Mr. \nSteele, read on; read the next chapter about Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nand the Works Progress Administration and the Citizens Conservation \nCorps and how the Government got us out of the Great Depression.\n  Another measure of whether our Republican friends are being fair is \nto look at the arguments they have made. Do they make sense?\n  ``We should do housing first.'' We have heard that one. Well, fixing \nthe housing market is, indeed, important. But actions speak louder than \nwords, and while the Republicans' words call for action, their actions \nspell obstruction. They still resist the single most important and \neffective thing we can do to stem foreclosures, which is Senator \nDurbin's bill to allow bankruptcy courts to modify mortgages on \nprincipal residences, the only loans that don't have this authority in \nall loans in our country.\n  And when we tried to address the housing crisis only a few months \nago, they stopped all those bills, refused to allow us to move forward \nbecause they said expanding--remember this--oil drilling was more \nimportant and we had to do that first. It's the number one issue facing \nthe American public.\n  Look where we are now and how important oil drilling is in our \ncrisis. If we had done housing first, can you not see the signs here \nsaying: Jobs first? I fear our friends would rather move the goalposts \nthan move legislation.\n  ``It is full of spending, and it is too big.'' Yes, it is full of \nspending. The recession of consumer spending and business spending is \nwhat is draining the economy. The whole idea is to counterbalance the \nloss of that spending with Government spending. And you know what? It \nis probably not enough. Our economy has already lost more than 3.6 \nmillion jobs since the peak of the business cycle in December 2007, and \n11.6 million Americans are currently looking for work. A report last \nmonth estimated that in the absence of this legislation, we could lose \nanother 3 to 4 million jobs. This legislation will create or preserve 3 \nto 4 million jobs. 11.6 million Americans out of work. This \naccomplishes the first necessary step of stopping the bleeding. But \nmore, I suspect, will be required to cure the patient. Realistically, \nthe danger that this bill is too small is worse than the danger that it \nis too big.\n  ``The bill doesn't all create jobs.'' Well that is true. But let's \nlook at two examples of provisions that don't create jobs--Pell grants \nand Medicaid. The Pell grant money lets people step out of the market \nfor jobs at a time when it is highly stressed, train up, improve their \nskills, and move back in in better times. Isn't that smart? Doesn't \nthat make sense for the country?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 more minutes.\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The health care spending will protect precarious \nState budgets and protect people's health care as they ride out the \nstorm. Isn't that the decent thing to do as this storm hits American \nfamilies?\n  Another argument: ``Some of it isn't soon enough.'' Well health \ninformation technology, for instance, will take a while to ramp up, but \nit is necessary infrastructure to avert the $35 trillion health care \ncalamity now bearing down on us. It has to be done sooner or later. The \nrecession will almost certainly be here 2 years from now, and if it \ndoes take a little while to do, isn't that all the more reason to start \nnow?\n  And then there are the--what I call the ``oh, please'' arguments. The \nparty that ran up nearly $8 trillion in debt under George Bush--now \nthat Barack Obama has been elected, and now in the one time of crisis \nwhen every respectable economist is saying this is the time for deficit \nspending--now suddenly gets religion about deficit spending? If this \nweren't so serious, it would practically be funny.\n  Finally this: If our opponents cared about jobs and putting people to \nwork quickly with effective, valuable infrastructure, why such \nwidespread opposition to the $20 billion for school repair and \nconstruction? This money could have put contractors to work on school \nrepairs, green renovation, weatherization, and conservation measures. \nIt would have made schools cleaner and greener. It would have lowered \nlocal fuel budgets, and it would have reduced dependence on foreign \noil. What does opposition to that tell you?\n  And what did they argue for? Here is a golden oldie: Reduced \ncorporate tax rates. How many companies do you think are out there \nreporting big, taxable profits in this economy?\n  On even brief consideration, the Republican arguments against the \nbill don't hold water. It is instant replay of the same, tired, flawed \nideology that put us in this mess in the first place. Barack Obama did \nnot ask for this mess. He inherited this mess. Barack Obama would \nrather have come into a budget surplus, a growing economy, and a \ntrajectory to a debt-free America, like George Bush and Dick Cheney \ndid. But that is not what they left him. And now he's the guy who has \nto dig us out of their mess. In simple decency, you would think the \nleast one could ask is that the party whose President made the mess not \nslap away Barack Obama's hand of friendship. ``I am sorry, but I won't \nhelp you clean up my mess unless you do it my way.''\n  After weeks to ventilate their arguments, our friends now have an \nopportunity to show that when all is said and done, they care more \nabout moving the country forward than scoring political points. Now we \nhave the chance to come together and pass this bill and send to it \nPresident Obama's desk so we can begin to restore confidence and hope \nto our country.\n  I hope--I hope--our Republican friends will join us. There is too \nmuch at stake to do nothing.\n  I thank the presiding officer, I thank distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her courtesy in yielding me additional time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the bill \ncoming from the House shortly. We have had a chance to look at this \nbill for the last few hours. There is much in it that is different from \nwhat passed the Senate. Some of it is different from what passed the \nHouse as well.\n  I wish to address a few points that have been made. It is somewhat \nmisleading to talk about the Republican input in the way it is being \ndescribed. First, the bill was written without any Republican input. It \nwas written in the House of Representatives by Democrats. There were no \namendments allowed. The committees were not allowed to exercise their \njurisdiction on the bill there. It came to the Senate. I was on the \nAppropriations Committee which passed the spending part of the bill. \nAmendments were discouraged. The meeting lasted a couple hours. The \nsame thing happened on the Finance Committee, which is the tax part of \nthe bill. There were no amendments that were hammered out. There was \nnot an amendment process where we gave and took. To say Republicans had \na chance to have input is disingenuous.\n  I respect the President of the United States for coming and talking \nto Republicans. He talked to the Republican Senators and House Members. \nThat is good. There is nothing bad about that because he is a smart and \ncivilized man whom we all respect. We want the President to work with \nCongress as we go forward. But talking should include taking ideas and \nshaping them into something on which we could all say we had a part. If \nI could support half this bill, I would be inclined to look at it in a \nway that maybe I would be able to support. But let's look at what this \nbill is.\n  It has a total cost of $787 billion. The spending portion is $580 \nbillion. With interest, the cost of the bill is going to be about a \ntrillion dollars. I take the cost of a trillion dollars, and borrowing \nthat money from the future, very seriously. We ought to spend some time \nbefore we spend $1 trillion in a bill that is going to be off the \nbudget and is not in any projected budget we have seen. It is going to \nadd almost $1 trillion to the deficit. Is it going to succeed? I hope \nit does. But let's talk about what is in the bill.\n\n  Eleven percent of the spending in this bill will occur this year. The \npurpose of a stimulus bill is to stimulate the economy quickly. We are \ntalking about almost $1 trillion and 11 percent is spent this year. A \nstimulus bill should inject money into the economy that will cause jobs \nto be either produced or kept, that will produce spending so there will \nbe something for people to make and retailers to sell. After we have \nthat stimulus, which we hope would be in the private sector and \ntherefore permanent, then we are going to have to deal with the deficit \nin years 3 through 10, so we don't have an upside down situation where \nwe have so much debt that either our foreign investors will not buy our \ndebt or, if they do, the risk is so high that they increase the \ninterest rate, which then becomes an inflationary problem. This is not \na stimulus package when 11 percent is spent in the first year.\n  Eighteen percent of this conference report is dedicated to tax \nrelief. I believe tax relief has been proven again and again to spur \nthe economy. President Kennedy gave tax relief, and it spurred the \neconomy and increased revenue. President Reagan, tax relief, and it \nincreased revenue. President Bush, in 2001 and 2003, when we were \nhaving a rough time in the economy, the tax cuts gave us the largest \nincrease in revenue in the history of America.\n  People scoff at tax relief as part of a stimulus package. How can \nthey scoff, when it has been proven again and again to work? In this \nconference report, 18 percent is tax relief. It is not even tax relief \nthat will spur the economy. The tax relief is the Making Work Pay \nCredit which is going to be approximately $7.65 per week in tax relief \nfor a worker. That is going to be limited to $400 a worker.\n  Speaking of what has been tested, last year, when we became concerned \nthat the economy was beginning to lag, we passed a $600 tax credit. \nEvery economist I have read says it did nothing. It did not spur the \neconomy. It did not help our financial situation at all. That was $600 \nper person last year. This is going to be $400 per person, and it is \ngoing to be strung out in such small amounts in a person's paycheck, \nthey are not going to go out and spend money which is what you want in \na stimulus package. The stimulus provides $1.10 a day in tax relief to \nworkers, while saddling every American family with $9,400 in added \ndebt.\n\n  The home buyer credit the Senate added, which tries to correct the \nfundamental problem that started this whole economic downturn--\nhousing--is all but eliminated from the conference committee report. We \nhave an $8,000 credit for first-time home buyers. Now, I support this \nbecause it will be some credit for a first-time home buyer to go out \nand buy a home. But the Senate provision was $15,000 for any home \nbuyer. So we had the capability to give every home buyer that $15,000 \ntax credit so we would move inventory and allow homebuilders to start \nbuilding again, which would create jobs. That was changed in the \nconference report.\n  The conference drastically reduced the auto purchase deduction which \nwould have spurred our struggling auto industry and provided relief to \ndealers\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\nall across the country. I have a great sympathy for auto dealers. When \nwe were taking up the automobile manufacturing bailout, I was very \nconcerned about not only the manufacturers but also the dealers because \nthe dealers could not help what was happening in the auto manufacturing \nindustry. They had nothing to do with the manufacturing, but the \ndealers and the families who are supported by dealers were being hit \nagain and again and again because their buyers could not get credit and \nthey could not buy cars.\n  So we should have dealt in this bill with housing and credit. Those \nare the two things that caused this financial downturn, and so I hoped \nthe first things we would deal with in this package would be housing \nand credit, and I hope eventually we will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, 17 percent of the discretionary \nspending in this package is for infrastructure items. Now, \ninfrastructure is what we should be spending money on because \ninfrastructure is jobs. Infrastructure is American jobs. In this bill, \nwe do not have enough in infrastructure spending.\n  Mr. President, we should keep in mind that the money in this bill \nisn't temporary. There are concerns that it will be permanent. It is \nlikely that those funds will be extended well beyond the short window \nthat we claim to be acting in. And in that case, according to The \nHeritage Foundation, the total cost of the bill comes to $3.27 trillion \nover 10 years.\n  This is not the bill we should be passing right now. This bill did \nnot even have the signature of one Republican on the conference \ncommittee. We do not expect to have dominated the conference committee \nor the Senate or the House production of a bill, but to have no \nRepublican support cannot under any circumstances be declared \nbipartisan. Mr. President, 3 Republicans out of the Republican \ncontingent is just not bipartisan.\n  Let me add, in a couple of minutes, what we are for. I am for \nstimulus. We all know we need stimulus.\n  I would like tax cuts that would spur spending, not tax cuts that \nwould be dribbled out in such small amounts that no one would feel they \ncould go out and buy something. Tax cuts that would spur spending would \nbe in the form of a card, such as the converter box cards that were \nsent in the mail, that would be for specific purposes--maybe it would \nbe home improvements, maybe it would be weatherization. Specific \npurposes would require spending. It would be a card that people would \nknow they could spend, and it would make a difference in jump-starting \nthe economy.\n  Tax cuts that would spur hiring. It was sort of said on the other \nside that we do not need corporate rate deductions because no one is \nmaking a profit. Well, let's do something that would allow corporations \nto make a profit because that is when they hire people, when they are \nmaking a profit.\n  How about a tax credit for hiring people? That might make a \ndifference. How about spending on infrastructure? How about more than \n17 percent of $1 trillion going for infrastructure? That would be jobs \ntoday for people building bridges, building highways, building things \nthat would clearly be job creation.\n  I had an amendment which never made it to the floor that said that \nmilitary construction should be moved up from the Department of Defense \n5-year plan to 3 years. Military construction is money we know we are \ngoing to spend. The Department of Defense has a 5-year plan. They know \nexactly what their priorities are. We normally take it 1 year at a \ntime. Why not take the 5-year plan and bring it up and do it in 2 or 3 \nyears? Because we know it would be American jobs. We know it is money \nwe are going to spend anyway. It would be stimulative, and it would be \nthe right kind of spending. Instead, the conference cut the military \nspending in this bill from what passed in the Senate. The conference \ncut our military spending for hospitals and for Veterans' \nAdministration hospitals to increase the quality and access to health \ncare for our veterans. What kind of priority is that? And they are \nincreasing spending to save a mouse in San Francisco that might be \nendangered.\n  This is not a package we can be proud to give to the American people \nand say: It is worth tightening our belts to do this because it will \nmake a difference. But we can be for something. We do not say we should \nhave everything we propose. There are other good ideas on the other \nside. We acknowledge that. But this is not the right bill for the \nAmerican people, and I urge my colleagues to please consider their \npositions and let us do this right: tax cuts to spur spending, tax cuts \nto spur the opportunity for corporations and businesses to hire people, \nspending on infrastructure, more in military construction. That would \nbe a bill we could support.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I, too, want to speak about the conference committee \nreport. I did not think it was possible, but after waiting until late \nlast night to finally receive the text of this trillion-dollar economic \nbailout legislation, the Speaker of the House and the majority leader \ntook a bad bill and made it worse.\n  Fix housing first. The housing market is where the problems began, \nand it is where they will end. Fix housing first. So what did the \nnegotiators between the House and the Senate do? Amazingly, Democratic \nleadership managed to remove one of the provisions that would really do \nsome good and help address housing. Stripped from the conference report \nis Senator Isakson's home buyers tax credit extension amendment. \nExpanding that successful tax credit program--we know from the 1990s--\nwould have addressed the source of our economic crisis--housing--and \nwould help bring tentative homeowners back into the market. There are \nover 3.5 million homes on the market right now and no buyers. Instead \nof including this provision, the conferees replaced it with more \nwasteful Government spending. They have used our last bullet. They have \nmaxed out the Federal credit card. Every drop has been taken out of the \nwell, and they have spent this one-time money on expenses that will go \non and on--and that is the real problem--on and on with money we do not \nhave for things we do not need.\n  I have listened to the Democratic leadership speak on this \nlegislation over the past day or so and have been surprised as they \ndescribed it as bipartisan compromise legislation. I have been a Member \nof the Senate for 12 years, and in my experience, finding only three \nMembers of the minority party to support legislation and only involving \nthem at the end of the process is not bipartisan. It is not bipartisan \nin the slightest.\n  I am disappointed that we have reached this point. When we first \nbegan discussing this legislation, President Obama asked for change. He \nasked for a bipartisan economic stimulus measure, something that could \ngarner as many as 80 votes. I wanted to see that as well. I wanted to \nsee legislation that both parties could support because the economic \ncrisis we are in is not a partisan problem. Unfortunately, the \nlegislation we have before us is partisan, and it reads like a list of \nbundled liberal priorities that could not gain support individually. \nHow do I know? It is a wish list that could not be passed for the last \n20 years because they could not find the money.\n  Democratic leaders, even at the exclusion of other Democrats, wrote a \nbill, brought it to the floor, and then negotiated with Republicans \nthey thought they could pick off. Several saw what was happening and \ndropped out. They picked three off by asking what it would take to get \nthem to vote for the Democratic bill and making a few changes. It was \nnot a bill made by both parties.\n  President Obama turned the drafting of this bill over to the Speaker \nof the House and other Democratic leaders who did not consult \nRepublicans and even said: We won the election, we get to write the \nbill. Then the President went out on the campaign trail to stump for a \nplan crafted solely by Democratic leaders in the House and\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\nSenate. He complained that he reached out to Republicans but they did \nnot reach back. Reaching out cannot just be an afterthought.\n\n  The supporters are using the politics of fear. Fear mongering adds to \nthe problem.\n  I was not part of the initial ``gang of eight'' Republican Senators \nwho were handpicked to work with Senator Ben Nelson and the majority \nleader on a ``compromise'' ``stimulus'' bill. I would note, however, \nthat five of the eight Republicans quickly saw how superficial the \ncompromise was going and bowed out.\n  I nevertheless offered and supported ways to improve the bill that \nwas put forward by some of my colleagues. I am not just talking about \namendments you saw on the floor that would reduce the price. Those were \nsimply efforts to salvage something out of the wreck. I suggested \nremoving a number of things that did not make sense--policies backed by \nRepublicans and policies backed by Democrats. I always recognize that \nboth sides have to have things left out to be fair. I also backed \nmoving the bill forward in several understandable pieces so we could \nbring the American public along.\n  I offered amendments that sought to improve several parts of the \nbill, including a change that would make sure the billions of taxpayer \ndollars spent to pay for health information technology would go toward \nitems that will actually work in the real world. This was a real \nbipartisan effort which enjoyed broad support among both Republicans \nand Democrats. In fact, I did get an amendment adopted that was just \ntechnical changes, and that was difficult to do. I think it has been \nripped out now too. But the bill will not work without those.\n  Unfortunately, it, along with my efforts to try to protect patients \nfrom Government bureaucrats rationing their access to health care, was \nlargely ignored. As a result, I have strong concerns that this stimulus \nbill will likely backfire on patients and providers, resulting in more \nharm than any good we are likely to see from its ill-conceived and \nmisguided efforts.\n  We are going to do health care reform this year. Partisan pieces do \nnot have to be rushed through as ``stimulus.'' We do not have to \nlegislate on a spending bill.\n  This massive bill contains short-term and long-term spending, and I \nadvocated moving forward with the short-term spending immediately. I \nadvocated for addressing the housing crisis and the jobs crisis right \nnow. I suggested that after we dealt with those pieces of legislation, \nwe should work together on the long-term items, not jam them in with no \ntime for debate. Some of those items in this bill are important, but \nthey should be dealt with in a separate measure going through the \nnormal legislative process where we can have the time for real debate \nabout our Nation's priorities.\n  I am not happy about deficit spending in these bailouts. I realize \nsomething is wrong with our economy, and we need to take steps to fix \nit. I worked to create a bill that efficiently used taxpayer money to \nimprove the housing market and put people back to work. The \n``compromise'' we are forced to take or leave is so far off the mark \nand full of pork that it is obscene. I will not support spending money \nwe do not have for projects we do not need. I will support legitimate \nefforts put forward by either party that could help our country out of \nthis economic mess.\n  I have been very critical of this bill and other bailout bills passed \nlast year, and time is showing I made the right decisions opposing \nthose bailouts. I would support an economic stimulus package if only it \nlived up to the President's own threshold of being targeted, timely, \nand temporary. I am leery of spending one-time money on programs that \nwill have to continue. These will be continuing payments on our maxed-\nout credit card. But this bill does not fit with the President's words, \nand Democratic leadership has made no real effort to make it conform.\n  This bill is both bad in content and in process. It includes wasteful \nspending, including $2 billion for groups like ACORN and $1.3 billion \nfor Amtrak. Funding that was stripped from the Senate version for \nsexually transmitted disease prevention was included in the conference \nreport.\n  As is typical in Washington, programs that were Members' pet projects \nsaw ridiculous increases in the conference. The Senate bill provided $2 \nbillion for the High-Speed Rail Corridor Program. The House bill \nincluded no funding for the program. How did we compromise that? How \nmuch did the conference provide? It provided $8 billion. This is \ncompromise according to Congress. Both the House and the Senate version \nof the bill included $200 million for ``Transportation \nElectrification''--both bills, House and Senate--$200 million for \ntransportation electrification. Logically, one would then expect that \nthe conference would provide $200 million, but logic flies out the \nwindow around here when you come inside the beltway. The conference \nprovided $400 million--double what either body suggested.\n\n  I know how to do more than talk about bipartisanship. I have built a \ncareer on it without compromising my principles. Take a closer look and \nwe will see bipartisan isn't about compromise; it is about establishing \ncommon ground and finding a third way. First you sit down together with \nprinciples each side can agree on. That is probably about 80 percent of \nany issue. Then you identify the 20 percent you were never able to \nagree on and either leave that out or preferably find a new way both \nsides can agree on--one that hasn't already been down in the weeds and \nwashed for years and years. After you have the principles, you work on \nthe details, keeping what you can agree on and throwing out what you \ncan't, until you have legislation that is for and from both sides, from \nthe beginning. That didn't happen here.\n  Talk is cheap, but the latest economic bill pushed through by a \nmajority and three Republican Senators is not. And if this is the \ndescription of bipartisan support, then the House, with every \nRepublican and 11 Democrats voting no, must be bipartisan opposition. \nThis legislation is the single most expensive bill in the history of \nthe United States and it is being sold to the American people as a \n``compromise.'' Buyer beware.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of the time, I yield the floor, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the \nagreement that was reached a day or so ago by conferees on the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act and the inclusion of two priorities of \nmine in particular.\n  Before I give the substance of my remarks, let me commend the \nleadership of the Senate and the House as well as the Members on both \nsides of the so-called political divide in this Chamber and elsewhere \nwho helped put this together. I know there were many who obviously did \nnot want this bill to pass and who have spoken against it. Most, I \nbelieve, feel that inaction is unacceptable. We may have significant \ndisagreements about what should have been included in this package--\nwhether it is stimulative enough; whether the size of the package \nitself will provide the necessary jolt to our economy to have us moving \nin a better direction than the one we are obviously in. I happen to \nbelieve we are doing the right thing by doing this. I don't take any \ngreat joy or pleasure in the fact we are doing it, any more than I did \nwhen we had the vote last fall on the emergency economic stabilization \neffort. That was no great moment of joy either.\n  Normally when we pass legislation, we are directly helping some group \nor helping the country in some way. These efforts obviously help, but \nthey help us get out of a mess we are in, one that, in my view, could \nhave been avoided. This was not a natural disaster that occurred in our \ncountry; this was a manmade disaster--inattention, misfeasance, \nmalfeasance that allowed this country to watch the greatest economy in \nthe history of mankind evaporate in the pockets of many overnight. Job \nlosses--20,000 a day--with our fellow citizens finding themselves \nwithout an income. Nine thousand to\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\nten thousand homes a day are foreclosing in our country. Retirements \nare evaporating within minutes. People who have spent years \naccumulating, to be able to enjoy the latter years of their lives in \nsome peace and comfort and security, knowing they can take care of \nthemselves and their loved ones as they step out of the workforce and \nenjoy a well-deserved period of retirement, are now in jeopardy. People \nmay have to stay at work, if they can find work, at an older age in our \ncountry.\n  So while I am pleased this bill is going through and pleased that my \nState will be the beneficiary of some help at this particular hour, I \ndon't take any great pleasure in this moment at all; quite the \ncontrary. It saddens me that it has come to this. So with that as a \nframework, I wish to share some thoughts about what is in this bill and \nwhy I think it can be of some help to get us moving in the right \ndirection.\n  Most Americans I think are aware now that our economy has been in a \nrecession for the last 14 months or so and has impacted every State \ndifferently. My State of Connecticut is no exception. While the effects \nof the recession took a bit longer to hit my State than others, \neconomists believe Connecticut may take longer to recover for a variety \nof unique reasons, including the kinds of jobs we provide and the like. \nWe have lost about 125,000 jobs in my State. Close to 20,000 homes have \nbeen foreclosed on. One of my cities alone, the city of Bridgeport, has \nhad 1,100 foreclosures--one city, 1,100 foreclosures. That means our \nefforts to get our economy moving in this bill are going to be \nimportant to families all across the country, and certainly my State is \nno exception.\n  We are addressing many priorities with this economic recovery \npackage, providing urgent help to communities who are struggling in the \nmidst of this recession while making a downpayment on long-term needs \nas the new President, President Obama, has articulated in Indiana, in \nFlorida, and in Illinois, where he has spoken in townhall meetings \nabout this over the last several days, as he did in his first \nnationally televised press conference. At a time when layoffs are \nincreasing the rolls of the uninsured, this bill provides $24 billion \nin health care premium assistance to 7 million unemployed workers. I \ncan't begin to tell my colleagues how important that is.\n  I have held two townhall meetings in my State in the last two weeks \non health care. I had one at 8:30 on a Monday morning, which is a \ndreadful time to hold a townhall meeting, obviously. We anticipated \nmaybe 75 people might show up at the small community college on the \nbanks of the Connecticut River outside of Hartford. Well, 700 people \nshowed up at 8:30 in the morning to talk about health care and to talk \nabout what they are going through. The discussion was supposed to be \nabout coverage. Specifically, we had three themes: one on coverage, one \non costs, and one on prevention. But the conversation was far beyond \nthe issue of coverage. Seven hundred people showing up at 8:30 in the \nmorning. These are people who either didn't have coverage--most had \ncoverage, but couldn't afford the 42-percent increase in premiums they \nhave seen in the last 6 years.\n  Then, last Saturday at Western Connecticut State University at 2:30 \non a Saturday afternoon--not exactly, again, an optimum time for a \ntownhall meeting--500 people showed up to express their views and to \nlisten to some professionals in the field talk about what they thought \nought to be included in a comprehensive universal health care program, \none I hope that will be charting a course and moving forward very \nquickly. I know my great friend from Montana, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Max Baucus, is already deeply involved. Senator Ted \nKennedy has been a champion of this issue for decades. While he is \nstruggling with his own health issues, he is on the phone every day, \ntalking to everybody, and he wants his committee to be deeply involved \nin this effort as well.\n  But in the midst of it, until that gets done, more and more people--\nthe 20,000 a day who lose their jobs--if they had health care are \nlosing that as well. So the fact that we are providing $26 billion to \nhelp out unemployed workers at a time such as this, I think most \nAmericans--most; not all, but most Americans--would say that is the \nright thing for our country to do for hard-working people who, through \nno fault of their own, may find themselves on an unemployment line \ntoday, tomorrow, or next week, to know of the fear and fright that you \nmay have a health care crisis with you or your family and all of a \nsudden don't have the capacity to deal with it.\n  These people didn't lose their jobs because of something they did \nwrong and should not be put in a position where their ability to take \ncare of their families regarding their health care needs will be \ndisregarded.\n  To ensure that people have safe, affordable shelter during these \ntough economic times, there is a $4 billion downpayment on an estimated \n$30 billion backlog for capital repair needs in public housing. A lot \nof people are falling behind out there. That will put people to work, \nand that is the major goal here.\n  As we see families struggling to make ends meet, I am proud and \npleased that people in Connecticut will receive over a billion dollars \nin Medicaid assistance. Every State in the country and every Governor \nhas asked for assistance in this area. We have a program called the \nHUSKY Program--our Medicaid Program. It is strongly supported across \nthe political spectrum. This assistance will help out in that area.\n  I am glad we were able to include assistance for our fire first \nresponders. Fire departments in my State are reporting they are turning \ndown awarded what they call SAFER grants--funds used to put additional \npeople on these rigs. You ought to have at least four people in a rig \nwhen going out to deal with these fires and problems they have to face. \nThose numbers are dwindling. This bill provides assistance and support \nfor first responders. I am pleased to say that is the case.\n  We included $8.8 billion in stabilization funds to States to provide \nfor public safety and other critical services. That was a change--a \nwelcome one.\n  Across our State, from city to town, communities faced with budget \ndeficits are crunching the numbers to maintain critical education, \npolice, firefighter jobs, and services.\n  In East Hartford, CT, the town was forced to lay off 8 municipal \nemployees and eliminate 11 positions that were vacant or will be vacant \nbecause of retirements--including firefighters and police officers.\n  The city of Stamford was counting on $500,000 in State assistance \nthat was eliminated in the State budget in the last several days for \nthe city's $16 million overhaul of their police and fire radio systems, \nand that interoperability will get help.\n  The communities of Farmington and Colchester are trying to replace \ndecade-old fire engines.\n  These stabilization funds will help communities in my State, and \nothers across the country, to prevent layoffs of first responders, \nfirefighters and police officers, which are so critical to the well-\nbeing of our communities.\n  Our communities' safety must not get left behind during this economic \ndownturn. While the comprehensive economic recovery package before us \ntoday will provide critical support for a broad range of additional \nneeds, there are three issues I want to focus on today.\n  First, I wish to highlight an amendment I authored to restrict \nexecutive compensation and bonuses. I have to thank the majority \nleader, his staff, and others, for making its inclusion a priority. On \nexecutive compensation, let me say that when the American people wake \nup in the morning and see some institution just received billions of \ndollars and you have a headline that 700 employees received income in \nexcess of a million dollars, people ask themselves: What are you \nthinking of?\n  The idea that we continue to pour billions of dollars into \ninstitutions that are still awarding their employees massive amounts of \nincome is infuriating--and that hardly describes the reaction of the \nAmerican people. This is about trying to save an economy in our \ncountry, with 20,000 people losing their jobs every day. I promise you \nthat the overwhelming majority of these people are making nothing like \na million dollars a year or $500,000 a year. They are earning $40,000, \n50,000 to raise a family of four. When they see their tax dollars going \nout the door and\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\ninto institutions that are then, in some cases, not lending but are \nhoarding and doing other things, I cannot begin to describe the anger \nwe hear. Then we turn around and say to that taxpayer that we need to \nhave them step up and do more because the economy needs assistance. The \nAmerican public really reacts to this.\n  If you have hope of convincing the public we are on the right track--\nI see my colleague from Alaska, and I know she has time constraints.\n  I am digressing from the text, but, again, I find it incredible that \npeople are calling up and bellowing about this, how upset they are that \nwe have asked for some constraints in this area. Do they have any idea \nwhat is going on? I am mesmerized that people are calling up and \nbellowing because somehow they are going to be asked to be restrained \nfrom providing these exorbitant incomes for some people.\n  This country is hurting. This is the deepest financial crisis we have \nhad in many years in America, and they are worried about their pay. Our \nsystem of economy is at risk these days, and we will be judged by \nhistory as to whether we can respond intelligently to it. To be \npreoccupied over whether someone is going to get a bonus of--whatever \nit is, is misplaced energy and attention. It is stunning that the very \npeople in the communities who are directly involved in this and the \nconception are the ones calling about that issue.\n  The stories we have seen in recent weeks about CEOs giving themselves \nbonuses and spa vacations on the taxpayer dime after they have been \nrescued by the taxpayer infuriate the public, and they ought to.\n  Families in Connecticut have lost everything as a result of this \nfinancial crisis. They don't have jobs, health care, their retirement, \nand they may have lost their homes. When they hear about the complaints \ncoming out of these towers of financial success--about pay cuts--after \nall these people have gone through, they deserve better than having to \nput up with the behavior from some of the most fortunate among us, who \nhave made many of the decisions that got us into this crisis.\n  I have said again and again that if your institution is receiving \nfunds through TARP and at the same time paying out lucrative bonuses, \nwe should look at every possible legal means to have that money come \nback and ban the practice outright for high-paid executives going \nforward.\n  As a result of the inclusion of this language in the legislation, it \nwill prohibit bonuses to the 25 most highly paid employees of the large \ncompanies that receive TARP funding--and severely limit other \nperformance-based bonuses as well. It will empower the Treasury \nSecretary to get back bonuses or compensation paid to an executive at \nthese companies based on false earnings reports or anything else later \nfound to be materially inaccurate or misrepresentative of what was \noccurring. It will also give shareholders the right to vote on \nexecutive pay at these firms. And it will strictly prohibit golden \nparachutes to senior executives of companies that receive taxpayer \nhelp. Because of this bill, we now will provide far more safeguards \nthan exist today--measuring whether executive compensation plans pose \nrisk to the financial health of the company and preventing the \nmanipulation of earnings reports.\n  The President told the world a few weeks ago that a new era of \nresponsibility had begun--it is time our executives in those companies \nunderstood that message.\n  The second issue I wish to discuss is transit. The bill dedicates \nsome $8.4 billion to transit issues. Connecticut alone will receive \n$137 million, which will meet many important needs, reducing congestion \nin our State. Route 95 through Connecticut and other arteries of \ntransport are under tremendous congestion. Transit assistance and \nsupport is long overdue. This bill provides that needed assistance.\n  The American Public Transit Association has said that $48 billion \nworth of transit projects are to be completed over the next 2 years; \ntherefore, jobs will be created, putting people back to work. That is \nvaluable not only in the short term but for the long-term economic \ngrowth in investments for transit. That is not only about being shovel-\nready, it is also future ready. Ridership is already at record levels. \nTraffic congestion in metropolitan areas is getting worse, and our \npopulation is going to grow by another 50 percent by 2050.\n\n  I am pleased that the legislation includes $100 million to establish \nand implement a program to provide assistance to transit agencies to \nbecome more energy efficient as well. This is a very important part of \nthis bill. There are a number of other provisions that provide that \nkind of assistance.\n  Public transit saves over 4 billion gallons of gasoline annually and \nreduces carbon emissions by some 37 million metric tons a year--that is \nthe equivalent to the electricity used by almost 5 million households. \nThe need to repair our highways, roads and bridges is obvious, and I am \npleased the bill includes $302 million in highway funds for my State of \nConnecticut.\n  But the most effective way to reduce congestion is to provide \ntransportation options that take cars off the road. Investing in \ntransit creates jobs, it addresses climate change and reduces our \ndependence on foreign oil, and makes our economy competitive in the \n21st century.\n  Third is an area where I think we fell short in this bill--the \nfailure to include the amendment I offered with Senator Martinez of \nFlorida, which would require the administration to use $50 billion of \nthe TARP money to attack the root cause of the economic crisis: \nforeclosure. It would have gone a long way toward dealing with the safe \nharbor so we can avoid the kind of litigation that may slow down some \nof these workouts. That was a mistake. We are trying to get to the root \ncause of the problem, the foreclosure issue. Senator Martinez had a \nvery good idea that was adopted unanimously, and it had no cost of any \nmeasurable amount. I don't understand why it was taken out, but it is \ngone. That will create problems in terms of addressing the foreclosure \nissue. Clearly, we wanted the $50 billion used for foreclosure \nprevention.\n  In 2001, this body approved $1.3 trillion in tax cuts at a time when \nunemployment was 4 percent and our economy was in fairly good shape. \nToday, with an unemployment rate of 7.6 percent and headed upward and \nas many as 8 million foreclosures potentially on the horizon, we are \ndedicating $800 billion to jump-starting our economy. Meanwhile, nearly \n10,000 families enter into foreclosure every day, as I mentioned \nearlier. In December alone, there were 2,000 foreclosures in \nConnecticut. Other States, such as California, Arizona, Nevada, and \nFlorida, have many more than we do. Eight million homes are underwater, \nwith mortgages that exceed the value of their homes.\n  Perhaps the most important step we could have taken in this bill is \nto require Treasury to spend some of the TARP money Congress previously \nreleased to modify home loans. By providing the Treasury with the \nauthority and funds in this bill to design and implement a loan \nmodification program in consultation with FDIC, HUD, and the Federal \nReserve, we could have ensured we would help nearly 2 million families.\n  Some 16,000 families in my State of Connecticut would have avoided \nlosing their home, moving them out of these unaffordable, exploding and \noften predatory mortgages that are strangling our economy and into \nmortgages they can afford.\n  While I am disappointed we didn't codify this requirement into law, I \nam pleased that the Treasury Secretary has pledged to dedicate at least \n$50 billion to preventing foreclosures--and I believe that is in no \nsmall part due to the strong support this body expressed for this \namendment last week.\n  Quite frankly, that is a step which should have been taken months ago \nin the previous administration. There was no interest in it despite the \nfact that expert after expert warned that unless you get to the bottom \nof the residential mortgage market, the economic crisis will persist. \nThey are right. I hope we will see a change in direction and resources \ncommitted to the underlying problem of our economic issues.\n  While we will hold this administration's feet to the fire, I believe \nthey recognize that unless we act now to stop foreclosures and put a \ntourniquet on the crisis, the hemorrhaging will get worse--the number \nof layoffs will increase, more businesses will shutter\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\ntheir doors, and more Americans will suffer.\n  With this bill, we begin to get our economy moving again. This is not \na moment of great joy, as I said. We should not have had to have been \nin this moment to talk about this, but we are here. While I know many \nhave said they are going to vote against this, I think they bear a \nresponsibility of having offered some alternative ideas because just \nsaying no is not enough, in my view. That is the conclusion of almost \nevery economist who has analyzed this issue over the last number of \nweeks and months.\n  Again, I commend the efforts of Senator Reid, the majority leader, \nNancy Pelosi, and the efforts made by Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe \nand Arlen Specter, who have agreed to work with us and come up with \nthis package. We would not be at this point without them. I appreciate \ntheir efforts.\n  Lastly, some of my colleagues are concerned that some of their \namendments were dropped as well. Senator Sessions mentioned one, the E-\nVerify Program. E-Verify is currently authorized through March. When we \ntake up the omnibus spending bill in 2 weeks, I am told it will include \na provision to extend that until September 30, 2009. This is a program \nthat, when fully funded, will be operational for hires funded by the \nstimulus bill for companies participating in the program.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Alaska, who I know wants to \nexpress her thoughts on this.\n  I thank those who put this together. We need to get back on our feet \nagain. Obviously, unleashing the clogged-up credit market is a critical \nissue, but also providing that jolt this stimulus package will provide \nis also necessary if we are going to complete the effort to do what we \ncan to improve the economic conditions in our country. For those \nreasons, I will be supportive of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the remarks of my \ncolleague from Connecticut and thank him for his efforts to focus on \nthe housing issues that face this Nation right now. As he has \nmentioned, if we are not able to get to the root cause, which is the \nhousing debacle and the failures we have seen, all our good efforts may \nnot be successful.\n  I thank him for his efforts in that regard. I know we will continue \nworking on this issue together with the administration. It is essential \nwe focus on the housing piece.\n  Later this afternoon or this evening, we are going to be voting on \nthe conference report to accompany the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act. I was one of those 37 Senators who voted against this \nbill earlier this week. I would like to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to speak to some of the reasons why I was unable and why I \nwill be unwilling to support the conference report when it comes before \nus later.\n  My principal concern in voting against the Senate measure at the time \nwas the scope of the spending. It is not just the scope of what we have \nin front of us with this particular bill, this package of $790 billion. \nThere was an article in the Washington Post on Wednesday that had a \nchart that outlined all of what we have been spending in the past year.\n  The header is: ``It Adds Up.'' ``The Federal Government has committed \nat least $7.8 trillion in loans, investments, in guarantees since the \nbeginning of 2008.'' The funding coming from the Federal Reserve is at \n$3.8 trillion; from the FDIC, $1.22 trillion; from the Treasury, this \nincludes the TARP moneys we authorized back in October, $771 billion; \nthe joint programs that include the guarantees of Bank of America and \nCitigroup, $419 billion; and then in the ``Other'' category, it \nincludes not only the programs Fannie and Freddie at $200 billion, but \nthen at the bottom we have the Senate bill for the current stimulus \npackage at that time coming in at $838 billion.\n  It is almost inconceivable what we are talking about in terms of the \noutlays we are putting forward.\n  The cost of this stimulus package before us, as everyone in America \nknows, is $790 billion, but when we account for the interest, which we \nneed to do--that is part of the bill--the cost increases to more than \n$1 trillion; it is about $1.2 trillion. So add this in to the outline \nof what I have laid out, and the cost to America is considerable.\n  Where do we get this money? From where do we get it? We don't just \ntell the Treasury to turn the printing presses on full bore: let's go, \nlet's print the money. No, we have to borrow. We sell Treasury bills. \nWe sell debt. Who buys it? People such as the Chinese and others from \noutside this country.\n  It is not just cranking up the presses and printing more money. We \nwill be paying for this legislation. My children will be paying for it. \nWe have a responsibility to make sure what we spend is spent wisely.\n  The focus of this stimulus, of course, is the job creation. Even if \nit actually creates the 4 million jobs the White House once promised, \nthen those jobs, if you piece it all out--do the math--these jobs come \nat a cost of about $300,000 apiece. What we are seeing now is probably \nnot 4 million jobs. Even the most optimistic economists are now \nestimating what we are looking at would create or save less than 2.5 \nmillion jobs.\n  I noted the comments of the Senator from Connecticut about the need \nto fix housing first, and I strongly agree with that approach. But this \nafternoon, I wish to speak to another issue.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, I wish to spend some time on another aspect of the bill. \nThis is an area where millions of new jobs are promised, and that is in \nthe area of energy. There is absolutely no doubt we must facilitate the \ndevelopment of renewable resources, increase our energy efficiency, and \npursue the many innovative solutions to the challenges we face when it \ncomes to how we consume, how we use, and how we create energy.\n  I am not satisfied with the energy provisions that are contained in \nthis measure. I am not satisfied that they are timely, that they are \ntargeted, and that they are temporary. By adopting this conference \nreport, we are missing out on some significant opportunities that could \nrevive our economy and improve our energy security at little or, \nhopefully, no cost to our taxpayers.\n  When it comes to criticisms, there is plenty of room to be critical. \nOne of my first criticisms this afternoon is not necessarily the items \nthat are included in the stimulus but perhaps some of the items that \nwere left out. Simply put, this package makes no effort to increase \ndomestic production of our traditional resources, such as oil and \nnatural gas. What we have done is focused on the new technologies, to \nthe total exclusion of those tried-and-true technologies. I think this \ncreates this false dilemma. It says clean energy is the only viable \noption for energy development and job creation when, in fact, it might \nnot be the most effective option at this time when we are trying to \npursue jobs and get the country strong again.\n  Consider the benefits that could be brought about by greater \nproduction of oil and gas in this country. One recent study outlines \nthat the full development of domestic oil and gas resources could \ngenerate up to $1.7 trillion in revenues for the Federal Government and \ncreate as many as 161,000 new jobs by 2030.\n  The revenues from the production could be used to provide a \ntremendous downpayment on the long-term strength and security of our \nNation. Instead, as a result of what we will be doing today, American \ntaxpayers are ultimately going to be paying $1.2 trillion because of \nthe decisions we are making.\n  Setting aside my concerns about the priorities, it is very uncertain \nthe funds that are provided by this bill can be spent in a rational and \ncost-effective way. Perhaps the best example of this is within the \nDepartment of Energy. It is set to receive roughly $45 billion in the \nconference report we are looking at now. DOE's total budget for fiscal \nyear 2008 was $24 billion. Assuming the Department receives similar \nfunding through fiscal year 2009 appropriations--and we are going to be \ndebating that after this recess break--DOE will receive almost triple \nits historic level of funding in less than 3 months. What we have is an \nunprecedented level of spending within the Department.\n  CBO is concerned about how we spend this out as well. They determined \nthe\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nDepartment would only be able to spend 24 percent of its funding before \nthe 2-year deadline. The Energy Department, along with so many of the \nother departments we are dealing with, simply does not have the time to \ngear up and properly spend, with a level of accountability, so much \nmoney over such a short period.\n  The question then needs to be asked: Will this level of funding \nbecome the new baseline for the Department? If it does, we will have \nsignificantly expanded Federal spending at a time of unprecedented \nFederal deficits. If it does not become part of the baseline, then that \ncrashing sound we will hear is going to be the gears that are grinding \nback down as funding returns to normal. I suggest such wild swings in \nfunding are disruptive and one of the most ineffective ways to spend \nour taxpayers' dollars.\n  The stimulus, by giving Government agencies completely unprecedented \namounts of money for sometimes nonexistent programs, also sets up near \nperfect conditions for waste, fraud, and abuse. This is exactly what \nthe American taxpayers do not want to see. For example, $3.2 billion is \nprovided for block grant programs for energy efficiency. The conference \nreport provides $400 million for a competitive grant system that does \nnot currently exist and for which there is no administrative process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, making matters worse, it provides an \nadditional $3.1 billion to State energy programs but imposes conditions \non receiving funds that are currently met by only a handful of States.\n  Another example I wish to leave you with is the smart grid. We agree \nthis is very important. There is $4.5 billion for the smart grid. This \nwas authorized at $100 million in the 2007 Energy bill. It has received \nzero funding to date. Is it possible to expect we can ramp up to $4.5 \nbillion in 2 years in a rational way? We don't even have the standards \nin place for the interoperability framework.\n  I don't think the American taxpayer is concerned so much about how \nmuch we spend, so long as we do it responsibly and with accountability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. My concern is we have not done this with this stimulus \npackage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, as Members can see from the debate we have \nhad today and throughout the past couple weeks, almost everyone in this \nSenate and in the House of Representatives agrees on the need for \nCongress to be working with our new President on a stimulus plan to \njump-start the economy.\n  We have people in our home States who are hurting. There were 600,000 \njobs lost last month across our country. These facts underscore the \nneed for something to be done to strengthen our economy. So we are all \nin agreement on that basic premise.\n  There is a great deal of good will out there in the country for our \nnew President. I commend President Obama for making the economy his \nmain focus. I also commend him for publicly stating Democrats do not \nhave a monopoly on good ideas. The President said: Republicans have \ngood ideas also. And he wanted to include them in his stimulus plan.\n  That is not what happened when House Democrats met behind closed \ndoors several days ago to write this bill. It is not what has happened \nthroughout the process.\n  Republicans responded to the President's call. We came forward. We \ncame to this floor. We talked to our constituents back home. We stood \nbefore every television camera that would film us. We talked with every \njournalist we could find. We have discussed our ideas with the American \npeople.\n  We presented ideas that I believe could have turned this economy \naround. Our ideas focused, first, on getting the housing market out of \nthe gutter. The housing problem is what got us where we currently are, \nand it should be where we begin in turning our economy around.\n  Also, we proposed real tax relief for America's working people and \nfor those people who create over half the jobs in this country, our \nNation's small businesses.\n  Additionally, our plan called for targeted infrastructure investments \nwith clear economic development purposes, in addition to putting an \nemphasis on legitimate Government priorities, such as early investment \nin military equipment and facilities, items we know will be funded in \nthe future but would create increased jobs quickly if we focused on \nthem now.\n  Just as importantly, the Republican idea I supported would have \nstimulated our economy at half the cost of the plan we are considering \ntoday, and that is not just my opinion, that is the opinion of a lot of \nvery well-considered Democrats in this town.\n  Three days ago, the Senate cast one of the most expensive votes in \nthe history of the United States of America. That $835 billion bill, \nwhich actually costs $1.2 trillion-plus when we add the cost of \ninterest, has been given, at best, a small haircut. The bill before us \nis being presented to the American people today at a cost of $789 \nbillion, still in the neighborhood of $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion, \nwhen one adds the cost of debt service.\n  In order to reach the current number, this so-called compromise cut \nmuch of the tax relief geared toward job creation and stimulating the \nhousing market in order to keep in place spending for slow, unending, \nand nonjob-creating government programs. As the Washington Post \nreported yesterday morning, this final product ``claims many coauthors, \nincluding house liberals who saw a rare opportunity to secure new \nsocial spending.'' And take advantage of that opportunity they did \nindeed.\n  It now appears the majority leadership in the House and Senate have \ntaken a bad bill and made it worse. Two popular items, one Republican \nand one Democratic, added to the Senate bill on the floor have been \ndropped from the final version and replaced with weaker alternatives \nthat are less likely to work to stimulate home sales and automobile \nsales.\n  The first is the Isakson amendment, which was so widely agreed upon \nin this Chamber that it was approved by a voice vote. It went right to \nthe housing problem. It would have provided a $15,000 tax credit to all \nhome buyers, a concept which has worked in the past. Yet the final \nconference report before us reverts back to the House-passed proposal, \nproviding much less money--an $8,000 credit--and limiting the provision \nto first-time home buyers. We need to encourage home buying by every \nAmerican who is creditworthy, and this provision doesn't get the job \ndone.\n  The Mikulski amendment, offered by our Democratic colleague from \nMaryland, also had wide bipartisan support. It passed this Chamber by a \nvote of 71 to 26. It has been dropped in favor of a weakened \nalternative. The plan now allows new car buyers to deduct from their \nFederal taxes the sales tax they paid on a new car. But the Mikulski \nprovision that would have also allowed them to deduct interest on their \ncar loans was stripped. The Mikulski amendment would have helped \nstruggling U.S. automakers and auto dealers get buyers in the \nshowrooms, it would have helped move cars off their lots, and helped \nprotect the endangered automobile industry jobs. Like the Isakson \namendment, it was unfortunately removed from this final package.\n  So while the conferees tinkered around the edges--making the bill \nworse in some ways--we stand here today debating a bill that will add \nover $1 trillion to the national credit card. I have said it before in \nthis debate, and I will say it one more time: A trillion dollars is a \nterrible thing to waste. But that is exactly what this bill does. This \nbill is full of bad decisions that will take Americans decades to pay \nfor.\n  Much has been made during this debate--by me and by many of my \ncolleagues--about how much $1 trillion is, and I think we have \nestablished well that this is a staggering amount of money. Again, this \nis the most expensive piece of legislation ever passed in the history \nof our Republic.\n  Last September, Congress approved the $700 billion Wall Street \nbailout.\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\nThat came on top of approximately $200-plus billion earlier in the year \nin the form of rebate checks. I think the American people have the \nright to ask: of that $200 billion and then the $700 billion--and that \nis almost $1 trillion right there, and certainly more than $1 trillion \nwhen you add the debt service, as I have already pointed out--what did \nwe get? What did the taxpayers, the American public, get for that \nunbelievable expenditure of taxpayer funds last year? A worsened \neconomy is what we have gotten. We certainly didn't get the economic \nboost that was promised.\n  In an editorial yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, it was noted \nthat the Congressional Budget Office estimates the 2009 deficit will \nreach 8.3 percent of the economy--a number that does not include the \nstimulus or the TARP bailout funds. We know that after this is \nenacted--and it does appear that the proponents of this conference \nreport have the votes to move it to the President's desk--another very \nexpensive financial package will be forthcoming from the administration \nin a matter of days. So what does this mean for people across America? \nEach household now owes more than $100,000 to pay for the debt we \nalready have, not including the additional debt that is coming.\n  Senators need to ask themselves, when is enough enough? When will we \nbegin making hard choices?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to consume about \n30 seconds more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. We need to ask ourselves in the Senate: When is enough \nenough? When will we begin making hard choices between what will truly \nwork to stimulate this economy and what we wish to have but which will \nnot work to get the job done?\n  Americans expect us to get this right and to take the time necessary \nto make sure we get this right. This bill fails to hit that mark. I \nwill vote no because we simply cannot afford again to make a mistake of \nthis magnitude.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, President John F. Kennedy said:\n\n       There are risks and costs to a program of action. But they \n     are far less than the long-range risks and costs of \n     comfortable inaction.\n\n  President Kennedy's observation applied well to the economic policies \nof the late 1920s and 1930s. When we look back at the late 1920s and \nearly 1930s, we wonder what our leaders must have been thinking. With \nthe benefit of hindsight, we see that they should have acted more \nforcefully. We see they should have used the tools of government to \nincrease the demand for goods and services in the economy. By failing \nto act to spur demand, our leaders prolonged the Great Depression. By \nseeking to balance the budget in the face of economic decline, our \nleaders only worsened that decline.\n  President Kennedy's adage about action applies as well again to the \neconomic policies of our time. Yes, there are risks and costs to the \nbold program of action we recommend today. But those risks are far less \nthan the long-range risks and costs of failing to act forcefully.\n  Since this recession began, 3.6 million Americans have already lost \ntheir jobs, and job loss is accelerating. In each of the last 3 months, \nmore than half a million American workers lost their jobs. Economists \nwarn that the worst is yet to come.\n  Last month, before the latest bad news, the Congressional Budget \nOffice--a nonpartisan professional organization--said:\n\n       Under an assumption that current laws and policies \n     regarding Federal spending and taxation remain the same, CBO \n     forecasts . . . an unemployment rate that will exceed 9 \n     percent early in the year 2010.\n\n  Those are the costs of inaction. The costs of inaction will be paid \nwith millions--millions--more lost jobs. The costs of inaction will be \npaid by the heartache of millions of families plunged into economic \nhardship.\n  And so, with the leadership of our new President, we have sought to \nact forcefully. We have put together this $787 billion package designed \nto help bring our economy back. We have assembled this package, \ndesigned to create and save jobs.\n  The day before yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office said it \nwill work. The Congressional Budget Office--again, a nonpartisan \nprofessional organization--said:\n\n       The legislation would increase employment by . . . 1.2 \n     million to 3.6 million by the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\n  That is an objective observation done by professional analysts. The \nadministration agrees. The administration projects the legislation \nbefore us will create or save 3\\1/2\\ million jobs.\n  That is what this debate is about. It is about creating or saving \nmillions of jobs. It is about acting forcefully to avoid yet more \nhardship. It is about avoiding the far greater risks and costs of \ncomfortable inaction.\n  The history of the 1920s and 1930s teaches us what we must do. The \nhistory of the Great Depression teaches us the costs of delay. This \nrecession is the economic test of our generation. Responding to it with \nforceful action is our duty. Let us not be found wanting.\n  So let us not find comfort in ``no'' votes and the blocking of \naction. Rather, let us rise to the challenge of our generation and let \nus finally send this jobs bill to the President's desk to become law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this is a bittersweet day for a lot of us, \nI know a lot of Americans. A lot of Americans have called in expressing \ntheir opinions, sent thousands of e-mails and letters. If my \ncolleagues' offices are anything like mine, mine have been 80 to 90 \npercent against this bill.\n  Folks are saying: Slow down. Let's see what is in it. We know about \nunintended consequences. Let's not spend all this money unless we know \nwhat we are doing. Folks have expressed concern that we seem, as \npoliticians for the last 2 years, to have been talking down the \neconomy--holding press conferences in the very worst areas of our \ncountry and saying this is what is happening everywhere, and every day \nsaying it is going to get worse, it is going to get worse. What \nbusinessman would expand his business, or what businesswoman would go \nout and invest her life savings to start a new business if what they \nwere hearing from Washington every day is: It is terrible; it is going \nto get worse. I am afraid we have done our part in creating a bad \neconomy.\n  Clearly, there is a difference in philosophy, and I have to respect \nwhat the President and the Democratic majority have said: They won the \nelection, they get to do it their way now. But I think some of us \nbelieve--and if you look at history, there are a lot of facts behind \nus--that when the economy slows down and there is a need to get more \nmoney in the economy, the fastest and quickest way to do it is to stop \ntaking so much out in taxes. Some say on the other side: Well, tax cuts \nare an old idea. But tax cuts are related to individual freedom, people \nmaking their own decisions about how money is invested; leaving profits \nin the hands of thousands of small businesses so they can use that \nmoney to hire people and grow their businesses. Because that is where \nall the jobs are created.\n  Government doesn't create jobs. It may hire someone, but they have to \ntake that money to pay that person from the private sector, from \nbusinesses that are actually creating the wealth.\n  We have talked about so much data in this very short debate. People \nhave talked about the Great Depression. It is pretty clear that we \ntried getting out of the Great Depression for about 10 years by \nspending and adding new government programs, and it didn't work. In the \n1960s, though, the economy grew after President Kennedy cut taxes. Our \neconomy sagged again during the big spending days of Lyndon Johnson. In \nthe 1970s, we tried to get out of a recession, or grow our economy, \nwith heavy spending and new government programs and huge deficits and \nended up in recession again. The 1980s were the boom years, when Reagan \nand Margaret Thatcher and others around the world realized that freedom \ndoes work. Free markets do create prosperity.\n  We have seen countries, such as the Soviet Union, change from their \nold centralized government approach to some free market principles and \ngrow\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\nout of a lot of their problems. We have talked about Japan during this \ndebate. They had a lost decade. They kept their taxes the highest in \nthe world and they tried to spend their way out of a recession. It \ndidn't work. They lost a lot of time, a lot of money, and a lot of \nopportunity.\n  There is a big difference in philosophy that we should debate. But \nwhy the rush? I think the consternation I hear from the American people \nnow more than anything else is, if this is the biggest spending bill in \nhistory, why are we trying to rush it through? Why does it have to be \non the President's desk Monday morning? Why are we going to vote on a \nbill that not one of us have finished reading at this point? We just \nhave had it today in any kind of searchable format on the Internet. Yet \nwe are going to vote on it before we leave today. It seems we are \nafraid there might be some good news coming out of the economy in \ndifferent sectors and the panic could subside long enough that maybe \nCongress doesn't feel we have to do something, even if we do not know \nwhat it is.\n  It seems we are rushing such an incredible spending bill. I talked to \none of my sons last night and said: You might get $400, spread out in \n$17 increments. The bad news is you will probably end up owing $10,000 \nor more because of this one bill. He didn't seem to think it was that \ngood a deal.\n  I know the other side won and that makes it bittersweet, in a way, \nbecause I feel like a lot of us have been standing for what the \nAmerican people are calling and telling us about. We know if we let the \npeople who are earning it and hiring people keep the money, we would \nstimulate our economy.\n  There are other things we can do, other than tax cuts as well. As to \nenergy, at a time when we know that by opening our own energy reserves, \ndrilling for our own oil and natural gas, we could stop the flow of \nAmerican dollars overseas and create lots of jobs here, this very week \nthis new administration delayed the planning of opening our own \nreserves by another 6 months. What are we waiting for, gas prices to go \nup to $3 or $4? Why delay something that could help the economy?\n  If we only allowed States to take the money we are already spending \nfor education and allow students to take that to any school of their \nchoice, it would attract literally billions of dollars--probably \nhundreds of billions of dollars of private sector investment in \neducation to create all kinds of new choices for students that might \nactually prepare them to compete in the global economy. But what we are \ndoing is more Government spending with the old Government model, and it \nis not going to create new jobs.\n  Even in health care, there is something in this bill that will help \nsubsidize people's health care with COBRA when they lose their jobs. \nBut we will not allow that same subsidy to apply if the same person \nwants to apply a less expensive policy of their own choosing that they \ncan keep more than just a few months. We will support something that is \nGovernment, but we will not help people live free and make their own \nchoices. Certainly, it is bittersweet.\n  But the news is not all bad today. I think the American people have \nresigned themselves to the fact that they are going to lose this \nbattle, but they have gotten more informed and more engaged and \noutraged. I think they have seen if they call, if they e-mail, if they \nstand and express their opinions, they have a chance to turn around \nthis move by our Government toward a more socialistic style of economy \nand culture to one that is more like the freedom Americans have always \nknown and loved.\n  Freedom is not an ideology; it works. When we let people take \nadvantage of opportunities and direct their own spending and start \ntheir own businesses, that creates jobs. We cannot do that \nartificially, by taking money from one person and giving it to another, \nwhich we are doing a trillion times in the bill we are talking about.\n  I think Americans are watching what is going on today. They are going \nto wonder why we voted on a bill that is not even on our desk, that we \nhave not read yet, that they have not been able to search--as the \nPresident promised during his campaign, that he would not sign any bill \nunless it had been on the Internet for at least 5 days so the American \npeople could know what we are doing here. We promised in these Chambers \nthat we would not bring a bill to the floor unless it was on the \nInternet for people to see before we voted on it. We are breaking all \nthose promises with this bill today.\n  The American people may have lost this one, but they have raised \ntheir voices and they have seen what is going on a little bit better \nthan they have seen it before. I think they are going to win the final \nbattle against this big Government approach to every problem that comes \nup, against this idea that every time there is a problem out across \nAmerica, that we throw up our hands and say we have to do something, \neven if it is wrong, even if we had not read it, even if it is $1 \ntrillion; we have to do something so the people back home will think we \nare doing something. Wasting this kind of money and putting this kind \nof debt burden on the next generation is inexcusable and intolerable \nand the American people are starting to figure it out.\n  They may lose this vote today, but the American people will win that \nfinal battle for freedom when they continue the fight they have started \nthis week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is good to see you in the \nchair. You are a great addition to the Senate, being a distinguished \nnew Senator from Delaware. What a pleasure.\n  Although we are in an emergency condition, I almost wish this vote \nthis afternoon were taking place a week from now, after the Presidents \nDay recess, so Senators who have voiced opposition--and I take them at \ntheir word and I certainly respect their right to disagree, and I \nrespect them. Almost all the Senators in this Chamber know how much \nthis Senator enjoys them personally. But I almost wish this vote were \nbeing taken a week and a half from now, after the recess, after \nSenators have gone home to their States and looked into the eyes of \ntheir people and understood the pain and the anguish that is going on \nacross America and how much people are depending on us, the Government, \nto stop the downward spiral of our economy; and to try to get it \nrighted and going back up the other way.\n  In the meantime, as that attempt is being made--and it is going to \ntake some time. We hear every economist in the world say it is going to \nbe at least a year, if not 2 or 3 years. In the meantime, our people \nare hurting. We hear, every day, these stories.\n  This Senator is going to scores of townhall meetings all across \nFlorida next week. I know what I am going to hear. It is what I have \nbeen hearing every weekend when I go home. It is these horror stories, \nthese impossible economic stories of people who have worked hard and \nplayed by the rules and done everything right and they lose their job, \nthey lose their home, they get upside-down in an economic condition and \nthey do not have any hope. It is almost as if I wish this final passage \nvote were not coming so Senators who have expressed an opinion about \nvoting against this legislation could listen to them. Fortunately, \nthere will be a vast majority of at least 60 in this Chamber, with not \nall the Senators present today because I don't think the health of \nSenator Kennedy is going to allow him to return to the Chamber--so at \nleast 60 of the Senators are going to be voting for it.\n  But there will be a substantial number, at least 37 in this Senate, \nwho will vote against it. If they could hear the stories, they would \nunderstand why there is $120 billion in this bill in investments in \ninfrastructure and science; and $14 billion for health and $106 billion \nfor education and training and energy--$30 billion in energy \ninfrastructure; and helping with direct economic help to those hit \nhardest by the economy, of $24 billion; and helping law enforcement, \n$7.8 billion.\n  My State is one of the States that has been the hardest hit. We are \nsecond only to California in the total number of foreclosures of homes. \nYou wonder, why did the President go to Fort Myers earlier in the week? \nThe Fort Myers area is the highest foreclosure rate area in the entire \ncountry, and for people who are getting laid off there, there is no \neconomic opportunity for them to find another job. Out of this stimulus \nbill, just this bill, with the spending\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\nand the tax cuts, some $10 billion is going to go to my State. It is \ngoing to be for roadbuilding, it is going to be for health care, it is \ngoing to be for classrooms and teachers, it is going to be for food \nstamps, it is going to be for unemployment compensation, it is going to \nbe for Medicaid. Look at the human face. Our people are hurting and \nthey need help.\n  Of that amount that is going to Florida, $4.3 billion is going to \nhelp people who have lost their jobs to keep their health insurance. \nCan you imagine the trauma of a breadwinner who loses the job--and that \nis traumatic enough--not to be able to afford health insurance for his \nfamily, especially if there is a traumatic injury in that family? That \namount of $4.3 billion going to Florida is going to provide health care \nfor the poor. This is what I am talking about. This is compassionate \nassistance in an economic downward spiral that only the Government can \nprovide.\n  Specifically, in Florida, this bill is going to create or save \n206,000 jobs. Nationwide it is going to be somewhere between 3 million \nand 4 million jobs it is going to create or save. Over 1 million jobs \nhave already been lost since the first of last year. But there are \nseveral million more that are going to be lost in this country if we do \nnot do anything. So this stimulus bill is designed to create 3 million \nto 4 million jobs that will, in fact, take up that slack of what \notherwise would have been lost and has been lost.\n  This bill is going to provide $800 for a family. That is going to \nprovide almost 7 million workers and their families, just in the State \nof Florida--7 million are going to be eligible for the making work pay \ntax cut of up to $800. Just in Florida, this bill is going to make \n195,000 families eligible for a new tax credit to make college \naffordable. That is almost 200,000 in Florida alone able to have the \ntax credit for college.\n  For those out of work who are getting unemployment insurance \nbenefits, there is going to be an additional $100 in my State, to \n761,000 people--761,000 workers in Florida who have lost their jobs in \nthis recession are going to get a little bit more help in unemployment \ncompensation.\n  In addition, what this bill is going to do for my State of Florida \nis, it is going to give funding sufficient to modernize 485 schools so \nour children are going to have labs and classrooms and libraries that \nthey need to get ready to compete globally in the 21st century.\n  Then, in addition, this legislation is going to help transform our \neconomy in our State, in Florida alone, by doubling the renewable \nenergy generating capacity over the next 3 years. It is going to create \nenough renewable energy in Florida to power 6 million homes.\n  We are going to be able to computerize every American's health record \nin 5 years, and look what that is going to save Floridians. We are \ngoing to be able to enact significant----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 \nadditional seconds. I will complete my thought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. We are going to provide the most significant \nexpansion in tax cuts for low- and moderate-income households ever. \nThat is going to occur right in the State of Florida. We are going to \nincrease the investment in roads and bridges and mass transit. We need \nall of this in Florida. This is stimulus. This is providing jobs. This \nis helping people in need. This is the right thing to do for Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the bill we are considering now was made \navailable to us at 11 p.m. last night, long after the Senate was out of \nsession. This is it. Now, I daresay that I doubt any of my colleagues \nhave read this bill. I have not, I confess. Yet we are going to be \nvoting on it in about 3 hours. We have relied on our staff to tell us \nwhat is in this bill, and we found some very interesting things.\n  There are changes from when the bill passed the Senate. My colleagues \nneed to know what some of these changes are. I would note, by the way, \nthat the middle-of-the-night, behind-closed-doors way this legislation \nwas created is a far cry from what the President requested of us and \npromised on his Web site. He talks about ending the practice of writing \nlegislation behind closed doors. He says: By making these practices \npublic, the American people will be able to hold their leaders \naccountable for wasteful spending, and lawmakers won't be able to slip \nfavors for lobbyists into bills at the last minute.\n  Well, would that it were. So, unfortunately, it looks as though a lot \nof favors were inserted for a lot of folks. I don't know whether it was \nbecause lobbyists requested it, but there are sure a lot of things that \nrelate to specific Members and specific States. And, as I said, many of \nthese items were not even included in the Senate-passed bill. Let me \nmention a couple because they are matters that have been in the media a \ngreat deal.\n  I think we have all heard discussed the fact that when Republicans \nraised the fact that ACORN could receive money from the neighborhood \nstabilization fund, this was a provision that the other side, the \nDemocrats, said: Well, we will take that out. And, indeed, they removed \nthe words ``neighborhood stabilization fund'' as a subheading. Then \nthey just lumped that funding under the community development fund.\n  Bottom line is, they took out three words. The money can still be \nspent, including for ACORN; same thing for the billion dollars for a \nnew prevention and wellness fund. This was in earlier committee reports \nthat indicated it could be spent for things such as STD testing and \nprevention and smoking cessation. There was a lot of commentary about \nthat in the media, and folks made fun of it. So the assumption was that \nhas come out. No, it turns out there is still very clearly flexibility \nto use the funds for these kinds of things.\n  Let me mention two or three others: $50 million for the National \nEndowment of the Arts, $500 million for Social Security Administration \ndisability backlog, $60 million for Student Aid Administration, $50 \nmillion for the Compassion Capital Fund. There is $450 million for \nAmtrak security grants, which was not in either the House bill or the \nSenate bill. They simply put it in this legislation.\n  All of these items were new from when the Senate passed the bill. \nThere is also $53.6 billion for a fund labeled ``Fiscal Stabilization \nFund.'' In looking to figure out what the Fiscal Stabilization Fund is, \nwe find it is really nothing more than a discretionary slush fund for \nStates to use.\n  Now, the Senate has cut the fund from $79 billion. They cut that down \nto $39 billion. Some of our Members were proud that was accomplished. \nAll of the Democrats voted for that. But it turns out in the \nconference--of course not the public conference; that was merely for \nshow. But when the Members went behind closed doors, they tucked all of \nthe money back in--added about $14 billion, I should say, back into the \nslush fund. But what is $14 billion when we are talking about $1 \ntrillion?\n  There is an article today in the Washington Post that includes a \nstory titled, ``Despite Pledges, the Package Has Some Pork.'' It \nbegins:\n\n       The compromise stimulus bill adopted by the House and \n     Senate negotiators this week is not free of spending that \n     benefits specific communities, industries or groups, despite \n     vows by President Obama that the legislation would be kept \n     clear of pet projects, according to lawmakers, legislative \n     aides and anti-tax groups.\n\n  Included in the pork called out by the Washington Post is $8 billion, \n$8 billion for high-speed rail projects, for a MagLev rail line between \nLos Angeles and Las Vegas, and other things. I mean, I had mentioned \nthis before, the money for Filipino veterans, I think a very worthy \ncause except they are from the Philippines, and it does not create jobs \nin America.\n  There is money for the Nation's small shipyards. I wonder why the big \nshipyards were not adequately represented? And I mentioned before the \n$1 billion for a powerplant in Mattoon, IL. These are what we call \nearmarks. These are especially for a specific Member's congressional \ndistrict or State. They may be good spending, some of them may even \ncreate jobs, but they violate what the President talked about when he \ntalked about special projects put in these bills.\n  The bottom line is, this legislation continues to spend money in a \nwasteful\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\nway that our constituents strongly oppose.\n  Now, the Coburn amendment was adopted to reflect our constituents' \nconcerns. We voted for that amendment, 73 to 24. We are in favor of \nending wasteful Washington spending, we said. Specifically, the \namendment prohibited funds from being used for a casino or other \ngambling establishment, aquarium, zoo, golf course, swimming pool, \nstadium, community park, museum, theater, art center, and highway \nbeautification project. And that is where we thought it ended. But not \nso. In this group of negotiators who met behind closed doors for at \nleast a couple of nights, it turns out that a lot of these things have \ncrept back into the bill.\n  So now section 1604 of the conference report includes part of the \nfunding limitation from the Coburn amendment but drops its applications \nto museums, stadiums, art centers, theaters, parks, or highway \nbeautification projects. So a lot of the good that we thought we had \naccomplished, it turns out, does not carry at the end of the day.\n  The end result of this is, the CBO scores the long-term consequences \nof the spending in this bill not to be $800 billion, as has been \ndiscussed, or even $1 trillion when you add in the interest. But, as \nyou know, the Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, scores for 10 \nyears what is the cost the real cost, over a 10-year period.\n  They say the cost will jump to $3.27 trillion. So when we are talking \nabout the $800 billion stimulus bill, let's understand it is really a \n$3.27 trillion bill.\n  Now, there are a couple of other interesting things about this. It is \nnot temporary. There are 31 new programs totaling $97 billion, in fact, \n31 percent of all of the appropriations. It expands 73 programs by $92 \nbillion. These should be part of the regular appropriations process.\n\n  It is interesting that while the Congressional Budget Office \nconfirmed the bill might provide a short-term boost to the gross \ndomestic product in the next few years, the added debt burden and \ncrowding out of private investment will actually become a net drag on \neconomic growth and wages by 2014. That means a lower standard of \nliving for all of us.\n  This is fascinating to me. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts \nthat the time period where economic growth is boosted, 2009 and 2010, \nis the same timeframe when 98 percent of the tax cuts are disbursed. \nBut between 2011 and 2019, when only 2 percent of the tax cuts are \nleft, you have over half of the spending in the bill, and yet the bill \nactually reduces economic growth. Let me repeat that. This is from the \nCongressional Budget Office. Their forecast is that economic growth \nwill be boosted in the years 2009 and 2010. I talked about it like a \nsugar high for kids. That is when 98 percent of the tax cuts are \ndisbursed.\n  We like to say tax cuts can do a lot of good here. Our Democratic \nfriends say: All you want to do is talk about tax cuts. We think tax \ncuts would really help. So the period where 98 percent of the tax cuts \nare disbursed, but less than half of the spending is where you have the \neconomic growth.\n  Then in 2011 to 2019, when there is only 2 percent of the tax cuts \nand over half of the spending, you actually have reduced economic \ngrowth. That is why Republicans have been emphasizing tax cuts. It is \ninteresting the actual incremental tax cuts represent only 20 percent \nof the overall size of the bill, and we do not know all of the exact \ntotals in the bill. But an analysis of the earlier passed House version \nwould result in 22 million families getting a check back from the IRS \nthat is bigger than what they paid in both payroll and income taxes \ncombined.\n  So when we say, well, this goes to folks who do not pay income taxes, \nour friends on the other side said: Yes, but they pay payroll taxes. \nYes. Combine the two. The check they get back, in 22 million cases, is \nstill more than the combination combined.\n  There are so many other concerns that we have expressed with this \npackage. We talked about the fact that small businesses create 80 \npercent of the jobs in the country. So you would think this bill would \ncontain all kinds of things to help small businesses create more jobs.\n  Well, we looked in vain. It turns out that about one-half of 1 \npercent of this package is dedicated to helping small businesses \nproduce jobs, one-half of one percent. In fact, only $7 billion total \nis provided for all business incentives combined, and one of the key \nfeatures relating to net operating losses that passed the Senate was \ntaken out of the conference report.\n  There are other provisions that will expand the cost dearly. If you \nlook closely in this package you will find a $17 billion tax, in \neffect, on Government spending because we included a requirement that \nthe Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rules must apply to most of the \nspending in the bill. That adds a cost of $17 billion because of the \nrequirements of Davis-Bacon. There are provisions that expand welfare \ndependents. It reduces or eliminates current work requirements for \nwelfare and will obviously or ultimately lead to less work and more \npoverty.\n  There is even a provision relating to unemployment benefits that \nallow people to leave a job to care for a family member and then \ncollect employment insurance compensation. Now, States, interestingly, \nhave to amend their State laws in order to take advantage of this \nprovision.\n  We really missed an opportunity to create private sector jobs through \ntrade. Yet that is the area where the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. The United States has actually only had a positive growth in \nour gross domestic product by virtue of our exports. This is another \narea, sadly, that has been missing from this legislation. At the end of \nthe day, this is not the right way to spend $1 trillion, gambling on \nour future and certainly not providing that we will stimulate economic \ngrowth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I believe I am scheduled for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order, but the Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If the Chair would advise me when 5 minutes has been \nused, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so note.\n  Mr. CARDIN. It is interesting my friend from Arizona mentioned small \nbusiness, because this morning on my way into the Capitol--I go home \nevery night to Baltimore--I had a meeting with small business leaders \nin Prince George's County. We noticed this a couple days ago. The room \nwas overflowing. These small business owners want us to take action to \nhelp them. Minority businesses, women-owned businesses, veterans' \nbusinesses--they want to see bold action because they are hurting. \nTheir businesses are hurting. They are having a difficult time getting \ncredit. They are using their credit cards for credit because they can't \nget SBA loans and credit from banks.\n  In this legislation, there is help for small business procurement \nfrom the Federal Government. There are provisions in this legislation \nthat will make it easier for them to get 7(a) loans and 504 loans by \neliminating the cost so it would be less expensive for small \nbusinesses.\n  The bottom line is that the American people are looking for us to \ntake bold action, to give our new President the tools he needs to get \nour economy back on track.\n  In Maryland we have lost jobs, as has the rest of the country. \nNationwide we have lost over 600,000 jobs last month, over a million \njobs in the last 2 months. Foreclosures are at record numbers. \nBusinesses are closing their doors. Consumer confidence is at an all-\ntime low. We need to take action.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will create jobs. In my \nState, it is estimated to be 66,000. It will provide tax relief for 2.2 \nmillion Marylanders of $800. It will provide for the American \nopportunity tax credit for 253,000 Marylanders which will help them pay \nfor college education. It will increase unemployment insurance for \n242,000 Marylanders who are on unemployment by $100 a month. It will \nhelp modernize 138 schools in my State.\n  Nationwide we will double the renewable energy capacity of America. \nWe will computerize medical records which will make it safer for \npatients and less expensive. We will build roads and\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\nbridges, the most expansive public infrastructure efforts literally \nsince President Eisenhower.\n  I am pleased that the final bill includes the Mikulski amendment that \nwill help auto sales by allowing taxpayers to deduct the cost of the \nsales tax. I am appreciative that the committee included an amendment I \noffered with Senator Ensign to expand the homeowners credit for first-\ntime home buyers, introduced last year to make it a true credit of \n$7,500 and to extend that through November of this year. That will help \nhome sales. It was the housing market that triggered the current \nrecession. That is an important issue. It will restore consumer \nconfidence in home buyers. I am pleased to see that was included.\n  I am pleased to see the amendment I offered for small business, for \nsurety bonds to make it easier for small businesses to get surety \nbonds, increasing the limit from 2 million to 5 million for \nconstruction companies to get help from SBA to get the surety bonds so \nthey can get part of this procurement.\n  This underlying bill provides for significant opportunities to create \njobs now in which small businesses will participate and be the driving \nengine for creation of new jobs in our country. That is how it should \nbe. We need to take action in order to expand job opportunity now and \nmake the type of investments so America can compete in the future. \nThere is accountability. There is transparency in this legislation.\n  I have confidence that we will pull out of this recession. America \nwill continue its economic strength. But let us give the tools to \nPresident Obama that he needs so we can answer that person who talked \nto me this morning, the small business owner who has to use personal \ncredit cards in order to get a loan to keep the business open, because \nhe can't get a loan from the bank even though he is creditworthy. We \nneed to provide the type of economic stimulus to our economy to create \nthe type of jobs now to fill the void to make sure America can compete \nin the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, if the Chair could let me know when I \nhave about a minute remaining, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, our economy needs a stimulus; there is no \nquestion about it. Senator Cardin certainly illustrated that in his \nremarks. Americans are worried, very worried about job security and how \nthey will support their families and stay in their homes if they lose \ntheir jobs. The Senator mentioned businesses in Maryland. I know \nbusinesses in Kansas are the same way. All over the country, our \nNation's businesses are struggling. Not a day seems to pass without \nanother major U.S. employer announcing stunning layoffs. However, this \nconference report--this didn't get here until 12 last night. You talk \nabout transparency. I defy any Senator to say he has been through every \npage of this in terms of transparency.\n  This conference report is a missed opportunity. We had an opportunity \nto provide pro-growth policies that put money directly into the pockets \nof families and businesses. When they have more money in their pocket, \nthey can spend it as they see fit rather than handing the money over to \nthe Government to redistribute elsewhere. Instead the conference report \nfurther reduces the tax relief that will go to workers from $500 to \n$400 per individual, from $1,000 to $800 per couple. Estimates are that \nthis tax relief will add about $13 more per week in the worker's \npaycheck this year. Next year it will add only about $8 a week. How \nwill $8 a week stimulate the economy? It won't even buy a family of \nfour dinner at McDonald's off the dollar menu. They will probably have \nto split the hamburger.\n  We also had an opportunity to fix housing first--that is the Gordian \nknot of what faces us in terms of an economic stimulus--to address the \ncore problem in our economy. Unfortunately, our colleagues across the \naisle rejected meaningful housing relief during Senate debate. Now the \nconference report dramatically cuts the tax relief to encourage \nqualified home buyers to purchase a home, one of the very few things in \nthe stimulus that would have done us some good.\n  Most Americans are clearly opposed to the spending in this bill. A \nbill negotiated in a back-room deal without the transparency we were \npromised by the new administration. A bill that increases spending at \nthe expense of putting money directly in the pockets of families and \nbusinesses.\n  This bill remains a honey pot for too many special interests. It \nreinforces a growing and dangerous mindset that the Government--not \nprivate enterprise, personal responsibility and hard work--is the \ncreator of wealth and prosperity. It reinforces for individuals, \nbusinesses, and State and local governments that the Federal Government \nis the source for funding for--the honey pot--for whatever they need.\n  I have here the ``Berenstein Bears,'' a little book I read to first, \nsecond, and third graders. It should have been required reading prior \nto the stimulus. ``The Trouble With Money, With the Berenstein Bears.'' \nOpen the book and it reads: When little bears spend every nickel and \npenny, the trouble with money is they never have any. And then after \nlearning their lesson, the cub asked Momma bear: What about the money \nwe earned?\n  You earned it and it is yours, said Momma.\n  No more, not with this conference report. It borrows money for \nprograms that, in many cases, should be funded by local or State \ninvestments and that won't create jobs now, such as $300 million for \nnew cars for Federal employees. The problem with $300 million for new \ncars is that somebody is going to drive them. Rather than focusing on \npractical and comprehensive approaches to fixing housing first, this \nbill diverts Federal funds to controversial and politically skewed \ngroups that will do nothing to address interest rates, availability of \ncredit, or declining home values that are at the root of the housing \nand mortgage crisis.\n  Two infrastructure provisions have miraculously grown during this \nconference. First, the Senate bill provided the highest level of \nfunding for Amtrak at $850 million. The House had $800 million. The \nconference report includes $1.3 billion for the rail company. Does this \nmean Amtrak will stop in Dodge City, KS at some time other than 4 a.m. \nwhich they do today?\n\n  Second, the high speed rail earmark that is not an earmark, that \nreceived $2 billion in the Senate bill and zero in the House, has \nsomehow grown by 400 percent overnight. I know some of my colleagues \nwill come up and say this is not an earmark to the tune of $8 billion \nin taxpayer money. But press reports have already questioned this \ndefinition since it appears the rail link between Los Angeles and Las \nVegas will be the major beneficiary. I guess they hit the jackpot.\n  I want to be clear as well that the health care provisions in this \nbill are not stimulative. Instead they represent major policy changes \nthat should have gone through the regular order.\n  The most egregious example of this stealth maneuvering is $1.1 \nbillion for the establishment of a new Federal board to conduct \ncomparative effectiveness research. The majority is aiming, bluntly \nput, for research that justifies restricting access for Medicare \npatients to medical treatments that the Government deems to be not cost \neffective. That is an extremely dangerous path to be on. One need look \nno further than Canada and the United Kingdom for examples of \ncomparative effectiveness research being used to deny access for \ntreatments for breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid \narthritis, and much more.\n  I also want to highlight the inequitable increases to Federal \nMedicaid funding for States. I have heard arguments from my friends \nfrom States that reap large windfalls under the regular Medicaid \nformula as well as under the special bonus formula in this bill. But \nyou cannot tell me with a straight face that the State of New York \ndeserves $12.2 billion more than the State of Kansas.\n  Under this bill, the State of Kansas is estimated to receive an \nadditional $450 million, while the State of New York will receive an \nadditional $12.65 billion. That is nearly 28 times more than what my \nState will receive. When CBO estimates that total enrollment-driven \nState Medicaid increases are only expected to be $10.8 billion, well \nanything\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\nmore than that is an earmark in my book.\n  So I want everyone to understand the State of New York is getting an \nearmark that is 28 times what the State of Kansas is getting, 23 times \nwhat the State of Iowa is getting, and 41 times what the State of \nNebraska is getting. That is not fair.\n  Americans do not want us to place greater debt on future generations \nby supporting a bill that doesn't provide the right incentives to \nstimulate the economy and create private sector jobs. The American \npublic does not want the Government determining what is and what is not \na beneficial health care treatment.\n  This is not our finest hour as a Congress. We had a real opportunity \nto stimulate our economy, create jobs, and put money back in families' \nwallets through common sense tax relief.\n  There is an old story that says you can't kill a frog by dropping him \nin boiling water. He reacts so quickly to the sudden heat that he jumps \nout before he is hurt. But if you put him in cold water and warm it up \ngradually, he never decides to jump until it is too late. He is cooked. \nMen are just as foolish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair.\n  If you take away their freedom overnight, you have a violent \nrevolution on your hands. But steal it from them gradually under the \nguise of security or stimulus or recovery, and you can paralyze an \nentire generation. I think we failed on that front. We are not \nstimulating the economy. We are creating a nanny state based upon a new \nform of American socialism. The lure of that is especially dangerous, \nas many people I would have never suspected will be coming to \nWashington, coming to the honey pot, not doing things for themselves at \nhome but coming to Washington expecting some kind of a stimulus or \nmoney or grant. That is not right. It tears at the fabric of what \nAmerica is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I do not have much time, so I cannot take the liberty \nI would normally take to build on the metaphor offered by my dear \nfriend from Kansas about this frog in the hot water. But I will say \nbriefly that I see this legislation, this conference report, as \nessentially being a prod to the American economy, which is kind of like \na lethargic frog right now, not moving very far, and when this bill \npasses and is signed by President Obama, that American frog is going to \ngo jumping positively all over the landscape.\n  Now, having gotten that out of my system, may I say that you have to \njudge this bill not just on its face or as a matter of theory but in \nreality, in the context of the world we live in now. The fact is, \nwithout belaboring it, because we are living it, we are going through \nin this country the most severe economic emergency since the depression \nof the 1930s, and it is happening in a way that is unprecedented. It is \nnot like the 1930s. So we are working very hard to figure out a way to \nget us out of it.\n  What is the reality? Hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every month, \npeople laid off, hundreds of people every month; the market going down; \nthe value of people's homes dropping more than $4 trillion in the last \nyear; the stock market dropping somewhere around $8 trillion; \nconfidence sapped in our economy; no credit from the banks.\n  So this is not a perfect piece of legislation. I do not believe I \nhave ever seen one in my 20 years in the Senate. But this is a very \nstrong piece of legislation. I will say, bottom line, I am confident \nthat passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which is \nbefore us from the conference committee, will be the turnaround of the \nAmerican economy. It will stop the slide of our economy. It will \nprotect and create millions of jobs. It is that strong and that urgent.\n  I said from the beginning that I thought this so-called stimulus \npackage should be as big and clean and quick as possible. Big because \nthe problem is so big that the economists I have talked to--left, \nright, center--say: Don't do what Japan did when it, through a similar \ncrisis, kind of gave a little, it did not work, and gave a little more. \nGive it a big investment. I think this bill does that.\n  Clean. Yes, there was some stuff in it at the beginning that, in my \nopinion, was not as directly related to job creation or economic \nrecovery as it could have been, should have been. That is why I worked \nwith the bipartisan group of centrists, and I think we ended up cutting \nout $110 billion, a lot of programs. The bill is as clean as possible, \nas it could be.\n  Quick. That is most important. You cannot legislate in the middle of \nan emergency in a way that is as lethargic as that frog I described in \nthe beginning. The American people need help. This bill will provide \nthem help.\n  I want to make two quick points. There is a lot of spending in this \nbill, and some people are rightfully worried about whether we can spend \nthis much money this quickly and do it without waste or fraud. I want \nto say on behalf of Senator Collins, who is the ranking member of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and myself, we \nhave responsibility for the oversight of Government spending generally. \nWe take that seriously. We intend to oversee aggressively the carrying \nout of this economic stimulus package. We are going to begin with a \nhearing in our committee on March 5 to examine how the Federal \nGovernment will account for the billions of dollars that will be spent \nover the next 2 years, with a focus on ensuring that measures are taken \nto prevent cost overruns, that strict oversight of contractor \nperformance is in place, that grant conditions are met, and that fraud \nis promptly prosecuted.\n  Speed in distributing money, as I said, is critically important, but \nwe cannot repeat the kinds of mistakes that occurred in support of \nIraqi reconstruction projects or in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina \nwhere money rushed out the door with little accountability and too many \nbillions of taxpayer dollars were wasted.\n  This bill, on its face, gets off to a good start in that direction. \nIt includes $200 million in additional funding for our inspectors \ngeneral to hire experienced auditors and investigators to police the \nspending under this program. It creates a Recovery Accountability and \nTransparency Board, headed by a Presidential appointee and composed of \nat least 10 inspectors general from the departments and agencies that \nhave jurisdiction over the recovery package.\n  The bill adds protections for whistleblowers who work for State or \nlocal governments or private contractors, who generally have no \nprotection against retaliation, if they disclose waste or fraud in the \nspending of these stimulus funds. A special Web site called \nrecovery.gov will provide transparency by posting information about \nspending, including grants, contracts, and all oversight activities, so \nthat any American will be able to report on waste, fraud, or abuse when \nthey see it. But our committee is going to police this, working with \nthis board, and stick with it to do our best to make sure every \ntaxpayer dollar is spent efficiently.\n  Final point: I cosponsored, with Senator Isakson, a proposal to \ncreate a home buyer tax credit of $15,000 to help stimulate the home-\nbuying sector of our economy, raise home values, along with the $50 \nbillion the Secretary of the Treasury has to use to prevent \nforeclosures and modify delinquent mortgages. Unfortunately, the \nconference committee determined that our proposal was too expensive to \nfund. It ended up coming in at over $35 billion. But there was a good \ncompromise to create an $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit, with \nno recapture--in other words, you do not have to pay it back--and it \ncan be used until the end of this year, December 1, 2009. As I said, it \nis raised to $8,000. This is no small incentive. In fact, the estimates \nare that this credit will cost us $6.6 billion. But what that means is, \nI think hundreds of thousands of people who want to buy a home will get \nthis special incentive--an $8,000 tax credit--to buy that home. That \nwill raise the values of homes generally and get this economy of ours \nmoving again.\n  Bottom line, we are in an emergency. This bill is as big and \nunprecedented as the emergency. As I said before, I believe we will \nlook back at the passage of this bill and say: This is where the\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\nAmerican economy began to turn around and work its way out of the great \nrecession of 2008 and 2009.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the administration and many of my colleagues have \nargued that we cannot rely upon the same strategies that got us into \nthis mess to get us out of it, and I wholeheartedly agree. I am voting \nagainst this stimulus bill because I believe it replicates a failed \nstrategy.\n  Some of my colleagues have claimed that a ``nay'' vote on the bill \nmeans we are for doing nothing. I want to correct that misimpression. \nThat is just not true. We all understand the economy is in crisis. This \nweek, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas said that my \nState--which had been doing well relative to the rest of the country in \njob growth and from an economic standpoint--is now officially in \nrecession, which confirmed what small businesses have been telling me \nfor weeks. None of us disputes we are in a crisis. Some of us disagree \nabout what we ought to do in order to get out of this crisis.\n  I believe a stimulus bill would have been a good idea if it had been \nfocused on the right priorities. That, I believe, was President Obama's \noriginal vision. The administration said it wanted a bill that was \ntimely, targeted, and temporary when it came to the spending that is \ncontained in it. I daresay that if this bill had reflected President \nObama's priorities, it might well then have received the 80 votes he \nsaid he wished it could receive, if it had truly been the product of \nbipartisan collaboration and cooperation. But it was not.\n  The fact is, we never saw the bill the President said he wanted. We \nsaw instead that Speaker Pelosi and Democrats in the House essentially \nwrote the bill themselves and really redefined the word ``stimulus'' to \nmean nearly anything they wanted in a bill which they knew they could \npass because they knew this was an emergency, there was not adequate \ntime to scrutinize the spending and projects, so they knew this was a \nmoving vehicle, and they took every opportunity to load it up with a \nlot that is certainly not targeted, timely, or temporary and thus \nbreached with the vision President Obama had said he envisioned for the \nbill.\n  That is the reason why this bill will receive very little support on \nthis side of the aisle. In fact, out of 535 Members of Congress, I \nwould be surprised if there are more than 3 on this side of the aisle \nwho will support this bill because it was essentially written by the \nleadership in the House and the leadership in the Senate and without \nRepublican contributions. Indeed, every amendment that was offered, \nwith only rare exception, was rejected upon party-line votes--both in \nthe Finance Committee, on which I serve, and here on the floor. That is \nnot bipartisan. If, in fact, this bill had been produced by a \nbipartisan process, I have every conviction it could well receive an \noverwhelming vote on both sides of the aisle in this body. But this was \na failed opportunity, I believe.\n  Many of the programs in this bill are, in fact, wasteful and \nunnecessary. These are earmarks in all but name only: golf carts, art \nprojects, company cars, and new buildings for Federal employees. And \nthese are only some of the spending plans that we know are contained in \nthis 1,100-page bill which, as the Senator from Kansas pointed out, we \ndid not get a copy of until roughly midnight last night--without enough \ntime for Senators to actually read every line, to discuss it and \ndeliberate on it and to make sure we understand what is in it and that \nwe are not simply wasting taxpayer money. The fact is, we will not have \neven had 24 hours to look at the conference report before being \nrequired to vote on it later today, a report negotiated in secret, \nbehind closed doors, and which seemed to be briefed to reporters and \nleaked to the press before many Members of Congress actually got a \nchance to look at it, but we are told: Don't worry. Trust us.\n  The people in my State of Texas were promised many benefits under \nthis bill, at least $10 billion of direct spending and aid to our \nState, according to the Democratic policy committee--$10 billion. Well, \nthat is one reason some of my constituents are saying: Senator Cornyn, \nwe want some of that even if we understand your point that in order to \nget it, my State's share of the cost of this bill will roughly include \n$90 billion, including interest. Mr. President, $10 billion for $90 \nbillion in debt? That does not strike me as a great bargain. Now, I am \nnot an accountant, and I am not sure the Democratic policy committee's \nnumbers are accurate. I just cannot vouch for them. But accumulating \n$90 billion in debt to receive about $10 billion in benefits does not \nstrike me as a good deal. And I suspect the deal is not much better for \nany of our other States.\n  The math does not work on a national scale either. Even if this bill \ndoes ``create or preserve'' up to 4 million jobs, that means we are \npaying about $300,000 per job--$300,000--which is more than five times \nthe median household income in the country.\n  Now, if we are going to do this, why don't we just give the money \ndirectly to the people through lower taxes, letting them keep more of \nwhat they earn? They would create and preserve far more jobs than the \nGovernment is going to be able to do and we would not be in the process \nof picking political winners and losers in the process.\n  But now the tax relief in this bill is even weaker tea than it was \nbefore, averaging only about $8 a week, according to some accounts--\nhardly stimulative. The simple truth is, Government is inefficient at \ncreating jobs, and this morning the Wall Street Journal explained some \nof the reasons why.\n  Many Federal agencies, such as the Department of Energy, simply do \nnot have the capacity to spend all of this money as quickly as Congress \nis appropriating it through this bill. I expect the same is true for \nmany State and local governments. But the fact is, we in Congress have \nsimply not taken the time to find out. Instead, we are determined to \nturn up the water pressure across all levels of government without \nthinking about which pipes will burst and whether they can handle the \nload.\n  Nobody knows what will happen once this bill is actually implemented. \nI appreciate the distinguished Senator from Connecticut saying he and \nthe ranking member on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee are going to do extensive oversight. But I would suggest, the \ntime to do our due diligence is before passing the legislation, before \nspending the money, not after it is already spent, when Government does \nnot have the capacity to deal with it.\n  And then there is this: The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat this so-called stimulus bill will actually reduce growth of gross \ndomestic product over the next 10 years. Because as the CBO says, it \nwill actually--because of such enormous direct Government spending, it \nwill crowd out private investment in the economy and actually hurt the \neconomy, rather than help it as its proponents have promised. That \nmeans many millions of our children will have fewer opportunities as \nthey enter the workforce, even as they inherit more and more public \ndebt than any generation in history.\n\n  The tragedy of this $1 trillion bill is it ignores hard-learned \nlessons. We cannot spend our way to prosperity. During the Bush \nadministration over the last 8 years, we spent a lot of money. We \nstrengthened our homeland defenses, we delivered a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare, and we increased Federal support for education. \nYet all that additional spending--for the war on terror, for homeland \ndefense, prescription drugs, and education--did not protect us from a \nrecession.\n  In last year's stimulus package, we sent out rebate checks. Remember \nthat was about a year ago where we sent out cash to taxpayers \nostensibly as a rebate which, in fact, represented a redistribution of \nmoney from people who did pay income taxes to people who don't. You \nknow what. It had virtually zero effect in terms of stimulus. Now we \nare going to do it all over again, this time under the guise of \nrefundable tax credits, again sending money to people who don't pay \nincome taxes from people who do pay income taxes in a vast \nredistribution of wealth and replicating the failed example of the \nstimulus package we passed a year ago.\n  Now, I understand these are unprecedented economic times. I \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\neven the smartest people in the world have a hard time knowing what we \nshould do, but shouldn't we at least prevent repeating mistakes we know \ndon't work? I don't think it takes a rocket scientist or a master of \nthe universe to know that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is not as though my colleagues are just \ncomplaining about the bill on the floor. We offered a constructive \nalternative to fix housing first that got us into this mess and which, \nI believe, if we had listened to some constructive suggestions on this \nside, would help lead us out of it. We also know that letting people \nkeep more of what they earn exerts a much greater multiplier effect in \nterms of the economy than does direct Government spending. Finally, the \nidea that we can spend money we don't have on things we can't afford \nsimply defies logic.\n  I am sorry this is a missed opportunity, both for bipartisanship and \nan opportunity to actually solve a real problem confronting the \nAmerican people. I believe there are better ideas available, and those \nideas remain available if we simply have the will to embrace them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am honored to be here to speak in \nfavor of the economic recovery plan.\n  Yesterday we celebrated Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday. As I sat \nthere and listened to the historians talk about Abraham Lincoln's life, \nthere was one thing that stood out to me and that is the importance of \ntiming. They talked about when he was there in those very dark days of \nthe Civil War, that he had to make a decision. He had to make a \ndecision about whether he was going to sign the Emancipation \nProclamation, freeing the slaves. He thought about it for awhile. He \nknew if he did it at one time, it would be too early, and if he waited \ntoo long, it would be bad. Finally, he signed it. The Historian said \nyesterday it is very possible that if he had done it 6 months earlier, \nwe would have lost a number of States that wouldn't have been with us; \nand if he had done it 6 months later, we would have lost the momentum \nthat propelled us forward to win the Civil War. It reminded me again \nthat timing is everything and that timing matters.\n  This is a time to take action with our economic crisis. This is the \ntime. With each passing day, we get more bad news: another round of \nlayoffs, dropping consumer confidence, increasing debt. Last month, we \nlearned the United States had lost 598,000 jobs in just 1 month--the \nmonth of January. As the President pointed out, that is basically \nequivalent to the total number of jobs in the State of Maine. That \nhappened in 1 month in the United States of America.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, the unemployment rate rose to 6.9 \npercent last month. That is the highest it has been in 20 years. The \nnational unemployment rate is now at 7.6 percent. It is across the \nboard. Great companies in my State such as Target and Best Buy and \nAmeriprise are trying everything to do the right thing, but they still \nare having to lay off employees.\n  Behind all these numbers and statistics are real families. They are \nnot just a number, such as 598,000; they are real families, people whom \nI have spoken to across our State; moms and dads who put their kids to \nsleep and then sit at the kitchen table with their heads in their hands \nthinking: How are we going to make it? A woman wrote me saying she got \na little inheritance from her father. She was going to use it for her \ndaughter's wedding and now she had to spend it on her own retirement \nbecause it got blown in the stock market.\n  As we prepare to vote on this bill, it is important to remember how \nwe got there. Our economic crisis is a result of bad decisions on Wall \nStreet, a result of greed, as well as the result of a failed economic \npolicy for 8 years. There is a diner that used to be down the street \nfrom me in Minnesota. It was a motorcycle diner called Betty's Bikes \nand Buns. There would always be a bunch of motorcycles parked in front. \nThere was a sign in the window that said: ``Betty's Bikes and Buns: \nWhere lies become legends.''\n  Look at the past 8 years. We were told by the past administration \nthey would create jobs. Just last month--the last month of the past \nadministration--we lost 8,000 jobs. They told us they would restore \nfiscal responsibility. Well, we went from the largest budget surplus \nleft by the Clinton administration to a record-high budget deficit left \nby the Bush administration. They told us they would reduce that \ndeficit. They didn't do it. ``Where lies become legends.''\n  The people of this country in this last election said they had enough \nof lies, they had enough of legends, and they wanted to see change. \nThey wanted to put a President in who was going to tell them the truth \nand not sugarcoat it, not make a bunch of promises and not keep them. \nIf we are going to get out of this crisis, we are not going to be able \nto rely on the ideas that got us here, as some on the other side have \nargued. We need a new direction and that is what this bill offers. It \nis not a perfect bill, but it is the first step to jolting this economy \nback in the right direction.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will jump-start our \neconomy in the near term by creating jobs, but it is also going to give \nthe people of this country something to show for their money. The \nlegislation provides economic assistance aimed directly at Main Street. \nIt provides economic relief to working families, small businesses, and \nseniors. It gives critical support to States and communities so they \ncan ensure a safety net for families hurt by the economic downturn, and \nit will save or create 3.5 million jobs.\n  In my State of Minnesota, the projections are that this bill will \ncreate 66,000 jobs. A recent analysis concluded that the economic \nrecovery bill could create as many as 91,000 jobs in Minnesota by 2010. \nAdditionally, it will provide a tax cut to 95 percent of working \nfamilies and offer additional unemployment benefits to so many of the \npeople in our State who have lost their jobs.\n  This legislation will put Americans back to work building bridges, \nbuilding roads, building schools. That is what this legislation is \nabout. The legislation invests $116 billion in infrastructure, in \nscience, roads, bridges, highways, and transit systems. The Federal \nHighway Administration estimates that for every $1 billion of highway \nspending, it creates nearly 35,000 jobs. We know a little bit about the \nneed to invest in infrastructure in my State. We had a bridge that fell \ndown right in the middle of the Mississippi River, 6 blocks from my \nhouse. As I said that day, a bridge shouldn't fall down in the middle \nof America. Not a six-lane highway, not a bridge 6 blocks from my \nhouse, not a bridge that my daughter travels as she rides with me and \nmy husband every day when we go to work or go visit our friends. It \nshouldn't have happened.\n  The Federal Highway Administration estimates that more than 25 \npercent of the Nation's 600,000 bridges are either structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete. That is the good thing about this \nbill. It gives us immediate short-term jobs, as well as giving us \nsomething to show for it, so that years later, when this economy is \nrunning again, we will have the bridges that will take the goods to \nmarket, the good highways, and the good rail.\n  This plan will also create jobs by investing $43 billion in homegrown \nrenewable energy, creating new energy jobs across the country. As I \nhave traveled across my State, I have seen the possibilities. I have \nseen the little solar panel factories. I have seen the wind turbine \nfarms. When we had the information technology revolution--the IT \nrevolution--it created jobs. A lot of those jobs were for people who \nhad graduate degrees and Ph.D.s and they had to be in certain parts of \nthe country. That is what is great about this energy technology \nrevolution--the ET revolution. We have had experts testify before our \nenvironmental committee, and they have told us the ET revolution will \ncreate not just those Ph.D. jobs and those graduate student jobs, they \nwill create jobs for working people, building those wind turbines, \nworking on those solar panels, putting in those lines for that \nelectricity grid.\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\nIt is jobs across the demographic spectrum of this country. It is \ngreen-helmet jobs, not just Ph.D. jobs.\n\n  Finally, I wish to highlight the $7 billion this plan contains for \nbroadband for Internet and for telecommunications infrastructure. When \nPresident Roosevelt, back in 1935, looked at this country, he knew \nthere was a problem. Only 12 percent of American farms had electricity. \nThere we were in the middle of the Depression and only 12 percent of \nAmerican farms had electricity. Now, what did he do? Did he put his \nhead in the sand and say: Well, times are bad, we are not going to do \nanything? No. He said: Let's invest in some jobs, and let's invest in \nmaking things better for people so we can get this economy moving \nagain. You know what. Fifteen years later because of rural \nelectrification, we had about 75 percent of the farms with electricity. \nWe went from 12 percent to 75 percent in 15 years. That is what \nGovernment action will do when it is done right.\n  Focusing now on the present day, in so many counties in my State we \nhave Internet service, but it is either too slow or too expensive. This \ncountry has gone from fourth in the industrialized world for Internet \nservice subscribership to 15th in just 8 years. How are we going to \ncompete with countries such as Japan and India if we are going \ndownhill, if we are nosediving when it comes to Internet service? This \nbill puts over $7 billion in infrastructure for Internet. In these \ntough economic times, broadband Internet deployment creates jobs, not \nonly direct creation of jobs in the technology sector but also the \ncreation of even more indirect employment opportunities by increasing \naccess to the Internet. I want these jobs to go to Thief River Falls, \nMN, or to Lanesboro, MN, instead of over to India and to Japan. I want \nthem to be in our country.\n  This recovery plan offers an economic one-two punch, including tax \ncuts that will promote more consumer and business spending by providing \nrelief to middle-class families, small businesses, and seniors. Second, \nFederal spending that will create jobs and strengthen the economy with \ninvestments in transportation, renewable energy, and high-speed \nInternet.\n  The American people are tired of the lies and legends of the last 8 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, they want action. They want the truth. \nWe literally can't afford to wait any longer to pass something.\n  As President Obama recently said, the time for talk is over. The time \nfor action is now. If we don't act, a bad situation will become \ndramatically worse. This is our time. This is our opportunity. Let's \nget this passed today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the moment of truth is almost here, the \ntime when we will all have to cast our votes. I submit this is a sad \nday for our country, for the American taxpayer, and it is a sad day for \nfuture generations, who will be left paying for this trillion dollar \nspending bill.\n  The American people are hurting and they are demanding action. \nUnfortunately, Congress has failed the American people and lost an \nincredible opportunity to empower small business owners, fix our \nhousing crisis, and turn our economy around. So many things could have \nbeen done with this legislation that could have meaningfully led to job \ncreation and economic stimulus.\n  In the few short hours that the final bill has been available, it is \nclear that the Democratic leadership has turned a deaf ear to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  The final spending bill still includes spending on wasteful \nGovernment projects that have outraged taxpayers across the country. \nThe final bill includes: tax benefits for golf carts, electric \nmotorcycles, and ATVs; $300 million for Federal employee company cars; \n$1 billion for ACORN-eligible block grants; $50 million for arts \nendowment; $165 million for fish hatcheries; $1 billion for the census.\n  Instead of mouse habitats, electric golf carts, and fish barriers, \nCongress should have focused on serious proposals to address the \nhousing crisis and create jobs through small business tax relief.\n  There were a number of opportunities. I view this as the question of \nwhat could have been. A number of amendments that were offered last \nweek would have addressed this crisis with respect to housing and job \ncreation and getting the economy back on a path to a recovery. Senators \nMcCain and Martinez and other Republican Senators offered an \nalternative proposal that would have cut wasteful Government spending \nand focused on targeted investments and tax relief.\n  This proposal was a well thought out and fiscally responsible \nproposal. It included a commonsense provision that would have cut off \nnew spending after two consecutive quarters of economic growth greater \nthan 2 percent of inflation-adjusted GDP.\n  The alternative plan would have invested about $45 billion in \ntransportation infrastructure, $17 billion in defense facilities and \nresetting our combat forces. This targeted spending would have \nrehabilitated our military facilities and equipment while creating jobs \nover the next 9 months--important tax relief that would have put money \nback into the hands of average middle-income families in this country \nand incentives for small businesses to create jobs, hire employees, and \npurchase equipment.\n  What is unbelievable and, in my view, a major flaw in the Democratic \nstimulus bill is this simple fact: The bill we will be voting on spends \n$6 billion on Federal buildings and only $3 billion on small business \ntax relief. Small businesses create most of the jobs in our economy--\nthree-quarters to 80 percent of the jobs in this country. We ought to \nbe figuring how can we get that economic engine going again so small \nbusinesses are making those investments. As I said before, this bill \ncontains $6 billion for Federal buildings and only $3 billion for small \nbusiness tax relief--a small, minuscule amount. One-third of 1 percent \nof the final stimulus bill is going to small business tax relief.\n  In terms of the way the bill breaks down, 27 percent of the entire \nalmost trillion dollar bill is in tax relief in some form, or tax \nprovisions. Many would argue that it was meaningful tax relief. There \nare a lot of better ways to deliver tax relief. The rest is in the area \nof spending. Forty-seven percent of that spending doesn't occur in 2009 \nor 2010. Only 11.3 percent will be spent in 2009, which means one \nthing--there is a lot of spending in the bill that cannot be \ncharacterized as stimulus. In other words, it is spending that will go \non and on for years to come. What is remarkable about it--the late \nPresident Ronald Reagan once said that the closest thing to immortality \non this planet is a Government program.\n  There is a letter out from the CBO in response to a question posed by \na House Member regarding some spending in the bill: What would happen \nto the 20 most popular Government programs that are funded in this bill \nif, in fact, at the end of the 2 years the funding doesn't terminate? \nIn other words, a lot of this spending will go on and on over time. \nWhat CBO found was the total cost of the bill, if those programs are \nexpended--bear in mind that these are popular items on which it will be \ndifficult to turn off the spigot. If the spending continues past that \n2-year window, the cost of this explodes to $3.27 trillion. The \ninterest alone is $744 billion. So it will be $3.27 trillion for much \nof the spending in this bill if it continues beyond the 2-year window.\n  As I said, according to CBO, only 47 percent of the spending part of \nthe bill gets spent in 2009 and 2010. There are so many better ways \nthis could have been done. We offered amendments last week. I mentioned \nthe McCain amendment. I offered an alternative focused on tax relief \nfor middle-income families and small businesses, which, according to \nthe methodology developed by the President's own economist, Christina \nRomer, would have created twice as many jobs at half the cost--6.2 \nmillion jobs--and the cost of this amendment voted down last week was \nabout $440 billion or, in rough terms, half of what we are looking at \nin the bill we are voting on today.\n  The last amendment I offered last week, toward the end of the debate, \nwould have taken the total amount. I don't agree that we ought to spend \nthis\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\namount of money. I think it is stealing from future generations. If we \nare going to do it, the question is, should Washington spend it or \nshould the American people? I took the total amount and divided it by \nevery tax filer in the country--182 million people who file a tax \nreturn in this country--and we could have given a rebate of $5,403 to a \nsingle filer and to a couple filing jointly, $10,486--if we take the \ntotal amount of the bill and divide it among the taxpayers in this \ncountry. I would be willing to bet that the American people would much \nrather have that check than have money going to Washington, DC, to \nspend on these new programs, many of which will create obligations and \nliabilities for generations to come.\n  I think we have missed a golden opportunity here. I think we have \ncreated a whole new realm of spending that will go on for some time \ninto the future. It is not fair to our children and grandchildren. The \nFederal Government needs to learn to live within its means. I can tell \nyou as somebody who comes from the prairies, when the prairie pioneers \nsettled South Dakota and places such as that, they understood a basic \nprinciple or ethic, which was that they were going to have to sacrifice \nso their children and grandchildren and future generations could have a \nbetter life.\n  What we have done with this bill is turn that very ethic entirely on \nits head. What we are asking future generations to do is sacrifice by \nhanding them a trillion dollar debt so that we here and now can have a \nbetter life, and we cannot live up to the obligations we have to pay \nour bills on time.\n  It is a sad day; it is unfortunate. This could have been much \ndifferent. There could have been more input from our side. It is a bill \nheavy on spending, not only temporary but spending that will continue \nto go on for some time into the future and create obligations down the \nroad. If this is correct and the CBO response in this letter is \naccurate, if these programs continue to be funded and don't terminate \nat the end of the 2-year period, there will be $3.27 trillion in \nliabilities that we are creating today by voting for this legislation. \nIt is not fair to our children and grandchildren and to the future \ngenerations who will bear the cost of the fact that we cannot live \nwithin our means and cannot come up with a way to fund an economic \nrecovery plan that creates jobs and helps stimulate the economy and \ngets this recovery underway in a fashion that is fiscally responsible.\n  I regret that I will be voting no on this bill. I urge my colleagues \nin the Senate to do the same.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is the largest spending bill ever \nto be voted on. It will probably be passed by this body. It has been \ndone in the most rushed fashion that we have ever done a spending bill. \nIt is the least bipartisan ever. Not a single Republican in the House \nvoted for this bill; nine Democrats voted against it.\n  Unfortunately, in conference, the bad parts of the bill got bigger \nand the good parts got smaller. We are left with a spending bill of \ngigantic proportions and a stimulus package that is small, by any \nmeasure.\n  I will point out a few historical numbers. We have had stimulus \npackages in the past, and we have needed them. We need one now. We have \nnever, in the history of the Republic, had a stimulus package over the \nsize of 1\\1/2\\ percent of GDP. That is the biggest we have ever done in \nthe history of the Republic. This stimulus spending bill is 5.5 percent \nof the GDP of the entire country. It is huge--more than three times \nlarger than any we have ever done.\n  To give perspective, we did a stimulus package in 2008 in the amount \nof $152 billion. This is $800 billion. In 2001, it was $38 billion. \nThat seems small by today's standards. This one is 5\\1/2\\ percent of \nGDP. If you look at the actual tax cuts, there are things in the tax \ncuts I think are good. There are other things in spending I think are \ngood, but they should not be in a stimulus bill. They should go through \nthe regular order in a spending package.\n  We will have the omnibus spending bill after the break. That will be \nhundreds of billions of dollars, and people can measure that. But the \ntax cut piece of this bill that is probably going to be stimulative--\nand I would support as being stimulative--is a total of $76 billion, \nwhich is 9.6 percent of the bill. Many of the tax cuts in the bill are \nactually spending through the Tax Code or an AMT fix that will not be \nstimulative, which most people regarded as that will be fixed and they \nare not going to alter economic activity based on that. You are left \nwith $76 billion in tax cuts that would be stimulative. As I said, \nthere are things in there I like. I congratulate the majority on some \nof those tax cuts that are in it--the issue on first-time home buyers. \nWe have done that in Washington, DC. It was helpful in stimulating the \nhousing market here. I think it will stimulate the market across the \ncountry. Wind energy is in here that will help our Plains States--the \nSenator from South Dakota, myself, and many others. This will help in \nwind energy, a key growth area for us. I am supportive of that. I think \nthat is important. We got a piece in here about deductibility of State \ntaxes on purchases of new automobiles in 2009. That will have a \nstimulative effect. I think it will be small. There is bonus \ndepreciation for a big industry in my State, aircraft, that will have a \nstimulative effect. It will be positive. All of those I support and I \napplaud the majority side for that.\n  The sum total of those altogether is less than 10 percent of the \nwhole package. Instead, we are left with this gargantuan spending bill \nthat is 5\\1/2\\ percent of the economy, which we cannot afford. It will \nnot be stimulative. It will a be highly speculative Government bubble \nthat we are creating.\n  At the end of the day, the last and biggest number in this whole bill \nis a number of $12 trillion. That is in the bill and that is what we \nare growing, what we are setting the debt limit of the country at in \nthis bill. We are raising it to $12 trillion. That is in the bill. The \nreason we are raising that debt limit to $12 trillion--you guessed it--\nit is headed that way. We are getting closer with this bill.\n  We have come to a very big speculative bubble on housing and consumer \ncredit and a number of other things as well. This speculative bubble \nled to a lot of housing being built, cars being purchased, and all was \nfine. But then the bubble burst. Now we are trying to substitute that \nwith a Government speculative bubble. We are going to spend all this \nGovernment money and in a speculative, highly leveraged nature, because \n100 percent of this is borrowed. That is somehow going to stimulate the \neconomy. It is going to leave that big, massive hole in it.\n  I am deeply concerned about what this is going to do both in the \npresent and in the near-term future. I hope we can do better. There is \na great possibility that we can do better. I think we should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to publicly express my appreciation \nfor the thoughtful time certainty on this by the Republicans. As they \nknow, we\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\nhave a couple issues on our side, one is a death and one is the health \nof one of our Members. They have been very thoughtful and understanding \nof our situation. For that I will always be grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings at pages \nH1307 through H1516 of the Record of February 12, 2009.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the conference report?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized for 7 minutes \nand be informed when I have used 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this debate is coming to an end, and it \nnever really started. We are bringing a conclusion to a process that \nwill spend $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years, and there has never \nbeen a thoughtful discussion between the parties to figure out how we \ncan get there from here.\n  The Republican alternative was $440 billion, I believe. It had tax \ncuts. It had spending on unemployment benefits extension, food stamp \nextension. It had a $35 billion, $45 billion amount of spending for \ninfrastructure, shovel-ready jobs. It was an alternative that also had \na trigger that said that once the economy got back on its feet and we \nhad two quarters of positive GDP growth, any unspent funds would be \nfrozen, and we would look at trying to get back to a balanced budget \nsituation. In other words, it had a slowdown provision. There is \nnothing in this bill that is going to slow down spending.\n  The compromise that has been reached--$440 billion was the Republican \nalternative--we are going to settle on a bill of about $787 billion-\nplus that received no Republican votes in the House. I think they lost \nseven or eight Democrats in the House. Apparently, they are going to \npick up three Republicans in the Senate.\n  I would argue that if the shoe were on the other foot, if Republicans \nwere in charge and we lost more Republicans than we picked up \nDemocrats, that would be a lead story. So the idea that this is \nbipartisan does not meet any realistic test of bipartisanship, and that \nis a loss. Mr. President, $1.1 trillion unfocused over 10 years, in \nterms of job creation, is a huge loss to the next generation of \nAmericans who are going to pay this bill.\n  We had a chance to start over early on in this administration. The \nattitude that started this process in the House, ``We won, we write the \nbill,'' never changed. It came to the Senate. We spent 1 hour 40 \nminutes marking up this bill. We have had a handful of Republican \namendments accepted. I am not saying our version is the right way \ncompletely. I am saying the difference between $440 billion and $787 \nbillion and $819 billion, the House version, is not $787 billion.\n  There has never been a real effort to try to find common ground. The \npercentage of this bill that is tax cuts is 27 percent of $787 billion; \n27 percent of the amount is for tax relief. A $400 rebate check is a \ngreat part of the tax provision. Last year, we gave people $500 tax \nrebates. That did not stimulate the economy. The $400 will not.\n  What stimulates the economy is cutting taxes for consumers as well as \nbusiness. As Senator Thune from South Dakota said about 75 percent of \nthe jobs in America are created by small business. If your goal is to \nstimulate the economy and create new jobs, one test of this bill would \nbe how much did you do for small business.\n  Less than $3 billion in the entire package is directed to small \nbusiness. I would argue that if 75 percent of the jobs come from the \nsmall business sector and only $3 billion of the money is allocated for \nsmall business relief, we missed this thing by a country mile.\n  This bill started out of the House as a ``We won, we write the bill'' \nspending package that never had a focus on job creation. There are so \nmany things in this bill unrelated to creating a job in the next 18 \nmonths that it is, in my opinion, a failure as a stimulus package.\n  Of the $580 billion of this bill that is appropriated--about 53 \npercent of it is appropriated--only 11 percent of that money hits the \neconomy in the first year. Fifty-three percent of the appropriated \nfunds are not spent until after 2 years from now.\n  So the goal I had working with our Democratic colleagues and the \nWhite House was to try to create as many jobs as possible by \nstimulating the economy through a combination of tax cuts and spending \nthat would create jobs in the near term and, yes, help people who have \nlost a job. We have failed miserably in that endeavor, in my opinion. \nWe have run up the cost of this bill, and every dollar that is wasted \nin the stimulus package that does not create a job is one less dollar \nto jump-start housing and banking.\n  To my colleagues, you all know this one fact. We will never get out \nof this economic mess until we deal with the banking problem and the \nhousing problem. We have wasted a lot of money in this bill that could \nhave gone to banking and housing. There will be a request in the \nfuture, mark my words. The TARP funds left to deal with banking and \nhousing of $315 billion are not nearly enough to deal with the toxic \nassets that cripple the ability to lend, not nearly enough, in my \nopinion, to deal with the foreclosures that are coming in waves in this \ncountry.\n  The stimulus package is important, but it was, in my opinion, the \nleast-effective measure to jump-start the economy. We put all the money \nin the thing that works the least, and we designed it in a fashion \nwhere it will work hardly at all. This is a blown opportunity to come \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to deal with banking and housing. We \nput all our resources upfront in a stimulus package that has very \nlittle to do with creating jobs and a lot to do with growing \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have created more Government, new \nGovernment than we created jobs. We lost the spirit of bipartisanship \nwe were yearning for. It is going to be hard for us to come back to the \nAmerican people after this monstrosity of a bill is understood in the \nnext couple weeks and ask for more money in housing and banking.\n  I am disappointed in the process. I am disappointed in the final \nsubstance of the bill. We spent $1 trillion in about 2 weeks, with very \nlittle discussion.\n  Finally, America wants this Congress and this new administration to \nbe smart and work together. We are not being smart, and we sure as heck \nhaven't worked together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I claim the 7 minutes that is part of the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the scope of this legislation is enormous \nand endangers our country's future economic health.\n  Currently, the U.S. debt burden is huge, but it is going to rise to \n54 percent of the economy in just the next 2 years. That is before we \ntake into account this omnibus spending bill that\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nis still to come before the Congress, another round of TARP, and \napproximately $1 trillion that we have in the bill before us today. \nWhen we add the Children's Health Insurance Program that was passed, \nTARP, a supplemental, the omnibus bill, we will add an additional $2 \ntrillion to our national debt. That means higher taxes for our \nchildren, our grandchildren, and actually just in a few years for \nalmost all Americans.\n  We have been borrowing against future generations. Keep in mind that \nwe have a $60 trillion debt out there in Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other entitlement programs. That money has to be paid \nsomeday.\n  We have to ask ourselves: What will the credit markets around the \nworld think? What will they think about the idea of the United States \nbeing actually solvent? The previous administration, as we heard from \nthe other side, spent money like crazy. I am not going to defend them. \nI was one of the people fighting against a lot of that spending.\n  The spending that is before us today is unprecedented. Unfortunately, \nin the so-called stimulus bill, only about 25 percent of the bill is in \ntrue tax relief. A lot of it is disguised as tax relief, but it is just \nspending. Not all tax relief is equal when it comes to stimulating the \neconomy. Unfortunately, some of the tax relief in this bill that was \nactually good was stripped out of the bill.\n  Today, as a percentage of GDP, Government spending last year was \naround 21 percent. This year, it is going to be close to 30 percent. \nThe historical average over the last 40 years is around 20.6 percent. \nIf we continue to add and add, in not too many years, it is heading \ntoward 40 percent. This amounts to the Europeanization of the United \nStates. Why is this? The government takes up a large percentage of the \nbudgets of Europe's economies. These are more socialist-type economies, \nand that is the percentage of their gross domestic product they spend \non government.\n  Let's consider the cost of this bill. If we count everything that is \ngoing to expire in the stimulus and say it is not going to expire over \nthe next 10 years, the true cost of this bill is somewhere around $3 \ntrillion. We have to ask ourselves: When was the last time a Federal \nprogram was cut or was discontinued? That does not happen around here. \nOnce we put something in place, it seems to be in place forever.\n  The assumptions in the bill that the spending put in place is \nactually going to go away in 2 years seems a little ridiculous to me. \nThat is why we actually should be honest about the true cost of this \nbill.\n  According to CBO, all the stimulus spending will do little to help \nour long-term economic growth. It will help some in the short term but \nnot in the long term. We have to think about not just short term. Too \nmany companies in America were thinking short term. We have to think \nlong term as well for our, once again, children and grandchildren.\n  We did not even receive this 1,100-page bill until 11 p.m. last \nnight. Thanks to all my staff, and the Republican Policy Committee \nstaff. They spent most of the night and today going through this bill. \nThere is no way everybody is going to know everything that is in this \nbill because of the difficulty of trying to go through an 1,100-page \nbill in less than 24 hours.\n  We need to look at history. Japan, in the 1990s, gave us valuable \nlessons about not what to do. They spent $6.3 trillion. Unfortunately, \nthey spent it building a lot of bridges to nowhere, roads to nowhere.\n  We heard we need a lot of infrastructure spending in this country. If \nthis bill had only answered that call. This bill has very little to do \nwith infrastructure. Only a small percentage of this bill actually \ndeals with infrastructure. That is unfortunate. Japan also failed to \naddress the underlying problems in their banking system. Japan created \nzombie banks. These are banks that should have failed but were not \nallowed to. Japan also suffered from a bad course of monetary policy. \nWhile the parallels may not be exactly the same between Japan and the \nU.S., we may be headed in the same direction. That is why a lot of us \nare afraid that this stimulus bill before us today is actually not \ngoing to cure our economic woes.\n\n  The housing industry is what brought this whole economy down. We \nunderstand that. The American people in my State of Nevada know it was \nthe housing crisis that brought the economy down. So if we don't fix \nhousing, how are we going to fix the economy? The underlying problem \nwith the patient here is the housing problem.\n  I had an amendment that actually would have gone a long way toward \nfixing housing. My amendment had three components. The first was that \nAmericans would have been able to get a much lower interest rate--\nsomewhere between 4 to 4.5 percent. About 40 million American \nhouseholds would have qualified for it. It would have given the average \nAmerican household about $450 per month more for their budget. This was \npermanent, though, it wasn't just a one-time check. This was a 30-year \nfixed interest rate. That actually would have helped stimulate the \neconomy.\n  The second part of the amendment was that we took a provision from \nSenator Isakson.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The second part of the amendment would have given a \n$15,000 tax credit to buy homes. That would have helped to stimulate \nthe housing market. Unfortunately, in this bill, that was dramatically \ncut down. And the third part was to help those houses underwater.\n  This spending bill that is before us could have been made so much \nbetter if we had sat down in a bipartisan fashion--not as Republicans, \nnot as Democrats, but as Americans. I hope we learn from the way this \nbill was done that it is not the way we need to fix some of the major \nproblems the country will face in the future. I hope we can actually \nsit down in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, may I be informed when 6 minutes of my \n7 minutes has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, here is what we know of the so-called stimulus bill.\n  This bill will give American workers $8 a week in their paychecks in \nexchange for passing along a $1 trillion debt to our grandchildren. The \nentire New Deal, in today's dollars, cost only half of what this bill \ncosts.\n  We know that if we were to spend $1 million a day, every day since \nJesus Christ was born, we would still spend less money than the cost of \nthis bill.\n  We know that if you were to add the cost of this bill to the national \ndebt that we already have, it would cost each American household more \nthan $100,000 to pay off our country's debt.\n  We know that in the bill there is $50 million that could be used to \nsave red-bellied harvest mice in the San Francisco area, something that \nSpeaker Pelosi has supported.\n  We know that in the bill there is $8 billion for a levitating train \nfrom Disneyland to Las Vegas that the majority leader is very \ninterested in.\n  We also know that people are hurting. That we need to do something to \nhelp the economy. And that something includes a real stimulus bill. But \nwe know this is not the right approach.\n  Mostly, this is spending, not stimulus. Most of the spending in the \nbill does not come soon enough to help create jobs quickly. Most of the \ntax cuts in the bill--such as the $8 per week for working families--are \nwelcome but not stimulative.\n  We know this is a lot of money. An example of how much money is that \nit took us until about 1980, from the beginning of our Republic, to \naccumulate a debt that equals the amount of this bill. Or to look at it \nanother way: The entire annual Federal budget in the early 1980s was \nabout the amount we are spending in this bill.\n  We know this is not temporary. Even though stimulus bills, as defined \nby Speaker Pelosi, are to be timely, temporary, and targeted, this is \nnot. We know that because of the mandatory spending it adds to the \nlong-term budget. We know that because the Senate rejected Senator \nMcCain's amendment which said that after two consecutive quarters of \neconomic growth above 2 percent, the new spending would stop. So this \nbill is not temporary.\n  We know we are bailing out States with much more money than they\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nneed. In my State of Tennessee, it had a $900 million dollar shortfall. \nThat is a lot of money for our State. But our legislature and Governor \nare handling that, with some pain. Yet we are giving Tennessee almost \n$4 billion, as if we had the money to spend.\n  We know we are not seriously thinking about how much spending is too \nmuch spending in Washington, and how much debt is too much debt. We \nknow that we establish policies in this bill--huge policies in \neducation, energy, and health--in 2 weeks, without careful \nconsideration that deserve enormous consideration.\n  I used to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. Its \nbudget today is about $68 billion. We are adding $40 billion a year to \nthat Department for the next 2 years. Does that mean we are completely \nsatisfied with what is happening in kindergarten through the 12th \ngrade? If we are to add $40 billion a year, should we not be asking \nwhat can we do differently to reward outstanding teachers, to add \ncharter schools, to offer parents more choices for afterschool programs \nfor their children? Surely, we can have a debate about education, or \nenergy, or health care if we are going to spend that much new money.\n  We know there has been a lack of bipartisanship. The refrain seems to \nbe: We won the election; we'll write the bill. That was not the tone of \nthe election. That was not what we looked forward to on the Republican \nside of the aisle.\n  We know what we should have done instead. We know we shouldn't have \nspent the whole piggy bank on a spending bill that doesn't include much \nstimulus. We know that we should have reserved as many of those scarce \ndollars as we could to focus on fixing housing first and making sure \nthat we don't underestimate the difficulty we have in getting toxic \nassets out of the financial institutions in this country so they can \nstart lending again and on Main Street we can start doing business \nagain. We know those are the things we should have done instead.\n  This bill doesn't pass muster with truth in labeling. It claims not \nto have earmarks, although that levitating train from Las Vegas to \nDisneyland looks a lot like an earmark.\n  We know that the two provisions in the bill that seemed to do the \nmost to help were cut by the conference report in substantial ways. I \nam speaking of Senator Isakson's $15,000 tax credit for home buyers who \nwould buy homes in the next year, which was gutted. And Senator \nMikulski's and Senator Brownback's effort to give encouragement to \nautomobile and truck buyers all over America to revive the automobile \nindustry.\n  We know that if we are to add $87 billion over 2 years to Medicaid \nfor the States that we may be making the program so rich that we will \nnever be able to decide what to do about it when we have our national \nhealth care debate. We are preempting that discussion without very much \ndebate.\n  I know what bipartisanship is. I have participated in it. When I was \nGovernor of Tennessee, I worked with a Democratic legislature. We \nbecame the first State to pay teachers more for teaching well. I said \nwhat I thought we ought to do and the Democratic speaker said what he \nthought we ought to do. We sat down together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  We took some of Speaker McWherter's ideas and some of my ideas. We \ncame to a conclusion and we together announced the result.\n  President Bush and the Congress did the same thing with No Child Left \nBehind when President Bush working with Senator Kennedy and \nRepresentative Miller. Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici gave us a \ngood example with the energy bill. Seventy of us cosponsored the \nAmerica Competes Act. And the Gang of 14 helped keep the Senate \nfunctioning and produced good Supreme Court nominees.\n  I am disappointed that we have not risen to the occasion. This bill \nshould have been easy to do in a bipartisan way. I hope that this is \nnot a symbol of what is to come with more difficult pieces of \nlegislation, like health care, climate change, and entitlements.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, during the last 18 months, our economy has \nbeen crippled by an unprecedented financial crisis. What began simply \nas rising defaults on subprime mortgages has rapidly evolved into the \ngreatest economic storm since the Great Depression.\n  Shackled by mounting losses on mortgage-backed securities and falling \nhome prices, our banking system has retracted from normal lending. \nStarved of financing, our economy is rapidly deteriorating, while \nmillions of Americans face unemployment.\n  Unfortunately, we have watched two succeeding administrations--the \nBush administration and now, I fear, the Obama administration--propose \nplans to revitalize our economy that have failed to live up to \nexpectations.\n  We are now told that the solution to the current crisis lies in this \nstimulus bill before the Senate. Proponents claim that this bill will \njump-start the economy and reinvigorate private commercial activity. I \ndisagree.\n  This bill has been poorly conceived and hastily crafted. First, the \nimmediate impact of this bill is far too small. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, only 12 percent of the discretionary \nspending in this bill takes place in the year 2009. Secondly, this bill \nis not targeted to maximize its impact. It simply funds, I believe, a \nwish list of government programs rather than focusing on creating jobs \nand bolstering the incomes of all Americans.\n  Finally, I fear that the supporters of this bill have been resting \nfar too heavily on their Keynesian ideological crutch rather than \ndevising good policy here.\n  We are told that Professor Keynes said that government spending was \nthe key to restoring long-term economic growth. We need to remember \nthat Professor Keynes' views evolved a great deal over time. He was \ncontinually changing his opinions when confronted with new facts and \ncircumstances. His famed ``general theory'' of employment, interest, \nand money was borne of his concern that the old policy prescriptions \nwere not working.\n  Because his thinking was always changing, Keynes was often criticized \nfor being inconsistent. He famously replied:\n\n       When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?\n\n  I believe we need a solution that fits the facts and circumstances of \nour times, just as Keynes sought to provide a solution to address those \nof the United Kingdom at one time.\n  Our solution, I believe, needs to focus on restoring our banking \nsystem. Unless our banking system is nurtured back to health, our \neconomy will remain crippled, and much of what is in this stimulus \nbill, I believe, will have been wasted.\n  It is worth remembering that the first thing Franklin Roosevelt did \nupon becoming President of the United States was address the Nation's \nbanking crisis, long before he embarked on the New Deal spending \nprograms. Another example I believe we should keep in mind is the \nexperience of Japan during their so-called lost decade. You will recall \nthat during the 1990s, the Japanese experienced a banking crisis as \nwell. Rather than deal with their zombie banks, Japanese policymakers \nenacted numerous stimulus bills. And despite those spending sprees, the \nJapanese economy continued to stagnate as they increased Japan's debt-\nto-GDP ratio from 60 percent to a staggering 180 percent today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of economists, including several Nobel Prize winners.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all these economists agree that government \nspending is not the way to improve economic performance.\n  Over the past year, I have repeatedly called for an extensive \nexamination of the origins of this economic crisis and of the potential \nsolutions. So far, the majority has refused. In the absence of any \nanalysis or detailed information, they have chosen time and again to \nsolve the crisis by throwing money at it. I believe this is laying the \ngroundwork for a much greater economic catastrophe.\n  It took until 1982 for our publicly held debt to cross the $1 \ntrillion mark. In the 27 short years since, we have amassed a debt 10 \ntimes that amount. Now we are about to vote on a measure that will, in \na single year, add to the national debt what it took nearly 200 years \nto accumulate.\n\n  I fear this is a day we will come to regret, not only because I \nbelieve the stimulus bill will not work but because it will mark the \nday when our generation decided we were not capable of enduring the \nconsequences of our own actions, and therefore future generations must \nshoulder the burden we could not find the courage to bear ourselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the \neconomic recovery package, a package that will create jobs, put money \nin the pockets of the middle class, and strengthen our investment--\nthree extremely worthy and necessary goals. It is a package that will \nturn our economy around--and Lord knows we need it.\n  Let me say, I have heard much talk from the other side claiming they \nare against this package because it increases the budget deficit and \nthe national debt too much. For instance, I heard my good friend from \nArizona this morning talking about generational theft. There is one \nsurprising thing: When we talked about $1 trillion for the war in Iraq, \nall told, we never heard about generational theft. When President Bush \ntalked about $2 trillion of tax cuts, mainly for the wealthy, did we \never hear the words ``generational theft''? Did we ever hear we should \nnot do tax cuts for the wealthy or fund the war in Iraq because it was \ngenerational\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\ntheft? Because it would increase the deficit? No, we didn't. I am not \ncommenting on whether those two actions were worthy, but we certainly \ndid not hear any qualms from the other side.\n  The GOP was a borrow-and-spend party for each of the 8 years \nPresident Bush was in office. They doubled the national debt in 8 years \nand by some estimates added $30 trillion to future liabilities over 8 \nyears. Our friends on the other side of the aisle simply have no \ncredibility when it comes to the issues of deficits and debt because, \nuntil 3 months ago, they didn't give a hoot about it. Only now, when \nthere are Government programs for education and health care and \ntransportation, do we hear about Government debt. But we never hear \nabout it when it comes to funding wars overseas, like Iraq, or when it \ncomes to tax cuts for the wealthy--that is perfectly OK. Where were our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle for the last 8 years as the \ndebt skyrocketed, as generational theft occurred? Where was my good \nfriend from Arizona, who talked about this earlier today when I was on \nthe floor?\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will only yield, since I have only 5 minutes, on the \nSenator's time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield myself the time. The Senator \npaints with an awfully broad brush. I have been in this Senate for 4 \nyears. He knows very well that I voted against most appropriations \nbills. I talked about the debt in almost every speech I have given. So \nI hope we would talk about individuals rather than a group because it \nis not necessarily representative of all on my side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time, I think my colleague from Oklahoma \nmakes a fair point. There have been occasional Members, such as the \nSenator from Oklahoma, the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from Maine, \nMs. Snowe, who have talked repeatedly about increasing the debt. But by \nand large, the speakers we have heard this morning and this afternoon \nand the votes we have seen from the other side of the aisle, both under \nGeorge Bush and now--we didn't hear much talk about generational debt.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield on my colleague's time since I only \nhave 3 minute left.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Sure. Does my friend recall that for many years under \nPresident Bush, the Republican leadership told us how imperative it was \nto repeal the estate tax, which would cost this Nation $1 trillion over \na 10-year period? Mr. President, $1 trillion--and who were the \nbeneficiaries of that tax break? The top three-tenths of 1 percent.\n  We are spending $800 billion, including tax breaks for the middle \nclass, rebuilding this country. What does my friend think about $1 \ntrillion for the top three-tenths of 1 percent as opposed to putting \nmoney into the middle-class and working families?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend from Vermont, and, reclaiming my time, \nhe is exactly right. Let's look at it this way: Does anyone really \nbelieve that if a Republican President had helped construct a stimulus \npackage with $800 billion of tax cuts, that we would hear talk about \ngenerational debt and that we would hear talk about not voting for the \nbill because it increased the national debt? Obviously not.\n  Despite the claims to the contrary, the issue that most--not all--\nRepublicans have with this package is not that it is too big. Oh, no; \nthat is a Trojan horse. The issue is plain and simple that they did not \nlike investments--they do not like the Government to spend money on \neducation and schools, they don't like the Federal Government to spend \nmoney on helping people with their health care, they don't like the \nGovernment to spend money on transportation, helping rebuild our roads \nand bridges, or spending money on changing our energy policy so we are \nnot dependent on foreign oil. Oh, no. It is OK to spend money on the \nmilitary--something I usually support--it is OK to spend money on tax \ncuts for the very wealthy but not to help the middle class with health \ncare and education and transportation.\n  That is why we took the majority. That is why we will stay in the \nmajority, because the average middle-class person knows. They do not \nwant a profligate government. They do not want a government that wastes \nmoney--absolutely not. But I think they want a government that is there \nfor them and makes their lives a little better. They know that all the \nhue and cry of generational theft and increasing the national debt is \nonly coming because this stimulus package helps the middle class with \nsmart Government programs on education and health care and \ntransportation. It is that simple.\n  My colleagues, this package is very much needed. Without it, we could \nend up in a Great Depression, as the deflationary spiral goes down. To \ntalk just ``no,'' as so many on the other side do, is reminiscent of \nHerbert Hoover. Back in 1930, there was a recession about the level of \nthis one, and Herbert Hoover said, ``Do nothing.'' The recession became \na depression.\n  God forbid that happens now. President Obama is struggling mightily \nto prevent it from happening. He should have broad support from both \nsides of the aisle because, simply, this package is a mixture of \nspending and tax cuts--I think it is 56-44; because this package has \naccepted major amendments from the Republican side, the largest of all \nfrom the Senator from Iowa--a reduction in the alternative minimum tax, \nsomething I have long supported. So this is a balanced package.\n  The horror the other side shows when the Government will get itself \ninvolved to help the middle class results in only getting three \nRepublican votes. What more do my colleagues want us to do? Do they \nwant a package just of tax cuts only, no help for health care, no help \nfor education, no help for transportation? Do they want a package that \nis aimed and skewed at the wealthiest among us who are those who least \nneed the help? We have let them offer amendments. We have accepted a \ngood number of those amendments. Yet we have three votes.\n\n  We want to be bipartisan, and we understand that each side mistrusts \nthe other. But I say to my friends, we have reached out, we have \naccepted suggestions, we have put many tax cuts in this proposal that \nmight not get a majority support on our side alone in an effort to \nreach out even though we think there are better ways to stimulate the \neconomy.\n  When we meet you halfway, don't give us the back of your hand and say \nit is not bipartisan. Don't say: It has to be all our way or 90 percent \nour way before we will vote with you. Don't let the hard-right base of \nthis Republican Party keep a stranglehold on you and prevent us from \nmarching forward together, because the country needs better. The \ncountry needs more. The country does need bipartisanship, but more \nimportant even than bipartisanship, as very important as that is, it \nneeds help. It needs help to get this economy out of the mess, to \ncreate and preserve 3 to 4 million jobs, to put money in the pockets of \nthe middle class, and to rebuild an infrastructure that is aging and \nwill hurt our economy long after, God willing, this recession is over.\n  To my colleagues, please, on the next bill--it is too late for this \none--rethink the attitude. We are trying. You have had amendments and \namendments. A good number have been accepted. Republican input, albeit \nfrom three, has been large in this package. Join us. We want you to. We \nare not going to insist on a bill that is 100 percent spending just as \nyou should not insist on a bill that is 100 percent tax cuts. We are \nnot going to insist on a bill that only invests in the things we care \nabout. We will meet you part of the way. But don't give us the back of \nyour hand because we have made real efforts and we know the arguments \nabout debt and generational theft ring hollow because you didn't make \nthose arguments once in the last 8 years when the deficit ballooned--a \nfew did--when the deficit ballooned because of spending on the Iraq war \nand spending on tax cuts, largely for the highest income people in \nAmerica.\n  I hope we pass this package. It is not perfect. I would draw it \ndifferently. My colleague from Vermont would draw it differently than I \nwould. But it is a lot better than sitting here arguing and doing \nnothing. The country is in tough shape. We have had the most difficult \neconomic time since the Great Depression. It requires concerted and \nsmart action that President Obama has outlined. Please join us and help \nus move\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\nthis country away from the difficult times we are now in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to my colleague from \nNew York, as I always do. I was very interested in Senator Schumer \nsaying that they have met us halfway. The first two bills out of this \nadministration have been the C.H.I.P. bill--that was completely put \ntogether by Democrats without any input at all from Republicans and \nespecially from people like me who wrote the original CHIP bill. The \nsecond bill was a stimulus package that was put together with no real \nimpetus and no real help from the Republicans or any of us from this \nside. If you watched the process, it was basically we were told: Take \nit or leave it. When it finally passed by a narrow vote on this floor, \nby really 1, it immediately went into a conference where basically \nRepublican ideas were not really considered. We were left out of \nnegotiating this bill.\n  I cannot help but paraphrase one of the leaders of the White House \nwho said: We Democrats love crises. Why? Because then we can pass \nlegislation we would never otherwise get through the Congress of the \nUnited States or through the elected representatives of the people in \nthe two bodies in the Congress.\n  I am outraged by the amount of government expansion that is contained \nin this bill. The Majority Democrats have seized this opportunity to \nput all kinds of programs in here that are not stimulus, some of which \nmay be very valid in the regular appropriations process, but many of \nwhich are not stimulus, and are eating funds that should be going to \nhelp pull us out of these difficult times. The legislation clearly \nstates that the funds appropriated in this bill should be for emergency \nuses, yet there is plenty in this legislation that is not imminent.\n  I have to say that when my friend from New York, Senator Schumer, \ntalks about tax relief they put in this bill, it is not true tax \nrelief. When you start calling it a ``Make Work Pay'' tax credit, where \nthey give refundable tax credits to people who do not pay income taxes, \nthat is not a tax cut. It is not even tax relief. It is a cost to \neverybody else who works and pays income taxes, and it is not going to \nproduce any jobs.\n  Now, I am not against helping those who do not pay income taxes. I am \nnot against helping people who are out of work. But, let's call it what \nit is--spending. And let us not put this in a stimulus bill, which is \nsupposed to be effective immediately. Those provisions will not be \neffective for 2 or 3 years from now.\n  I have been in the Congress 33 years this year. There has not been \none day in my 33 years in the Senate where the fiscal conservatives \npoint of view has been in the majority, not one day. We have won some \nbattles because of great Presidential leadership or just plain gutsy \nleadership by the conservative Republicans, fiscal conservative \nRepublicans. But, the Congress has been run by the more liberal left \nDemocrats and a few Republicans who will side with them on these \nissues. This has created too much spending.\n  One of the Senators on the floor yesterday said, how can we take \nadvice from people who ran us into bankruptcy over the last 8 years?\n  Well, Congress has exceeded the President's budget 20 times in the \npast 28 years. And it has always been because of the liberal left along \nwith a few liberal Republicans to make a majority in the Senate.\n  Since President Reagan, Congress has exceeded the President's budget \nevery year except the years when President Clinton was in the White \nHouse. Now, why did we match President Clinton's budget when he was in \nthe White House? It was the first time you had a Republican Congress, \nand a President who agreed to a lower budget.\n  Today, the government spending as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct is moving towards 40 percent. That is government spending as a \npercentage of GDP that is more in line with Europe. 40 to 50 percent \nspending of GDP is where Europe is. We are going through the \n``Europeanization'' of the United States of America.\n  We have always had to give in to the left, because they have always \nbeen too many liberal people and a few Republicans who support liberal \nspending. This has led to threats to our principles of freedom, self-\nreliance, and market-driven prosperity.\n  An example is how our government is taking over the financial sector. \nWhy are managers and shareholders of failed financial institutions not \nfirst in line to bear the consequences of their mistaken actions? Why \nare we not following the principles of a free market society?\n  The economy has been stronger than the Democrats have been portraying \nit during those Republican years and during the Bush years, in \nparticular. Democrats keep blaming the current economic decline on the \nfailed economic policies of the past 8 years. But the economy grew each \nyear over the past 8 years. We have only seen a decline in GDP over the \npast 6 months under which both Houses being controlled by Democrats. Do \nnot miss the point. Over all of these years, we have had a liberal \ncontrol of spending in the Congress, and you cannot blame President \nGeorge W. Bush for that. He could have vetoed more, I have got to admit \nthat, but the spending came from the left.\n  We are headed toward Government spending being 40 to 50 percent of \nour gross domestic product. And since the bailouts started last year, \nwe have only added nearly $2 trillion to our national debt. That did \nnot happen when Republicans were in control of the Congress. The \nfinancial rescue package with $700 billion and more for AIG and other \nbanks, we are beginning to wonder when the spending will end.\n  I was amazed that in the last election, the Democrats, who had voted \nfor the financial rescue legislation, went out and chewed up a few \nRepublicans who also voted for that legislation. Even though most of \nthe Democrats voted for it, they chewed Republicans up for voting for \nit and defeated them at the polls--talk about hypocrisy.\n  We have seen very little success for our money, but even worse, we \nhave used it to save management and shareholders of big banks, even as \nhomeowners were forced into default and Main Street businesses faced \nbankruptcy. Now we have a stimulus package of $787 billion.\n  While there is bipartisan concern over the economy, this is a \npartisan plan. This stimulus bill will explode the size of Government. \nWhy? Because the more you explode it, the more you get people dependent \nupon the almighty Federal Government. The liberals who have been \nrunning us into bankruptcy over all of these years will put us even \nmore into debt.\n  I think conservatives need to be more alert. If these provisions are \nmade permanent, and there will be a massive attempt to make these \npermanent, the expansion of Government is going to be enormous. I do \nnot know what you call it other than socialism.\n  Do not get me wrong. I am for a stimulus bill that would work, that \nwould help homeowners, that would strengthen research and development, \nthat would cut corporate and small business tax rates so that they can \nemploy more people, that would move farther and farther toward creating \njobs. That would be effective.\n  However, this bill does not do that. I hope our colleagues will vote \nagainst it. We have to stand up on something, and this is a bill we \nshould stand up on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I wish to be recognized for a unanimous consent \nrequest. I understood under the current unanimous consent we are going \nback and forth. I would ask that Senator Sanders be recognized up to 5 \nminutes, then Senator Coburn be recognized for up to 30 minutes, and \nthen I be recognized for up to 7 minutes, and if a Democrat comes in \nand wants to speak between Senator Coburn and myself that they be \nallowed to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, my sense of history is a little bit \ndifferent than my good friend from Utah. I was under the recollection \nthat George W.\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\nBush was President for the last 8 years. My recollection was that the \nRepublicans controlled the House and the Senate for 6 of those 8 years. \nMy recollection is that during the last 8 years, 6 million Americans \nslipped out of the middle class and went into poverty. My recollection \nis that median family income for middle-class working families declined \nby over $2,000. My recollection is that, yes, the wealthiest people in \nthe country did very well under President Bush but that ordinary people \nstruggled to keep their heads above water.\n  The bill we are addressing this evening is not perfect. I would have \nwritten it differently. I suspect everyone here would have written it \ndifferently. But what it does do is that in the midst of the greatest \neconomic crisis this country has faced since the Great Depression, what \nwe do is begin to address the unmet needs of the American people and we \nbegin marching forward to create the millions of jobs this country \ndesperately needs.\n  Most importantly, we begin the process of moving America in a very \ndifferent direction so that, in fact, this country does not fall into a \ngreat depression from which it would take us years and years and \ntremendous human suffering to dig our way out.\n  What this legislation does is says that after years of neglect, let \nus create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling \ninfrastructure. In the State of Vermont, our bridges need work, our \nroads need work, our water systems need work. That is true all over \nthis country.\n  Let us put people to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. \nThat is what this legislation does. For decades now, people have been \nsaying what a terrible shame it is, how silly it is that we import \nevery single year hundreds of billions of dollars of oil from foreign \ncountries. How silly it is. Well, finally we are beginning to address \nthat absurdity. We are saying now and we are investing in energy \nefficiency, we are investing in wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, \nsustainable energy.\n  Let's end the talk of moving us into a new energy direction. Let's \ninvest in those areas so that America, in fact, can become energy \nindependent. My Republican friends over the years have said what we \nneed to do is give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country. \nIn fact, right now, today, despite the fact that we have the most \nunequal distribution of wealth and income of any country, the \nRepublican leadership today says, let's repeal the estate tax.\n  Do you know that if we did as the Republicans wanted and repealed the \nestate tax completely, we would provide $1 trillion in tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent, millionaires and billionaires \nall? Not one person in the middle class would gain one nickel from that \neffort. It is one trillion dollars for the three-tenths of 1 percent.\n  Then they come to the floor of the Senate and they say, what a \nterrible thing, you are investing $800 billion rebuilding America, \ncreating 3.5 million jobs, giving millions of middle-class and working-\nclass Americans tax breaks. What a bad idea that is. You should do not \nthat. We should not invest $800 billion rebuilding America. We should \ngive $1 trillion to the top three-tenths of 1 percent. That is the \ncontrast in terms of how they want to go and how many of us want to go.\n  What this bill does is not only begin the process of rebuilding our \ninfrastructure, not only begin the process of moving us away from \nfossil fuel and foreign oil, what we also understand is that middle-\nclass families cannot afford to send their kids to college. So we are \nputting a significant sum of money in and expanding the Pell grant \nprogram.\n  This bill understands that in these hard economic times, when \nmillions of our fellow Americans have lost their jobs, hunger in \nAmerica is a real problem. So we are putting money in for food stamps. \nWe are putting money into energy, homeless shelters so that those among \nus, those least able among us, are protected.\n  Working-class and middle-class families cannot afford childcare. We \nare putting billions into helping them get the childcare they need, the \nHead Start they need, and creating jobs in that area as well.\n  This is an 800-page bill. It is not perfect. Everyone knows that. But \nthis bill begins the process----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Of moving the country in the right direction. It should \nbe supported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nebraska be \nrecognized next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my friend from \nOklahoma for the courtesy of extending 5 minutes of his time on the \nfront end of his time, so I will not be going between Senator Coburn \nand Senator Chambliss.\n  Our Nation's economy is in trouble. Over the course of America's \nhistory our economy has been in trouble before but rarely this much. \nJob losses in my State of Nebraska and across the Nation are climbing, \nand the recession that began some 13 months ago is accelerating.\n  Of the 3.6 million who have lost their jobs, nearly half received a \npink slip in the last 3 months. Everyone in Congress knows we need to \nact, and to act soon, to try to stop our economy's downward slide, and \nto ease the increasing hardship felt by millions of American families, \nbusiness owners, workers, students, and seniors.\n  The time is now to begin turning this recession toward recovery. \nCongress cannot wait another 3 or 6 months to see if economic \nconditions worsen. By then it could be too late and we could be in a \ndepression which it could take years to overcome. Now is the time to \nprovide the tools the American people will use, with creativity and \ndrive, to rebuild the economy and return us to prosperity.\n  The $789 billion economic recovery plan before us providing jobs \ncreation and tax cuts for millions of Americans has the best chance to \ndo that, I believe. It is timely. This plan is a vast improvement over \nthe first proposal considered several weeks ago.\n  In the Senate, we faced a reality that any economic recovery plan \nwould require at least 60 votes to overrule a filibuster attempt and \nwin passage. So I and a number of colleagues came together to work \nacross the political aisle with a shared goal: Scrub as much pork, \nnonstimulative spending, and fat as possible from the bill to focus it \nsharply on saving and creating millions of jobs. The group I dubbed the \n``jobs squad'' included my friend Senator Susan Collins of Maine and \nfive other Republicans and some 15 Senators in my own party. I thank \neach of them for their contributions to making the bill better and for \nhelping Congress respond to a national economy in crisis.\n  This legislation before us is also targeted. There has been a lot of \ncriticism of the final bill before us, and I agree it is not perfect. \nOne criticism I have heard is that it will leave just $13 to $15 in \npeople's pockets per week. To many hard-working Americans, that is \nsomewhere between $700 and $800 a year, money they can use to pay \nelectric or gas bills, buy food or medicine, provide clothes for their \nchildren, take a bit of the stress out of their lives.\n  Let's look back a moment to recent history. In 2003, under the \nprevious administration, Congress approved a major tax cut bill that \nincluded $20 billion in economic stimulus for States. Senator Collins \nand I coauthored the provision to help States cope with the loss of \nState revenues tied to the tax cuts. The $20 billion in State aid was a \none-time boost designed to end when it would likely no longer be \nneeded. Eighteen months after the tax cut bill passed, the aid to the \nStates ceased. We have safeguards in the current economic recovery bill \nthat will shut off spending in a similar timeframe. And 78 percent of \nthe spending in this bill will be completed by the fall of 2010, \novercoming the old wives' tale that this money will only be spent at \nthe end of the legislation.\n  This legislation clearly is temporary. As I said, it is not perfect, \nbut it has the support of such major organizations as the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and, in my \nState, the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, and others. Members of these \ngroups will be able to use money from this legislation quickly to hire \nnew workers, tackle infrastructure needs nationwide, expand\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\ntheir businesses, and begin to get our economy moving again. The bill \nwill have a major impact on States across the Nation as well. For \nexample, my State of Nebraska stands to receive a total of $1 billion \nfrom the recovery plan. Nebraska's K-12 school districts will receive \nabout $236 million to prevent cutbacks, teacher layoffs, to modernize \nschools, and for other purposes. For State flexibility money, Nebraska \nwill receive about $52 million to help rebuild vital educational and \nother State infrastructure. It can also be used to help State \ngovernment provide services and avoid layoffs of critical employees \nsuch as State troopers and public safety officers. Nebraska is \nestimated to receive another $310 million in additional Medicaid \nassistance, preserving needed health coverage for low-income Nebraskans \nwho will feel the economic downturn more than many others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for the \ntime. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have been sitting here for about an \nhour. I have to think the American people are pretty sick of what they \nhave been hearing. We heard the Senator from New York talk about how \nbad the Republicans were. We heard the Senator from Utah talk in Hobson \nfashion. It doesn't come anywhere close to solving the problem. I think \nwe ought to have a discussion about how we got here. How do we find \nourselves in the mess we are in? I think we can look at history.\n  There was a great historian named Alexander Tytler. He looked at the \nancient Greeks and looked at what happened to them as they fell. He \nsaid this about republics. He said: All republics fail. They fail as \nsoon as the people figure out they can vote themselves money from the \npublic treasury.\n  There is no question we are in hard times. There is no question we \nneed to do a stimulus package. There is no question the Federal \nGovernment has the power to make a big difference in a lot of people's \nlives who are hurting right now. I don't think it would be fair to say \nthat there is anybody in this Chamber who doesn't want to try to \naccomplish that. The difference is, how do you do it? In doing so, what \nkind of problems do you create?\n  The way we got here is abandoning this little booklet. If you read \narticle I, section 8 of the Constitution and then read what the \nFounders had to say about article I, section 8, it is called the \nenumerated powers. They were very clear in the role of the Federal \nGovernment. We are in trouble today, this Nation is in trouble today--\nnot something we can't get out of, we can; not something that the \nAmerican spirit won't overcome--because we let the politicians abandon \nthe very clear rules and wisdom that was given to us by a unique, \nalmost ordained group of individuals over 200 years ago who saw a \nvision and said: How do we keep this?\n  When we abandon this book, as we have and as we did, and we get into \ntrouble, it is important to recognize what we did wrong, if we are \ngoing to try to fix it.\n  The other thing I am tired of hearing about--and I think the American \npeople are too--this isn't a Bush, Clinton, or Obama thing. This is a \nCongress thing. No President can spend money without us allowing it to \nhappen. I almost laughed when I heard the claims on the Senate floor \nfrom both sides about the trouble we are in and how we got there and \ndeficits and the Senator from Vermont and his claim of a trillion \ndollars.\n  I think the CBO cost on that was $60 billion on estate taxes. But the \nidea that we would put a blame on anybody other than ourselves, the \ntruth of that is, go look at the votes on appropriations bills for the \nlast 8 years. It is nearly 100 percent on one side and almost 95 \npercent on this side of people voting to spend money we didn't have for \nthings we didn't need.\n  It is important the American people, as they see us trying to work \nthrough a process, No. 1, reject any partisanship they will hear. When \nsomebody starts being partisan, turn the TV off because what it means \nis, they don't have anything substantive to talk about if they are \npointing their finger at somebody else.\n  The second question we ought to ask is, is what we are doing going to \nfix the problem? Here is the problem. The problem goes back to this. We \nset up two agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to socialize the risk \nfor homeownership, a total violation of what is in this book. It is a \ntotal violation. Then we said: Maybe we can help people a little more, \nso let's go to subprime mortgages and let's bonus the people who work \nat the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The more subprime mortgages \nthey take, the more money they make.\n  If I remember, one former leader of Fannie Mae made $140 million \nbecause we bought mortgages he knew people weren't going to be able to \npay for, but the incentive was there, in a quasi government-owned \nagency, to do something that is outside of the enumerated powers of the \nConstitution.\n  So as we abandon principles, the best way for us to solve the \nproblems in front of us is to go back and look at the principles.\n  The other concern is, do we have the potential to make things worse? \nNobody has talked about that today. Does what we are doing have a \npotential downside? You can't talk to one economist who doesn't say \nyes. As a matter of fact, by CBO's own score, 10 years from now this \nwill either have zero effect or anywhere from a minus 2 to a plus \nthree-tenths effect on the economy. The reason for that is we are going \nto borrow so much money, as we do in this bill, we are going to crowd \nout private investment. The Government is going to have all the money, \nand people will not be able to borrow money to invest in new ideas \nwhich create opportunity, which create jobs, which create increased \nstandards of living.\n  So going back, how did we get here and what is the real problem for \nus to create a stimulus bill right now, before we have a way to solve \nthe housing and mortgage crisis--because the bank problem wouldn't be \nthere if the mortgage and housing crisis wasn't there, for us to fix \nthose first before we do this and for us to have a plan to do that--as \na physician, one of the things I notice is, if somebody comes into the \nemergency room with chest pain, it is one of three or four things. \nEither they have an esophageal spasm or their esophagus is irritated or \nthey have terrible reflux where the fluid from the stomach acid is \nburning the esophagus or they are having angina, heart pain, due to \nlack of blood supply. If you treat the symptoms, you can make that \nangina go away, but they still have a vascular abnormality around the \nheart that could kill them.\n  My worry with this bill is that we are treating symptoms. We are not \ntreating the disease. We are arguing, partisan arguing: Was this a \nbipartisan bill, wasn't it a bipartisan bill; you did this over the \nlast 8 years, you did this. We need the country thinking forward, not \nbackward. The guide for that has to be the Constitution, which every \nMember of this body is sworn to uphold but violates daily. We are in \nthis trouble because the Congress put us in this trouble. The blame \nlies solely here.\n  Let me talk about the bill for a minute. This is the bill. I won't \npick it up and wave it around for fear I would be called into account \nof using theatrics. But do the American people realize nobody who is \ngoing to vote on this bill has read it? There is $727 million worth of \nspending on every page of this bill. That is what it averages out. So \nnot counting interest, we have a less than $800 billion bill that had \n30 amendments in the Senate before it went to conference. We hear they \nare accepted. Some of them were accepted. We voted on one unanimously, \nand it got thrown out in conference, just a simple little thing like \nmaybe we ought to make sure that contracting is competitively bid. Now \nthe language reads we ought to try to do that, but we will not make \nsure that happens.\n  I brought along with me, thanks to somebody down in the Senate gift \nshop, this little green item. It is called a thimble. In Oklahoma, we \nhave a statement for that kind of thinking. It is called ``there is not \nany more commonsense than what can fit in a thimble.'' So when we take \nout something that is agreed to unanimously in the Senate to mandate \ncompetitive bidding so even if\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\nwe are wasting money, we waste it efficiently, you have to wonder what \nis going on.\n  Let me tell you what is going on. This is a massive bill. Supposedly, \nit doesn't have any earmarks, which is laughable, if you have been \naround here any period of time.\n  The conference did clean it up so you can't truly find out where the \nearmarking is. You could find it out a little bit before it went to \nconference. Now you can't pinpoint it all. But we are going to move \nfrom earmarking to a concept called ``phone marking.'' It is a new \nconcept. It is more powerful than earmarking. Phone marking is this: \nThis bill gets signed, $500 billion of it is going to be disbursed \nthrough the agencies. Guess what is the first thing that is going to \nhappen after President Obama signs this bill. Members of Congress and \nSenators are going to be on the phone saying: I want this money spent \nhere and here and here, and if you don't, in your appropriations next \nyear, you are going to suffer.\n  That is exactly what will happen with the money in this bill. \nEverybody who works inside Washington knows exactly that will be what \nhappens.\n  We have heard talk about the earmarks. I won't try to repeat some of \nthe things that are in this bill. But I will talk about one. We have a \nprivate company that was developed. It has spent several million \ndollars developing a railroad from California to Las Vegas.\n  Do you know what this bill does? It wipes them out. They invested \nprivate capital to develop a railway. In excess of $10 million has \nalready been invested in that, and with the wisp of one earmark, we are \ngoing to bankrupt people who invested their life savings to try to do \nsomething good because the Government is now going to do it through an \nearmark and going to try to accomplish something that has only been \ndone in one country and not effectively. It costs $100 million a mile \nto build a maglev train, and we are not going to see any of that money \nspent for 4 or 5 years because the technology is not here.\n  That aside, there also was an amendment that truly would have done \nsomething to fix the real problem: housing--the Isakson amendment, with \na $15,000 tax credit, if you are buying a primary residence, whether it \nis a foreclosed home or a new one. It would have done something \nmagnificent in terms of lessening the crisis in housing.\n  What did we do? Out. It had an overwhelming vote in the Senate, but \nit is out. How do you explain that? What is going on here? What is \ngoing on here is the initiation of what Alexander Tytler talked about: \nthe failure of a republic. And it is about short-term politically, \nexpedient thinking to the benefit of politicians, instead of what is \nthe best right thing we can do for our country.\n  The very claim that Senator McCain did not offer a substantive bill \nthat would have significantly increased the number of jobs created, at \na significantly lower cost, as scored by CBO and as scored by outside \neconomists, is a spurious claim.\n  Another thing that got added into the bill is the most dangerous \nprecedent for health care in this country we have ever seen. We are \nnow, with this bill, embracing Great Britain's health care system. What \nwe are saying is that we are going to allow the Government in the \nfuture to decide what care you will get. It is called comparative \neffectiveness, and it is going to be based on cost, not clinical \noutcomes. We are going to abandon the knowledge of physicians, the \nexperience they have with their patients, the 8 to 12 years of \nadditional training they have and the lives that have been dedicated to \nimproving the health of their patients. We are going to abandon that to \na bureaucracy where the Government says: We know best.\n  We are going to do that because we cannot afford Medicare in the \nfuture, and we are going to say, just like England says, if you only \nget 1 more year of life, then the most we can spend on you is $49,000. \nIf you are 75 years of age and you are a Medicare patient and you fall \nand break your hip, we are sorry, we are not going to do it because it \nis not cost-effective.\n  The first leg of you losing a doctor-patient relationship and the \nfreedom to have health care decisions made by you and your caregiver is \nburied within this bill and will kill health care in America as far as \nits quality. You will get access--you will get to wait just like Canada \nand England do--but you will kill the quality and will kill medical \ninnovation in this country. This country leads the world. Mr. \nPresident, 7 out of every 10 major breakthroughs in medicine occur in \nthis country. And the reason? It does not mean we have a good system \nnow. It needs to be improved.\n  Here is the theory as I have observed it in the 10 years I have been \nin Congress: Never do what is best when you can do what is safe. That \nis how it operates in Washington and throughout the Federal agencies. \nThey are risk averse, just like the politicians are risk averse to \nchallenging priorities in this bill, that we ought to have priorities \nto spend the money for what would get the most jobs, the most economic \nbenefit.\n  I had an amendment that was adopted. It had 73 or 74 votes. It got \nwatered down and divided in conference because a lot of special \ninterest groups said: Oh, no. You can't do that. So what did we do? \nThey are not a priority as far as what we should be doing right now. As \na matter of fact, 80 percent of--most of the groups that were \ncomplaining about it get their funds from private sources. The best way \nto get them funded back up is getting private sources moving again in \nterms of the economy. But what did we do? We chose the politically \nexpedient path. Again, it was not often thought of--political \nexpediency--by the people who created this country who risked their \nlives and their fortunes to make sure we have the freedom we have \ntoday. But yet we are abandoning that.\n  It comes back to: What is our heritage as a nation? What is the \nheritage we as a nation have been brought forward with? I will tell you \nwhat I think it is. I think the heritage we have is that one generation \nwas willing to make hard choices and hard sacrifices so the generation \nthat followed would have greater opportunity--greater opportunity--a \nhigher standard of living, more freedom, more liberty.\n  What have we done? We are going in reverse. What we have been doing \nfor the last 10 to 15 years in this country, what we have been saying \nis we will take it now. Kids, you lump it. As an example of that, if \nyou look at 2008, the Federal Government spent $25,000 per household of \nyour money. A good portion of it--a third of it--was borrowed. But we \nspent $25,000 as a Federal government per household. With this bill, we \nare going to spend $38,000 per family--just with this one bill. And we \nare hurrying it up. We have to get it done right now because there are \nCODELs, trips, and junkets waiting for Members to go on, including the \nSpeaker of the House.\n  So we have a bill that nobody has read, that has some real questions \nabout whether it is going to be stimulative, that has taken out good \nfinancial controls such as competitive bidding, taken out listing \npriorities, and we are going to vote on it tonight, with nobody ever \nhaving read it. That is about as bad as the partisan bickering we have \nheard.\n  Does it serve us well to hurry and do something when we do not know \nwhat we are doing? Now, there are some staff members who know some of \nwhat is in here. But there is not one person who knows the full extent. \nMark my words, within a month, we will be back in here passing a bill \nto do all the corrections to this bill that we do not have right and \ncorrect at this time. That is how sloppy we do our work. So it is not \nonly sloppy in terms of our effort, it is sloppy in terms of our \ntheory.\n  I would also add we are going to move from $2,000 per family in \ninterest costs to $4,817 per family this next year. Now, in my State, \nthe average family income is below what the Federal Government is going \nto spend with this bill. In my State, average family income is under \n$36,000. Yet we are going to spend $38,000 this next year per family in \nthis country, and we are going to justify we had to do it to get us out \nof trouble. And we are going to do it because we did not fix the real \nproblem, we are treating the symptoms. We are all going to feel good, \nand we are all going to take the invite of the Senator from New York to \ncome on over and join us.\n  The fact is, my oath as a Senator should disallow me from ever voting \nfor this bill. Anybody who votes for\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\nthis bill will be violating their oath to this Constitution. America \ndemands something be done. They are right. We need to do something. \nShould we do it sloppily? Should we do it without focus? Should we do \nit without temperance? And should we do it in a timely manner to make \nsure we are not treating the symptoms as reflux or esophageal spasm, \nbut we actually go in and take the clot or the plaque out of the artery \nthat surrounds the heart? Isn't that what we should be doing? Shouldn't \nwe be fixing the real problem?\n  While we are at it, we ought to be fixing us because we are the \ncocommitters of the real problem. Shouldn't we all be thinking long-\nterm rather than short-term political benefit? Shouldn't we be \nrealizing what is expected of us?\n  I would hope Americans tonight, if they have children, will go and \nlook into the eyes of their children. There is something you see in \nchildren in this country that is very different than when you look in \nthe eyes of some starving African child or some Third World country \nchild. What you see, when you look into those beautiful brown, blue, \ngreen or hazel eyes, is hope.\n  I think about my four grandkids and the one who is on the way. When I \nlook in their eyes, I see hope. Then contrast that with the pictures \nyou have seen of the despair and look of no hope of the kids around the \nworld who have not had the opportunity of this country. What we are \ndoing is we are stealing some of that hope tonight from our children.\n\n  If you do not have a young child but you have one who has grown up, \nthink back to that picture you have on the wall and look into those \neyes and say: Do you want to steal that hope? Because that is what we \nare doing. We are limiting their liberty economically. We are limiting \ntheir freedom to be the best and brightest and have the greatest \npotential that any society has ever offered their youngest citizens. \nThat is what we are doing with this bill.\n  I will close with this and reserve the remainder of my time. There \nwas a President we had who made a statement that was fairly popular, \nbut it has great application right now. He said: Freedom is a precious \nthing. It is a precious thing. It is never guaranteed. It is not ours \nby inheritance. It has to be fought for and maintained and won by every \ngeneration.\n  As we embrace this bill, we are selling out the heritage of our \ncountry. We are denying the hope and joy in those young eyes and we are \nlimiting the freedom our children will enjoy. We can do better. We must \ndo better for this country. Our country needs statesmen who will \nsacrifice themselves for the best interests of the country rather than \nthe best interests of their party or the best interests of their \npolitical career.\n  Freedom is precious. We are going to take a bit of it away tonight. \nIt is going to go away, and you will see a little decrease in the \nglimmer of those children as they contemplate and we contemplate their \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I think I have 7 minutes under the \nconsent. Will you let me know when I have a minute remaining, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to this \nbill, and I do so somewhat reluctantly because I do not think there is \nan individual who is a Member of this Senate who does not agree that \nsomething needs to be done.\n  We are in a financial crisis in this country today. We are in not \njust a financial industry crisis but every household has their own \nfinancial crisis they are looking at. We have folks out of work. We \nhave folks who are looking at their homes being foreclosed, some of \nwhom are even still working. We have real issues that need to be dealt \nwith. The question becomes: How do we solve this problem? How do we, as \npolicymakers, act in a responsible way to address this crisis?\n  There are three real issues that need to be addressed, in my opinion. \nFirst of all, the issue that got us into the crisis mode we are in is \nthe housing industry. The housing industry crisis started years and \nyears ago. I could go all the way back to the Carter administration and \ntalk about bills that were passed by this body that started the ball \nrolling. It steamrolled in subsequent administrations and came to a \nhead last summer and last fall, when we saw foreclosures reach an \nalltime high, and they have gotten higher ever since. We saw the \nfinancial sector of our economy collapse. But that does not do us any \ngood to talk about that.\n  We have to deal with the cards we have in our hand today, and we have \nto look forward. But let us make no mistake about it, if we do not fix \nthe housing crisis this country is in, all the hundreds of billions of \ndollars and trillions of dollars we have obligated and are about to \nobligate are not going to be spent in the correct manner because we \nhave to fix the housing market. We have too many households in America \nthat are upside down. Upside down means the home they have now is worth \nless than what they owe on it. Those particular households all across \nAmerica are struggling right now with the decision of whether they are \ngoing to continue to make their house payment or whether they are going \nto just let the foreclosure proceed so they don't have to make a \npayment on a house that is worth significantly less than what it was \nwhen they bought it.\n\n  There was a provision we debated on the floor of this body last week \ncalled the Isakson amendment. My colleague from Georgia introduced that \namendment which would have allowed a $15,000 tax credit to anyone who \nbuys a home in the next 12 months. That $15,000 tax credit would have \ngone a long way towards incentivizing individuals to buy homes and take \nthese houses that have been foreclosed on out of the inventory of the \nfinancial institutions across this country and allowed our developers \nto get back to work. It would have taken those developers now in their \nown partially developed--or in some instances totally developed--\nsubdivisions and given them the opportunity to get back into the \nmarketplace with credit being freed up and continue to develop those \nsubdivisions and build houses and put carpenters back to work and \nplumbers back to work and folks who lay carpet back to work. That is \nthe kind of stimulus that needs to be done to get the housing industry \nback on track.\n  Unfortunately, during the conference that took place over the last \nseveral days, starting, I think, at midnight the other night, from what \nI hear, and concluding maybe at midnight the next night, that provision \nwas taken out.\n  So with this bill, as we see it on the Senate floor today, the \nIsakson amendment has been so watered down that it is meaningless. It \nis not going to be an incentive on the part of anyone to buy a home.\n  Now, we don't have one single provision in this bill that is going to \nbe voted on, on the floor of the Senate tonight, that is going to \nreally stimulate and invigorate the housing sector of our economy.\n  Secondly, there was another amendment I thought was a pretty good \namendment. I didn't know about it until we got the bill on the Senate \nfloor, but it was a Democratic amendment by Senator Mikulski from \nMaryland. Her amendment basically said: Look, you are not going to \nstimulate the automobile industry by writing checks to Detroit. The way \nyou stimulate the automobile industry is to put people in the showrooms \naround America. I am trying to buy a car right now, and I was \nparticularly interested in what she had to say because what her \namendment did was to allow an individual who bought a car and financed \nthat car to deduct the interest paid on that loan at the end of the \nyear off of their income taxes. Pretty good idea. For somebody who is \nin the market for an automobile, that may have been the final thing \nthat put them over the top. Unfortunately, that particular amendment, \ntoo, has been so watered down that it is meaningless. It is not going \nto do one thing to incentivize or stimulate an individual to go out and \nbuy a car today.\n  The next issue that needed to be addressed is job security and job \ncreation. Are there provisions in this bill that seek to create jobs? \nYou bet there are. Out of $789 billion, I would hope some of those \nbillions of dollars would do that. Certainly, with respect to part of\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\nthat money that is going to infrastructure projects, to build roads, to \nbuild highways, to do waterworks projects, there are going to be jobs \ncreated by that, and I have an appreciation for that fact. However, the \nfact is, it falls way short when it comes to looking at the percentage \nof spending that is allocated in this bill to infrastructure projects. \nIt is minuscule--minuscule--compared to the total amount of $789 \nbillion that has been allocated, and when you add the interest, the \n$1.2 trillion that we are going to obligate tonight if this bill does, \nin fact, pass.\n  There is a way we could have addressed job stabilization and job \ncreation. In the McCain amendment that was on the Senate floor, there \nwas a provision in that amendment that said we can incentivize the \nsmall business community--which is the heart and soul of the job \ncreation sector of our economy--we can incentivize that small business \ncommunity to grow their business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Do I not have a minute left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am sorry, I thought you were going to let me know \nwhen I had 1 minute left.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent for 1 additional minute to Senator Inouye of Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the fact is, that amendment should have \npassed. It didn't pass. That would have gone a long way toward \nstabilizing and creating jobs in this market.\n  The third part of this is that we need to be compassionate. We need \nto extend unemployment benefits. That is an appropriate part of \nspending but, again, minuscule compared to what is being spent here.\n  This total amount of $789 billion which translates into $1.2 trillion \nhas to be paid back. The Lord has blessed my wife and I with four \ngrandchildren, two of whom we have had for about 10 and 12 years, and \ntwo of whom were just born about 60 hours ago. It is those \ngrandchildren of mine and the children and grandchildren of everybody \nin this Senate and all across America who bear the responsibility of \npaying this money back. When we spend money, we are obligated to spend \nit judiciously and responsibly. This expenditure of $1.2 trillion is \nnot going to stimulate this economy, and this bill ought to be \ndefeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   SOCIOECONOMIC PROCUREMENT PROGRAMS\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that the language in section \n1610 that reads ``is otherwise authorized by statute to be entered into \nwithout regard to the above referenced statutes'' is intended to ensure \nthat existing Federal procurement laws applicable to programs that \nallow for set-asides and direct-award procurements for service-disabled \nveteran-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses, tribal \nenterprises, women-owned businesses, HUB Zone qualified businesses and \nother entities covered through SBA programs, as well as, for example, \nthe Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act Program, remain fully applicable to \ncontracts initiated under this Act, is that correct?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct. Nothing in this act overturns or \nchanges the existing procurement laws for the SBA or similar programs \nor the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act. Since approximately 80 percent of the \njobs in the United States are created by small businesses and since one \nof the main purposes of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n2009 is to get people back to work as soon as possible, the intent of \nthis stimulus package is that small businesses, including those \nparticipating in SBA programs, will be able to participate in spending \nprograms contained in the bill so long as the contracts are awarded \nfollowing existing Federal law for competitive and direct award \nprocurements.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator for this clarification.\n\n\n                    SMALL FREIGHT RAILROAD PROJECTS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to clarify a provision \nin the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It is my view that our \nnational transportation policy should promote a balance between the \nhighway and rail freight shipment modes. In promoting this concept of \nmodal balance, I have particular interest in the well-being of the 500 \nshort lines and regional railroads of America. I am advised that these \nrailroads operate 50,000 miles of line, nearly 20 percent of the entire \nsystem. They connect communities and entire rural regions of the \ncountry to the mainline rail network. These carriers provide essential \neconomic and environmental benefits primarily in rural regions of the \ncountry, including those in my State.\n  Pennsylvania has 54 small railroads that operate over 3,000 miles of \nline. It is estimated that if these railroads are abandoned, \nPennsylvania highway users would sustain additional pavement damage of \n$87 million annually. This alone, in addition to the documented \nenvironmental and congestion relief benefits of freight rail, is a \nnotable public benefit to highway users. In 2007, Congress enacted \nPublic Law 110-140, the Energy Act of 2007, and chapter 223 created a \nnew program of capital grants to class II and III railroads to preserve \nthis essential service. I believe that this provides an authorization \nand public interest justification for funding small rail projects with \nstimulus appropriations.\n  There are two programs within the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct that are of particular applicability. They are both adopted from \nthe Senate version of the bill. First, the Senate bill included a $5.5 \nbillion discretionary program that could be used for highway, transit, \nas well as freight and passenger rail projects. The conference report \nfunds this at $1.5 billion. There is a threshold that the projects must \nbe between $20 million and $500 million. I am informed that this is too \nhigh a threshold for most short line rail projects. Fortunately, the \nconference report stipulates that the Secretary may waive the \nrequirement for smaller cities and regions. It is my understanding that \nthese investments may include short-line railroad projects that meet \npublic benefit tests such as those stipulated in the Energy Act of 2007 \nand provide a benefit to highway users. Second, the conference report \nincludes $27.5 billion for highways and surface transportation \ninfrastructure. The conference report explicitly states that grants may \nbe for passenger and freight rail transportation projects. The \nflexibility criteria states that a project must be eligible under \nSection 133 of title 23 601(a)(8) which reads in part ``for a public \nfreight rail facility or a private facility providing public benefit \nfor highway users.'' My understanding is that short line rail projects \nthat ``provide a benefit to highway users'' are be eligible for this \nfunding.\n  I would ask the distinguished chair of the Transportation, Housing \nand Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee \nif I am correct in my understanding that the Secretary may waive the \n$20 million minimum requirement under the discretionary grant program \nand that short line and other freight rail projects that provide a \nbenefit to highway users are eligible under the $27.5 billion highway \ninfrastructure investment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yes, the Senator from Pennsylvania's \nunderstanding is correct. The conference report does give the Secretary \nof Transportation authority to waive the minimum grant size under the \ndiscretionary grant program for the purpose of funding significant \nprojects in smaller cities, regions or States. Additionally, funds \nprovided for investment in highway infrastructure maybe be used for \npassenger and freight rail transportation and port infrastructure \nprojects.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                  economically distressed communities\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to engage my colleague, the chair \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, in a colloquy. The \nReinvestment Act we are passing today provides a unique opportunity for \nsome of our most economically distressed communities to connect to our \nNation's transportation network. We have ``shovel ready'' projects that \nare in need of funds. As the chair knows,\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\nthese Federal funds have enormous potential to help complete work on \nprojects and help bring jobs and economic development to our \ncommunities. I ask my colleague, in helping to draft this legislation, \nis it her intention to ensure that projects already under development \nin distressed communities receive full consideration under the law?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Projects in economically distressed communities are a \nhigh priority in this legislation and those projects should be \naddressed on an expeditious basis under applicable Federal \nrequirements.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our Nation is in a serious recession. The \nAmerican recovery and reinvestment conference report that we now have \nbefore us will help create or maintain 3.5 million jobs.\n  The question before my colleagues is this: Will we act together to \nreinvigorate our economy, turn the tide on this recession, and create \nthose 3.5 million jobs, or will we say no?\n  When we cast our vote today, we are not choosing between the bill we \npersonally would have written and the bill before us. The choice before \nus today is between the bill we have before us and doing nothing. And \nwe simply cannot afford to do nothing.\n  The recession is the most pressing threat to our national security.\n  I have spoken often on the floor over the past several weeks about \nthe alarming job losses that continue to escalate each day. That alone \nshould be enough to convince my fellow Senators we must act.\n  Yesterday, we heard a new argument for action. President Obama's top \nintelligence advisor, Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair, \ntold us yesterday that the deteriorating global economy is now the \ngreatest threat to America's national security--a security threat more \ngrave even than terrorism.\n  He said:\n\n       Roughly a quarter of the countries in the world have \n     already experienced low-level instability such as government \n     changes because of the current slowdown.\n\n  Director Blair said that the most immediate fallout from the \nworldwide economic decline for the United States will be ``allies and \nfriends not being able to fully meet their defense and humanitarian \nobligations.''\n  We have a bill before us that is ready to be sent to the President's \ndesk. What could any of us be waiting for? The global economy will only \nrecover if the largest economy in the world--ours--begins to recover. \nThat is what this bill is designed to do.\n  The bill provides a long list of critical investments. The powerful \ninvestments in America contained in this package are too numerous to \nlist, but here are a few highlights:\n  On infrastructure, the conference report includes a critical $8 \nbillion investment for our intercity passenger rail system. This \nfunding will take us a long way toward the goal of transforming our \nnational transportation system, including rail service for many people \nin my home State of Illinois who want to ride the trains today but \nsimply can't find a seat on our overcrowded trains.\n  The conference report invests $4.7 billion in extending broadband \naccess to underserved areas, so that all American families and \nbusinesses can benefit from the technology of the 21st century. These \ninvestments will create good-paying jobs here in America. And all \nAmericans will benefit from stronger transportation and \ntelecommunication systems in this country.\n  In the area of tax cuts, 95 percent of all working families in \nAmerica will receive a tax cut of up to $800. Mr. President, 26 million \nfamilies will be shielded from paying additional alternative minimum \ntax payments for 2009. Small businesses will benefit from new tax \nprovisions related to expensing, net operating loss carrybacks, and \ncapital gains. These tax cuts will help American families keep food on \nthe table and will help many small businesses stay in business and \nweather the storm of this economic downturn.\n  On education, Pell Grants will be increased by up to $500 per student \nso that more students can stay in school even as the finances of their \nfamilies deteriorate. Illinois students will receive over $650 million \nfrom this national investment in their future.\n  A new American Opportunity Tax Credit will provide eligible students \nwith up to $2,500 to help with tuition and expenses. Over 150,000 \nstudents in Illinois will benefit.\n  Some argue that we shouldn't be investing in education because it \nisn't ``stimulative.'' I disagree. What is the impact on the economy if \nstudents all over the country have to drop out of school because their \nfamilies can no longer afford the cost of higher education? How does \nthat help turn around our economy and sustain our economic strength \nover time? An investment in those students pays off now, and it pays \noff again later, as they emerge from school better prepared to \nparticipate in a renewed economy.\n  On health care, out-of-work Americans trying desperately to maintain \nthe health care coverage they received from their former employer will \nreceive help from the Government with their COBRA payments. The \nGovernment will pay 65 percent of COBRA premiums for up to 9 months \nwhile these individuals look for work.\n  States will receive more Medicaid funds to help low-income children \nand their families keep their Medicaid coverage. My home State of \nIllinois, for example, will receive $2.9 billion over 2 years.\n  It is critical that families receive this modest but vital help as \nthey try to stay afloat and desperately look for new jobs. Providing \ninsurance against the costs of health emergencies is a fundamental way \nto help struggling families, and it produces an immediate, stimulative \neffect as the fund flows.\n  Voting no is the real generational theft. Now, some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle have claimed that this bill amounts to \n``generational theft.'' My answer is this: We are stealing from our \nchildren's future if we fail to act today. If we don't act, we are \nstealing from millions of children the one thing that is more important \nthan anything else: hope.\n  We are trying to save or create 3.5 million jobs with this bill. \nThose jobs aren't just numbers on a page; they represent real lives--\nreal fathers and mothers who either can or cannot make ends meet for \ntheir little ones.\n  Are we not stealing hope from our children if we tell millions of \nparents that they have to go home to their kids and explain that there \nis no more money coming in to put food on the table?\n  Are we not stealing hope from millions of children if we take away \nthe security of being able to sleep in their own bedrooms each night, \nif we stand aside as they are thrown out on the street when the banks \ncome to take away the keys to their homes?\n  Are we not stealing hope from our children if there is not enough \nmoney to allow them to go to college because all of the money that \nmight have been saved needs to be used now to keep the family from \ngoing bankrupt?\n  This bill commits generational theft?\n  We have been told by economists across the political spectrum that \ntoday's economic malaise is greater than anything we have experienced \nsince the Great Depression. We have been warned of the potential for a \ndecade of more lost growth.\n  What is the cost to our children, if they inherit an economy from us \nthat is stuck in reverse or neutral for years and years? If we have a \nway out of this crisis and we fail to act, isn't that the real \ngenerational theft?\n  Voting no today steals hope from our children. Voting no today steals \neconomic growth from our children. Voting no today steals a more secure \nfuture from millions of children.\n  That is the theft we commit today if we fail to send this recovery \nbill to the President's desk.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak on concerns I have \nwith the Medicaid and welfare provisions in the conference agreement we \nwill be voting on shortly.\n  This bill would provide an $87 billion slush fund for the States.\n  As I have said on the Senate floor numerous times during this debate, \nStates don't need $87 billion for their Medicaid Programs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office analyzed an amendment I wrote to \ntarget funds just for enrollment-driven increases in Medicaid spending. \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office gave us the answer for how \nmuch it would cost to provide federal funding for the additional \nMedicaid enrollment\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\ncaused by the economic downturn. And that cost is not $87 billion; it \nis 1.8 billion.\n  The remaining $75 billion in this bill goes to helping States fill in \ntheir deficits. Giving States almost eight times what they need for \nenrollment-driven Medicaid does not meet the definition of targeted in \nmy book.\n  Now, we will hear that this $87 billion Medicaid slush fund for \nStates is necessary to avoid tax increases at the State and local \nlevel. We will also hear that vital State services will be cut unless \nthe Federal Government cuts this big blank check to the States. But \nwhen asked to tie the taxpayer dollars to guarantees that the States \nwill not raise taxes or cut services, we have been turned back by \nMembers on the other side.\n  I heard some folks on the other side of the aisle claim the formula \nfor distributing the funds better targets relief to the States that \nneed it most by using unemployment rates in the formula.\n  Using unemployment makes sense to target--there is nothing wrong with \nthat. But it doesn't work if you then funnel the money for the States \nthrough Medicaid.\n  Let me explain. Every State has a different sized Medicaid program--\nsome States have bigger Medicaid Programs and some have smaller ones.\n  By using Medicaid to distribute the 87 billion, the formula in the \nbill necessarily biases the funds towards States with large Medicaid \nPrograms, like California, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York.\n  Now we'll hear that those States need more because they have larger \nMedicaid Programs. But remember it only takes $10.8 billion to pay for \nenrollment-driven Medicaid spending increases.\n  So States like California, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York get \nfavored treatment and everyone else gets short-changed.\n  Simply put, this way of targeting misses the target. The formula in \nthis bill clearly fails the targeting test of the three Ts.\n  This bill also undermines key principles of welfare reform. While it \nmakes sense to provide a safety net for families that have lost their \njobs, this bill moves welfare policy in the wrong direction.\n  The historic Welfare Reform law signed by President Clinton already \nhas a built-in mechanism to help states during an economic downturn. \nThat law provides welfare contingency funds for States in economic \nneed.\n  But rather than make the existing contingency fund more accessible to \nStates, this bill creates a new fund that includes policies that are \nnot consistent with the principles of meaningful welfare reform.\n  For the first times since the abolishment of the aid to families with \ndependent children program, this new fund gives States financial \nincentives for expanding their welfare caseloads. Rather than encourage \nStates to reduce their welfare rolls, this provision rewards States for \nenrolling families on welfare.\n  This bill also relieves States of the responsibility to engage able-\nbodied adults on welfare in work training, work experience programs or \neducation.\n  It makes no sense to promote policies that encourage States to expand \ntheir welfare rolls while loosening requirements on States to provide \nwork training, work experience programs or education. At this critical \ntime, these job training activities are even more important than ever.\n  These changes will not stimulate the economy nor will they lead to \nproductive jobs. In fact, these policies could trap families in deep \nand persistent poverty.\n  Mr. President, that is clearly not what we should be doing in this \nbill and it is another reason why I am unable to support the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I am back again to speak about some provisions that \nare buried deep within this stimulus bill that was put together behind \nclosed doors without input from the minority. I know this was done \nbehind closed doors because I was a conferee to the negotiations and I \nwasn't even in the room.\n  Now, I have always been a strong advocate of opening up Government, \nmaking it more transparent, making it more accountable, and shedding \nsome sunlight on how the Government works for the people. So, in that \nvain, I am here today to shed some light on provisions hidden away in \nthe conference report that will actually hurt transparency and \naccountability of taxpayer dollars.\n  Inspectors general are the front line against fraud, waste, and abuse \nof taxpayer dollars at Federal agencies. They are independent from the \nFederal agencies they oversee and are independent from Congress. They \nare the watchdogs that are responsible for sifting through all the \nbudgets and expenditures by conducting audits, performing program \nevaluations, investigating allegations of wrongdoing, and working \nclosely with whistleblowers to uncover the truth. Inspectors general \npoint out problems that need to be fixed and save taxpayers billions of \ndollars a year. They are integral to any effort to stamp out waste and \ndeter fraud and abuse. So, I was pleased to see that they weren't \nforgotten in the bill and were given some more resources to oversee the \nbillions in new spending. However, tucked away in this bill is a \nprovision that threatens to micromanage these independent watchdogs in \na manner that is contrary to not only the spirit and intent of the \nInspectors General Act of 1978, but the 31 years of results these \ndedicated fraud fighters have worked to achieve.\n  I will point my colleagues to division A, page 465 of the conference \nreport. There, section 1527 is, ironically titled, ``Independence of \nInspectors General.'' Great title, something you would think you would \nlike to support. If you keep reading, it states that ``nothing in this \nsubtitle shall affect the independent authority of an inspector general \nto determine whether to conduct an audit or investigation of covered \nfunds.'' Again, a nice statement that reinforces the fact that we want \ninspectors general to be independent, but, unfortunately, the provision \ndoesn't stop there.\n  If you read a little further you will find that the bill gives a new \nentity, the ``Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board'' the \nauthority to, request ``that an inspector general conduct or refrain \nfrom conducting an audit or investigation.'' It goes on further to say \nthat if an IG objects to being told what to do and acts independently--\nas we expect them to--he or she must submit a report to that board, the \nagency they oversee, and to Congress within 30 days.\n  Now, I don't know about everyone else around here, but that sounds to \nme like a lot of redtape for an independent watchdog to go about doing \ntheir job. In fact, it is fitting that the acronym for this board is \nRAT, because that is what I smell here.\n  But, most importantly, this provision strikes right at the heart of \nany inspectors' general independence. It appears to me that the \nmajority that crafted this bill, isn't all that interested in \ntransparency and accountability. Let me say it loud and clear: I don't \nlike this one bit and from the chatter I hear, the IGs don't like it \neither--especially if it involves a criminal investigation.\n  Now, some of my colleagues will say this isn't too burdensome and \nthat it will help coordinate the work of inspectors general. Others say \nthat the new board will contain IGs who will have input so it won't \nstifle investigations. Both of these arguments lack merit when you peel \nthe onion back.\n  Any new limitation on the independence of inspectors general is \ndangerous. Here, even though an inspector general is allowed to buck \nthe new board and continue an investigation they are told not to do, he \nor she must then put together a report for that board, the agency that \nis being investigated, and Congress, all within 30 days. This will take \nresources away from investigating and auditing fraud, and turn a truly \nindependent IG into a report writer.\n  As to the argument about the make-up of the new board, it is true \nthat inspectors general will make up the bulk of the board. However, it \nwill be chaired by either: the Deputy Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, a Presidential appointee confirmed by the \nSenate, or any other individual subject to Senate confirmation. So, \nbased upon this model, you could have a situation where the President \nappoints a sitting Cabinet Secretary to oversee the board that oversees \nthe inspectors general that oversee the agency run by the Secretary in \ncharge of\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\nthe board. I don't want to even try to imagine the scenario where the \nhead of the board is a private sector corporate figurehead of a company \nthat has a financial conflict stemming from the fact that the company \nreceives stimulus money. The system this bill creates is not only \nunworkable; it is loaded with potential for conflicts of interest that \nare simply mind blowing.\n  I also question the need for yet another board full of Government \nofficials. Why do we need yet another Government entity? The inspectors \ngeneral have worked cooperatively for years via the President's Council \nfor Integrity and Efficiency, PCIE, and the Executive Councils for \nIntegrity and Efficiency, ECIE, which are made up of inspectors \ngeneral. These entities were recently rolled into the Council of the \nInspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, CIGIE, by the Inspector \nGeneral Reform Act of 2008. This new board created by the stimulus bill \nwill simply duplicate already existing efforts in addition to hindering \nthe independence of inspectors general.\n  We have repeatedly recognized the need for independent IGs and we \nunanimously passed the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 that was \nsigned into law by President Bush last October. That law was passed \nbecause Congress and the IGs recognized that changes were needed to \nstrengthen the independence of inspectors general. It included simple, \nstraightforward reforms such as ensuring each inspector general had \naccess to independent legal advice free and clear of agency influence. \nIt seems to me we all agreed independence was needed for IGs so long as \nit occurred when there was a Republican President. I hate to think that \nthere is some conspiracy here, but when we have all backed the \nindependence of IGs in the past, you have to question the change of \ndirection buried deep within this bill.\n  This is a dangerous provision that will hamper oversight, restrict \ntransparency, and damage the independence of inspectors general. It \nworks against the pledge of transparency and accountability that \nPresident Obama has advocated for and puts another layer of bureaucracy \nbetween taxpayers and the truth about how the hundreds of billions of \ndollars are spent.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk about an immigration provision \nthat was included in the final conference report, as well as a couple \nthat were not.\n  First, the good news. I was pleased to hear that the conference \nreport retained the Sanders-Grassley amendment to ensure businesses \nthat receive TARP funds go through a very rigorous hiring process \nbefore employing new H-1B visa holders. Hiring American workers for \nlimited available jobs should be a top priority for businesses taking \ntaxpayer money through the TARP program. With the unemployment rate at \n7.2 percent, there is no need for companies to hire foreign workers \nthrough the H-1B program--particularly in the banking industry. \nAccording to an AP article, the banking industry requested more than \n21,800 visas for foreign guest workers over the last 6 years. At least \n100,000 workers were laid off in the banking industry in the past few \nmonths. Now that many qualified American bank employees are unemployed, \nbanks who want to hire workers shouldn't have a hard time finding what \nthey need from an American workforce.\n  The Sanders-Grassley language requires that a company receiving TARP \nfunds and applying for workers under the H-1B process must operate as \nan ``H-1B dependent company.'' This means they will still be able to \nhire H-1B visa holders, but must comply with the H-1B dependent \nemployer rules which include attesting to actively recruiting American \nworkers; not displacing American workers with H-1B visa holders; and \nnot replacing laid off American workers with foreign workers. This \nrestriction would last for 2 years.\n  So this amendment would ensure that TARP recipients comply with \nstrict hiring standards in order not to displace qualified American \nworkers. The bottom line is that if banks are going to be getting TARP \nmoney--American taxpayer money then they need to be hiring American \nworkers. While I support the H-1B program, it needs to be used in the \nway it was intended and not to replace qualified American workers. This \namendment helps to ensure that taxpayer money going to assist companies \nget back on their feet also helps American workers keep and/or get \njobs.\n  Now, the bad news. I am extremely disappointed that the final bill \ndoesn't include some very important E-verify provisions. The House \npassed stimulus bill included language to extend the E-verify program, \na program that allows employers to verify the social security numbers \nand legal status of newly hired employees. The E-verify process has \nbeen an extremely successful program for employers. In addition, the \nHouse passed stimulus bill included language that would have made it \nmandatory for companies receiving TARP funds to use the E-verify system \nwhen hiring new employees. These two provisions passed the House with \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  Here on the Senate side, my friend Senator Sessions filed several \namendments to extend E-verify and require TARP recipients to use E-\nverify. I fully supported those amendments. Unfortunately, the good \nSenator from Alabama was blocked from offering his amendments to the \nSenate bill--even though, if given the chance, I am sure that his \namendments would have passed with the same overwhelming vote as the \nHouse amendments.\n  I was ready to support the House E-verify provisions in conference. \nAs we all know, Republican conferees were shut out from any negotiation \nof this conference report. But we were extremely hopeful that the \nprovisions were going to be retained, because of strong bipartisan \nsupport on both sides of Capitol Hill.\n  So I was really surprised to hear that House leadership stripped E-\nverify completely from the conference report. Many people supported \nthese provisions and understood their importance. These E-verify \nprovisions would have helped stimulate the economy by preserving jobs \nfor a legal workforce, so it is outrageous that they were not included \nin the final conference agreement. The American taxpayer is spending \nnearly a trillion dollars to spur the economy. It's not much to ask \nthat the companies receiving hard earned taxpayer dollars actually make \nsure they are employing legal workers. The exclusion of both the E-\nverify reauthorization and the requirement that companies getting TARP \nmoney have to use the E-verify program is truly a colossal failure on \nthe part of our congressional leadership to stimulate the economy and \nensure that jobs go to legal workers.\n  The fight is not over. I am a strong believer in the E-verify \nprogram. I will continue to work with my colleagues to make sure that \nthis important program is reauthorized and utilized by as many \nemployers as possible.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, section 405 of division A of this \nconference report involves an amendment to section 1304 of the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007, which is under the jurisdiction \nof the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, of which I am the \nchair. It is a provision that deals with the standards and protocols \nthat will be used in Smart Grid demonstration projects. With respect to \nthese demonstration projects, the conference report states that the \nSecretary of Energy ``shall require as a condition of receiving funding \nunder this subsection that demonstration projects utilize open \nprotocols and standards (including Internet-based protocols and \nstandards) if available and appropriate.'' This is a clarification of \nlanguage originally passed by the House of Representatives on the \nsubject. It makes clear that all protocols and standards used by Smart \nGrid demonstration projects must be open. Some of those open protocols \nand standards may involve sending information over the Internet. Others \nmay use other means of data transfer. The parenthetical inclusion of \nInternet-based protocols and standards under the requirement for open \nstandards means nothing more than that to the extent that an open \nstandard uses the Internet, it is still an open standard, but (1) the \nuniverse of open standards and protocols is not considered to be \nlimited to only those which use the Internet, and (2) the mere use of \nthe Internet would not cause a standard to meet the criterion of being \nopen if it were not otherwise an open standard. There is no intent in \nthis language to discriminate for or against any given\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\nopen protocol or standard, or to promote any one technology solution \nover another, so long as they are available and considered to be \nappropriate by the Secretary of Energy. The Senate expects the \nSecretary to conduct the process of making awards under this authority \nin a way that ensures there is no discrimination for or against any \nopen protocol and standard that is otherwise available and appropriate.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Senate tonight will send to the \nPresident the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. I think this \nlegislation is a first step not only in turning the economy around in \nthe short term, but also in laying the groundwork for rebuilding and \ngrowing it over the near and longterm. But we need to do much more.\n  I think it is important to lay down a marker right now that our job \non rebuilding this economy is not finished. We must continue to focus \non making the right kind of investments, ones that help us realize our \nmaximum economic potential and ones that update our economic engines \nfor the 21st century and beyond. To do this, we must make a commitment \nto invest in our capacity to innovate and in our capability to \ncommercialize new technologies and discoveries.\n  I have worked with many of my colleagues, especially Chairman Baucus \nand Senator Hatch, on bolstering the incentives that support our \ncountry's research capabilities.\n  For example, I have long been a supporter of making the R tax \ncredit permanent. I continue to believe that we have done ourselves a \ntragic disservice by failing to provide long-term predictability to the \nvery businesses that are driving economic growth and are at the \nfrontline of every innovation and discovery that moves us forward as a \nsociety.\n  We all know that if the high-wage jobs of the future are going to be \ncreated in the United States we have to make the necessary investments \nin intellectual infrastructure to keep American business competitive in \nthe global economy.\n  Investing in America's intellectual infrastructure is key to economic \ngrowth and instrumental in spurring entrepreneurial innovation and job \ncreation. It is just as important as our commitment to physical \ninfrastructure.\n  Yet, thousands of companies employing U.S. workers in cutting-edge, \nresearch-oriented industries such as biotechnology, high technology, \nand clean technology are suffering from the same fate that has affected \nour U.S. manufacturing companies. Without credit markets properly \nfunctioning and with little to no investment from the equity markets or \nventure capital, this next generation of job creators will shrink and \nbecome less competitive in the global economy if we do not take action.\n  Economic analysis tells us that because R doesn't produce fast cash \nit is often a target when times are rough and companies need to reduce \ncosts. It is in our collective interest as a country to help companies \ntake a different path during this economic downturn and find ways to \nhelp innovative companies sustain and increase their R spending now \nso they are better positioned to succeed when economic conditions turn \naround.\n  I will ask to have printed in the Record a letter from 11 technology-\noriented, R trade associations such as the Biotechnology \nIndustry Organization, BIO, the Advanced Medical Technology \nAssociation, AdvaMed, and others--that represent companies employing \nhundreds of thousands of U.S. workers reliant on our commitment to \nintellectual infrastructure.\n  This letter was recently sent to all members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and outlines an approach that would allow small businesses to \naccelerate their use of accumulated net operating losses, NOLs, if they \ninvest in U.S.-based research and development.\n  Expanding incentives to encourage more R activity in the United \nStates will be essential to the American innovators who are developing \nthe technologies of the future.\n  We must commit to considering new and thoughtful legislative \napproaches like this one that can truly move us forward in creating the \nhigh-quality, high-paying jobs of this century, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on these issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles B. Rangel,\n     Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dave Camp,\n     Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Grassley, Chairman \n     Rangel, and Ranking Member Camp: The thousands of companies \n     represented by our organizations, and the U.S. workers they \n     employ, are key drivers of the innovation that enables \n     America to compete in today's global marketplace. As such, we \n     respectfully request Congress take action in the upcoming \n     economic recovery package to invest in America's intellectual \n     infrastructure to support and create the high-quality, high-\n     paying jobs of the 21st century.\n       Specifically, we ask that you support efforts to spur U.S.-\n     based research and development (R) during the economic \n     downturn by allowing small businesses to elect a one-time \n     accelerated use, at a discount, of a portion of their \n     accumulated net operating losses (NOLs) in exchange for \n     giving up the future tax benefits associated with those \n     losses. This proposal, if enacted, will help America's \n     cutting-edge companies weather a difficult storm at a time \n     when the U.S. capital markets are largely frozen to many of \n     our nation's most innovative businesses. Further, this \n     proposal will help to ensure that U.S.-based R by smaller \n     firms does not drastically decline or disappear as America's \n     capital markets recover from the current financial crisis. \n     Failure by Congress to move quickly to enact this temporary \n     proposal could result in a sharp decline in R on cutting-\n     edge technologies (many of which are in fields where the U.S. \n     is currently the global leader) and additional job losses.\n       Investing in America's intellectual infrastructure is key \n     to economic growth and instrumental in spurring \n     entrepreneurial innovation and job creation. Innovative, \n     research-intensive industries enhance America's living \n     standards while creating high-quality, high-paying jobs. \n     American innovation is increasingly challenged by more \n     rigorous global competition and the future of the American \n     economy depends on critical investments today to lay the \n     groundwork for the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Without \n     investment in these fields, the U.S. will find it more \n     difficult to compete in a 21st century global economy.\n       We respectfully urge you to invest in America's \n     intellectual infrastructure by including a proposal to \n     accelerate the utilization of NOLs in the upcoming economic \n     recovery and reinvestment legislation. We thank you for your \n     consideration of this request and we look forward to working \n     with you to get our economy moving again in a way that \n     protects and creates the high-paying jobs associated with \n     America's innovation economy.\n           Sincerely,\n         James C. Greenwood, President and CEO. Biotechnology \n           Industry Organization; Stephen J. Ubl, President and \n           CEO, Advanced Medical Technology Association; Mark G. \n           Heesen, President, National Venture Capital \n           Association; Mark B. Leahey, President and CEO, Medical \n           Device Manufacturers Association; Jonathan Zuck, \n           President, Association for Competitive Technology.\n         Marianne Hudson, Executive Director, Angel Capital \n           Association; Patricia Glaza, Executive Director and \n           CEO, Clean Technology and Sustainable Industries \n           Organization; Sean Murdock, Executive Director, \n           NanoBusiness Alliance; Zack Lynch, Executive Director, \n           Neurotechnology Industry Organization; Bretton \n           Alexander, President, Personal Spaceflight Federation; \n           F. Mark Modzelewski, Founder and President, Water \n           Innovations Alliance.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Congress considers critical \nlegislation to renew America's promise of prosperity and security for \nall of its citizens. I am pleased that the greatly needed relief \nprovided in the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act includes an \ninvestment in health information technology that takes meaningful steps \nto protect the privacy of all Americans.\n  I have long held the view that American innovation can--and should--\nplay a vital role in revitalizing our economy and in improving our \nNation's health care system. That is why I have worked so hard with the \nlead sponsors of this bill to makes sure that privacy was addressed at \nthe outset, as our Nation moves towards a national health information \ntechnology system.\n  I commend the lead sponsors of this legislation in the House and \nSenate, Majority Leader Reid, and Speaker\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nPelosi for making sure that the economic recovery package includes \nmeaningful privacy safeguards for electronic health records. I also \ncommend the many stakeholders, including, the Center for Democracy & \nTechnology, the Vermont Information Technology Leaders, Inc., Consumers \nUnion, the American Civil Liberties Union and Microsoft, that have \nadvocated tirelessly for meaningful health IT privacy protections in \nthis legislation.\n  The privacy protections in this legislation are essential to a \nsuccessful national health IT system. Without adequate safeguards to \nprotect health privacy, many Americans would simply not seek the \nmedical treatment that they need for fear that their sensitive health \ninformation will be disclosed without their consent. Likewise, health \ncare providers who perceive the privacy risks associated with health IT \nsystems as inconsistent with their professional obligations would avoid \nparticipating in a national health IT system.\n  The economic recovery package includes several of my recommendations \nto better protect Americans' health information privacy. First, the \nprovisions give each and every American the right to access his or her \nown electronic health records, and the right to timely notice of data \nbreaches involving their health information. The recovery package also \nimposes critical restrictions on the sale of sensitive health data and \non the use of Americans' health data for marketing purposes. Lastly, \nthe legislation makes sure that the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services receives input from individuals with specific \nexpertise in health information privacy and security, as the Secretary \ndevelops a national health information technology system.\n  These and many other privacy safeguards in the bill will help tackle \nthe difficult, but essential task of ensuring meaningful health \ninformation privacy for all Americans. But, we can--and should--do \nmore. There is much more to be done to ensure that Americans have \ngreater control over their own electronic health records. Another \ncritical issue is the use of new technologies to better secure \nsensitive health records, so that data breaches involving health and \nother sensitive personal data do not occur in the first place.\n  Yesterday, we celebrated the bicentennial of the birth of our \nNation's 16th President--Abraham Lincoln--who once remarked that ``you \ncannot escape the responsibility for tomorrow by evading it today.'' We \nall have a responsibility to ensure quality health care that is both \nefficient and respectful of all Americans' privacy rights. I am pleased \nthat the Congress acted to address the issue of health information \nprivacy at the outset of the ambitious effort to fully digitize \nAmerica's health records during the next 5 years. During the months and \nyears ahead, Congress must build upon this early privacy success with \nmore work on health information privacy on behalf of all Americans.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the American people are counting on us to \nact to stabilize and revitalize the economy, and passage of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act is an essential part of that \neffort. I am encouraged by how promptly the Senate and House have been \nable to reach a compromise on this critical legislation. I support \nfinal passage because it will create jobs and make investments to \nbolster our economy in both the short and long-term.\n  The Nation is in a deep recession and the situation is particularly \ndire in Michigan where the unemployment rate is the highest in the \ncountry. The Bush policy, still supported apparently by all but three \nRepublicans, was a failure. It provided repeated tax cuts to the \nwealthy with the hope that some of it would trickle down to help those \nwho really need it.\n  The legislation before us will provide tax breaks to our working \nfamilies. It will provide a tax cut to 3.9 million Michigan workers, \nand allow over 120,000 Michigan families to benefit from a tax credit \nto make college more affordable. This legislation will also create or \nsave 3.5 million jobs over the next 2 years, including jobs in health \ncare, clean energy and construction. It will also strengthen the social \nsafety net by increasing unemployment insurance benefits by $100 a \nmonth for over 1 million Michigan workers.\n  That is why it is so important that we take aggressive action now.\n  Job creation must be our No. 1 priority as we work to turn the \neconomy around, and jobs are the focus of this conference report. \nShovel-ready infrastructure projects are the most immediate way to \ncreate jobs and get the economy moving quickly. The recovery plan \nincludes $48 billion in funding for ready-to-go road, bridge, rail and \nother projects to immediately and directly create jobs. This \nlegislation is expected to provide Michigan with approximately $1 \nbillion dollars in highway and transit formula funds, allowing for \nsignificant repairs to roads and bridges and purchases of buses for our \npublic transit authorities. There is additional funding which will \nhopefully result in investments in the Midwest High-Speed Rail \ncorridor, and improvements to Amtrak that can help bring commuter rail \nto Michigan.\n  I am hopeful the Army Corps will direct a significant portion of the \n$4 billion toward the Great Lakes to address the backlog of ready-to-go \nprojects and maintain this vital maritime highway of the Midwest.\n  I am also hopeful that the EPA will direct a portion of its funds for \ncleaning up contaminated sediment under the Great Lakes Legacy Program. \nOne report concluded that there is a 2\\1/2\\ to 1 ratio of return on a \nFederal investment on restoring the Great Lakes.\n  The recovery package also contains $6 billion in funding for water \ninfrastructure. These projects immediately create jobs and play a \ncritical role in protecting public health, improving the environment, \nand creating a sustainable and strong economic climate in which \ncommerce can thrive. Specifically, Michigan is slated to receive more \nthan $150 million to address wastewater projects, and $70 million to \nupgrade water mains, leaking pipes, and water treatment plants. These \njob-creating water infrastructure projects will address current needs \nin Michigan, while investing in upgrades that will prepare us for years \nto come. In addition, this legislation contains $200 million for \nenvironmental infrastructure that the Army Corps would manage. In \nMichigan, this funding could be used to address combined sewer \noverflows, which dump harmful pollutants into the Great Lakes.\n  Additionally, the conference committee legislation contains $750 \nmillion for the National Park Service, NPS. The NPS has a significant \nbacklog of deferred maintenance projects that can be started within the \nnext 18 months which will create jobs and help restore and enhance our \nnational treasures. Michigan's four National Park units and the North \nCountry National Scenic Trail have significant funding needs, and a \nnumber of projects have been delayed for years. I am hopeful that the \nNPS will direct a sizable portion of the $750 million included in the \npackage to address the significant needs of Michigan's parks and \ntrails.\n  I am pleased that the $100 million for brownfields competitive grants \ncan be awarded for both cleanup and site assessment projects. I asked \nthe conferees to expand the flexibility for these grants so that more \nMichigan communities could benefit from this funding, and I am pleased \nthat the final bill contains this broader language.\n  The funding in the conference report will create jobs by making smart \ninvestments in technology and modernization efforts that will continue \nto pay dividends by helping us compete in the global economy. I am \nespecially pleased the bill includes $2 billion in grants to encourage \ncompanies to invest in the development and production of advanced \nbatteries and battery systems, which will fuel the energy-efficient \nvehicles of the future and make it more likely they will be produced in \nU.S. factories. In so doing, the conferees have adopted the Senate \napproach of focusing exclusively on grant funding rather than loan \nguarantees, which I believe will go much further in providing American \nmanufacturers the resources and support they need to manufacture these \nbatteries in U.S. facilities. This funding is critical because battery \nmanufacturers and other manufacturers are deciding now where to locate \ntheir production facilities, and we cannot afford to lose those \nfacilities and the associated jobs to other countries that are willing \nto offer greater financial incentives than we are.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report includes significant \nmeasures to\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\nexpand the American market for advanced technology vehicles. It will \nmake these vehicles more affordable for consumers by increasing the \navailability of consumer tax credits for plug-in hybrid vehicles. \nInstead of making the tax credit available only for a total of 250,000 \nvehicles as is in current law, the conference report will make these \ntax credits available to consumers who purchase the first 200,000 plug-\nin hybrid vehicles sold by each manufacturer. Taking this important \nstep will help America get to the goal set forth by President Obama of \nputting 1 million plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road by 2015. I am \npleased that the conference report also includes some funding for \nFederal agencies to aggressively lease alternative energy vehicles--\nsuch as hybrid vehicles--to support a wide variety of agency missions. \nGovernment leasing of these vehicles will help stimulate production of \nthese vehicles. We cannot just preach about the need to produce these \nvehicles. We must lead the way in purchasing them, even though their \nup-front cost is greater.\n  The conference report also makes a clarification in the Tax Code to \nprevent an unintended tax consequence that would have hurt auto \ncompanies and others receiving TARP funds. This clarification will \nlimit section 382 of the Tax Code in instances where a change in \ncorporate control is the result of restructuring required by the \nGovernment pursuant to a TARP agreement. This maintains the clear \nintent of 382 while preventing unintended results that would have hurt \nthese companies at the very time the Government is stepping in to help.\n  This legislation also helps those who have lost their jobs by \nincluding important measures that will help States modernize their \ncurrent unemployment insurance programs and includes administrative \ndollars and funds to incentivize States to do this. For my home State \nof Michigan this means they will receive more than $90 million straight \naway. This plan will also provide a further extension of unemployment \nbenefits which will help the more than 400,000 unemployed workers in \nMichigan who are unable to find a job in these hard economic times and \nthe, on average, 13,000 individuals whose unemployment benefit will \nexpire this month alone. Additionally, it will provide an additional \n$100 per month in unemployment benefits, pumping money directly into \ndepressed economic areas and exempts the first $2,400 unemployment \nbenefits from income tax, meaning more of these funds can go to \nrecipients and help grow the economy.\n  The bill provides funding for important job training in new and \nexpanding fields, as well as funding to enhance and expand education \ninitiatives aimed at ensuring that our next generation of Americans is \nable to meet the challenges of a global economy. Specifically, it \nincludes $53.6 billion for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, \nincluding $40.6 billion to local school districts using existing \nfunding formulas, which can be used for preventing cutbacks, teacher \nlayoffs, or other purposes; $5 billion to States as bonus grants for \nmeeting key performance measures in education; and $8.8 billion to \nStates for high-priority needs such as public safety and other critical \nservices, which may include modernization, renovation and repairs of \npublic school facilities and institutions of higher education \nfacilities.\n  The bill includes $3.95 billion for job training including State \nformula grants for adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs, \nincluding $1.2 billion to create up to 1 million summer jobs for youth. \nThe training and employment needs of workers will also be met through \ndislocated worker national emergency grants, new competitive grants for \nworker training in high growth and emergency industry sectors, with \npriority consideration to training for ``green'' jobs, including \npreparing workers for activities supported by other economic recovery \nfunds, such as retrofitting of buildings, green construction, and the \nproduction of renewable electric power.\n  It includes $13 billion for title 1 to help close the achievement gap \nand enable disadvantaged students to reach their potential; $12.2 \nbillion for special education/IDEA to improve educational outcomes for \ndisabled children. This level of funding will increase the Federal \nshare of special education services to its highest level since the \ninception of the program. Finally, the bill provides $15.6 billion to \nincrease the maximum Pell grant by $500, which will help 7 million \nstudents pursue postsecondary education. Further, the bill includes \n$2.1 billion for the Head Start and Early Head Start to allow \nadditional children to participate in this proven program, which \nprovides development, educational, health, nutritional, social and \nother activities that prepare children to succeed in school.\n  The tax provisions in this legislation will create a refundable tax \ncredit of $400 for working individuals and $800 for working families, \ncovering 95 percent of working families. Taxpayers can receive this \nbenefit through a reduction in the amount of tax that is withheld from \ntheir paychecks, or through claiming the credit on their tax returns. \nThis will mean direct and immediate relief for nearly 4 million \nMichigan workers and their families. The legislation also expands the \nchild tax credit and the earned-income tax credit to ensure that more \nlow-income families get the full benefit. There is also a new, \npartially refundable $2,500 tax credit that will help make 4 years of \ncollege more affordable for an estimated 121,000 families in Michigan. \nFor many struggling families, these targeted tax cuts will help them \nmake ends meet in these tough times. Putting extra money in families' \npockets will offer an immediate boost to the economy.\n  Together, the provisions in this bill offer significant hope for our \nNation's economic future. Still, a comprehensive economic recovery \neffort is balanced on a three-legged stool consisting of creating jobs, \nunfreezing credit markets, and addressing the housing crisis, including \nreduction in the flood of foreclosures.\n  As the housing crisis worsens, I will continue to urge Treasury to \nmove quickly to implement a loan modification program to help prevent \navoidable foreclosures. While much still remains to be done with \nrespect to ending the crisis in our financial sector, the financial \nstability outline put forth by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner this \nweek outlined some new approaches so that recipients of the so-called \nTARP funds will cooperate with mortgage foreclosure mitigation programs \nand provide reports of how the Federal loans are used and will expand \ntheir lending. This is a positive step in the right direction toward \nresuming the flow of credit, but Congress must continue to exercise \nstringent oversight of the TARP program and we must work to reform our \nfinancial system to restore commonsense regulation of this industry.\n  This legislation represents a significant and essential step in \nstabilizing our economy. The infrastructure projects will create \nMichigan jobs, the tax provisions will help Michigan families and the \ninvestments in technology and modernization will pay dividends for \nyears to come. While there are major challenges before us that we must \naddress in order to end this recession, passage of the Economic \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act will give us some urgently needed \nmomentum.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the conference report for H.R. 1, \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This vital legislation will \ncreate jobs, ensure that States can continue to provide essential \nhealth and social services, improve education, and assist veterans.\n  This legislation will create jobs by encouraging innovation for the \ndevelopment of clean energy and strengthening our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Additionally, the legislation includes funding for the \nEconomic Development Administration to create additional economic \nopportunities.\n  Our States are confronted with declining revenue while citizens have \nincreasing health care and social service needs. This bill will provide \nfunding to States so that they can continue to provide health care \ncoverage and essential social services that will help our constituents \nin this great time of need. States must be good stewards of these \nresources and utilize them for their intended purposes. This recovery \nbill will also provide relief to workers and families hardest hit by \nthe economic recession.\n  In order to ensure that we have a well-educated workforce both now \nand in the future, I am pleased to support\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nthe provisions included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \ndesigned to increase and support educational opportunities for our \ncountry's children as well as provide much needed resources and \ninfrastructure improvements for educators nationwide. The establishment \nof a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund will help schools suffering during \nthis difficult economic time to retain teachers and continue programs \nvital to helping students achieve their academic potential. I also \napplaud the inclusion of $100 million for impact aid. Due to the \nsignificant military presence in Hawaii, these funds are vitally \nimportant to Hawaii's public schools.\n  I have been working, along with other members of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, to advocate for the needs of veterans in the context \nof this recovery and reinvestment bill and am pleased that the \nconference report includes funding that will benefit VA and the \nveterans it serves.\n  Although I wanted the final agreement to include more of the Senate's \nshovel-ready projects to improve health care and other services \nveterans receive from VA, I am grateful the conference report includes \nmore than a billion dollars in immediate funding that will create jobs \nwhile improving services for veterans.\n  The conference report also includes $50 million to make key \nimprovements to Veterans Benefit Administration IT systems and $150 \nmillion to provide a temporary increase in claims processing staff.\n  In addition, there is $50 million included in the conference report \nthat is intended for VA's National Cemetery Administration. This \nfunding will be used to provide much needed cemetery infrastructure \nsupport and repair and investment in VA's National Shrine Initiative. I \nbelieve the funding will help meet our obligation to provide final \nresting places for veterans and honor their service.\n  As helpful as this infusion of funding will be, more resources are \nneeded. I remind all of my colleagues that these funds only begin to \naddress existing, unmet needs. When it is time to begin work on the new \nbudget, we must provide a robust VA appropriation to meet the new \nfiscal year's costs.\n  I am glad that the conference report retains a provision to make sure \nthat certain veterans facing financial hardship in this time of \nuncertainty receive an economic recovery payment. I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to secure additional resources for VA.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Inouye, for his ongoing advocacy on \nbehalf of the Filipino veterans of World War II. This conference report \ncontains an authorization for a lump sum payment for funds that were \nappropriated last session for these veterans.\n  I look forward to having the conference report signed into law \nquickly so that we can begin our economic recovery and assist our \ncitizens in need.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n  Our economy is in dire straits. And urgent action is required to get \nthe economy moving and reverse the alarming trend of job loss that is \ncurrently plaguing our cities.\n  This Nation is in the grip of the most serious recession in more than \nseven decades. American families are increasingly facing tough choices \nas economic indicators tumble across the board.\n  Bad news has fallen like a row of dominoes. Our current economic \nsituation is a result of many different problems, all developing at the \nsame time. The major factors: The collapse of the subprime housing \nmarket sent shockwaves through the financial sector of the American \neconomy. This was the direct result of a scheme in which poorly \nunderwritten loans promoted by unregulated mortgage brokers and lenders \nwere sliced, diced, securitized and spread all over, with severe \nconsequences that are global in scope. Unregulated markets schemes like \nthis were a fertile breeding ground for greed and fraud. The Enron \nscandal of the late 1990s was a smaller-scale precursor, costing \ntaxpayers billions of dollars and ending in the collapse of the energy \ngiant, as well as the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in Enron \ninvestments held by more than 50 mutual funds and insurance companies.\n  Enormous State deficits have deepened with the combined effects of \nrampant foreclosures and plummeting property values which have \nsignificantly cut into revenues. And local governments, trying to \nmaximize returns for taxpayers with investments in firms like Lehman \nBrothers, have lost their money. They are looking to the State for \nhelp, and the State is looking to the Federal Government for help.\n  The financial sector is currently held aloft by a lifeline from the \nfederal government. Main Street is also looking to Washington to \nprovide an injection of financial stability.\n  There are many different vectors of this economic crisis. But there \nis only one sure solution. And that is the infusion of large amounts of \ncapital into the marketplace from the only place with the capacity to \ndo so, which is the Federal Government.\n  It is time to give the American people some good news for a change. \nIt is estimated that the bill could help sustain and create up to 3.5 \nmillion jobs over the next 2 years--with 396,000 in California alone.\n  The bill before us is far from perfect. But we need to give the \nPresident the flexibility and resources he needs to create jobs and \nrevive our ailing economy.\n  This bill will not meet every need, and some difficult choices have \nbeen made in order to move it forward with the 60 votes it needed to \nsecure passage in the Senate.\n  But faced with a choice of taking action to confront this crisis, or \nsimply dithering away as families lose their jobs, their homes and \ntheir hope, I think the choice is clear: We must support this economic \nrecovery package.\n  President Obama inherited an unprecedented fiscal mess when he took \noffice last month: National debt: $10.7 trillion; this year's budget \ndeficit: $1.2 trillion, projected; GDP: Fell by 3.8 percent last \nquarter 4th quarter 2008, the worst showing in 26 years; unemployment \nis skyrocketing: 7.6 percent nationwide. Since the recession started in \nDecember 2007, 3.6 million jobs have been lost. More than 598,000 jobs \nwere lost in January. Economists say 3 million more could be lost by \nthe end of this year.\n  In California we have a 9.3 percent unemployment rate, Dec. 2008. \nThere are at least 1.7 million unemployed workers in California. We \nhave the fourth highest foreclosure rate in the Nation. There were \n837,665 foreclosures filed in 2008 up 110 percent from 2007. State \nbudget deficit has reached $42 billion. This has real and serious \nimplications.\n  The Governor has had to halt public infrastructure projects. Public \nemployees are being furloughed and local governments are planning to \nslash the critical services upon which taxpayers depend.\n  The bill before us will not solve every problem, but it will provide \nfunding for critical investments that will create jobs and get our \neconomy moving again.\n  First, transportation: $29 billion for highways and bridges. \nCalifornia's share by formula will be at least $2.6 billion; $8.4 \nbillion for public transit--i.e., subway, bus, and light rail projects. \nCalifornia's share by formula will be $1 billion; $1.3 billion for \nAirport capital improvements, funding allocated by competition; and \n$9.3 billion for intercity passenger rail, including $8 billion \ntargeted at building high speed rail funding allocated by competition.\n  In total, the bill provides roughly $50 billion for transportation. \nThese projects will not only modernize the corridors used to transport \npassengers and goods that move across America, they are also a critical \npart of the jobs creation goal of this package.\n  Experts estimate that between 27,000 to 37,000 jobs are created for \nevery $1 billion invested in transportation projects. So an estimated \n1.5 million jobs could be generated by transportation projects funded \nin this bill.\n  Second, water. We have a huge water infrastructure problem in this \ncountry. The Government Accountability Office and EPA report that the \nnation faces a $300-500 billion water and wastewater funding gap over \nthe next 20 years. That is why it is so important that this bill \nincludes a substantial investment in water infrastructure:\n  Army Corps of Engineers: $4.6 billion for construction, maintenance, \netc.,\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\nthat will create 37,000 direct jobs and 102,000 indirect jobs; clean \nwater and drinking water state revolving Funds: $6 billion. California \nwould receive $444 million; Bureau of Reclamation: $1 billion, \nincluding $126 million for title XVI Water Recycling and Reuse \nProjects.\n  The U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates \nthat for each additional job created in the water and sewer industries, \n3.68 jobs are created in all industries.\n  So, investing in these projects will help create millions of jobs \nhere at home, and better protect human health and the environment. This \nis a vital investment.\n  Third, housing.\n  It is widely recognized that the roots of this economic recession \nwere in the bursting of the housing bubble. Last year, there were more \nthan 830,000 foreclosures filed in California alone, an increase of \nmore than 100 percent over 2007.\n  So it is important that the bill makes a major commitment to \nstabilizing the housing market--and to helping hardworking Americans \navoid the devastating loss of their homes through foreclosure.\n  The bill provides a public housing capital fund of $4 billion to help \nlocal public housing agencies address a $32 billion backlog in capital \nneeds. California's share by formula will be $118.5 million; home \ninvestment: $2.25 billion for State and local governments to acquire, \nconstruct, and rehab affordable housing.\n  It is critical that Congress do whatever we can to help restore and \nfoster the American dream of home ownership--and this bill is part of \nthat effort.\n  Fourth, the bill also boosts funding for our Nation's health care and \neducation systems and provides increases for other safety nets, \nincluding:\n  $87 billion for Medicaid. California will receive an estimated $10 \nbillion; $13 billion for title I education; $12.2 billion for special \neducation; $2.1 billion for Head Start and Early Head Start; $20 \nbillion for additional food stamps benefits; and an additional $100 per \nmonth in unemployment insurance benefits.\n  Finally, Energy.\n  This legislation makes a serious down payment towards our permanent \nshift away from fossil fuels and towards a more sustainable energy \nsystem.\n  The bill invests in efficiency, providing $5 billion to weatherize \nthe homes of low income individuals through the Weatherization \nAssistance Program.\n  It also establishes a tax credit for 30 percent of the cost to \nhomeowners that weatherize their own homes, and provides cities with \n$3.2 billion in block grants to assist them with building codes, \nefficiency improvements to their own facilities, and renewable energy \nprojects.\n  These efforts will help us realize the goal of weatherizing millions \nof homes.\n  It invests in a ``smart grid,'' putting $4.5 billion into an effort \nto improve electricity delivery through technology.\n  The legislation will allow WAPA to build new powerlines, to deliver \nrenewable electricity to California consumers who would otherwise \ncontinue to depend on coal power.\n  And finally, this legislation establishes a grant program at DOE and \nexpands a loan guarantee program.\n  These two steps will help capital intensive wind, solar, geothermal, \nand cellulosic biofuels projects move forward even at a time when \nfinancing capital projects has become all but impossible.\n  Bottom line: these are all investments that will either provide an \nimmediate benefit to local economies by adding jobs or will help shore \nup the safety net for Americans who have been hit by the crisis.\n  This is a very welcome sum of investment in States that are facing \ngrim scenarios today.\n  One headline in the Monterey Herald recently asked whether the \n``Golden State is rusting.''\n  But the truth is, California is not alone in suffering these \nconsequences. Every State in the Union is feeling the painful effects \nof this downturn, and every State needs this injection of investment at \nthis critical time.\n  President Obama has stated clearly that this economic recovery \npackage is the tool he needs to get our economy back on track and move \nthis country forward.\n  The millions of people who are losing their jobs and their homes have \nno use for partisan bickering. Re-enacting Washington's usual \nideological battles won't stop any companies from downsizing, free up \nany credit for businesses in need, or put food on the table of a family \nin need.\n  Candidly, I would have written a very different bill than the one \nbefore us. And there are some aspects of this bill that I would still \nlike to change--I would have liked to see more job-creating \ninfrastructure projects and fewer costly tax cuts.\n  But despite the imperfections in this bill, I believe we must \nrecognize the enormous task at hand by providing the president with the \nresources he needs to get the job done.\n  This bill is a major part of that effort, and it should be approved.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise on this occasion to speak on the \neconomic stimulus conference report that is before this chamber--at a \ntime when we face the longest and deepest recession since World War II, \nand a moment of economic peril not seen since the days of the Great \nDepression almost 80 years ago.\n  There has been a great deal of healthy and vigorous debate about this \nstimulus package--here in the Congress and certainly throughout \nAmerica--and rightfully so, given the magnitude of the legislation we \nhave deliberated upon over the past few weeks. And let me say, I well \nrecognize this process got off to a less than stellar start.\n  And yet, especially given that people look to the Senate to temper \nthe passions of politics--to provide an institutional check that \nensures all voices are heard and considered--should we have allowed \nthat inauspicious beginning to establish a permanent detour from \nultimately passing an economic stimulus package that economists from \nacross the political spectrum have said is urgently required?\n  I believe the answer to that question is no. And in that light, I \nextend my gratitude to Majority Leader Reid for bringing us together in \nforging the much improved package we consider today. I thank Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Grassley of the Senate Committee on Finance, \nChairman Inouye and Ranking Member Cochran of the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations, as well as Senators Collins, Specter, Nelson, and \nLieberman for their yeoman leadership in yielding this consensus-based \nsolution. I also thank those who argued against this package--because, \nfrankly, I agreed with a number of their arguments, and ultimately the \nconcerns expressed have helped to improve this final product.\n  Indeed, we lost 3.6 million jobs since the onset of the recession, \nthe most since 1945. The Department of Labor has reported the number of \npeople receiving unemployment benefits has reached 4.8 million, an all-\ntime high since record keeping began in 1967--and that doesn't include \nthe nearly 1.7 million getting benefits through an extension last \nsummer. At the end of January, we learned that the economy shrank at \nits fastest pace in nearly 27 years in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our \ngross national product dropped at a 3.8 percent annual rate, worst \nsince 1982.\n  And with more than 11 million jobless Americans today, inaction has, \nfrankly, never been a viable option. In fact, economist Mark Zandi of \nMoody's Economy.com--who advised both Presidential candidates McCain \nand Obama, I might add--projects an even higher unemployment rate of a \nremarkable 11.1 percent--should we fail to pass a vigorous economic \nstimulus package. That is 11.1 percent--and that is unacceptable. We \ncannot stand on the sidelines.\n  That is why I have said from the outset--as I stated on the Senate \nfloor at the beginning of last week--that I wanted to support a \nstimulus package. But at the same time as I also said, I could not \nsupport just any package. The fact is, we are confronting a \nmultidimensional crisis that requires a multidimensional approach, and \nwe can ill afford to get it wrong.\n  Our approach must be successful, as it must also go hand-in-hand with \nmonetary policy to ensure that vital credit--that is the lifeblood of \nour economy--is flowing to American individuals and businesses.\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\n  Already Congress passed a rescue plan for financial institutions, but \nthe lending expected to free up our credit markets has yet to take \neffect. Already, the Treasury Department has issued a second component \nto the rescue plan, which I might add is regrettably long on \naspirations and short on details. And already the Federal Reserve has \nessentially exhausted its options to improve the economy through \nmonetary policy, having reduced interest rates to zero--something else \nthat hasn't happened since the 1930s--and lent more than $1 trillion to \nstabilize the financial and credit markets. So, as I said during the \nmark-up in the Senate Finance Committee, we ought to remember that for \nus, in crafting fiscal policy to meet this historic challenge, there \nare no ``do-overs.''\n  That is why I have said repeatedly that this isn't about how much we \nlabel as ``tax relief' and how much we label as ``spending.'' Rather, \nin the final analysis, it's been about the merits of the individual \nmeasures in this legislation, and whether the totality of a package can \ndeliver job creation and assistance to those who have been displaced--\nbecause both elements are essential to turning the economic tide and \naligning our nation for a more prosperous future. In short, the \nchallenge has been to fashion a measure that meets the ``what works'' \ntest.\n\n  Critical to that test is whether a stimulus measure is timely, \ntargeted, temporary, and achieves the critical equilibrium of creating \njobs and assisting those displaced by this economic crisis through no \nfault of their own. There has been widespread agreement, even from the \nharshest critics of this bill, that economic stimulus must meet this \nstandard. That is exactly what a Washington Post editorial called for \nwhen it advocated a focused stimulus as the most viable approach. And \nafter a week of intense, bicameral negotiations and compromises, this \neconomic stimulus package--while not what everyone may have wanted--\nwhile not everything I would have wanted--meets that threshold.\n  It has not been easy arriving at this point. At the beginning of \ndeliberations on the floor and throughout the amendment process, I was \ndeeply concerned this bill more closely resembled omnibus legislation \nrather than emergency stimulus legislation. Indeed, as the Senate \nconsidered and adopted amendments on the floor, this package had \nactually ballooned to $920 billion. Let me repeat that--$920 billion.\n  Let's look at the House-passed bill. The House bill was voted out at \n$819 billion. And then the Senate bill ultimately passed at $838 \nbillion. But now, with our efforts over the past week, this package has \nemerged as a $787.2 billion conference report that is not only more \nnarrowly tailored toward stimulus, but actually has a lower overall \ncost than either the House-passed bill at $819 billion or the Senate-\npassed bill at $838 billion. And that is no insignificant achievement.\n  At the same time, the package isn't only right--it is right sized. As \nthe President has stated, we will lose $2 trillion in consumer demand \nthis year and next--demand, I might add, that must be ``backfilled'' in \nour economy with a substantial investment in both tax relief and \ntargeted, effective expenditures that will create jobs. The fact is, \ngiven the monumental level of this recession, we can't just be throwing \npebbles in the pond. Rather, we require the ripple effect of a \nboulder--while at the same time ensuring that this is not an open-ended \npassport to spending in perpetuity.\n  I know that there are those who criticize the top-line number on this \npackage. And given this legislation is deficit-financed, the cost and \nthe stimulative affect of each of the elements of this bill should be \nof concern to all of us. I said on the floor at the beginning of this \nprocess that we cannot overload this bill with items that are not \nwithin the strictures of stimulus. We must ensure that programs that \nmay well be worthwhile policy but not economic stimulus are not \nconsidered in this package, and instead are vetted through the budget \nand regular legislative process. We cannot, under the auspices of \nstimulus legislation--open the door to permanent spending that exceeds \nthe life and purpose of what is before us today.\n  But in terms of the actual size of the package, let's consider for a \nmoment the economic stimulus packages passed in 2001 and in 2003--and \ncompare the cost of those measures with the cost of this package, and \nthe economic conditions at those times, with the far worse economic \nconditions of now.\n  In June 2001, when the economy was in recession as well, we responded \nwith a $1.35 trillion package. In the quarter when that bill passed, \nthe economy grew by 1.2 percent, and unemployment was at 4.5 percent. \nIn 2003, we passed a bill that was essentially a trillion dollar \npackage masquerading as a $350 billion bill. During the spring of 2003, \nwhen that bill passed, the economy grew by 3.5 percent and unemployment \nwas at 6.1 percent.\n  Fast forward to today with this $787 billion package on the floor. \nThe economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.5 percent in the third \nquarter of 2008, and 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. The \nunemployment rate is currently at 7.6 percent. Furthermore, over the \npast 13 months alone, as I mentioned earlier, the economy has lost 3.6 \nmillion jobs. By comparison, we lost a total of 2.7 million total jobs \nin the 2001 recession. The bottom line is this package is not by any \nmeans out-sized for the times--it is right-sized.\n  When we began our deliberations in the Senate, the spending in the \nSenate package reached $366 billion. Fortunately, through our \nbipartisan efforts, we were able to trim that spending by an additional \n$55 billion in nonstimulative items. Today, this package contains a \ntotal of $286.5 billion in tax provisions, $311 billion in \ndiscretionary spending appropriations, and $192.4 billion in \nnondiscretionary spending items more narrowly focused on job creation \nand assistance to those displaced.\n  On the spending side of the ledger, we demonstrated our commitment to \njob creation by investing in infrastructure. For example, the \ncompromise accelerated the timeline for spending out 50 percent of the \nmoney for roads and bridges from 180 days to 120 days--with the \nremaining 50 percent required to be obligated within one year--to \nfurther frontload the stimulative effect. Right now, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors has a list of nearly 19,000 shovel-ready projects \nnationally, totaling almost $150 billion. Moreover, the Federal Highway \nAdministration projects that for every one billion dollars spent, \n28,500 jobs are created, and with the 7.5 billion contained in this \nConference Report for highways alone. That is 783,750 jobs just for \nroads and bridges.\n  We included $40 billion for enhancing unemployment insurance as CBO \nsaid last year that the cost-effectiveness of such a policy for \nstimulative effect is ``large''. . . the length of time for impact is \n``short''. . . and recently, Moody's Economy.com estimated that every \ndollar spent on unemployment benefits generates $1.63 in near term GDP. \nI thank Chairman Baucus for including in this conference report my \nprovision to exclude the first $2,400 of unemployment benefits from \ntaxation, to further maximize the provision's stimulative impact. And \nas increasing food stamps is also among the most immediate and \neffective stimulative steps we can take--we provided $19.9 billion to \ndo just that.\n  I am also particularly pleased, as ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee, that we included such critical job-creation funding \nas $730 million for the Small Business Administration's lending \nprograms. This spending is targeted toward increasing access to capital \nand lowering the cost of capital for our Nation's small businesses that \nhave created fully two-thirds of America's net new jobs, that created \nor retained 770,000 jobs in FY 2008 alone, and will unquestionably be \nat the forefront of leading us out of this crisis. The bill contains \nmany of Chair Landrieu's and my priorities, such as ones to slash fees \nfor SBA borrowers and reduce them for lenders; increase funding for the \nmicroloan program; and a new program targeted toward small businesses \nstruggling to make loan payments.\n  Additionally, on the spending side we provided vital Medicaid \nassistance to the states--and I have heard the arguments against it. \nBut does anyone seriously believe that with 45 states currently \nexperiencing a shortfall and a projected, combined budgetary gap of \n$350 billion over the next 2 years won't have a profound impact on our \nnational economy, as States grapple with raising taxes or slashing \nspending to balance their budgets?\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\n  We also included $28 billion for adoption of Heath Information \nTechnology by health care providers. This would not only actually \nresult in an eventual $10 billion in savings, but also improvements in \ncare and costs, while creating an additional 40,000 jobs that will \nendure. As we grapple with the gravity of our economic circumstances, \ndoesn't it make sense to simultaneously create transformational, well-\npaying jobs that, rather than looking to the past, will endure and \nensure that America is competitive in the global economy of the 21st \ncentury?\n  As I mentioned earlier, this package also contains more than $286 \nbillion in tax relief--with many provisions I was proud to ensure were \nincluded as a member of the Senate Finance Committee--that will \ndirectly result in job creation and retention, and bolster our economy.\n  The President's signature making work pay tax credit, which the \nPresident agreed to trim in this conference report, will provide \nadditional money in every paycheck to more than 95 percent of working \nfamilies in the United States, which Mark Zandi has said will be \n``particularly effective, as the benefit will go to lower income \nhouseholds . . . that are much more likely to spend any tax benefit \nthey receive.''\n  I am pleased to have helped retain in this legislation relief from \nthe alternative minimum tax as it will not only boost the value of the \nmaking work pay credit but will also ensure that around 30 million \nAmericans won't be ensnared by this onerous levy. We increase \neligibility for the extraordinarily successful refundable portion of \nthe child tax credit that I originally spearheaded to reach low-income \nfamilies earning between $3,000 and $9,667 a year. I have heard the \narguments before against refundability, but this program reaches people \nwho may not earn enough to have federal tax liability but who work and \ncontribute local taxes and payroll taxes and will, therefore, get \nadditional money into the pockets of those most likely to spend it.\n  When it comes to tax relief and America's greatest job generators, \nour Nation's 27.2 million small businesses, this package contains \nprovisions I authored to help them sustain operations and employees. \nThis includes enhanced section 179 expensing for 2009, allowing small \nbusinesses throughout the Nation to invest up to $250,000 in plant and \nequipment that they can deduct immediately, instead of depreciate over \na period of 5, 7, or more years.\n\n  The conference report also contains a provision to extend to 5 years \nthe carryback period of net operating losses for small businesses with \nup to $15 million in gross receipts which will help small businesses \nsustain operations with a cash infusion during these trying times. This \nmodification was the result of a last-minute negotiation, and I very \nmuch appreciate the personal efforts of Chairman Baucus.\n  This agreed-upon measure makes a welcomed, commonsense change to \nreduce to 90 percent the requirement that small business owners prepay \n110 percent of their previous year's tax liability. The purpose of \nquarterly prepayments is to ensure that the Government gets every penny \nowed. Because of the recession and the credit crunch, the overpayment \nof quarterly income taxes by America's small business owners is \nunnecessary, because few businesses are experiencing 10 percent growth, \nand harmful because it drains vital cash flow away from an ongoing \nbusiness.\n  The conference report also retains a provision I joined Senators \nLincoln and Hatch in spearheading to lessen the impact of the built-in \ngains tax on small businesses. This change is absolutely essential at a \ntime in which our Nation's credit markets remain frozen and small \nbusinesses are struggling to meet their financing requirements. This \nprovision will benefit up to 900 small businesses in my home state of \nMaine and hundreds of thousands across the country.\n  We must not neglect our Nation's distressed and rural communities. \nThis conference report rightly recognizes that imperative by including \nan additional $1.5 billion in each 2008 and 2009 allocation authority \nfor the new markets tax credit. And my understanding is that the \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Fund, which administers \nthe incentive, can allocate the augmented 2008 credit authority within \n90 days, which will create 11,000 permanent jobs and 35,000 \nconstruction jobs.\n  This agreement also contains tax credits for renewable energy that I \nhave long fought for that will create more than 89,000 jobs. Frankly, \nif we had not dithered last year and opted to pass the extension of the \nrenewable tax credits at the beginning of 2008, we would have already \nbeen on the road to creating 100,000 new jobs. I know in my home State, \nthere are a number of wind farm projects, for example, that could be \nready to move forward right now.\n  I am also pleased that the stimulus bill contains a provision I \nhelped to draft that will allow base communities across the Nation that \nhave been significantly affected by a closure or realignment to qualify \nfor vital recovery zone economic development bonds.\n  Finally, I am pleased this bill includes a provision I wrote to \nexpand the definition of ``manufacturing'' as it pertains to the small-\nissue Industrial Development bond, or IDB, program to include the \ncreation of ``intangible'' property. For example, this would allow the \nbonds to be used to benefit companies that manufacture software and \nbiotechnology products by helping them get the financing necessary to \nassist their operations in innovating and create new jobs. Knowledge-\nbased businesses have been at the forefront of this innovation that has \nbolstered the economy over the long-term. For example, science parks \nhave helped lead the technological revolution and have created more \nthan 300,000 high-paying science and technology jobs, along with \nanother 450,000 indirect jobs for a total of 750,000 jobs.\n  There will be those who say the cost of this package is too much, and \nothers will say it is too little. Some will say it should have higher \nlevels of tax relief, others that we should focus almost entirely on \nspending. There are 535 Members between the House and the Senate who \nall have their own legitimately held beliefs about this legislation. \nThere are millions of Americans with their own, differing views, \nquestions, concerns, and expectations.\n  At the end of the day, I must return to my own evaluation--again, \nshared by so many across the political spectrum--that inaction is not \nan option and, frankly, time is of the essence. I also return to my \nstandard for evaluating a stimulus: Is it sufficiently focused on \ncreating jobs and assisting those who have been displaced. In that \nlight, this package deserves to be passed now and signed into law. It \nis supported by organizations such as the National Association of \nManufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Institute of \nBuilding Sciences, because they also believe it will create jobs. On \nbalance, this is the right approach at the right time that offers us \nthe best course for economic recovery and, therefore, I will be \nsupporting this conference report.\n\n\n                               sales tax\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a \ncolloquy with the senior senator from Montana regarding the car \npurchase tax credit introduced by Sen. Mikulski and included in this \nconference report.\n  Mr. Chairman, my home State of Delaware does not have a State sales \ntax, which this provision addresses. However, a ``document fee'' of \n3.75 percent is collected when a new vehicle is sold in Delaware. This \nfee is the equivalent of a State sales tax, although it is not called \nthat term.\n  Alaska, Montana, Hawaii, Oregon and New Hampshire lack State sales \ntaxes. Instead, these States levy fees and/or taxes or allow local \ngovernments to levy fees or taxes on new vehicles. For example, in your \nhome State of Montana, there is a county option tax on vehicles. In New \nHampshire, towns and cities can collect fees on motor vehicles. Hawaii \nlevies a four-percent excise tax on goods, which includes automobiles. \nThis tax is passed along to Hawaiian new car purchasers.\n  As the purpose of the Mikulski amendment is to encourage Americans to \npurchase new automobiles, is it the chairman's understanding that it is \nthe intent of Congress that the document fee in Delaware is the \nfunctional equivalent of a State sales tax?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. In fact, IRS currently counts \nvehicle registration fees based on a vehicle's value as a personal \nproperty tax, which\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\nis deductible. This is true even if the State calls the fee a \n``registration fee'' or a ``vehicle use fee.'' In Montana, new \npassenger vehicles are subject to a $217 fee, as well as a county \noption tax-based on the value of the vehicle. The same standard should \napply to Section 1008.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator. Additionally, in lieu of paying \nStates sales taxes or in the case of Delaware, a document fee, is it \nthe intent of Congress that the motor vehicle registration fees on new \nvehicles collected by State or local governments in Alaska, New \nHampshire, Oregon, Hawaii and Montana qualify for a deduction as \ndefined under section 1008?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to proceed on my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, across the country Americans are \nstruggling with a very bad economy. Every day we hear more \nheartbreaking stories about foreclosures and lost jobs. The situation \nis serious. It appears to be getting worse. It was in the midst of this \nscenario that our new President took office. As did all of us, the \nPresident wanted to do all he could to help the economy. So he asked \nCongress to put together a stimulus bill aimed at preventing as much \nfuture damage as possible.\n  From the very start, Republicans supported the idea of a stimulus. \nAll of us, Democrat and Republican, thought it was important and \nnecessary. The question was, what kind of stimulus? What would it look \nlike? What would it cost? Who would it help? Where would it go? Most \nimportantly, would it work?\n  These are important questions, particularly when the economists tell \nus that a bad stimulus is worse than no stimulus at all. As the \nPresident's top economist, Larry Summers has written:\n\n\n       Poorly provided fiscal stimulus can have worse side effects \n     than the disease that is to be cured.\n\n\n  These questions naturally lead to another: How do we measure whether \na stimulus will work? Well, according to Summers, it is a fairly simple \nthree-point test. First, in order to be effective, a fiscal stimulus \nmust be timely; second, it must be targeted; and, third, it must be \nclearly and credibly temporary. So using the standard outlined by the \nPresident's own top economist, Republicans have asked: Is this bill \ntimely? Is it targeted? Is it temporary?\n  The answer, I have regretfully concluded, is a resounding no. This \nbill fails on all three points. This means, in my view, that \ncongressional Democrats have put together a stimulus that by Democrats' \nown standards is likely to fail. Yet, with interest, this bill is \nexpected to cost taxpayers $1.1 trillion.\n  So the question now is, what can the taxpayers expect for their \nmoney? Well, at a time when millions are struggling to hold on to their \nhomes and jobs, Democrats in the name of stimulus want taxpayers to \ncover the cost of golf carts, electric motorcycles, and ATVs; $300 \nmillion for new government cars; $1 billion for ACORN-eligible block \ngrants; $50 million for out-of-work artists; $165 million to maintain \nand build fish hatcheries--$165 million for fish hatcheries; $1 billion \nfor the Census. I defy anyone to explain to me how $1 billion for the \nCensus will stimulate the U.S. economy.\n  So a stimulus bill that was supposed to be timely, targeted, and \ntemporary is none of the above. This means Congress is about to approve \na stimulus that is unlikely to have much stimulative effect.\n  That is why an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office actually \npredicted a potential sustained economic decline--decline--as a direct \nresult of this bill. That is why I can't support it.\n  This is one of the most expensive pieces of legislation Congress has \never approved. Including interest, as I have said, it is expected to \ncost $1.1 trillion. To put that figure in perspective, consider this: \nIf you spent $1 million a day every day since Jesus was born, you still \nwouldn't have spent $1 trillion. This is an extraordinary sum of money. \nIt deserves an extraordinary level of scrutiny.\n  Yet even based on the ordinary standards of evaluation, it easily \nfails the test. Even if the bill were timely, targeted, and temporary, \nwe would still have to look at the pricetag in the context of all the \nother spending we are all soon going to be asked to consider. The \nAmerican people need to remember this stimulus is just one piece of the \nDemocrats' overall spending plan.\n  Soon we will be asked to consider $50 billion for housing and \nunspecified hundreds of billions of dollars--possibly even another \ntrillion--for troubled banks. We will also soon be voting on a $400 \nbillion Omnibus appropriations bill that will bring the total \ndiscretionary spending for this fiscal year to $1 trillion for the \nfirst time in American history.\n  This isn't Monopoly money. It is real. It adds up. It has to be paid \nback by our children and their children, and the American people still \ndon't have the facts about the total cost.\n  We need to tell the American people the whole story. If Americans \ncan't be assured these programs they are paying for will work, they \nshould at least be told what they are going to cost.\n  Even the Democrats admit this bill is a $1 trillion risk. Today--this \nvery day--the Democratic majority leader of the House asked his members \nto pray: ``Pray that this bill works.'' Why? Because, as he said, he is \nnot sure that it will. I can't take that big of a risk on this big of a \ncommitment of the American people's money.\n  I know everyone believes their efforts will help strengthen the \neconomy and create jobs. No one should doubt that. Everyone is trying \nto do the right thing. My concern is not the motivation behind these \nefforts but the wisdom--the wisdom--of these efforts.\n  This bill has been roundly criticized for being loaded with wasteful \nspending and hundreds of billions of dollars in permanent--permanent--\nGovernment expansion. Our plan would have reduced monthly mortgage \npayments and made it easier to buy a home. Workers would have been able \nto keep more of what they earn. It is also about half the cost of the \nDemocratic plan.\n  Every Member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, wants the economy \nto recover. The question is, which plan would work? In my view, it is \nhighly unlikely this one will. I can't take that big of a risk with \nother people's money. I will vote against it, and I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, I believe, is a good bill. It is not perfect. It may have \nimperfections, but I believe it deserves our support.\n  Many compromises were made, and the final compromises that we made in \nconference were very difficult. There is no doubt those of us on this \nside of the aisle had to make some very difficult decisions and some \npainful cuts to programs that I personally believe would have been of \ngreat benefit to the American people. But in the end, I remain \nconvinced we have gained far more than we have lost, and this bill is \nessential in beginning the task of turning our economy around.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will create more than 3.5 \nmillion jobs. This is nothing to sniff at. It will provide tax cuts for \nworking families, aid to our States, and will allow us to invest in our \nfuture by rebuilding our roads, schools, and mass transit systems.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I know that the $311 \nbillion in appropriated funds that are contained in this bill will make \na difference as we confront the economic crisis. For example, the funds \nwill prevent layoffs of State employees, will allow for increased \nfunding for education, health care initiatives, improved energy \nefficiency, and many other vital investments.\n  With this large influx of Federal funding now headed to our States, \nincluding my home State of Hawaii, it is essential that each State has \na plan of action in place to ensure that these resources are invested \nquickly and responsibly, and in the right places. In Hawaii, for \nexample, we have established working groups of State and local \nofficials and community leaders to identify priorities that will have \nthe most effective and timely economic impact in local communities \nthroughout the State.\n  Before concluding my remarks, I want to take a moment to thank the\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\nMembers and staff of the Appropriations Committee for all of their \ndedication and hard work in taking this bill from conception to \ncompleted legislation in a matter of a few months. On our committee, we \nhave 12 subcommittees, each of which was involved in this bill. It is \nthe subcommittees, the chairmen and ranking members who, along with \ntheir subcommittee clerks and staff, are the people who have carried \nthe load on this bill. I believe that the Senate owes them its \ngratitude.\n  At this time, I wish to inform the Senate that division A of the \nconference report on H.R. 1 does not contain any congressionally \ndirected spending items as defined in rule XLIV of the Standing Rules \nof the Senate.\n  There is no quick fix or easy answer to this grave economic crisis, \nbut I am confident this plan will begin to put America on the road to \nrecovery.\n  I believe the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is the \nright medicine for what ails our economy. It will not fix our problems \novernight, but it will begin the process. We face some tough times in \nthe coming year, but this legislation will have an impact. It will help \nmillions of Americans, directly and indirectly and, most importantly, \nit will give America confidence that we can overcome this crisis.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to say something at the \nconclusion of the debate. I have spoken a number of times and have had \nmy say, but this is not a normal bill. This is the largest expenditure \nin the history of this Republic, or of any nation in the history of the \nworld. Some have said--and we heard this from the Administration--that \nthey want to remake the economy. A press person asked me today: What do \nyou think happened to bipartisanship?\n  I said, well, I don't know if I can hold hands and walk down the road \nto socialism. I don't want to walk down the road together to say our \nheritage of limited Government and lower taxes and individual freedom \nand responsibility ought to be altered.\n  What I am concerned about, at my deepest level, is that this step, as \nhuge as it is, is only one of many that we are going to see. We had the \nWall Street bailout of $700 billion. We hear there may be another $500 \nbillion coming on housing and that kind of thing, because there's not \nmuch housing benefit in this.\n  This endangers our heritage. It is not a little bitty matter. I am \nproud of my colleagues who have said no. I believe it is the right vote \nand I hope and pray that yet it might fail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the legislation have 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the opponents have 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the disposition of the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe we have 3 minutes and a few \nseconds and I will use that time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator wish to go now or wait for me?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I defer to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, we are, obviously, about to vote affirmatively on the \nlegislation before us. I want to say that I think the debate has been \ngood and respectful. I congratulate the Members on the other side of \nthe aisle and the President for their success in achieving the \ntimetable that they laid out for the passage of this legislation.\n  I point out that the allegation that this is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation is simply not accurate. A total of three Republican Members \nin the entire Congress will be voting for this bill--only three. That \nis not a bipartisan approach, by any measure.\n  I think there are some hard facts we should not ignore as we address \nand dispose of this issue and move on to others. I remind my colleagues \nthat the current national debt is $10.7 trillion. The 2009 projected \ndeficit is another $1.2 trillion. The cost of this legislation before \nus is $1.124 trillion; that is, $789 billion plus interest. The \nexpected omnibus spending bill, which will be coming shortly, is \nroughly $400 billion. The expected supplemental request for Afghanistan \nand Iraq will be an additional $80 billion. We will be addressing \nappropriations bills for 2010 that will be over a trillion dollars. We \nare already spending $700 billion on TARP I and II. And estimates, \naccording to the media, are that TARP III will be somewhere around $1.5 \ntrillion.\n  We are on a spending spree of unprecedented and historic proportions. \nWe are committing what some of us have called generational theft \nbecause we are laying this debt on our children and our grandchildren.\n  My colleagues--and the Senator from Illinois who has been here \nconstantly and has argued his side effectively--will point out that \nRepublicans did the same thing. I agree, and Republicans were punished \nin the last election for doing so.\n  What grieves me the most about this process we have been through is \nthat it started out with a phrase by the Speaker of the House that ``we \nwon, we wrote the bill.'' I think I understand the lesson. That is the \nprocess that it has been through, without Republican involvement and \nwithout Republican negotiations, which I think are necessary to achieve \nthe consensus that is necessary when we are addressing an issue of this \nmagnitude.\n  This has not been a bipartisan effort. The other side will emerge \nvictorious in a few minutes, but we have to face additional challenges. \nI mentioned TARP III--$1.5 trillion--and the expected war supplemental \nrequest. There are all of these new challenges--not to mention national \nsecurity challenges and policy challenges.\n  I think I understand the message from the 2008 election. I think I \nunderstand it very well. That message is that the American people don't \nwant business as usual. They do want us to sit down together. We want \nto be in on the takeoff, so that we can be in on the landing. We want \nto work together with the other side.\n  This is not the example that I think the American people want us to \nexercise as we address the enormous challenges. We need a stimulus \npackage, we need to address the war in Afghanistan, and we need to \nprovide for the much-needed services to Americans as revenues decline \nwith a bad economy.\n  I end my remarks and yield back the balance of my time by saying \nagain: Congratulations to those who will succeed in passing this \nlegislation. The next time--and it will be soon, because I understand \nthere will be an omnibus appropriations bill, TARP III and others--let \nus sit down and negotiate and work together. When we come out with a \nsolution and legislation, we can tell the American people that we \nlearned the lesson but, most importantly, we will reflect their wishes \nthat we have worked together to address some of the most difficult \nchallenges of anyone's lifetime.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have listened to the critics of this \nlegislation. What would they have us do? They would have us do nothing. \nWhat they offer is one-half of this bill, in the hopes that that might \ndo it. We tried that. I say to the critics of the bill that we tried \ntheir tax cuts last year under President Bush, and they didn't work. We \ntried their TARP under President Bush, and it didn't work as well as we \nhad hoped.\n  Now we are asking for a chance. This President, President Obama, \ninherited the worst economic crisis in 75 years. He is showing \nleadership, and he came with a solution and offered it to the \nRepublicans and said sit down with us, work with us together. Only \nthree Republicans out of all those elected on Capitol Hill would do so. \nThis President made direct overtures to bring in Republicans, to try to \nfind a solution to these problems, and they refused to do so. Many of \nthe same Republicans--not the Senator from Arizona--who have spoken \nearlier supported amendments to this, adding to the cost of this \npackage $70 billion in the Finance\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\nCommittee, up to $30 billion on the floor; and after their amendments \nwere adopted, they said, of course, we cannot vote for the bill because \nit costs too much--after they added some $100 billion in costs to the \nbill.\n  They cannot have it both ways. They cannot ask us, as Democrats, to \nstand with President Bush when he tried to solve it and then walk out \nthe door when we face this crisis under President Obama. We have \ninvited the Republicans to join us, and three stepped forward. I salute \nthem for their courage in doing so. I hope more will do that in the \nfuture.\n  A lot of the arguments are about the impact on the next generation. \nConsider the impact on the next generation of Americans if their \nparents lose a job. Consider the impact on kids in the next generation \nif their home is foreclosed upon. Consider the impact on the next \ngeneration if they are forced out of college because their parents \ncannot pay the bills. In this bill, we address each of those issues, \nproviding tax relief to working families, creating up to 4 million \njobs, giving people a chance to stay in their homes and trying to help \nthem pay for a college education. Yes, we have our eye on the next \ngeneration.\n  What we are doing in the bill is trying to give a lifeline to our \neconomy for those who are suffering in Arizona, Illinois, Colorado, and \nall across this country. This is a serious effort to find a solution. \nWe have tried to work together. It is a transparent approach with full \naccountability, and we will do our best to pass it and turn this \neconomy around and give America the new day it deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mrs. Hagan). All time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in keeping with the previous unanimous \nconsent agreement, I believe this point of order and final passage are \nboth combined in one vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, pursuant to section 294(a) of the 2008 \nbudget resolution, S. Con. Res. 21, of the 110th Congress, I raise a \npoint of order against the emergency designation in section 5(a) of the \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, a motion to waive \nthe applicable point of order is considered made.\n  The question is agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

As a result, the point of order falls.\n  Pursuant to the previous order which imposed a 60-vote threshold for \nthe adoption of this conference report, this vote also constitutes the \nvote on the adoption of the conference report.\n  Pursuant to that order, the conference report to accompany H.R. 1 is \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider that vote is considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about how the trade \nadjustment assistance provisions in the conference report represent the \none shining example of bipartisanship in this mammoth legislation. It's \nunfortunate that the overall conference report wasn't the product of a \nsimilarly bipartisan process, but that missed opportunity should not \ndetract from the tremendous bipartisan effort that my colleagues and \nour staffs undertook to bring about this significant achievement in \nreforming and reauthorizing our trade adjustment assistance programs. I \nwant to take a moment to note for the record my appreciation to those \nwho have worked so hard to produce this good compromise legislation on \ntrade adjustment assistance.\n  I will begin by thanking my colleagues on the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member Camp. Our bicameral \nnegotiations over the last 6 weeks have been intensive, and at times \ndifficult but always professional and constructive. Chairman Rangel was \nably advised by Tim Reif and Viji Rangaswami, his respective staff \ndirector and deputy staff director on the trade subcommittee, as well \nas Alex Perkins, international trade counsel to the chairman, and \nIndivar Dutta-Gupta, adviser to the chairman on the professional staff \nof the subcommittee on income security and family support. Congressman \nCamp was ably advised by his chief trade counsel, Angela Ellard, as \nwell as David Thomas, international trade counsel to the ranking \nmember.\n  Of course I must thank my partner on the Finance Committee, Chairman \nBaucus, with whom I have been actively overseeing the operation of our \ntrade adjustment assistance programs since the last time we implemented \nreforms in 2002. We have been negotiating over this legislation since \nApril of last year, so this is the culmination of a lot of effort by \nour two staffs. My thanks begin with his staff director, Russ Sullivan, \nand extend to Demetrios Marantis, his chief international trade \ncounsel, and the rest of his trade team, particularly Hun Quach, Ayesha \nKhanna, and Darci Vetter, as well as Amber Cottle, Chelsea Thomas, and \nJanis Lazda. I would also like to thank Liz Fowler and Neleen Eisinger \nfrom his health staff, and Anya Landau French, formerly of his trade \nstaff.\n  On my staff I want to thank first my staff director on the Finance \nCommittee, Kolan Davis, and my deputy staff director and chief tax \ncounsel, Mark Prater, for their wise counsel in managing the \nlegislative processes that have led to today's achievement. I also want \nto thank my chief international trade counsel, Stephen Schaefer, who \nhas spearheaded my oversight of trade adjustment assistance since 2003 \nand led my negotiating effort these many months, as well as David Ross, \nmy international trade counsel, who played an integral role in the \nnegotiations that produced today's compromise. In addition, I want to \nthank David Johanson, my international trade counsel and agricultural \ntrade specialist, for his role in negotiating a reform of the trade \nadjustment assistance for farmers program, and Claudia Bridgeford \nPoteet, my international trade policy advisor, for her advice and \nsupport. Additional members of my staff that merit special recognition \ninclude Mark Hayes, my chief health counsel, and Andrew McKechnie, also \non my health staff, as well as Kristin Bass and Colette Desmarais, \nformerly of my health staff. I also want to thank Chris Condeluci, my \ntax and benefits\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\ncounsel, as well as Lacee Oliver, an intern on my Finance Committee \nstaff, and John Kalitka, a former detail to my Finance Committee trade \nstaff from the Department of Commerce, for their work on trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  Our work has been supported by the substantial efforts of dedicated \nprofessionals at the Department of Labor, and my appreciation there \nbegins with Erin Fitzgerald in the Division of Trade Adjustment \nAssistance, as well as Mark Morin and Lois Zuckerman in the Office of \nthe Solicitor, and Erica Cantor, the administrator of the Office of \nNational Response. I also want to thank Mason Bishop, Blake Hanlon, and \nGeoffrey Burr, formerly of the Department of Labor, as well as Justin \nMcCarthy and John Bailey, formerly on the White House staff of the \nprevious administration.\n  I mentioned that Chairman Baucus and I have been engaged in joint \noversight of the trade adjustment assistance programs since 2002, and \nour oversight has included requesting a series of reports from the \nGovernment Accountability Office to examine various aspects of the \noperation of these programs. Among current and former personnel at the \nGovernment Accountability Office who merit special recognition for \ntheir hard work are Sigurd Nilsen, Dianne Blank, Lorin Obler, and Wayne \nSylvia.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our House and \nSenate legislative counsels to deliver timely drafts and constructive \ncritiques of proposed legislative provisions. On the House side I want \nto thank Sandra Strokoff and Mark Synnes, and here in the Senate I want \nto thank our experts on customs and international trade law, Polly \nCraighill and Margaret Roth-Warren.\n  As you can see, today's achievement is the result of the dedication, \nhard work, and commitment of many individuals. It is the culmination of \nyears of effort, and I am confident that the result will serve to \nbenefit American workers in Iowa and across the United States for years \nto come.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, although I voted against the motion to \nwaive the Congressional Budget Act on the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 1, the so-called stimulus bill, and on the adoption of \nthe conference report to H.R. 1, I must acknowledge the courtesies and \nthoughtful leadership of the Appropriations Committee by the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye.\n  He carried out his responsibilities as chairman of our committee in a \nfair minded way that reflected credit on the Senate.\n  This legislation was written by our committee, but in many respects \nit reflected the attitude and interests of the other body. The bill in \nmy opinion creates too many new programs and policies that will have a \nmajor impact on the Federal budget for years to come.\n  Our Nation faces an economic emergency, but a health information \nprogram is not an emergency and should not have been included in this \nbill. Upgrading the elective grid is not an emergency and neither is \nimproving our Nation's scientific capacity, but they should have been \nconsidered in the President's budget request and through a deliberative \ncongressional process.\n  There are many things like this that should not have been included in \nthis bill.\n  The process has been anything but deliberative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2313-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I would like to recognize Mr. Joseph \n``Joe'' Burke for his 33 years of service with the U.S. Capitol Police.\n  Joe was raised and educated in Pennsylvania and Virginia. He attended \nMoravia College in Pennsylvania and graduated with a degree in criminal \njustice. Joe's studies didn't occupy all his time while at Moravia; he \nwas an extremely talented baseball player and tried out for the \nPittsburgh Pirates.\n  After choosing a career in law enforcement, Joe joined the U.S. \nCapitol Police on December 8, 1975. He served in several positions \nwithin the department before finding his true calling--the Containment \nand Emergency Response Team, CERT, in 1981.\n  Joe was among the original members of CERT upon its inception in \n1981. The tryouts for CERT were strenuous; held at the FBI Academy, \nthey consisted of shooting drills, running an obstacle course and \njumping into a pool with a rubber gun before swimming the length of the \npool. The Unit started with three five-man teams that train twice a \nmonth. This modest beginning has grown into the CERT we see today--a \nhighly trained, full-time tactical team.\n  Over the years, Joe has remained committed to serving the \ncongressional community. He has served during several challenging \nperiods for the Capitol Police including the tragic shooting at the \nCapitol, the attacks on September 11, 2001, and the anthrax mailings. \nJoe's experience was invaluable during big events, too--the state \nfunerals of Presidents Reagan and Ford, demonstrations, eight \nPresidential Inaugurations and numerous State of the Union Addresses.\n  Joe Burke's experience and service have helped CERT become a SWAT \nteam that ranks among the top teams in the country. He is responsible \nfor many of the programs currently used by the Capitol Police to train \nCERT personnel.\n  Joe has been recognized for his leadership and efforts to develop an \nenhanced and professional tactical team and for his work with area \nteams to develop response and coverage capabilities across the region.\n  Mr. President, Joe Burke retired from the U.S. Capitol Police on \nJanuary 3, 2009. I would like to thank him for his years of service to \nthe congressional community and ask that my colleagues join me in \nwishing Joe well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2313-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2313-S2315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each \ncommittee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the committee and \nto publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than March \n1 of the first year of each Congress. Today, February 12, 2009, the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship held a business \nmeeting during which the members of the committee unanimously adopted \nrules to govern the procedures of the committee. Consistent with \nStanding Rule XXVI, I am submitting for printing in the Congressional \nRecord a copy of the rules of the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship for the 111th Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRULES FOR THE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP --111TH \n                                CONGRESS\n\n\n                                GENERAL\n\n       All applicable provisions of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the Senate Resolutions, and the Legislative \n     Reorganization Acts of 1946 and of 1970 (as amended), shall \n     govern the Committee.\n\n\n                                MEETINGS\n\n       (a) The regular meeting day of the Committee shall be the \n     first Wednesday of each month unless otherwise directed by \n     the Chair. All other meetings may be called by the Chair as \n     he or she deems necessary, on 5 business days notice where \n     practicable. If at least three Members of the Committee \n     desire the Chair to call a special meeting, they may file in \n     the office of the Committee a written request therefore, \n     addressed to the Chair. Immediately thereafter, the Clerk of \n     the Committee shall notify the Chair of such request.

Such \n     number shall exclude any Administration witness unless such \n     witness would be the sole hearing witness, in which case the \n     Ranking Member shall be entitled to invite one witness. The \n     preceding two sentences shall not apply when a witness \n     appears as the nominee. Interrogation of witnesses at \n     hearings shall be conducted on behalf of the Committee by \n     Members of the Committee or such Committee staff as is \n     authorized by the Chair or Ranking Minority Member.\n       (3) Witnesses appearing before the Committee shall file \n     with the Clerk of the Committee a written statement of the \n     prepared testimony at least two business days in advance of \n     the hearing at which the witness is to appear unless this \n     requirement is waived by the Chair and the Ranking Minority \n     Member.\n       (c) Any witness summoned to a public or closed hearing may \n     be accompanied by counsel of his or her own choosing, who \n     shall be permitted while the witness is testifying to advise \n     the witness of his or her legal rights. Failure to obtain \n     counsel will not excuse the witness from appearing and \n     testifying.\n       (d) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, and other \n     materials may be authorized by the Chair with the consent of \n     the Ranking Minority Member or by the consent of a majority \n     of the Members of the Committee.

Subpoenas shall be issued by the Chair or by the \n     Member of the Committee designated by him or her. A subpoena \n     for the attendance of a witness shall state briefly the \n     purpose of the hearing and the matter or matters to which the \n     witness is expected to testify. A subpoena for the production \n     of memoranda, documents, records, and other materials shall \n     identify the papers or materials required to be produced with \n     as much particularity as is practicable.\n       (e) The Chair shall rule on any objections or assertions of \n     privilege as to testimony or evidence in response to \n     subpoenas or questions of Committee Members and staff in \n     hearings.\n\n\n                        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n       (a) No confidential testimony taken by, or confidential \n     material presented to, the Committee in executive session, or \n     any report of the proceedings of a closed hearing, or \n     confidential testimony or material submitted pursuant to a \n     subpoena, shall be made public, either in whole or in part or \n     by way of summary, unless authorized by a majority of the \n     Members.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and celebrate the \n100th anniversary of the National Association of the Advancement of \nColored People--the NAACP--and thank my colleagues for unanimously \nadopting H. Con. Res. 35, introduced by my friend, Congressman Al \nGreen, of Texas. I was honored to introduce companion legislation in \nthe Senate.\n  Yesterday we were reminded once again of the historic nature of the \nwork the NAACP has done over the last century as our Nation's first \nAfrican-American President came to the United States Capitol to pay \ntribute to President Abraham Lincoln on his 200th birthday.\n  When we reflect on how far we have come in this country, we must \nacknowledge the crucial role the NAACP has played in making so many of \nthose steps possible.\n  Founded on February 12, 1909, in New York City by a small multiracial \ngroup of activists that included Ida Wells-Barnett and W. E. B. Dubois, \nthe NAACP spent decades working to eliminate discrimination in schools \nand throughout our society at the grassroots. Nearly a half century \nlater, it would make itself known to the world with one of our Nation's \ngreatest legal victories, the Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of \nEducation.\n  In 1955, the Secretary of the NAACP's Montgomery, AL, branch suffered \nhumiliation and unwarranted arrest for refusing to give up her front \nseat on a segregated bus in Montgomery, AL. Rosa Parks' simple yet \npowerful action would ignite the largest civil rights grassroots \nmovement in the history of this country, reminding us once again of the \ndifference that even one American can make to change the course of \nhistory.\n  The NAACP also played an essential role in ensuring the passage of \nthe Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964.\n  Though the right to vote was declared to be a basic human right under \nthe U.S. Constitution, persons of color, especially African Americans, \nwere historically--and shamefully--denied this fundamental right. The \nNAACP played a substantial role pushing for the passage of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, partnering with the likes of Cesar Chavez.\n\n  While the NAACP's political work is extraordinary, its community \nservice efforts deserve recognition as well. In\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\n2005, it created the Disaster Relief Fund to provide assistance for \nHurricane Katrina victims in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Florida, \nand Alabama at a time when they needed it most.\n  As President Obama said, ``A nation cannot prosper long when it \nfavors only the prosperous.'' The NAACP has reminded us of those words \nfor a century.\n  For all this achievement symbolizes to Americans and the world, the \nNAACP still recognizes the importance of remaining vigilant in our \nfight for equality, never allowing the past to be forgotten. I am \nhonored that it has supported the passage of the Emmett Till Unsolved \nCivil Rights Crime Act that I introduced last Congress, in \ncommemoration of the unspeakably brutal and unjustified murder of an \nAfrican-American youth, ensuring that criminals of the unsolved hate \ncrimes of the civil rights struggle are brought to justice and that its \nvictims can finally find peace. And I am pleased that this legislation \nhas become law.\n  Much progress has been made in the lives of persons of color because \nof the NAACP and its tireless, life-risking, and never-ending work.\n  As Thurgood Marshall, who a dozen years after arguing Brown v. the \nBoard of Education before the Supreme Court would become the first \nAfrican American to serve on our nation's highest court, said:\n\n       In recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay \n     ourselves the highest tribute.\n\n  Today, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives return that \ntribute to the NAACP and everyone who has been associated with its \nachievements and advocacy for this last century.\n  May its work to ensure equality for all American citizens continue as \neach of us in this institution and across our country commit to \ndiminishing its necessity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2315-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2315-S2316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FINANCIAL FRAUD HEARING\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I want to bring my colleagues' attention \nto an important hearing held this past Wednesday by the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have been focused on the economy over the past few weeks, \nand particularly on the recovery bill that will soon start saving and \ncreating jobs.\n  But there are more steps we need to take to restart our economy. One \nstep is to renew confidence in our markets, by cracking down on the \nkind of criminal behavior that has contributed to our current crisis. I \nam talking about fraud in our financial markets.\n  On Wednesday, Chairman Leahy convened a Judiciary Committee hearing \non financial fraud. We heard testimony from John Pistole, Deputy \nDirector of the FBI; Rita Glavin, Acting Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Criminal Division; and Neil Barofsky, Special Inspector General for \nthe Trouble Assets Relief Program.\n  I will ask to include in the Record, following my remarks, three \narticles reporting on the hearing.\n  Two things became clear at the hearing: First, that the Justice \nDepartment's Criminal Division, the FBI and the Special Inspector \nGeneral are deadly serious about finding and prosecuting financial \nfraud.\n  FBI Deputy Director Pistole told the committee that the agency is \ninvestigating 530 open corporate fraud investigations, including 38 \ndirectly related to the current financial crisis. He said the total \nnumber of fraud investigations has nearly doubled, from 881 in fiscal \nyear 2006 to 1,600 in fiscal year 2008.\n  Second, we learned that Federal law enforcement needs additional \nresources to do so effectively.\n  According to Deputy Director Pistole ``The increasing mortgage, \ncorporate fraud and financial institution failure case inventory is \nstraining the FBI's limited white collar crime resources.''\n  The FBI's very necessary shift of resources to counterterrorism \nefforts has had a significant impact on its ability to investigate \nsophisticated financial crime.\n  Currently, the FBI has only 240 agents investigating complex \nfinancial fraud.\n  During the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, the FBI had more \nthan 1,000 agents investigating financial fraud connected to that \nscandal.\n  Mr. President, it is clear we need to scale up dramatically the \nnumber and training of FBI agents investigating financial fraud, \nbecause the financial meltdown of 2008 is much bigger than the savings \nand loan crisis.\n  That is why I was proud to join with Chairman Leahy and Senator \nGrassley to introduce S.386, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of \n2009.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Chairman Leahy and \nSenator Grassley to pass this important legislation, and I applaud them \nfor their leadership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the three articles to \nwhich I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From CQ Today, Feb. 11, 2009]\n\n    Spike in Fraud Investigations Taxing Law Enforcement Resources, \n                           Officials Testify\n\n                            (By Seth Stern)\n\n       More resources are needed to combat financial fraud, which \n     has soared amid the meltdown of financial markets, officials \n     told lawmakers Wednesday.\n       FBI Deputy Director John Pistole told the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee that the agency is investigating 530 open corporate \n     fraud investigations, including 38 directly related to the \n     current financial crisis. He said the total number of fraud \n     investigations has nearly doubled, from 881 in fiscal 2006 to \n     1,600 in fiscal 2008.\n       ``The increasing mortgage, corporate fraud and financial \n     institution failure case inventory is straining the FBI's \n     limited white-collar crime resources,'' Pistole said in his \n     written testimony to the committee.\n       Others noted that the problem was likely to worsen as \n     criminals target funds from the financial bailout (PL 110-\n     343) and the economic stimulus measure being considered by a \n     House-Senate conference (HR 1).\n       ``We stand on the precipice of the largest infusion of \n     government funds over the shortest period of time in our \n     nation's history,'' testified Neil M. Barofsky, the special \n     inspector general for the Troubled Assets Relief Program. \n     ``Unfortunately, our history teaches us that spending so much \n     money in such a short period of time will inevitably draw \n     those seeking to profit criminally.''\n       Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., the Judiciary Committee chairman, \n     and Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, have introduced legislation \n     (S 386) to extend federal fraud laws to cover more mortgage \n     lenders and funds expended under the financial bailout and \n     authorize the hiring of additional federal prosecutors and \n     FBI agents.\n       ``If we don't address this head-on, we'll have a hard time \n     chasing taxpayer money,'' Grassley said.\n       Pistole said the scale of the potential fraud dwarfs the \n     savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. He said 240 FBI agents \n     are currently involved in investigating mortgage fraud, as \n     opposed to the 1,000 agents and forensic experts who \n     investigated the savings and loan crisis.\n       ``More must be done to protect our country and our economy \n     from those who attempt to enrich themselves,'' Pistole said.\n       ``We're going to see demands on law enforcement really \n     increase'' with the stimulus package and financial bailout, \n     Rita M. Glavin, the acting assistant attorney general of the \n     Justice Department's Criminal Division, told the panel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Newsday, Feb. 12, 2009]\n\n                Rise in Fraud Cases Is ``Straining'' FBI\n\n       The economic crisis has sparked an increase in criminal \n     fraud, including an ``exponential rise'' in mortgage scams \n     that is straining the FBI's resources, a leader of the agency \n     said.\n       The Federal Bureau of Investigation has more than 1,800 \n     open investigations into mortgage fraud, more than double the \n     number in fiscal 2006, Deputy FBI Director John Pistole told \n     a U.S. Senate hearing yesterday in Washington.\n       The FBI also has more than 530 open corporate fraud \n     investigations, including 38 linked to the financial crisis, \n     he said.\n       ``The increasing mortgage, corporate fraud and financial \n     institution failure case inventory is straining the FBI's \n     limited white-collar crime resources,'' Pistole said in \n     prepared testimony.\n       Yesterday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing focused on \n     whether there should be beefed-up enforcement to cope with \n     the economic decline. The panel's chairman, Sen. Patrick \n     Leahy (D-Vt.), is pushing legislation to authorize funds to \n     hire fraud prosecutors and investigators. The bill, backed by \n     the Justice Department, also would strengthen financial crime \n     laws.\n       The 38 corporate cases linked to the financial crisis have \n     the potential to be as complex as that of Enron Corp., which \n     collapsed in 2001. The cases involve companies that \n     ``everybody knows about,'' Pistole said without naming them, \n     and include possible manipulation of financial statements, \n     accounting fraud and insider trading, he said.\n       The FBI has reassigned some agents from terrorism cases to \n     financial crimes.\n       The government's $700-billion Troubled Asset Relief Program \n     and the proposed economic stimulus legislation likely will \n     result in increased criminal activity, Neil Barofsky, special \n     inspector general of the TARP program, said in prepared \n     testimony.\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                  FBI Probes 530 Corporate Fraud Cases\n\n                          (By Devlin Barrett)\n\n       (Washington)--The FBI is conducting more than 500 \n     investigations of corporate fraud amid the financial \n     meltdown, FBI Deputy Director John Pistole told the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n       Investigators are tackling an even bigger mountain of \n     mortgage fraud cases in which hundreds of millions of dollars \n     may have been swindled from the system, he told lawmakers.\n       Pistole says there are 530 active corporate fraud \n     investigations, and 38 of them involve some of the biggest \n     names in corporate finance in cases directly related to the \n     current economic crisis. Additionally, the FBI has more than \n     1,800 mortgage fraud investigations, more than double the \n     number of such cases just two years ago.\n       There are so many mortgage fraud cases to investigate, he \n     said, that the bureau is not focusing on individual \n     purchasers, but industry professionals generating fraud \n     schemes that could total as much as hundreds of millions of \n     dollars. ``It is a matter of lawyers, brokers or real estate \n     professionals that are systematically trying to defraud the \n     system,'' Pistole said.\n       Agents have even seen some instances of organized crime \n     getting involved in mortgage fraud, he said.\n       Also appearing before the committee was Neil Barofsky, the \n     watchdog of the government's $700 billion Wall Street rescue \n     package passed last year.\n       Senate Democrats are urging more spending to expand the \n     ranks of the FBI's financial fraud investigators.\n       After the 2001 terror attacks, about 2,000 FBI agents were \n     moved to counterterrorism work, and Pistole said they are \n     considering moving some of them back to buttress anti-fraud \n     efforts.\n       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., \n     urged the FBI and the Justice Department to put people who \n     have committed mortgage fraud behind bars. ``Most people are \n     honest,'' Leahy said. ``The ones who are not honest in this \n     field are creating economic havoc and I want to make sure \n     that we're able to go after them. ``I want to see people \n     prosecuted . . . Frankly, I want to see them go to jail,'' he \n     said.\n       Barofsky, who was appointed the inspector general of the \n     ongoing financial bailout plan, suggested the best way to \n     clean up mortgage fraud is to pursue licensed professionals \n     in the industry, and make examples of them. ``They have the \n     most to lose, they're the most likely to flip, and they make \n     the best examples,'' said Barofsky, a former federal \n     prosecutor in New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2316-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HEART FOR WOMEN ACT\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to share my thoughts as \nthe lead cosponsor on the Heart for Women Act, introduced by Senator \nStabenow and myself along with 21 original cosponsors. Heart disease, \nstroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are critically important \nhealth issues that combined, are the No. 1 cause of death in all \nAmerican women, taking the life of one female nearly every minute. The \nHeart for Women Act will decrease the burden of heart disease in women, \nwhich coupled with stroke will claim the lives of nearly half a million \nwomen in America in 2008; this is more than all deaths from breast, \ncervical, and lung cancers combined.\n  A new study shows that while in young men under age 45, the heart \ndisease death rate is declining, the rate in young women has actually \nincreased and is now at its highest level since 1987. We cannot idly \nsit back and allow more of us to become part of these statistics, so to \naddress heart disease mortality and these significant disparities \nbetween men and women, Senator Stabenow and I have introduced The HEART \nfor Women Act.\n  Our legislation, the HEART for Women Act, does three things: First, \nit provides the public with better information about safe and effective \ntreatments for women by requiring drug safety information to be \nstratified by sex, race, and ethnicity. This information will help \ndoctors, researchers, and patients better understand why certain \ntreatments work better in men than in women. Second, this legislation \nexpands the WISEWOMAN Program that provides free heart disease and \nstroke prevention screening to low-income, uninsured women. This \nprogram has been incredibly successful throughout the U.S. three out of \nfour women screened by this program had at least one risk factor for \nheart disease and stroke. The HEART for Women Act also raises awareness \namong health care providers about the risk for heart disease and \nstroke. A 2004 survey found that less than 20 percent of physicians \nwere aware that more women than men die each year from cardiovascular \ndiseases.\n  After all this, there is some good news--a USA Today article from \nJanuary 2008 points out that heart disease deaths rates fell among \nwomen by almost 27 percent between 1999 and 2005; however, researchers \nestimate that epidemics of diabetes and obesity could threaten these \ngains.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us and support women's heart \nhealth.

His integrity and independence, his \nmanagerial skills, his broad experience in both the executive and \nlegislative branches, and his testimony during his confirmation hearing \nsuggest he is exactly the kind of CIA Director our country needs right \nnow.\n  First, his statements, in his meeting with me and at his confirmation \nhearing, provide assurances that he will put CIA activities squarely \nwithin the law and refocus the brave and dedicated professionals of the \nAgency on what they do best, and on what we need them for the most. Not \nonly did he express his commitment to ending an illegal and ineffective \ninterrogation and detention program, but he clearly indicated that the \nCIA would not conduct extraordinary renditions to secret detentions. \nCongressman Panetta also committed to ending the Bush administration's \npractice of using ``Gang of Eight'' briefings to evade its legal \nresponsibility to brief the full congressional intelligence committees, \nthereby thwarting oversight. And he assured me that the CIA would \ncooperate with the Department of Justice as the Department reviews \ninterrogation, detention, rendition and other matters that raise legal \nquestions. These statements, along with his previous condemnations of \ntorture and of warrantless surveillance of Americans, suggest a \npersonal commitment to the law and to our Constitution that will be \nneeded as the CIA faces the challenges ahead.\n  I have long been concerned that intelligence resources have not been \nsufficiently allocated toward long-term and emerging threats in places \nlike Africa, and was pleased that Congressman Panetta testified that he \nshares these concerns. More importantly, he has committed to conducting \na review of CIA operations and resources in light of these concerns and \nto working closely with the committee in the course of that review. \nFinally, he testified that he agrees with the goal of developing \nstrategies that integrate clandestine collection with the information \nobtained openly by our government, particularly through diplomatic \ncollection. Last year, the Senate Intelligence Committee passed \nlegislation creating an independent Commission to make-recommendations \non how to achieve this integration and Congressman Panetta has \ncommitted to working with me on that legislation. These commitments \ngive me confidence that Congressman Panetta will work to refocus the \nCIA on its central mission of protecting our national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2316-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2316-S2318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am a working class American male, fighting to maintain a \n     standard of living which will enable me to provide for myself \n     and my family. I find it difficult to imagine why we would \n     continue as a country to be held host to foreign oil.\n       I find that prices of everything are rising because of the \n     cost of shipping, and some members of Congress I hear think \n     this is a good thing? Sir, I am pleased that you would want \n     to hear from us, but realistically I am less than convinced \n     that much will be done by a body of people who seem so \n     unwilling and unable to work together as the current Congress \n     appears.\n       I used to be optimistic that one voice could make a \n     difference and now have resigned myself to believe that by \n     and large those who sit in the ``hallowed halls of Congress'' \n     care only for their power and position and nothing for us as \n     citizens. The price of groceries continues to rise, the price \n     of fuel driving everything higher, shippers cannot afford to \n     transport goods, and I find the future bleak. How long before \n     the trucking industry, the shipping industry, railways and \n     airlines stop because no one can afford to pay the cost?\n       Foodstuffs such as corn are now being grown for fuel, \n     driving those prices higher and yet no relief is felt at the \n     pump. It seems clear to me that two things must happen; first \n     we must become energy independent, drilling within our own \n     borders, and second finding alternative forms of energy to \n     prevent this from happening. Please use whatever powers of \n     persuasion you possess to convince your fellow Senators to \n     listen and feel the crunch that is crippling our nation!\n     Albert.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I were born in Idaho (I in Kellogg and my wife \n     in Pocatello) and I work at the INL although I am currently \n     on assignment at the Yucca Mountain Project.\n       How Do Gas Prices Impact Us and the Nation\n       I am 67 and my wife is 63 and, with the high cost of gas, \n     we are afraid to retire. These were supposed to be the \n     ``golden years'' and they are far from that. It is driving up \n     the cost of food and other items that must be shipped by \n     truck and is killing the auto industry. Because of all of \n     these cost increases and the uncertainties it is creating in \n     our economy, the stock market is also dropping and pulling \n     down what retirement investments that we have. Although \n     health care and other issues are also on our mind, I fear \n     that high gas prices are dragging our country to its knees \n     and it is spreading in all directions. They use to say that \n     if we lost Vietnam, it would have the domino effect and we \n     would lose all of that part of Asia.\n       Well, high gas prices are definitely causing a domino \n     effect, and as people travel less it impacts everyone who \n     support the travel industry. Look what it is doing to the \n     airline industry. The impact of high gas prices is spreading \n     everywhere. I wonder how long it will take to get beyond this \n     mess. Should I plan to retire at 70 or maybe I should think \n     about 75?\n\n\n                      What to Do About Gas Prices\n\n       The country is now looking toward nuclear power and that is \n     great. Wind and solar power might help a little, but they \n     cannot produce enough. And drilling for more oil in new \n     locations could also help. But these are all long-term \n     solutions that cannot help today. I think what makes us \n     frustrated is that the oil companies are making record \n     profits and they aren't doing anything to help the country. \n     It is sort of like their attitude is to take the money and \n     run. So if you want to do something in the short term, you \n     need to deal with them now. Congress needs to look into how \n     much they pay their CEOs and put a cap on that amount. When a \n     CEO makes 100 or 1,000 times more than the President or you, \n     Mike as a Senator, something is wrong. Congress also needs to \n     look into what they are doing with these record profits. They \n     claim that they are doing more exploration but we as the \n     public cannot see this. They should be forced to make public \n     what they are doing with the profits. I do not see them \n     building any new refineries. They should be forced to do \n     that. But you see, why would they want to build new \n     refineries when they have created a shortage that makes money \n     for them. We are asking the Saudis to pump more oil but we do \n     not ask our own oil companies to build more refineries. \n     Congress needs to ``get into their rice bowl'' as they. And \n     if the oil companies do not want to be part of this, Congress \n     should tax their profits beyond a certain point and use the \n     money to supplement gas prices. In the past during times of \n     war, Congress has created excess profit taxes to take the \n     profit out of war and they should do that now. We are in a \n     domestic war and it is killing our country. Or Congress \n     should look at their profits and set gas prices for them. Set \n     regular gas, for example, at $3.00 per gallon and the next \n     year if their profits are still beyond reason, drop it down \n     to $2.50 per gallon.\n       Thanks for working on this issue Mike. My wife and I are \n     worried for our country. We do not know where all of this is \n     going, but it does not look good.\n     Jim.\n                                  ____\n\n       We, as a Nation, have been irresponsible in allowing \n     ourselves to be dependent upon foreign sources for our energy \n     needs. And now, we are all paying the painful price. It is \n     ignorant to believe that we can just purchase all our energy \n     from other countries and in doing so, save the environment. \n     We have some of the strictest standards in place in the \n     United States to prevent damage to the environment, and yet \n     we allow other countries without those standards to pollute \n     the environment in the production of our energy. This is \n     burying our heads in the sand.\n       We have vastly improved our technologies since the early \n     1980s when the bans on offshore drilling were put into \n     effect. We would not expect to see the same problems we had \n     in the past if we were to resume that drilling today. We also \n     need to address the fact that we have not built any new \n     refineries in this country, and that is a necessary piece to \n     our energy needs puzzle. We have vast resources of oil \n     reserves that are untouched, mostly due to the cries of the \n     environmentalists, who are using their hearts instead of \n     their minds to raise their objections.\n       I have a dear friend who is an independent trucker out of \n     Pennsylvania, who has been doing a long-haul run from there \n     to the Northwest for over 10 years now. He has been watching \n     his profits be reduced by thousands of dollars per run, a \n     reduction that he is not able to simply pass along. After \n     almost 25 years of trucking, he is now contemplating \n     something else for the future. What will we, as a nation, do \n     if enough of our truckers quit due to the rising fuel costs? \n     We do not have enough alternatives in place to move our \n     goods, and without moving our goods, our economy will \n     collapse. We, individually, understand the impact on our \n     family budgets for energy increases, but we have not yet \n     begun to feel the entire impact that will trickle down to our \n     level.\n       We need to develop our own energy. We need to allow more \n     drilling. We need to allow refineries to be built. We need to \n     allow nuclear power plants to be built. We need to develop \n     such things as wind energy and tap waste sources such as \n     landfills for methane gas. We need permanent tax incentives \n     for the installation and use of renewables such as solar and \n     wind. We need to develop a usable hydrogen power. And that \n     should just be the start.\n       Yes, the increase in fuel has cost me and is hampering my \n     lifestyle. But I fear that, if the current prices become \n     permanent, then the costs to me will be so much greater than \n     they are today, and that is unacceptable.\n       Thank you for your time in reading this.\n     Monica.\n                                  ____\n\n       In September 2007 my husband changed jobs due to a long \n     commute and high gas prices. He had been travelling from \n     Weston, Idaho, to Promontory, Utah (132 miles round trip), \n     and had done so for the last sixteen years. In September, he \n     took a new job in Logan, Utah, which was half the commute. \n     However, in the exchange, he also took a $4.50/hr cut in pay. \n     We were okay because of the shorter commute and we were \n     saving in gas. Now, with the higher, much higher fuel prices, \n     we not only have lost the fuel savings but still have the cut \n     in wages. It is getting very difficult to make ends meet. \n     High fuel costs are affecting every aspect of our lives--\n     food, utilities, etc. We are supportive of drilling America's \n     own oil so we are not reliant on outside sources. Speed \n     limits could also be reduced and enforced. We drive small \n     fuel-efficient vehicles, unlike many who are driving large \n     trucks and SUVs. Americans need to wake up. Farmers in our \n     area are really struggling. Fuel prices are making it very \n     difficult to plant and harvest crops. We just need some \n     relief. We appreciate your asking our input and support your \n     efforts in getting the people of Idaho and America some \n     relief.\n     Richard and Christy, Weston.\n                                  ____\n\n       We need to start drilling now.\n       I am an Idaho resident and, because of work, commute weekly \n     from Idaho to Washington.

With \n     her in the Suburban were a passel of kids. Now I also have a \n     few children, and these days with energy costs skyrocketing \n     beyond the means of many families I think it is important to \n     speak up. I think twice every time I drive my van because of \n     the costs. We normally visit my family in Idaho Falls four \n     times per year and this year will only be able to reasonably \n     afford two times, and a major component of that decision is \n     the cost of fuel. My husband is an engineer and drives \n     approximately 20 miles round trip to work every day. He and \n     another co worker commute to save fuel. We have not had as \n     much disposable income as heating, cooling and fuel prices \n     have climbed at an astonishing pace. We have stopped eating \n     as much meat because of the cost of it. I water down the milk \n     to make it go further. We fortunately live far below our \n     means, but many families are not as fortunate as we are. One \n     of my dear friends works in 30 miles away, and drives there \n     from Moscow every day. With a long daily commute, and with \n     higher prices looming on the horizon who knows what this \n     winter will bring. She said that if it goes up much more she \n     will not make enough money to justify the driving.\n       I am not asking for the government to fix this. The \n     American people are resilient, and the government's \n     micromanagement of energy opportunities has only led us to \n     higher prices. You can bet if the oil companies are penalized \n     for their comparatively tiny per gallon profit, prices will \n     continue to climb.\n       What I propose is for government to get out of the way. \n     Pave the road to energy independence with reduced regulation \n     and open opportunity for exploration of all energy sources. \n     We should pursue coal to oil, nuclear, wind, methane, natural \n     gas and every other type of fuel, with the goal of being \n     energy independent. If the government will just be \n     reasonable, we could do all these things. I appreciate your \n     service, and your request for stories.

As you know living on a fixed income is \n     not easy at best, but with the cost of gas going up that is \n     affecting EVERYTHING. I have cut back on all non essential \n     driving--even to travel 50 miles to see my elderly parents \n     (80 & 78) once a week to help them out. I have cut back on \n     how often I mow the lawn to once every 2 weeks. I do not own \n     any recreation toys such as campers, 4-wheelers, boats or \n     motorcycles so cannot cut any RV usages. There will be very \n     limited vacation trips this summer. . . . Maybe to take my \n     grandsons camping.\n       I can remember back prior to the 70's gas scare when the \n     government had more controls on the oil companies and gas was \n     much more reasonable and there was still exploration being \n     done by the oil companies. Now without controls these \n     companies are having record net profits (enough to lower the \n     cost of gas close to $1.00 a gallon), why is this happening? \n     Also the stock market futures on oil dictate price increases \n     before the crude is even bought, but the drops in crude never \n     seem to get passed on to consumers at the same rate as the \n     increases . . . again why is this?\n       There was a march protesting the petroleum prices here in \n     Lewiston a couple of weeks ago . . . what else can the people \n     do to get thru to our government?\n       Thank you for the opportunity to voice my frustrations.\n       Sincerely,\n     Bob.\n                                  ____\n\n       We must do all we can to mitigate the energy crisis \n     gripping this nation. We can and must become energy \n     independent on natural gas in America. We have the resources \n     here to achieve this. Start drilling. Prices are on track to \n     double by this winter. However, the brutal truth is that the \n     neo-American Bolshevik socialist left in this country will \n     tie this nation up in the courts for years to prevent this \n     and force their agenda on this nation. They are arrogantly \n     smug about their ability to control us now. And well they \n     should be. They have been trained by some of the finest \n     Marxist professors anywhere in the world today, right here in \n     the USA. In the end, our epitaph will read that we destroyed \n     ourselves with the very freedoms that made us the envy of the \n     free world.

Those who knew him well knew of his selflessness and \ncommitment to the public good.\n  During World War II, Mr. Marumoto and his family spent 3 years in the \nGila River internment camp in Arizona. This experience did little to \ndeter Mr. Marumoto's pursuit of excellence and service to his country. \nHe served as student body president of his high school, Santa Ana High \nSchool, and later graduated from Whittier College.\n  His remarkable career spanned over five decades. He arrived in \nWashington, DC, in 1969 to serve as assistant to the secretary of the \nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare, responsible for recruiting \nsenior executives for the Office of Education. A year later, Mr. \nMarumoto became the first Asian American to serve at the executive \nlevel in the White House as an aide to President Richard Nixon \nresponsible for filling Cabinet and sub-Cabinet level positions.\n  In 1973, he founded The Interface Group Ltd., a Washington, DC-based \nexecutive search firm which specialized in placing women and minorities \nin senior executive positions. He is fondly remembered for his efforts \nto ensure diversity within the most senior levels of government.\n  He was a remarkable leader as president and CEO of the Asian Pacific \nAmerican Institute for Congressional Studies and received numerous \nnational professional awards for his work in higher education, \nfundraising, direct mail, events management, and publications.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to Mo's loved ones. He will be deeply\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\nmissed and his generosity will forever be remembered. May he rest in \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2319-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO C.

It is wonderful to see \nsomeone with such a distinguished health care record in Iowa recognized \nat the national level as a dedicated leader who is committed to \nimproving health care at such an important time for our Nation's health \ncare system.\n  Ed's voice will be a valuable contribution to the health care debate \nin 2009 in Washington, and I congratulate him on this new \nchairmanship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2319-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ZULUS 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this month America reflects on a \nseries of notable birthdays and anniversaries, including President \nAbraham Lincoln turning 200, and the NAACP celebrating its centennial.\n  In Louisiana, we are honoring a special birthday that is unique to \nour State. The famous Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club will enjoy its \n100th year.\n  The Zulus have a special place in Louisiana's history, which is as \ncolorful as the signature Zulu decorative coconuts. For 100 years they \nhave been an integral part of our Mardi Gras festivities and New \nOrleans culture. Dubbing themselves ``the everyman club,'' the Zulu \nSocial Aid & Pleasure club is composed of African-American men from all \nwalks of life.\n  While there are several stories about how the Zulus first came about, \nwe know they made their first appearance in the Mardi Gras parade in \n1909 when William Story led the Zulus as King.\n  That year the group wore raggedy pants and had a Jubilee-singing \nquartet in front of and behind King Story.\n  Just 6 years later, the Zulus used their first float. It was rather \nmodestly decorated with palmetto leaves and moss. Of course, this first \nfloat gave rise to the more lavishly decorated Zulu floats that we are \naccustomed to seeing today.\n  Since 1916, the Zulus have given the first official Mardi Gras toast \nto King and Queen Zulu at the Geddes and Moss Funeral Home on \nWashington Avenue.\n  Since 1910, the Zulus have been famous for the Zulu Coconut, often \ncalled the ``Golden Nugget,'' which they throw from floats during Mardi \nGras parades. The tradition developed, and they began scraping and \npainting the coconuts--now an indelible part of New Orleans Mardi Gras \nculture.\n  In January, I was honored to receive from Zulu president Charles \nHamilton, Jr., a special Zulu coconut as gift for President Obama. Mr. \nHamilton traveled to Washington by train to hand deliver the gift, \nwhich I hope to present to the President very soon. It was hand-painted \nby Gretna artist Keith Eccles and incorporates Mardi Gras colors and \nthemes with the distinctive red, white and blue of Washington, DC. Mr. \nHamilton has said that he wanted to give President Obama a piece of New \nOrleans and Zulu history. I can't think of a better representation.\n  In addition to the Zulu coconut, the Zulus' contribution to New \nOrleans is well-documented. The group proudly participates in the \nAdopt-A-School program and contributes to Southern University's \nscholarship fund. The Zulus also give Christmas baskets to needy \nfamilies each holiday season.\n  Over the years, many famous Louisianians have taken part in the Zulu \ntradition. In 1949, Louis Armstrong was King Zulu. And in 1988, New \nOrleans native Desiree Rogers--now the White House social secretary for \nPresident Obama--served as Zulu Queen.\n  This year, that proud tradition will be carried on by Zulu King \nTyrone Mathieu, Sr., and Zulu Queen Sheila Barnes Mathieu.\n  I congratulate the many generations of Zulus who have left their mark \non Mardi Gras and our great city of New Orleans. I ask the Senate to \njoin me in wishing the Zulus a happy 100th birthday--and all the best \nin the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2319-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:08 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New Jersey memorializing Congress to protect the automobile \n     industry and expand national infrastructure projects and \n     related industries; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 37\n\n       Whereas, a number of specialists have warned that the \n     collapse of the national economy could occur if certain stop-\n     gap and long-term actions are not implemented to overcome the \n     problems facing the automotive and machine tool sectors of \n     our economy; and\n       Whereas, the loss of the physical capabilities of the \n     automotive industry, especially its tool sector, could mean \n     the end of America's status as a leading world economic \n     power; and\n       Whereas, while it is in the best interests of our national \n     security to have a strong, vibrant manufacturing and \n     industrial sector, capable of producing the necessary \n     machinery and technology to defend the citizens of the United \n     States and protect our interests abroad, our manufacturing \n     and industrial sector has experienced a dramatic reduction in \n     capacity and production over the last several decades; and\n       Whereas, government has an obligation to promote economic \n     activity through the creation of new capital investment, \n     which will result in the expansion of employment \n     opportunities and help jump-start long-term capital \n     investment by private investors.; and\n       Whereas, as government leaders, we must ensure the \n     continued viability of our automotive and machine tool \n     industries, which is a vital element of the State and federal \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, diversification of the productive potential of the \n     automotive and machine tool industries into a broader sector \n     of production, coupled with a shift into the domain of \n     essential capital goods and economic infrastructure, such as \n     the repair, expansion, and improvement of our national \n     railway systems, and the development of other urgently needed \n     infrastructure projects, will save existing manufacturing \n     jobs and create large new areas of employment in \n     infrastructure and manufacturing for our citizenry in a \n     manner comparable to the best of the New Deal programs that \n     rescued the nation and the world from the ravages of the \n     Great Depression; and\n       Whereas, the impact of this intervention will be to provide \n     thousands of productive jobs in the state of New Jersey, \n     repair our infrastructure, and create at least ten million \n     jobs nationally, thus restoring our tax base and increasing \n     the standard of living. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. The Senate of the State of New Jersey respectfully \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to intervene \n     on behalf of national economic interests to ensure that the \n     productive potential of the automobile industry, with its \n     featured technology and machine tool capability, be \n     protected.\n       2. The Senate of the State of New Jersey respectfully \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to intervene \n     to vastly expand the construction and maintenance of \n     infrastructure projects and related industries.\n       3. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the President of the Senate and attested by the Secretary \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to each member of New Jersey's \n     congressional delegation and to the Speaker and Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. and \n     the President and Secretary of the United States Senate, \n     Washington, D.C.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-8. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan memorializing the Congress to assist Michigan in \n     rebuilding the State's economy, in light of Michigan's high \n     rate of unemployment and pressures on the State's \n     Unemployment Trust Fund; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 232\n\n       Whereas, our nation is facing an economic crisis, the depth \n     and breath of which has not been seen in decades. With \n     Michigan's historic connection to the automotive industry, \n     the Great Lakes State's economic struggles have been a \n     precursor to the nation's economic maelstrom. Michigan has \n     the nation's highest unemployment rate and has lost 538,000 \n     jobs since 2000. Clearly, federal assistance is necessary to \n     help Michigan restart its economic engine and help drive the \n     national economy back to full recovery. Given the severity of \n     Michigan's economic downturn, the state should be given \n     priority when distributing stimulus dollars to spur economic \n     growth in our country; and\n       Whereas, indeed, Michigan is now at a tipping point between \n     economic despair and recovery. Technological innovation and \n     business reforms and efficiencies adopted in response to \n     Michigan's ``one-state recession'' are already paying \n     dividends. However, the national economy and numerous federal \n     policies have continued to negatively impact our\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n     state's ability to pull itself up by its bootstraps. Chief \n     among these are Michigan's longtime status as a donor state \n     for federal highway funding dollars and the relative lack of \n     federal public works and defense investment in this state; \n     and\n       Whereas, Congress could be of great assistance in our \n     state's economic redevelopment efforts, in particular, \n     temporarily suspending the federal match for highway \n     infrastructure investment, improving the state's share of \n     federal highway funding so Michigan is no longer a donor \n     state, and giving greater weight to Michigan firms in \n     contracting would provide an immediate stimulus to our \n     stagnant state economy. Moreover, longer term efforts such as \n     creating tax-free state economic recovery zones; reducing \n     taxation on innovation, production, and investment; allowing \n     states to designate certain areas of the state as exempt from \n     federal corporate taxes capped at $1 billion per year; \n     enhancing investment tax credit availability; and targeting \n     federal infrastructure investment to those states with the \n     highest rates of unemployment would help provide economic \n     stability where it is needed the most; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, that we hereby memorialize the \n     Congress of the United States to assist Michigan in \n     rebuilding the state's economy, in light of unemployment and \n     pressures on the state's Unemployment Trust Fund; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-9.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the State plan amendment option for providing home and \ncommunity-based services under the Medicaid program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, every day millions of Americans are faced \nwith significant challenges when it comes to meeting their own personal \nneeds or caring for a loved one who needs substantial support. Many \nelderly Americans and individuals of all ages with disabilities need \nlong-term services and supports, such as assistance with dressing, \nbathing, preparing meals, and managing chronic conditions. They prefer \nto live and work in their community, and it is time that the Federal \nGovernment and states act as better partners to provide improved access \nto home and community-based long-term care services, HCBS.\n  The Medicaid program, administered by the States but jointly financed \nwith the Federal Government, is our nation's largest payer for long-\nterm care services. Medicaid spends about $100 billion per year on \nlong-term services. Despite recognizing that per person spending is \nmuch lower in community settings, and that people generally prefer \ncommunity services, Medicaid still spends 61 percent of its long-term \nservices spending in institutional settings. This disparity is due, in \nlarge part, to a strong access and payment bias in the program for \ninstitutional care.\n  Where Medicaid does offer HCBS, it is often in short supply, with \nmore than 280,000 Medicaid beneficiaries on waiting lists for HCBS \nwaiver services. Further, eligibility for HCBS waiver services requires \nbeneficiaries to already have a very significant level of disability \nbefore gaining access, and they must meet a level of functional need \nthat qualifies them for a nursing home. This not only contributes to \nthe unmet needs of those in the community but it also prevents states \nfrom providing services that can help prevent beneficiaries from one \nday requiring high-cost institutional care. While institutionalized \ncare may be an appropriate choice for some, it should be just that: a \nchoice that individuals and families are allowed to make about the most \nappropriate setting for their own care.\n  The result of Medicaid's ``institutional bias'' is that, according to \nthe Georgetown Health Policy Institute, ``one in five persons living in \nthe community with a need for assistance from others has unmet needs, \nendangering their health and demeaning their quality of life.'' This is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  The lack of long-term care options available to families has a \nsignificant impact on their lives. Many of my constituents are \naffected, as are countless Americans across the country. Take the \nparents living in Newton who continue to wait for their physically \ndisabled daughter, Julia, to have the opportunity to live \nindependently. Julia is a young adult and instead of starting out on \nher own, she must watch as her peers move away and begin their \nindependent lives--something she yearns to do as well. Growing up, \nJulia was able to attend Newton schools and keep a similar schedule to \nother children in the community but now has limited social interaction, \nas there is no other option but to live at home with her parents. \nJulia's parents are her full time caregivers and would like to see her \nable to live in an environment more conducive to both her needs and \ntheir own. Community-based care or home-based care in an apartment she \ncould share with a roommate are options Julia and her parents would \nmutually benefit from. As the opportunities for the future grow for her \npeers, Julia's options continue to shrink because housing and home-\nbased supports for adults with disabilities are limited at best. I have \nheard many stories similar to that of Julia, which emphasizes the \nurgency in which HCBS is needed. In addition to individual lives being \nput on hold, entire families must deal with the consequences of \ninadequate services available to their family members.\n\n  Access to HCBS affects individuals in all stages of life, including \nAmericans dealing with conditions such as Alzheimer's. Take Ann Bowers \nand Jay Sweatman for example. Without access to HCBS services, Jay, who \nsuffers from early onset Alzheimer's, was forced to first move into \nassisted living and then a nursing home. By the time Jay was approved \nfor HCBS it was too late and he was no longer able to live \nindependently. Ann had worked tirelessly to coordinate her husband's \ncare and get additional HCBS support but the process was so difficult \nthat by the time help came, it was simply too late. This is just one \ncase of many where early HCBS intervention would have not only saved \ntime, money, and stress for family members, but would have made a \nsignificant impact on the quality of life and personal independence for \nJay and Ann.\n  Today I am introducing, with my colleague from the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley, the Empowered at Home Act, a bill that increases \naccess to home and community-based services by giving states new tools \nand incentives to make these services more available to those in need. \nIt has four basic parts.\n  First, it will improve the Medicaid HCBS State Plan Amendment Option \nby giving states more flexibility in determining eligibility for which \nservices they can offer under the program, which will create greater \noptions for individuals in need of long-term supports. In return we ask \nthat states no longer cap enrollment and that services be offered \nthroughout the entire state.\n  Second, the bill ensures that the same spousal impoverishment \nprotections offered for new nursing home beneficiaries will be in place \nfor those opting for home and community-based services. In addition, \nlow-income recipients of home and community-based services will be able \nto keep more of their assets when they become eligible for Medicaid, \nallowing them to stay in their community as long as possible.\n  Third, the Empowered at Home Act addresses the financial needs of \nspouses and family members caring for a loved one by offering tax-\nrelated provisions to support family caregivers and promotes the \npurchase of meaningful private long-term care insurance.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to improve the overall quality of home and \ncommunity-based services available by providing grants for states to \ninvest in organizations and systems that can help to ensure a \nsufficient supply of high quality workers, promote health, and \ntransform home and community-based care to be more consumer-centered.\n  I want to say a word about the Community Choice Act, legislation \nlong-championed by Senator Harkin that would make HCBS a mandatory \nbenefit in Medicaid. I am a strong supporter\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nand co-sponsor of this landmark legislation, and look forward to \nworking for its enactment as soon as possible. The legislation I am \nintroducing today seeks to supplement--not supplant--the Community \nChoice Act by increasing access to HCBS for those who are disabled but \nnot at a sufficient level of need to qualify for nursing home services. \nThese two complimentary bills will finally make HCBS a right while \nvastly improving HCBS availability to vulnerable citizens of varying \nlevels of disability.\n  I would also like to thank a number of organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Empowered at Home Act and who have \nendorsed it today, including the National Council on Aging, the \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons, AARP, the Arc of the United \nStates, United Cerebral Palsy, the American Association of Homes and \nServices for the Aging, the Alzheimer's Association, the National \nAssociation of Area Agencies on Aging, the American Geriatrics Society, \nANCOR, the Trust for America's Health, and SEIU.\n  Improving access to a range of long-term care services for the \nelderly and Americans of all ages with disabilities is an issue that \nmust not stray from our Nation's health care priorities. I believe this \nlegislation can move forward in a bi-partisan manner to dramatically \nimprove access to high-quality home and community-based care for the \nmillions of Americans who are not receiving the significant supports \nand services they need.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Kerry today to re-introduce the Empowered at Home Act for the \n111th Congress. This bill is a continuation of efforts that I undertook \nin 2005 and again in 2008 to improve access to home and community based \nservices for those needing long-term care. This is an important piece \nof legislation that continues our efforts to make cost-effective home \nand community based care options more available to those who need it.\n  In 2005, I introduced the Improving Long-term Care Choices Act with \nSenator Bayh. That legislation set forth a series of proposals aimed at \nimproving the accessibility of long-term care insurance and promoting \nawareness about the protection that long-term care insurance can offer. \nIt also sought to broaden the availability of the types of long-term \ncare services such as home and community-based care, which many people \nprefer to institutional care.\n  The year 2005 ended up being a very important year for health policy \nas it relates to Americans who need extensive care. In the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005, Congress passed into law the Family Opportunity \nAct, the Money Follows the Person initiative, and many critical pieces \nof the Improving Long-term Care Choices Act. With the bill I am re-\nintroducing today with Senator Kerry, I hope to set us on the path to \ncompleting the work we started in 2005 and continued in 2008.\n  Making our long-term care system more efficient is a critical goal as \nwe consider the future of health care. There are more than 35 million \nAmericans, roughly 12 percent of the U.S. population, over the age of \n65. This number is expected to increase dramatically over the next few \ndecades as the baby boomers age and life expectancy increases. \nAccording to the U.S. Administration on Aging, by the year 2030, there \nwill be more than 70 million elderly persons in the United States. As \nthe U.S. population ages, more and more Americans will require long-\nterm care services.\n  The need for long-term care will also be affected by the number of \nindividuals under the age of 65 who may require a lifetime of care. \nCurrently, almost half of all Americans who need long-term care \nservices are individuals with disabilities under the age of 65. This \nnumber includes over 5 million working-age adults and approximately \n400,000 children.\n  Long-term care for elderly and disabled individuals, including care \nat home and in nursing homes, represents almost 40 percent of Medicaid \nexpenditures. Contrary to general assumptions, it is Medicaid, not \nMedicare that pays for the largest portion of long-term care for the \nelderly. Over 65 percent of Medicaid long-term care expenditures \nsupport elderly and disabled individuals in nursing facilities and \ninstitutions. Although most people who need long-term care prefer to \nremain at home, Medicaid spending for long-term care remains heavily \nweighted toward institutional care.\n  Section 6086 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, DRA, P.L. 109-171, \nwas based on the Improving Long-term Care Choices Act. The DRA \nprovision authorized a new optional benefit under Medicaid that allows \nstates to extend home and community-based services to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries under the section 1915(i) Home and Community-Based \nServices State Option. Under this authority, states can offer Medicaid-\ncovered home and community-based services under a state's Medicaid plan \nwithout obtaining a section 1915(c) home and community-based waiver. \nEligibility for these section 1915(i) services may be extended only to \nMedicaid beneficiaries already enrolled in the program whose income \ndoes not exceed 150 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  To date, only one State, my own state of Iowa, has sought to take \nadvantage of the provision authorized through the DRA. While we had \nhoped far more states would participate, we know that the relatively \nlow income cap, 150 percent, in the DRA provision creates an \nadministrative complexity that has not made the option appealing for \nstates.\n  The bill we are re-introducing today mirrors the one we introduced in \n2008 during the 110th Congress. In this bill, the income eligibility \nstandard would be raised for access to covered services under section \n1915(i) to persons who qualify for Medicaid because their income does \nnot exceed a specified level established by the state up to 300 percent \nof the maximum Supplemental Security Income, SSI, payment applicable to \na person living at home. This will significantly increase the number of \npeople eligible for these services. States will be able to align their \ninstitutional and home and community-based care income eligibility \nlevels.\n  The bill would also establish two new optional eligibility pathways \ninto Medicaid. These groups would be eligible for section 1915(i) home \nand community-based services as well as services offered under a \nstate's broader Medicaid program. Under this bill, states with an \napproved 1915(k) state plan amendment would have the option to extend \nMedicaid eligibility to individuals: who are not otherwise eligible for \nmedical assistance; whose income does not exceed 300 percent of the \nsupplemental security income benefit rate; and who would satisfy state-\nestablished needs-based criteria based upon a state's determination \nthat the provision of home and community-based services would \nreasonably be expected to prevent, delay, or decrease the need for \ninstitutionalized care. Under this new eligibility pathway, states \ncould choose to either limit Medicaid benefits to those home and \ncommunity-based services offered under section 1915(k) or allow \neligibles to access services available under a state's broader Medicaid \nprogram in addition to the 1915(k) benefits. These changes will give \nthe states the option of exploring the use of an interventional use of \nhome and community-based services. If states have the flexibility to \nprovide the benefit as contemplated in the bill, they can try to delay \nthe need for institutional care and keep people in their homes longer.\n  As the number of Americans reaching retirement age grows \nproportionally larger, ultimately the number of Americans needing more \nextensive care will grow. Many of these Americans will look to Medicaid \nfor assistance. States need more tools to provide numerous options to \npeople in need so that they can stay in their own homes as long as \npossible.\n  The cost of providing long-term care in an institutional setting is \nfar more expensive care than providing care in the home. States will \nbenefit from having options before them that allow them to keep people \nappropriately in home settings longer. The more States learn how to use \nthose tools, the more States and ultimately the Federal taxpayer will \nbenefit from reduced costs for institutional care.\n  I am also pleased that this bill will include key provisions from S. \n2337, the Long-Term Care Affordability and Security Act of 2007. The \nbill includes important tax provisions that I introduced in previous \nCongresses as well,\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\nthe Improving Long-term Care Choices Act of 2005, introduced in the \n109th Congress.\n  Research shows that the elderly population will nearly double by \n2030. By 2050, the population of those aged 85 and older will have \ngrown by more than 300 percent. Research also shows that the average \nage at which individuals need long-term care services, such as home \nhealth care or a private room at a nursing home, is 75. Currently, the \naverage annual cost for a private room at a nursing home is more than \n$75,000. This cost is expected to be in excess of $140,000 by 2030.\n  Based on these facts, we can see that our nation needs to prepare its \ncitizens for the challenges they may face in old-age. One way to \nprepare for these challenges is by encouraging more Americans to obtain \nlong-term care insurance coverage. To date, only 10 percent of seniors \nhave long-term care insurance policies, and only 7 percent of all \nprivate-sector employees are offered long-term care insurance as a \nvoluntary benefit.\n  Under current law, employees may pay for certain health-related \nbenefits, which may include health insurance premiums, co-pays, and \ndisability or life insurance, on a pre-tax basis under cafeteria plans \nand flexible spending arrangements, FSAs. Essentially, an employee may \nelect to reduce his or her annual salary to pay for these benefits, and \nthe employee doesn't pay taxes on the amounts used to pay these costs. \nEmployees, however, are explicitly prohibited from paying for the cost \nof long-term care insurance coverage tax-free.\n  Our bill would allow employers, for the first time, to offer \nqualified long-term care insurance to employees under FSAs and \ncafeteria plans. This means employees would be permitted to pay for \nqualified long-term care insurance premiums on a tax-free basis. This \nwould make it easier for employees to purchase long-term care \ninsurance, which many find unaffordable. This should also encourage \nyounger individuals to purchase long-term care insurance. The younger \nthe person is at the time the long-care insurance contract is \npurchased, the lower the insurance premium.\n  Our bill also allows an individual taxpayer to deduct the cost of \ntheir long-term care insurance policy. In other words, the individual \ncan reduce their gross income by the premiums that they pay for a long-\nterm care policy, and therefore, pay less in taxes. This tax benefit \nfor long-term care insurance should encourage more individuals to \npurchase these policies. It certainly makes a policy more affordable, \nespecially for younger individuals. This would allow a middle-aged \ntaxpayer to start planning for the future now.\n  Finally a provision that is included in our bill that I am really \npleased with is one that provides a tax credit to long-term caregivers. \nLong-term caregivers could include the taxpayer him- or herself. \nSenator Kerry and I recognize that these taxpayers--who have long-term \ncare needs, yet are taking care of themselves--should be provided extra \nassistance. Also, taxpayers taking care of a family member with long-\nterm care needs would also be eligible for the tax credit. These \ntaxpayers should be given a helping hand. As our population continues \nto age, the least that we can do is provide a tax benefit for these \nstruggling individuals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. Crapo, Mr. Martinez, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 437. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe deduction of attorney-advanced expenses and court costs in \ncontingency fee cases; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce \nlegislation to amend Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code to permit \nattorneys to deduct expenses and court costs incurred on behalf of \ncontingency fee clients as an ordinary and necessary business expense \nin the year such expenses are sustained. I introduced the same \nlegislation in the 110th Congress, and the bill attracted bipartisan \nsupport. My bill simply clarifies the law to make certain that \nattorneys who take on contingency fee cases are able to enjoy the same \ntax benefits as virtually every other small business in the country.\n  Contingency agreements between attorneys and clients are very common \nin personal injury, medical malpractice, product liability, Social \nSecurity disability, workers compensation, civil liberties, and \nemployment cases. Under these agreements, an attorney pays all out-of-\npocket costs associated with a case before any conclusion to the case. \nSuch expenses include costs for expert witnesses, depositions, medical \nrecords, and court fees. Contingency agreements have numerous benefits \nto clients; in particular, indigent individuals who might otherwise be \nunable to afford legal services.\n  The obvious benefit to clients of contingency fee arrangements is \nthat they do not have to incur out-of-pocket expenses for attorneys' \nfees. This may be particularly valuable to clients who do not have the \nability to pay attorneys by the hour to advance their case. The \narrangement also benefits the client by effectively spreading the risk \nof litigation. An hourly-rate payment agreement requires the client to \nassume all of the risk because the attorneys' fees are a sunk cost. \nHowever, under a contingent-fee arrangement, the attorney shares that \nrisk and is only paid a fee if he wins the case or obtains a \nsettlement.\n\n  Currently, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, treats expenses and \ncourt costs on behalf of contingency clients as loans to the client. As \na result, the IRS does not permit any deduction by the attorney until \nthe litigation is resolved, sometimes many years after the attorney has \nincurred the expenses on behalf of their client. The IRS treats the \nexpenses and court costs as a loan despite the fact that no interest is \ncharged and the lawyer only recoups costs if the case is won or \nsettled. Not only is the IRS's position illogical, but it is contrary \nto a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n  In Boccardo v. Commissioner, 56 F.3d 1016, 9t Cir. 1995, the 9th \nCircuit held that because the firm had a ``gross fee'' contract with \nthe client, the firm incurred ordinary and necessary business expenses \nin the payment of costs and charges in connection with its clients' \nlitigation. Consequently, litigation costs such as filing fees, witness \nfees, travel expenses, and medical consultation fees were deductible as \nordinary and necessary business expenses in the year the costs were \nincurred on behalf of the clients. In a ``gross fee'' contract, the \nclient is only obligated to pay their attorney a percentage of the \namount recovered and is not expressly responsible for specific \nrepayment of costs. While the Boccardo court contrasted ``gross fee'' \ncontracts with ``net fee'' contracts, such a distinction is trivial for \ntax purposes. In both agreements, the attorney takes a considerable \nbusiness risk to incur significant costs on behalf of a client and only \nrecoups the expenses if a recovery is won.\n  Despite the Boccardo court's ruling in favor of attorneys, the IRS \ncontinues to treat the out-of-pocket costs related to contingency fee \ncases as loans. Lawyers who make the decision to deduct these costs are \nexposed to potential audit and litigation. Over the past 13 years, \ntaxpayers have had to proceed at their own peril--Ninth Circuit \ntaxpayers risk a conflict with the IRS on this matter despite the case \nlaw, and taxpayers outside of the Ninth Circuit have no guidance at all \nsince they cannot directly rely on Boccardo.\n  My bill reverses an unfair IRS position by treating these businesses \nthe same as all other small businesses. It does so by allowing \nattorneys with contingency fee clients to deduct their expenses and \ncosts in the year that they are paid. My legislation does not give \nattorneys anything above and beyond that which is currently enjoyed by \nvirtually every other small business in our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for and promote the economic development of \nIndian tribes by furnishing the necessary capital, financial services, \nand technical assistance to Indian-owned business enterprises, to \nstimulate the development of the private sector of Indian tribal \neconomies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nestablish an Indian Development Finance Corporation as an independent, \nFederally-chartered corporation that is modeled after the family of \nDevelopment Banks established by the World Bank in lesser-developed \ncountries around the world.\n  Mr. President, in my more than 30 years of service on the U.S. Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, I have visited many Indian communities and \nAlaska Native villages, and I have seen that in many parts of Indian \ncountry, there are economic and social conditions that are as dire as \nthose conditions found in the so-called ``lesser developed countries'' \naround the world. And although we have seen some economic success in \nrecent years across Native America as a result of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, most Indian tribes and Native villages are not engaged \nin the conduct of gaming, nor have tribal governments found the means \nto overcome the challenges associated with their remote locations from \npopulations centers and market places that serve the commercially-\nsuccessful tribal gambling operations.\n  In those rurally-isolated areas, there is real potential to succeed \nin developing viable local economies based on agricultural and fishery \nresources, and the development of the vast energy resources that are \nlocated on Indian lands. What these Native communities need is the type \nof development financing services that the World Bank has successfully \nestablished--institutions empowered to make small, leveraged capital \ninvestments and economic infrastructure development to support tailored \nindustrial programs, internet-based communication services, national \nand international trade agreements, and economic research capabilities. \nAn Indian Development Finance Corporation could provide these kinds of \nservices through a network of centers that would be based in Indian \nCountry.\n  Under this bill, the Corporation would be authorized to issue 500,000 \nshares of common stock at $50 per share to every Tribal Nation in \nIndian Country and Alaska. The Corporation would be managed by a Board \nelected by the Tribal shareholders and the Board would be charged with \nhiring a President and a team of managers as well as set operating \npolicies. Seed capital would be injected into the Indian Development \nFinance Corporation (IDFC) by the U.S. Treasury in exchange for the \nissuance of capital stock. Initially, $20 million in start-up funds \nwould be invested and after the majority of common stock was purchased \nby tribes, another $80 million would be authorized.\n  I believe that the IDFC can take advantage of opportunities to \nintegrate the economic stimulus activities soon to be created by the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and. I am confident that there \nwill be support forthcoming from those tribal governments and Alaska \nNative corporations that have the resources to invest in the economic \ninfrastructure initiatives that will be established by the IDFC in this \nperiod of our greatest need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 439\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a special relationship has existed between the United \n     States and Indian tribes, which is recognized in clause 3 of \n     section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n     States;\n       (2) pursuant to laws, treaties, and administrative \n     authority, Congress has implemented activities to fulfill the \n     responsibility of the United States for the protection and \n     preservation of Indian tribes and tribal resources;\n       (3) despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian land and a rich cultural legacy that places great \n     value on self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     Indians and Alaska Natives experience poverty and \n     unemployment, together with associated incidences of social \n     pathology, to an extent unequaled by any other group in the \n     United States;\n       (4)(A) the reasons for that poverty and unemployment have \n     been widely studied and documented by Congress, the \n     Government Accountability Office, the Department of the \n     Interior, private academic institutions, and Indian tribes; \n     and\n       (B) the studies described in subparagraph (A) have \n     consistently identified as fundamental obstacles to balanced \n     economic growth and progress by Indians and Alaska Natives--\n       (i) the very limited availability of long-term development \n     capital and sources of financial credit necessary to support \n     in Indian country the development of a private sector economy \n     comprised of Indian-owned business enterprises;\n       (ii) the lack of effective control by Indians over their \n     own land and resources; and\n       (iii) the scarcity of experienced Indian managers and \n     technicians;\n       (5) previous efforts by the Federal Government directed at \n     stimulating Indian economic development through the provision \n     of grants, direct loans, loan guarantees, and interest \n     subsidies have fallen far short of objectives due to--\n       (A) inadequate funds;\n       (B) lack of coordination;\n       (C) arbitrary project selection criteria;\n       (D) politicization of the delivery system; and\n       (E) other inefficiencies characteristic of a system of \n     publicly administered financial intermediation; and\n       (6) the experience acquired by multilateral lending \n     institutions among ``lesser-developed countries'' has \n     demonstrated the value and necessity of development financial \n     institutions in achieving economic growth in underdeveloped \n     economies and societies that are strikingly similar to Indian \n     and Alaska Native communities in relation to matters such \n     as--\n       (A) control over natural resource management;\n       (B) the absence of experienced, indigenous managers and \n     technicians; and\n       (C) the availability of long-term development capital and \n     private sources of financial credit.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that, in \n     fulfillment of the special and long-standing responsibility \n     of the United States to Indian tribes, the United States \n     should provide assistance to Indians in efforts to break free \n     from the devastating effects of extreme poverty and \n     unemployment and achieve lasting economic self-sufficiency \n     through the development of the private sector of tribal \n     economies by establishing a federally chartered, mixed-\n     ownership development financing institution to provide a \n     broad range of financial intermediary services (including \n     working capital, direct loans, loan guarantees, and project \n     development assistance) using the proven efficiencies of the \n     private market mode of operation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nabove-the-line deduction for attorney fees and costs in connection with \ncivil claim awards; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce \nlegislation to amend Section 62(a)(20) of the Internal Revenue Code to \nallow taxpayers to subtract from their taxable gross income the \nattorneys' fees and court costs paid by the taxpayer in connection with \nan award or settlement of monetary damages in a civil claim. Such a \ndeduction is commonly referred to as an ``above-the-line'' deduction.\n  Under current law, there is an inequity in the tax code that results \nin the double taxation of attorneys' fees and costs in certain \ncircumstances. In addition, attorneys' fees paid by individuals in \nrecovering a taxable award in certain civil claims are only deductible \nas miscellaneous itemized deductions. As such, they are subject to a \nreduction equal to two percent of the individual's adjusted gross \nincome and subject to a complete disallowance when calculating the \nalternative minimum tax. Consequently, many plaintiffs end up incurring \nsignificant tax liability beyond the amount they actually bring home \nafter winning or settling a case.\n  Congress partially corrected the problem in 2004, when we passed, and \nPresident Bush signed, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Jobs \nAct. The Jobs Act allows an above-the-line deduction for amounts \nattributable to attorneys' fees and costs received by individuals based \non claims brought under certain statutes, including the False Claims \nAct, 1862(b)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act, or unlawful \ndiscrimination claims. Prior to enactment of the Jobs Act, the Internal \nRevenue Code already excluded from income awards arising out of claims \nrelating to physical injury and sickness. However, attorneys' fees paid \nin the pursuit and collection of punitive awards, awards for libel, \nslander, or other awards in cases not involving a physical injury or a \nclaim of discrimination are still not subtracted from gross income.\n  In 2005, the United States Supreme Court added further confusion to \nthe issue. In Commissioner v. Banks, 543 U.S. 426 (2005), the Court \nattempted to resolve a circuit split on the Federal income tax \ntreatment of attorneys' fees. In an 8-0 opinion, the Court held that \nwhen a litigant's recovery constitutes income, the litigant's income \nincludes the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney as a \ncontingent fee. Consequently, for those claims not excluded from gross \nincome in the Jobs Act, attorneys' fees are subjected to double \ntaxation; subjected to a reduction equal to two percent of the \nindividual's adjusted gross income when listed as a miscellaneous \nitemized deduction; and subjected to a complete disallowance when \ncalculating the alternative minimum tax.\n  My legislation corrects the problem by permitting taxpayers to \nsubtract from their taxable gross income the attorneys' fees and court \ncosts paid by the taxpayer in connection with an award or settlement of \nmonetary damages in all civil claims. The legislation would ensure more \nuniform treatment of contingency fees in all types of litigation, not \njust the limited categories of litigation as specified in the Jobs Act. \nImportantly, this change does not affect the requirement that attorneys \npay federal income tax on legal fees they receive. The legislation does \neliminate the inequity of the client also paying taxes on attorneys' \nfees despite not receiving the funds under the terms of a contingency \nfee contract.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to bring fairness \nto the tax code.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ABOVE-THE-LINE DEDUCTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND \n                   COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH CIVIL CLAIM AWARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (20) of section 62(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(20) Costs involving civil cases.--Any deduction \n     allowable under this chapter for attorney fees and court \n     costs paid by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer in connection \n     with any action involving a civil claim. The preceding \n     sentence shall not apply to any deduction in excess of the \n     amount includible in the taxpayer's gross income for the \n     taxable year on account of a judgment or settlement (whether \n     by suit or agreement and whether as lump sum or periodic \n     payments) resulting from such claim.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 62 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking subsection (e).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to fees and costs paid after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act with respect to any judgment or \n     settlement occurring after such date.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter in the \nintroduction of two bills, S. 437 and S. 440, that will correct \ninconsistencies and provide fairness to lawyers and their clients under \nthe Federal Tax Code.\n  Currently, attorneys who take on contingency fee cases, and advance \ntheir clients funds for court costs, witnesses, or other expenses, \ncannot deduct these expenses as ordinary business expenses at the time \nthey are made. Instead, attorneys who advance these costs may not take \na deduction until the case for which they are advanced is resolved. In \nmost cases this is a timeframe of several years. This results in an \nattorney carrying the burden of these costs from year to year until the \ncase is resolved. For many small law firms or solo practitioners, this \nis a significant burden.\n  Where attorneys are advancing costs to clients so that those clients \nmay pursue their rights in court, they deserve to be treated as any \nother small business owner. This disparate treatment is inequitable and \ncorrecting it will make legal representation more easily provided by \nattorneys and more available to clients.\n  The other bill we introduce today helps clients who have been awarded \nfunds through a contingency fee arrangement. Under current tax law, \npunitive damages awards and awards to a plaintiff resulting from \ncertain claims are subject to Federal taxation for the entire amount of \nthe award, even if the plaintiff then uses a portion to satisfy a \ncontingency fee agreement. The result is that the portion of an award \nto a plaintiff in a contingency fee arrangement that then goes to an \nattorney is taxed twice--once through the plaintiff and again through \nthe attorney.\n  This legislation will allow a plaintiff who has recovered an award to \ntake an above the line deduction for the portion of his or her award \nthat will be transmitted to the attorney who provided the \nrepresentation. This is a commonsense solution and where an individual \nhas suffered an injury and will rely on his or her award it is sound \npolicy to reduce this unnecessary and duplicative tax burden.\n  Neither of these bills gives any special treatment to attorneys or \ntheir clients. Rather, in combination, they will help attorneys provide \nmore representation to clients who by virtue of their financial or \nother circumstances must enter a contingency fee arrangement, and will \nallow a greater amount of funds recovered to be put to use by the \nindividual for whose benefit they were awarded.\n  I thank Senator Specter for introducing this legislation and I hope \nall Senators will join us in supporting these sensible corrections to \nour Tax Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 442. A bill to impose a limitation on lifetime aggregate limits \nimposed by health plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I join today with Senator Dorgan to address \nthe growing problem of beneficiaries who exceed their lifetime cap on \nhealth care coverage. Today, many Americans responsibly purchase a \nhealth plan to cover themselves and their loved ones in case of \nillness. Tragically, some of these individuals become stricken by \nillness that is extremely expensive to treat, and too often exceeds \ntheir policy's lifetime cap provision. After doing all you can to act \nresponsibly and avoid becoming a burden on society, an overly \nrestrictive lifetime cap on benefits can cause one to go bankrupt--and \nultimately shifts costs to public programs such as Medicaid.\n  We have seen that even beneficiaries who acquire health insurance \nwith seemingly hefty lifetime caps have found that the high cost of \nmodern treatments--combined with medical inflation which exceeds the \nconsumer price index by two to threefold--has greatly deflated the true \nvalue of the lifetime cap. The legislation offered today addresses this \nissue by setting a higher minimum cap. It has been estimated the cost \nof this improved protection--spread over many insurance purchasers--\nwill increase premiums by approximately $8 per year. This reinforces \nthe principle of insurance--spreading high risks over many purchasers--\nin order to assure adequate protection should a protracted and \nexpensive illness befall an individual. This bill will also assure that \ncosts are not inappropriately shifted onto the government programs, \nsuch as Medicaid--where taxpayers will feel the brunt of financial \nresponsibility for costly treatment.\n  As I work with my colleagues and the administration to grapple with \nhow to make health care more affordable to the millions of Americans \nstruggling to pay their premiums, coinsurance and copays--raising the \nfloor on lifetime caps will provide the immediate financial relief to \nfamilies so that they will have access to health care should a costly, \nchronic disease occur.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 443.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Hoh Indian Reservation, located along the Hoh River \n     and the Pacific Ocean in a remote section of Jefferson \n     County, Washington, is the homeland of the Hoh Indian Tribe, \n     a federally recognized Indian tribe.\n       (2) Established by Executive Order in 1893, the Reservation \n     is approximately one square mile, but its habitable acreage \n     has been reduced over time due to storm surges, repeated \n     flooding and erosion, and lack of river dredging.\n       (3) Due to its location along the river and ocean and \n     frequent torrential rains, 90 percent of the Reservation is \n     located within a flood zone and, in fact, has flooded \n     repeatedly over the last five years. In addition, 100 percent \n     of the Reservation is within a tsunami zone, leaving most of \n     the Reservation unfit for safe occupation.\n       (4) The Tribe has repeatedly suffered from serious flood \n     and wind damage to homes, tribal buildings, and utility \n     infrastructure that have caused significant damage and \n     resulted in critical safety and environmental hazards.\n       (5) Federal agencies such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency have limited authority to \n     assist the Tribe with housing and other improvements and \n     services due to the dangerous and unsustainable location of \n     the Reservation.\n       (6) The Tribe has purchased from private owners near the \n     Reservation approximately 260 acres of land in order to move \n     key infrastructure out of the flood zone.\n       (7) In addition, the State of Washington's Department of \n     Natural Resources has transferred ownership of 160 acres of \n     land to the Tribe.\n       (8) An approximately 37 acre parcel of logged land, \n     administered by the National Park Service, lies between the \n     current Reservation land and those lands acquired by the \n     Tribe, and the only road accessing the Reservation crosses \n     this parcel.\n       (9) Together, the lands described in paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 \n     would constitute a contiguous parcel for the Reservation and \n     would\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\n     create a safe area for members of the Tribe to live and \n     rebuild their community.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act----\n       (1) the term ``Federal land'' mean the Federal lands \n     described in section 4(c)(2);\n       (2) the term ``Reservation'' means the reservation of the \n     Hoh Indian Tribe;\n       (3) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior; and\n       (4) the term ``Tribe'' means the Hoh Indian Tribe, a \n     federally recognized Indian tribe.\n\n     SEC. 4. TRANSFER OF LANDS TO BE HELD IN TRUST AS PART OF THE \n                   TRIBE'S RESERVATION; PLACEMENT OF OTHER LAND \n                   INTO TRUST.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall transfer to the Tribe \n     all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to \n     the Federal land. Such land shall be held in trust by the \n     United States for the benefit of the Tribe. Such land shall \n     be excluded from the boundaries of Olympic National Park. At \n     the request of the Tribe, at the time of transfer of the \n     Federal land, the Secretary shall also place into trust for \n     the benefit of the Tribe the non-Federal land owned by the \n     Tribe and described in subsection (c)(1).\n       (b) Reservation.--Land taken into trust for the Tribe \n     pursuant to subsection (a) shall be part of the Reservation.\n       (c) Description of Lands.--The land to be transferred and \n     held in trust under subsection (a) is the land generally \n     depicted on the map titled ``H.R. ___ Hoh Indian Tribe Safe \n     Homelands Act'', and dated _________ and further described \n     as--\n       (1) the non-Federal land owned by the Hoh Tribe; and\n       (2) the Federal land administered by the National Park \n     Service, located in Section 20, Township 26N, Range 13W, W.M. \n     South of the Hoh River.\n       (d) Availability of Map.--Not later than 120 days after the \n     completion of the land transfer of Federal land under this \n     section, the Secretary shall make the map available to the \n     appropriate agency officials and congressional committees. \n     The map shall be available for public inspection in the \n     appropriate offices of the Secretary.\n       (e) Congressional Intent.--It is the intent of Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the condition of the Federal land at the time of the \n     transfer under this section should be preserved and \n     protected;\n       (2) that the natural environment existing on the Federal \n     land at the time of the transfer under this section should \n     not be altered, except as described in this Act; and\n       (3) the Tribe and the National Park Service shall work \n     cooperatively on issues of mutual concern related to this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. PRESERVATION OF EXISTING CONDITION OF FEDERAL LAND; \n                   TERMS OF CONSERVATION AND USE IN CONNECTION \n                   WITH LAND TRANSFER.\n\n       (a) Restrictions on Use.--The use of the Federal land \n     transferred pursuant to section 4 is subject to the following \n     conditions:\n       (1) No commercial, residential, industrial, or other \n     buildings or structures shall be placed on the Federal land \n     being transferred and placed into trust. The existing road \n     may be maintained or improved, but no major improvements or \n     road construction shall occur on the lands.\n       (2) In order to maintain its use as a natural wildlife \n     corridor and to provide for protection of existing resources, \n     no logging or hunting shall be allowed on the land.\n       (3) The Tribe may authorize tribal members to engage in \n     ceremonial and other treaty uses of these lands and existing \n     tribal treaty rights are not diminished by this Act.\n       (4) The Tribe shall survey the boundaries of the Federal \n     land and submit the survey to the National Park Service for \n     review and concurrence.\n       (b) Cooperative Efforts.--Congress urges the Secretary and \n     the Tribe to enter into written agreements on the following:\n       (1) Upon completion of the Tribe's proposed emergency fire \n     response building, Congress urges the parties to work toward \n     mutual aid agreements.\n       (2) The National Park Service and the Tribe shall work \n     collaboratively to provide opportunities for the public to \n     learn more about the culture and traditions of the Tribe.\n       (3) The land may be used for the development of a multi-\n     purpose, non-motorized trail from Highway 101 to the Pacific \n     Ocean. The parties agree to work cooperatively in the \n     development and placement of such trail.\n\n     SEC. 6. HOH INDIAN RESERVATION.\n\n       All lands taken into trust by the United States under this \n     Act shall be a part of the Hoh Indian Reservation.\n\n     SEC. 7. GAMING PROHIBITION.\n\n       No land taken into trust for the benefit of the Hoh Indian \n     Tribe under this Act shall be considered Indian lands for the \n     purpose of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 \n     et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Carper, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 445. A bill to provide appropriate protection to attorney-client \nprivileged communications and attorney work product; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to reintroduce \nthe Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2009, which is nearly \nidentical to S. 3217, a bill I introduced in July of 2008 under the \nsame name. This legislation continues to address the Department of \nJustice's corporate prosecution guidelines. Those guidelines, last \nrevised by Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip in August 2008, erode the \nattorney-client relationship by allowing prosecutors to continue \nconsidering the provision of privileged information in order for \ncorporations to receive cooperation credit.\n  To their credit, the Filip guidelines preclude prosecutors from \nasking for privilege waivers in nearly all circumstances. However, as \nevidenced by the numerous versions of the Justice Department's \ncorporate prosecution guidelines over the past decade, the Filip \nreforms cannot be trusted to remain static. Moreover, unlike Federal \nlaw--which requires the assent of both houses and the President's \nsignature or a super-majority in Congress--the Filip guidelines are \nsubject to unilateral executive branch modification. Therefore, to \navoid a recurrence of prosecutorial abuses and attorney-client \nprivilege waiver demands, legislation is necessary.\n  Like my previous bills, this bill will protect the sanctity of the \nattorney-client relationship by statutorily prohibiting Federal \nprosecutors and investigators across the executive branch from \nrequesting waiver of attorney-client privilege and attorney work \nproduct protections in corporate investigations. The bill would \nsimilarly prohibit the government from conditioning charging decisions \nor any adverse treatment on an organization's payment of employee legal \nfees, invocation of the attorney-client privilege, or agreement to a \njoint defense agreement.\n  The bill makes many subtle improvements over earlier iterations, \nincluding defining ``organization'' to make clear that continuing \ncriminal enterprises and terrorist organizations will not benefit from \nthe bill's protections. The bill also clarifies language that the \nDepartment of Justice had previously criticized as ambiguous. The bill \nfurther makes clear in its findings that its prohibition on informal \nprivilege waiver demands is far from unprecedented. The bill states: \n``Congress recognized that law enforcement can effectively investigate \nwithout attorney-client privileged information when it banned Attorney \nGeneral demands for privileged materials in the Racketeer Influenced \nand Corrupt Organizations Act. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1968(c)(2).''\n  Though an improvement over past guidelines, there is no need to wait \nto see how the Filip guidelines will operate in practice. There is \nsimilarly no need to wait for another Department of Justice or \nexecutive branch reform that will likely fall short and become the \nsixth policy in the last 10 years. Any such internal reform may prove \nfleeting and might not address the privilege waiver policies of other \ngovernment agencies that refer matters to the Department of Justice, \nthus allowing in through the window what isn't allowed through the \ndoor.\n  As I said when I introduced my first bill on this subject, the right \nto counsel is too important to be passed over for prosecutorial \nconvenience or Executive Branch whimsy. It has been engrained in \nAmerican jurisprudence since the 18th century when the Bill of Rights \nwas adopted. The 6th Amendment is a fundamental right afforded to \nindividuals charged with a crime and guarantees proper representation \nby counsel throughout a prosecution. However, the right to counsel is \nlargely ineffective unless the confidential communications made by a \nclient to his or her lawyer are protected by law. As the Supreme Court \nobserved in Upjohn Co. v. United States, ``the attorney-client \nprivilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential \ncommunications known to the common law.'' When the Upjohn Court \naffirmed that attorney-client privilege protections apply to corporate \ninternal legal dialogue, the Court manifested in the law the importance \nof the attorney-client privilege in encouraging full and frank \ncommunication between attorneys and their clients, as well as the \nbroader public interests the privilege serves in fostering the \nobservance of law and the administration of justice. The Upjohn Court \nalso made clear that the value of legal advice and advocacy depends on \nthe lawyer having been fully informed by the client.\n  In addition to the importance of the right to counsel, it is also \nfundamental\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\nthat the Government has the burden of investigating and proving its own \ncase. Privilege waiver tends to transfer this burden to the \norganization under investigation. As a former prosecutor, I am well \naware of the enormous power and tools a prosecutor has at his or her \ndisposal. The prosecutor has enough power without the coercive tools of \nthe privilege waiver, whether that waiver policy is embodied in the \nHolder, Thompson, McCallum, McNulty, or Filip memorandum.\n  As in my prior bills designed to protect the attorney-client \nprivilege, this bill amends title 18 of the United States Code by \nadding a new section, Sec. 3014, that would prohibit any agent or \nattorney of the U.S. Government in any criminal or civil case to demand \nor request the disclosure of any communication protected by the \nattorney-client privilege or attorney work product. The bill would also \nprohibit government lawyers and agents from basing any charge or \nadverse treatment on whether an organization pays attorneys' fees for \nits employees or signs a joint defense agreement.\n  This legislation is needed to ensure that constitutional protections \nof the attorney-client relationship are preserved in Federal \nprosecutions and investigations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 446. A bill to permit the televising of Supreme Court proceedings; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, once more I seek recognition to introduce \nlegislation that will give the public greater access to our Supreme \nCourt. This bill requires the High Court to permit television coverage \nof its open sessions unless it decides by a majority vote of the \nJustices that allowing such coverage in a particular case would violate \nthe due process rights of one or more of the parties involved in the \nmatter.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to open the Supreme Court doors so \nthat more Americans can see the process by which the Court reaches \ncritical decisions of law that affect this country and everyday \nAmericans. The Supreme Court makes pronouncements on Constitutional and \nFederal law that have a direct impact on the rights of Americans. Those \nrights would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments \nof the Court so that the public can see and hear the issues presented \nto the Court. With this information, the public would have insight into \nkey issues and be better equipped to understand the impact of and \nreasons for the Court's decisions.\n  In a very fundamental sense, televising the Supreme Court has been \nimplicitly recognized--perhaps even sanctioned--in a 1980 decision by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States entitled Richmond Newspapers v. \nVirginia. In this case, the Court noted that a public trial belongs not \nonly to the accused but to the public and the press as well and \nrecognized that people now acquire information on court procedures \nchiefly through the print and electronic media.\n  That decision, in referencing the electronic media, appears to \nanticipate televising court proceedings, although I do not mean to \nsuggest that the Supreme Court is in agreement with this legislation. I \nshould note that the Court could, on its own initiative, televise its \nproceedings but has chosen not to do so. This presents, in my view, the \nnecessity for legislating on this subject.\n  When I argued the case of the Navy Yard, Dalton v. Specter, back in \n1994, the Court proceedings were illustrated by an artist's drawings--\nsome of which now hang in my office. Today, the public gets a \nsubstantial portion, if not most, of its information from television \nand the internet. While many court proceedings are broadcast routinely \non television, the public has little access to the most important and \nhighest court in this country. Although the internet has made the \nCourt's transcripts, and even more recently, audio recordings, more \nwidely accessible, the public is still deprived of the real time \ntransmission of audio and video feeds from the Court. I believe it is \nvital for the public to see, as well as to hear, the arguments made \nbefore the Court and the interplay among the justices. I think the \nAmerican people will gain a greater respect for the way in which our \nHigh Court functions if they are able to see oral arguments.\n  Justice Felix Frankfurter perhaps anticipated the day when Supreme \nCourt arguments would be televised when he said that he longed for a \nday when: ``The news media would cover the Supreme Court as thoroughly \nas it did the World Series, since the public confidence in the \njudiciary hinges on the public's perception of it, and that perception \nnecessarily hinges on the media's portrayal of the legal system.''\n\n  When I spoke in favor of this legislation in September of 2000, I \nsaid, ``I do not expect a rush to judgment on this very complex \nproposition, but I do believe the day will come when the Supreme Court \nof the United States will be televised. That day will come, and it will \nbe decisively in the public interest so the public will know the \nmagnitude of what the Court is deciding and its role in our democratic \nprocess.'' I have continued to reiterate those sentiments in September \nof 2005 and in January of 2007 when I re-introduced identical bills. \nToday, I continue to support this legislation because I believe that it \nis crucial to the public's awareness of Supreme Court proceedings and \ntheir impact on the daily lives of all Americans.\n  I pause to note that it was not until 1955 that the Supreme Court, \nunder the leadership of Chief Justice Warren, first began permitting \naudio recordings of oral arguments. Between 1955 and 1993, there were \napparently over 5,000 recorded arguments before the Supreme Court. That \nroughly translates to an average of about 132 arguments annually. But \naudio recordings are simply ill suited to capture the nuance of oral \narguments and the sustained attention of the American citizenry. Nor is \nit any response that people who wish to see open sessions of the \nSupreme Court should come to the Capital and attend oral arguments. \nFor, according to one source: ``Several million people each year visit \nWashington, D.C., and many thousands tour the White House and the \nCapitol. But few have the chance to sit in the Supreme Court chamber \nand witness an entire oral argument. Most tourists are given just three \nminutes before they are shuttled out and a new group shuttled in. In \ncases that attract headlines, seats for the public are scarce and \nwaiting lines are long. And the Court sits in open session less than \ntwo hundred hours each year. Television cameras and radio microphones \nare still banned from the chamber, and only a few hundred people at \nmost can actually witness oral arguments. Protected by a marble wall \nfrom public access, the Supreme Court has long been the least \nunderstood of the three branches of our Federal Government.''\n  In light of the increasing public desire for information, it seems \nuntenable to continue excluding cameras from the courtroom of the \nNation's highest court. As one legal commentator observes: ``An \neffective and legitimate way to satisfy America's curiosity about the \nSupreme Court's holdings, Justices, and modus operandi is to permit \nbroadcast coverage of oral arguments and decision announcements from \nthe courtroom itself.''\n  Televised court proceedings better enable the public to understand \nthe role of the Supreme Court and its impact on the key decisions of \nthe day. Not only has the Supreme Court invalidated Congressional \ndecisions where there was, in the views of many, simply a difference of \nopinion as to what is preferable public policy, but the Court \ndetermines novel issues such as whether AIDS is a disability under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, whether Congress can ban obscenity \nfrom the Internet, and whether states can impose term limits upon \nmembers of Congress. The current Court, like its predecessors, hands \ndown decisions which vitally affect the lives and liberties of all \nAmericans. Since the Court's historic 1803 decision, Marbury v. \nMadison, the Supreme Court has the final authority on issues of \nenormous importance from birth to death. In Roe v. Wade, 1973, the \nCourt affirmed a Constitutional right to abortion in this country and \nstruck down state statutes banning or severely restricting abortion \nduring the first two trimesters on the grounds that they violated a \nright to privacy inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\nIn the case of Washington v. Glucksberg, 1997, the court refused to \ncreate a similar right to assisted suicide. Here the Court held that \nthe Due Process Clause does not recognize a liberty interest that \nincludes a right to commit suicide with another's assistance.\n\n  In the Seventies, the Court first struck down then upheld state \nstatutes imposing the death penalty for certain crimes. In Furman v. \nGeorgia, 1972, the Court struck down Georgia's death penalty statute \nunder the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment \nand stated that no death penalty law could pass constitutional muster \nunless it took aggravating and mitigating circumstances into account. \nThis decision led Georgia and many States to amend their death penalty \nstatutes and, four years later, in Gregg v. Georgia, 1976, the Supreme \nCourt upheld Georgia's amended death penalty statute.\n  Over the years, the Court has also played a major role in issues of \nwar and peace. In its opinion in Scott v. Sandford, 1857--better known \nas the Dred Scott decision--the Supreme Court held that Dred Scott, a \nslave who had been taken into ``free'' territory by his owner, was \nnevertheless still a slave.\n  The Court further held that Congress lacked the power to abolish \nslavery in certain territories, thereby invalidating the careful \nbalance that had been worked out between the North and the South on the \nissue. Historians have noted that this opinion fanned the flames that \nled to the Civil War.\n  The Supreme Court has also ensured adherence to the Constitution \nduring more recent conflicts. Prominent opponents of the Vietnam War \nrepeatedly petitioned the Court to declare the Presidential action \nunconstitutional on the grounds that Congress had never given the \nPresident a declaration of war. The Court decided to leave this \nconflict in the political arena and repeatedly refused to grant writs \nof certiorari to hear these cases. This prompted Justice Douglas, \nsometimes accompanied by Justices Stewart and Harlan, to take the \nunusual step of writing lengthy dissents to the denials of cert.\n  In New York Times Co. v. United States, 1971--the so called \n``Pentagon Papers'' case--the Court refused to grant the government \nprior restraint to prevent the New York Times from publishing leaked \nDefense Department documents which revealed damaging information about \nthe Johnson Administration and the war effort. The publication of these \ndocuments by the New York Times is believed to have helped move public \nopinion against the war.\n  In its landmark civil rights opinions, the Supreme Court took the \nlead in effecting needed social change, helping us to address \nfundamental questions about our society in the courts rather than in \nthe streets. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court struck down the \nprinciple of ``separate but equal'' education for blacks and whites and \nintegrated public education in this country. This case was then \nfollowed by a series of civil rights cases which enforced the concept \nof integration and full equality for all citizens of this country, \nincluding Gamer v. Louisiana, 1961, Burton v. Wilmington Parking \nAuthority, 1961, and Peterson v. City of Greenville, 1963.\n\n  In recent years Marbury, Dred Scott, Furman, New York Times, and Roe, \nfamiliar names in the lexicon of lawyerly discussions concerning \nwatershed Supreme Court precedents, have been joined with similarly \nimportant cases like Hamdi, Rasul, Roper, and Boumediene--all cases \nthat affect fundamental individual rights. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 2004, \nthe Court concluded that although Congress authorized the detention of \ncombatants, due process demands that a citizen held in the United \nStates as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to \ncontest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral \ndecisionmaker. The Court reaffirmed the nation's commitment to \nconstitutional principles even during times of war and uncertainty. \nSimilarly, in Rasul v. Bush, 2004, the Court held that the Federal \nhabeas statute gave district courts jurisdiction to hear challenges of \naliens held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in the U.S. War on Terrorism. In \nRoper v. Simmons, a 2005 case, the Court held that executions of \nindividuals who were under 18 years of age at the time of their capital \ncrimes is prohibited by Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. In Boumediene \nv. Bush, 2008, the Court held that, subsequent to Hamdan v. Rumsfeld \nand regardless of Congress' attempts to strip federal courts of \njurisdiction to consider pending habeas corpus petitions from \nGuantanamo detainees, the detainees nonetheless were not barred from \nseeking the writ and procedures under the Detainee Treatment Act were \nnot an adequate substitute for it.\n  When deciding issues of such great national import, the Supreme Court \nis rarely unanimous. In fact, a large number of seminal Supreme Court \ndecisions, such as Boumediene, have been reached through a vote of 5-4. \nSuch a close margin reveals that these decisions are far from foregone \nconclusions distilled from the meaning of the Constitution, reason and \nthe application of legal precedents. On the contrary, these major \nSupreme Court opinions embody critical decisions reached on the basis \nof the preferences and views of each individual justice. In a case that \nis decided by a vote of 5-4, an individual justice has the power by his \nor her vote to change the law of the land.\n  Since the beginning of its October 2005 term when Chief Justice \nRoberts first began hearing cases, the Supreme Court has issued 45 \ndecisions with a 5-4 split, not including the current October 2008 \nterm, in which I understand there are additional 5-4 decisions within \nthe few cases that have already been decided. It has also issued six 5-\n3 decisions in which one justice recused. Finally, it has issued a rare \n5-2 decision in which Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito took no \npart, and in the October 2007 term, two 4-4 ties. In sum, since the \nbeginning of its October 2005 term and not counting the current term, \nthe Supreme Court has issued 52 decisions establishing the law of the \nland in which only 5 justices explicitly concurred. Many of these \nnarrow majorities occur in decisions involving the Court's \ninterpretation of our Constitution--a sometimes divisive endeavor on \nthe Court. I will not discuss all 52 thinly decided cases but will \ndescribe a few to illustrate my point about the importance of the Court \nand its decisions in the lives of Americans.\n  The first 5-4 split decision, decided on January 11, 2006, was Brown \nv. Sanders. In this case the Court considered ``the circumstances in \nwhich an invalidated sentencing factor will render a death sentence \nunconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the \naggravation scale in the jury's weighing process.'' A majority of the \nCourt held that henceforth in death penalty cases, an invalidated \nsentencing factor will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason \nof its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale unless one \nof the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give \naggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances. The majority \nopinion was authored by Justice Scalia and joined by Chief Justice \nRoberts and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas. Justice Stevens \nfiled a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter joined. Similarly, \nJustice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg \njoined.\n\n  In November 2006, the Supreme Court decided Ayers v. Belmontes, a \ncapital murder case in which the Belmontes contended that California \nlaw and the trial court's instructions precluded the jury from \nconsidering his forward looking mitigation evidence suggesting he could \nlead a constructive life while incarcerated. In Ayers the Supreme Court \nfound the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the jury was precluded by \njury instructions from considering mitigation evidence. Justice Kennedy \nauthored the majority opinion while Justice Stevens wrote a dissent \njoined by three other justices.\n  Other 5-4 split decisions since October 2005 include United States v. \nGonzalez-Lopez, concerning whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right \nto counsel was violated when a district court refused to grant his paid \nlawyer permission to represent him based upon some past ethical \nviolation by the lawyer, June 26, 2006; LULAC v. Perry, deciding \nwhether the 2004 Texas redistricting violated provisions of the Voting \nRights Act, June 28, 2006; Kansas v. Marsh, concerning the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments in a capital murder case in which the defense \nargued that a Kansas statute established\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\nan unconstitutional presumption in favor of the death sentence when \naggravating and mitigating factors were in equipoise, April 25, 2006; \nClark v. Arizona, a capital murder case involving the constitutionality \nof an Arizona Supreme Court precedent governing the admissibility of \nevidence to support an insanity defense, June 29, 2006; Garcetti v. \nCeballos, a case holding that when public employees make statements \npursuant to their official duties they are not speaking as citizens for \nFirst Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their \ncommunications from employer discipline, May 30, 2006; and District of \nColumbia v. Heller, June 26, 2008, which found that Washington, D.C.'s \ngun laws were unconstitutionally restrictive of rights afforded under \nthe Second Amendment.\n  The justices have split 5-3 six times since October 2005.\n  In Georgia v. Randolph, March 22, 2006, a 5-3 majority of the Supreme \nCourt held that a physically present co-occupant's stated refusal to \npermit a warrantless entry and search rendered the search unreasonable \nand invalid as to that occupant. Justice Souter authored the majority \nopinion. Justice Stevens filed a concurring opinion as did Justice \nBreyer. The Chief Justice authored a dissent joined by Justice Scalia. \nMoreover, Justice Scalia issued his own dissent as did Justice Thomas. \nIn Randolph, there were six opinions in all from a Court that only has \nnine justices. One can only imagine the spirited debate and interplay \nof ideas, facial expressions and gestures that occurred in oral \narguments. Audio recordings are simply inadequate to capture all of the \nnuance that only cameras could capture and convey.\n  In House v. Bell, a 5-3 opinion authored by Justice Kennedy, June 12, \n2006, the Supreme Court held that because House had made the stringent \nshowing required by the actual innocence exception to judicially-\nestablished procedural default rules, he could challenge his conviction \neven after exhausting his regular appeals. Justice Alito took no part \nin considering or deciding the House case. It bears noting, however, \nthat if one justice had been on the other side of this decision it \nwould have resulted in a 4-4 tie and, ultimately, led to affirming the \nlower court's denial of House's post-conviction habeas petitions due to \na procedural default.\n  In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, a 5-3 decision in which Chief Justice Roberts \ntook no part, the Supreme Court held that Hamdan could challenge his \ndetention and the jurisdiction of the President's military commissions \nto try him despite recent enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act. A \nthin majority of the justices supported the decision despite knowledge \nthat the DTA explicitly provides ``no court . . . shall have \njurisdiction to hear or consider . . . an application for . . . habeas \ncorpus filed by . . . an alien detained . . . at Guantanamo Bay.'' In \ndeciding the merits, the Court went on to hold that the President \nlacked authority to establish a military commission to try Hamdan or \nothers without enabling legislation passed by both houses of Congress \nand enacted into law. This case was one of a handful of recent cases in \nwhich the Supreme Court released audiotapes of oral arguments almost \nimmediately after they occurred. Yet it would have been vastly \npreferable to watch the parties' advocates grapple with the legal \nissues as the justices peppered them with jurisdictional, \nconstitutional and merits-related questions from the High Court's \nbench.\n  In another fascinating 5-3 case, Jones v. Flowers, April 26, 2006, \nthe Supreme Court considered whether, when notice of a tax sale is \nmailed to the owner and returned undelivered, the government must take \nadditional reasonable steps to provide notice before taking the owner's \nproperty. In an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court held that \nwhere the Arkansas Commissioner of State Lands had mailed Jones a \ncertified letter and it had been returned unclaimed, the Commissioner \nhad to take additional reasonable steps to provide Jones notice. \nJustices Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy dissented and Justice Alito took no \npart in the decision.\n  Though Jones v. Flowers involved the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment, not the Takings Clause of Fifth Amendment, one \ncould draw interesting analogies to the Court's controversial 2005 \ndecision in Kelo v. City of New London. In Kelo, a majority of the \njustices held that a city's exercise of eminent domain power in \nfurtherance of a privately initiated economic development plan \nsatisfied the Constitution's Fifth Amendment ``public use'' requirement \ndespite the absence of any blight. Four justices dissented in Kelo and \npublic opinion turned sharply against the decision immediately after it \nwas issued.\n  It's possible, though merely speculative, that the public ire aimed \nat Kelo informed what became a majority of justices in Jones v. \nFlowers. In a passage by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court notes, ``when \na letter is returned by the post office, the sender will ordinarily \nattempt to resend it, if it is practicable to do so. This is especially \ntrue when, as here, the subject matter of the letter concerns such an \nimportant and irreversible prospect as the loss of a house.''\n  Not only lawyers but all homeowners could benefit from knowing how \nthe Court grapples with legal issues governing the rights to their \nhouses. My legislation creates the opportunity for all interested \nAmericans to watch the Court in action in cases like these. From his \nperch on the High Court one justice has been heard to contend that most \nAmericans could care less about the arcane legal issues argued before \nthe Court. But as elected representatives of the people we must \nendeavor to view America from a bottoms-up, rather than a top-down \nperspective.\n  Regardless of one's view concerning the merits of these decisions, it \nis clear that they frequently have a profound effect on the interplay \nbetween the government, on the one hand, and the individual on the \nother. So, it is with these watershed decisions in mind that I \nintroduce legislation designed to make the Supreme Court less esoteric \nand more accessible to common men and women who are so clearly affected \nby its decisions.\n  Given the enormous significance of each vote cast by each justice on \nthe Supreme Court, televising the proceedings of the Supreme Court will \nallow sunlight to shine brightly on these proceedings and ensure \ngreater public awareness and scrutiny.\n  In a democracy, the workings of the government at all levels should \nbe open to public view. With respect to oral arguments, the more \nopenness and the more real the opportunity for public observation the \ngreater the understanding and trust. As the Supreme Court observed in \nthe 1986 case of Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, ``People in an \nopen society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but \nit is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from \nobserving.''\n  It was in this spirit that the House of Representatives opened its \ndeliberations to meaningful public observation by allowing C-SPAN to \nbegin televising debates in the House chamber in 1979. The Senate \nfollowed the House's lead in 1986 by voting to allow television \ncoverage of the Senate floor.\n  Beyond this general policy preference for openness, however, there is \na strong argument that the Constitution requires that television \ncameras be permitted in the Supreme Court.\n  It is well established that the Constitution guarantees access to \njudicial proceedings to the press and the public. In 1980, the Supreme \nCourt relied on this tradition when it held in Richmond Newspapers v. \nVirginia that the right of a public trial belongs not just to the \naccused, but to the public and the press as well. The Court noted that \nsuch openness has ``long been recognized as an indisputable attribute \nof an Anglo-American trial.''\n  Recognizing that in modern society most people cannot physically \nattend trials, the Court specifically addressed the need for access by \nmembers of the media: ``Instead of acquiring information about trials \nby first hand observation or by word of mouth from those who attended, \npeople now acquire it chiefly through the print and electronic media. \nIn a sense, this validates the media claim of acting as surrogates for \nthe public. [Media presence} contributes to public understanding of the \nrule of law and to comprehension of the functioning of the entire \ncriminal justice system.''\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\n  To be sure, a strong argument can be made that forbidding television \ncameras in the court, while permitting access to print and other media, \nconstitutes an impermissible discrimination against one type of media \nover another. In recent years, the Supreme Court and lower courts have \nrepeatedly held that differential treatment of different media is \nimpermissible under the First Amendment absent an overriding \ngovernmental interest. For example, in 1983 the Court invalidated \ndiscriminatory tax schemes imposed only upon certain types of media in \nMinneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue. In \nthe 1977 case of ABC v. Cuomo, the Second Circuit rejected the \ncontention by the two candidates for mayor of New York that they could \nexclude some members of the media from their campaign headquarters by \nproviding access through invitation only. The Court wrote that: ``Once \nthere is a public function, public comment, and participation by some \nof the media, the First Amendment requires equal access to all of the \nmedia or the rights of the First Amendment would no longer be \ntenable.''\n  However, in the 1965 case of Estes v. Texas, the Supreme Court \nrejected the argument that the denial of television coverage of trials \nviolates the equal protection clause. In the same opinion, the Court \nheld that the presence of television cameras in the Court had violated \na Texas defendant's right to due process. Subsequent opinions have cast \nserious doubt upon the continuing relevance of both prongs of the Estes \nopinion.\n  In its 1981 opinion in Chandler v. Florida, the court recognized that \nEstes must be read narrowly in light of the state of television \ntechnology at that time. The television coverage of Estes' 1962 trial \nrequired cumbersome equipment, numerous additional microphones, yards \nof new cables, distracting lighting, and numerous technicians present \nin the courtroom. In contrast, the court noted, television coverage in \n1980 can be achieved through the presence of one or two discreetly \nplaced cameras without making any perceptible change in the atmosphere \nof the courtroom. Accordingly, the Court held that, despite Estes, the \npresence of television cameras in a Florida trial was not a violation \nof the rights of the defendants in that case. By the same logic, the \nholding in Estes that exclusion of television cameras from the courts \ndid not violate the equal protection clause must be revisited in light \nof the dramatically different nature of television coverage today.\n  Given the strength of these arguments, it is not surprising that over \nthe last two decades there has been a rapidly growing acceptance of \ncameras in American courtrooms which has reached almost every court \nexcept for the Supreme Court itself.\n  On September 6, 2000, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts held a hearing titled \n``Allowing Cameras and Electronic Media in the Courtroom.'' The primary \nfocus of the hearing was Senate bill S. 721, legislation introduced by \nSenators Grassley and Schumer that would give Federal judges the \ndiscretion to allow television coverage of court proceedings. One of \nthe witnesses at the hearing, the late Judge Edward R. Becker, then-\nChief Judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, spoke in \nopposition to the legislation and the presence of television cameras in \nthe courtroom. The remaining five witnesses, however, including a \nFederal judge, a State judge, a law professor and other legal experts, \nall testified in favor of the legislation. They argued that cameras in \nthe courts would not disrupt proceedings but would provide the kind of \naccountability and access that is fundamental to our system of \ngovernment.\n\n  On November 9, 2005, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing to \naddress whether Federal court proceedings should be televised generally \nand to consider S. 1768, my earlier version of this bill, and S. 829, \nSenator Grassley's ``Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2005.'' During \nthe November 9 hearing, most witnesses spoke favorably of cameras in \nthe courts, particularly at the appellate level. Among the witnesses \nfavorably disposed toward the cameras were Peter Irons, author of May \nIt Please the Court, Seth Berlin, a First Amendment expert at a local \nfirm, Brian Lamb, founder of C-SPAN, Henry Schleif of Court TV \nNetworks, and Barbara Cochran of the Radio-Television News Directors \nAssociation and Foundation.\n  The notable exception was the Honorable Judge Jan DuBois of the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania, who testified on behalf of the \nJudicial Conference. Judge DuBois warned of problems particularly at \nthe trial level, where witnesses who appear uncomfortable because of \ncameras might seem less credible to jurors. I note, however, that \nappellate courts do not appear susceptible to this criticism because \nthere are no witnesses or jurors present for appellate arguments.\n  The Judiciary Committee considered and passed both bills on March 30, \n2006. The Committee vote to report S. 1768 was 12-6, and the bill was \nplaced on the Senate Legislative Calendar. Unfortunately, due to the \npress of other business neither bill was allotted time on the Senate \nFloor. Again, in the 110th Congress, I introduced this legislation, and \nit was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 11-7.\n  During their confirmation hearings over the past two years, Chief \nJustice John Roberts stated he would keep an open mind on the issue and \nJustice Alito stated that as a circuit judge he unsuccessfully voted, \nin the minority, to permit televised open proceedings in the Third \nCircuit. I applaud the fact the new Chief Justice has taken steps to \nmake the Court more open and to ensure the timely publication of audio \nrecordings of the arguments as well as the written transcripts.\n  In my judgment, Congress, with the concurrence of the President, or \noverriding his veto, has the authority to require the Supreme Court to \ntelevise its proceedings. Such a conclusion is not free from doubt and \nis highly likely to be tested with the Supreme Court, as usual, having \nthe final word. As I see it, there is clearly no constitutional \nprohibition against such legislation.\n  Article 3 of the Constitution states that the judicial power of the \nUnited States shall be vested ``in one Supreme Court and such inferior \nCourts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'' \nWhile the Constitution specifically creates the Supreme Court, it left \nit to Congress to determine how the Court would operate. For example, \nit was Congress that fixed the number of justices on the Supreme Court \nat nine. Likewise, it was Congress that decided that any six of these \njustices are sufficient to constitute a quorum of the Court. It was \nCongress that decided that the term of the Court shall commence on the \nfirst Monday in October of each year, and it was Congress that \ndetermined the procedures to be followed whenever the Chief Justice is \nunable to perform the duties of his office.\n  Beyond such basic structural and operational matters, Congress also \ncontrols more substantive aspects of the Supreme Court. Most \nimportantly, it is Congress that in effect determines the appellate \njurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the Constitution itself \nsets out the original jurisdiction of the Court, it provides that \nappellate jurisdiction exists ``with such exceptions and under such \nregulations as the Congress shall make.''\n  Some objections have been raised to televised proceedings of the \nSupreme Court on the ground that it would subject justices to undue \nsecurity risks. My own view is such concerns are vastly overstated. \nWell-known members of Congress walk on a regular basis in public view \nin the Capitol complex. Other very well-known personalities, \npresidents, vice presidents, cabinet officers, all are on public view \nwith even incumbent presidents exposed to risks as they mingle with the \npublic. Such risks are minimal in my view given the relatively minor \nensure that Supreme Court justices would undertake through television \nappearances. Also, any concerns could be mitigated by focusing only on \nthe attorneys presenting arguments. There is no requirement that the \njustices permit the cameras to focus on the bench.\n  As I explained earlier, the Supreme Court could, of course, permit \ntelevision through its own rule but has decided not to do so. Congress \nshould be circumspect and even hesitant to impose a rule mandating the \ntelevising of Supreme Court proceedings and should do so only in the \nface of compelling public policy reasons. The Supreme Court has such a \ndominant role in key\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\ndecision-making functions that their proceedings ought to be better \nknown to the public; and, in the absence of Court rule, public policy \nwould be best served by enactment of legislation requiring the \ntelevising of Supreme Court proceedings.\n  This legislation embodies sound policy and will prove valuable to the \nall Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 447. A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to prevent \nexcessive price speculation with respect to energy and agricultural \ncommodities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the past couple of years energy prices \nhave taken the American people on an unpredictable, expensive, and \ndamaging roller coaster ride. In early 2007, a barrel of crude oil cost \nabout $50. Over the course of the year, the price rose steeply, nearly \ndoubling by the end of the year to almost $100 per barrel. Oil prices \ncontinued to soar through the first half of 2008, peaking at nearly \n$150 per barrel in July. Then, over the next few months, oil prices \ncrashed back down to $35 per barrel, a drop of over $110 per barrel.\n  These huge price swings can't be explained by simple changes in \nsupply and demand. Even taking into account the recession now plaguing \nour country and the world economy, many market analysts believe that it \nwas a stampede of speculators into the crude oil futures market that \nfirst drove prices far higher than justified by global supply and \ndemand, and now an exodus of those same speculators has driven prices \nmuch lower than justified by supply and demand.\n  Like crude oil, the natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil markets \nhave also seen large price changes. The prices are way up, they're way \ndown, they're unpredictable--making it impossible for many businesses \nand consumers to plan for and afford energy costs and related goods and \nservices.\n  Unpredictable energy prices continue to take a tremendous toll on \nmillions of American consumers and businesses. Unless we act to protect \nour energy markets from excessive speculation and price manipulation, \nthe American economy will continue to be vulnerable to wild price \nswings affecting the prices of transportation, food, manufacturing and \neverything in between, endangering the economic security of our people, \nour businesses, and our nation.\n  Congress should act now to help tame rampant speculation and \nreinvigorate supply and demand as market forces.\n  That is why I am re-introducing legislation today that is nearly \nidentical to the legislation I and others introduced near the end of \nthe last Congress that provides strong and workable measures to prevent \nexcessive speculation and price manipulation in U.S. energy and \nagricultural markets. It will close the loopholes in our commodities \nlaws that now impede the policing of U.S. energy trades on foreign \nexchanges and in the unregulated over-the-counter market. It will \nensure that large commodity traders cannot use these markets to hide \nfrom CFTC oversight or avoid limits on speculation. It will strengthen \ndisclosure, oversight, and enforcement in U.S. energy markets, \nrestoring the financial oversight that is crucial to protect American \nconsumers, American businesses, and the U.S. economy from further \nenergy shocks.\n  This legislation, which addresses commodity markets, is one important \npiece of the broader reform effort needed to repair our financial \nregulatory system, stop abusive practices, and put the cop back on the \nbeat in all of our markets.\n  Specifically, this particular legislation would make four sets of \nchanges.\n  First, it would require the CFTC to set limits on the holdings of \ntraders in all of the energy futures contracts traded on regulated \nexchanges to prevent traders from engaging in excessive speculation or \nprice manipulation. Since we closed the Enron loophole last year all \nfutures contracts must be traded in regulated markets.\n  Second, it would close the ``London loophole'' by giving the CFTC the \nsame authority to police traders in the United States who trade U.S. \nfutures contracts on a foreign exchange and by requiring foreign \nexchanges that want to install trading terminals in the United States \nto impose comparable limits on speculative trading as the CFTC imposes \non domestic exchanges to prevent excessive speculation and price \nmanipulation.\n  Third, it would close the ``swaps loophole'' by requiring traders in \nthe over-the-counter energy markets to report large trades to the CFTC, \nand it would authorize the CFTC to set limits on trading in the \npresently unregulated over-the-counter markets to prevent excessive \nspeculation and price manipulation.\n  Finally, it would require the CFTC to revise the standards that allow \ntraders who use futures markets to hedge their holdings to exceed the \nspeculation limits that apply to everyone else.\n  My Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has shown that one key \nfactor in price spikes of energy is increased speculation in the energy \nmarkets. Traders are now trading millions of contracts for future \ndelivery of oil, creating a demand for paper contracts that gets \ntranslated into increases in prices and increasing price volatility.\n  Much of this increase in trading of futures has been due to \nspeculators who are not in the oil business but who are buying and \nselling oil futures contracts in the hope of making a profit from \nchanging prices. According to the CFTC's data, the number of futures \nand options contracts held by speculators grew from around 100,000 \ncontracts in 2001, which was 20 percent of the total number of \noutstanding contracts, to almost 1.2 million contracts last fall, \nrepresenting almost 40 percent of the outstanding futures and options \ncontracts in oil on NYMEX. Even these statistics understate the \nincrease in speculation, since the CFTC data classifies futures trading \ninvolving index funds as commercial trading rather than speculation, \nand the CFTC classifies all traders in commercial firms as commercial \ntraders, regardless of whether any particular trader in that firm may, \nin fact, be speculating.\n  Basic economic theory tells us that the greater the demand there is \nto buy futures contracts for the delivery of a commodity, the higher \nthe price will be for those futures contracts.\n  Not surprisingly, therefore, massive speculation that the price of \noil will increase, together with massive purchases of futures contracts \nin pursuit of that belief, have, in fact, helped increase the price of \noil to a level far above the price justified by the traditional forces \nof supply and demand.\n  In June 2006, I released a Subcommittee report, The Role of Market \nSpeculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put a Cop on the \nBeat. This report found that the traditional forces of supply and \ndemand didn't account for sustained price increases and price \nvolatility in the oil and gasoline markets. The report concluded that, \nin 2006, a growing number of trades of contracts for future delivery of \noil occurred without regulatory oversight and that market speculation \nhad contributed to rising oil and gasoline prices, perhaps accounting \nfor $20 out of a then-priced $70 barrel of oil.\n  Oil industry executives and experts arrived at similar conclusions. \nAs oil prices neared $100 in late 2007, the President and CEO of \nMarathon Oil said, ``$100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in \nthe market. It has to be speculation on the futures market that is \nfueling this.'' At about the same time, Mr. Fadel Gheit, oil analyst \nfor Oppenheimer and Company described the oil market as ``a farce.'' \n``The speculators have seized control and it's basically a free-for-\nall, a global gambling hall, and it won't shut down unless and until \nresponsible governments step in.'' In January of 2008, when oil first \nhit $100 per barrel, Mr. Tim Evans, oil analyst for Citigroup, wrote: \n``[T]he larger supply and demand fundamentals do not support a further \nrise and are, in fact, more consistent with lower price levels.'' At a \njoint hearing on the effects of speculation my Subcommittee held in \nlate 2007, Dr. Edward Krapels, a financial market analyst, testified: \n``Of course financial trading, speculation affects the price of oil \nbecause it affects the price of everything we trade. . . . It would be \namazing if oil somehow escaped this effect.'' Dr. Krapels added that as \na result of this speculation ``there is a bubble in oil prices.''\n\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\n\n\n  Last summer, the Presidents and CEOs of major U.S. airlines described \nthe disastrous effects of rampant speculation on the airline industry. \nThe CEOs stated: ``normal market forces are being dangerously amplified \nby poorly regulated market speculation.'' The CEOs wrote: ``For \nairlines, ultra-expensive fuel means thousands of lost jobs and severe \nreductions in air service to both large and small communities.''\n  To rein in this rampant speculation, the first step to take is to put \na cop back on the beat in all our energy markets to prevent excessive \nspeculation, price manipulation, and trading abuses.\n  With respect to the commodity futures markets, the legislation we are \nintroducing today requires the CFTC to establish limits on the amount \nof futures contracts any trader can hold. Currently, the CFTC allows \nthe futures exchanges themselves to set these limits. This bill would \nrequire the CFTC to set those limits to prevent excessive speculation \nand price manipulation. It would preserve, however, the exchanges' \nobligation and ability to police their traders to ensure they remain \nbelow these limits.\n  This legislation would also require the CFTC to conduct a rulemaking \nto review and revise the criteria for allowing traders who are using \nthe futures market to hedge their risks in a commodity to acquire \nholdings in excess of the limits on holdings for speculators.\n  Another step is to give the CFTC authority to prevent excessive \nspeculation in the over-the-counter markets. In 2007, my Subcommittee \nissued a report on the effects of speculation in the energy markets \nentitled, Excessive Speculation in the Natural Gas Market. This \ninvestigation showed that speculation by a single hedge fund named \nAmaranth distorted natural gas prices during the summer of 2006 and \ndrove up prices for average consumers. The report demonstrated how \nAmaranth had shifted its speculative activity to unregulated markets, \nunder the ``Enron loophole,'' to avoid the restrictions and oversight \nin the regulated markets, and how Amaranth's trading in the unregulated \nmarkets contributed to price increases.\n  Following this investigation, I introduced a bill, S. 2058, to close \nthe Enron loophole and regulate the un-regulated electronic energy \nmarkets. Working with Senators Feinstein and Snowe, and with the \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee in a bipartisan effort, we \nincluded an amendment to close the Enron loophole in the farm bill, \nwhich Congress passed last year.\n  The legislation to close the Enron loophole placed over-the-counter, \nOTC, electronic exchanges under CFTC regulation. However, this \nlegislation did not address the separate issue of trading in the rest \nof the OTC market, which includes bilateral trades through voice \nbrokers, swap dealers, and direct party-to-party negotiations. In order \nto ensure there is a cop on the beat in all of the energy commodity \nmarkets, we need to address the rest of the OTC market as well.\n  A large portion of this OTC market consists of the trading of swaps \nrelating to the price of a commodity. Generally, commodity swaps are \ncontracts between two parties where one party pays a fixed price to \nanother party in return for some type of payment at a future time \ndepending on the price of a commodity. Because some of these swap \ninstruments look very much like futures contracts--except that they do \nnot call for the actual delivery of the commodity--there is concern \nthat the price of these swaps that are traded in the unregulated OTC \nmarket could affect the price of the very similar futures contracts \ntraded on the regulated futures markets. We don't yet know for sure \nthat this is the case, or that it is not, because we don't have any \naccess to comprehensive data or reporting on the trading of these swaps \nin the OTC market.\n  The legislation introduced today includes provisions to give the CFTC \noversight authority to stop excessive speculation in the over-the-\ncounter market. These provisions represent a practical, workable \napproach that will enable the CFTC to obtain key information about the \nOTC market to enable it to prevent excessive speculation and price \nmanipulation.\n  Under these provisions, the CFTC will have the authority to ensure \nthat traders cannot avoid the CFTC reporting requirements by trading \nswaps in the unregulated OTC market instead of regulated exchanges. It \nwill enable the CFTC to act, such as by requiring reductions in \nholdings of futures contracts or swaps, against traders with large \npositions in order to prevent excessive speculation or price \nmanipulation regardless of whether the trader's position is on an \nexchange or in the OTC market.\n  This bill also gives the CFTC the authority to establish position \nlimits in the over-the-counter market for energy and agricultural \ncommodities in order to prevent excessive speculation and price \nmanipulation. The CFTC needs this authority to ensure that large \ntraders are not using the over-the-counter markets to evade the \nposition limits in the futures markets.\n  The ``London loophole'' allowed crude oil traders in the U.S. to \navoid the position limits that apply to trading on U.S. futures \nexchanges by directing their trades onto the ICE Futures Exchange in \nLondon.\n  In the last Congress, after I and others introduced legislation to \nclose the London loophole that is similar to the legislation we are now \nintroducing, the CFTC imposed more stringent requirements upon the ICE \nFutures Exchange's operations in the United States--for the first time \nrequiring the London exchange to impose and enforce comparable position \nlimits in order to be allowed to keep its trading terminals in the \nUnited States. This is the very action our legislation called for. \nHowever, the current CFTC position limits apply only to the nearest \nfutures contract. Our legislation will ensure that foreign exchanges \nwith trading terminals in the U.S. will apply position limits to other \nfutures contracts once the CFTC establishes those limits for U.S. \nexchanges.\n  Although the CFTC has taken these important steps that will go a long \nway towards closing the London loophole, Congress should still pass \nthis legislation to make sure the London loophole stays closed. The \nlegislation would put the conditions the CFTC has imposed upon the \nLondon exchange into statute, and ensure that the CFTC has clear \nauthority to take action against any U.S. trader who is manipulating \nthe price of a commodity or excessively speculating through the London \nexchange, including requiring that trader to reduce positions.\n  The legislation also provides authorization for the CFTC to hire an \nadditional 100 employees to oversee the commodity markets it regulates. \nThe CFTC has been understaffed and underfunded for years. This \nauthorization is a necessary first step to reinvigorate the agency's \noversight and enforcement capabilities.\n  In summary, the legislation I am introducing today will give the CFTC \nability to police all of our energy commodity markets to prevent \nexcessive speculation and price manipulation. This legislation is \nnecessary to close the loopholes in current law that permit speculators \nin commodity markets to avoid trading limits designed to prevent the \ntype of excessive speculation that has been contributing to high energy \nand other commodity prices. I hope my colleagues will support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsupport material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to maintain the free flow of information to the public \nby providing conditions for the federally compelled disclosure of \ninformation by certain persons connected with the news media; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I sought recognition to introduce the \nFree Flow of Information Act of 2009. I am honored to be joined in my \nefforts by Senators Schumer, Lugar and Graham, who are original \ncosponsors. Some 242 years ago, on January 16, 1767, Thomas Jefferson \nremarked in a letter to Col. Edward Carrington, ``Were it left to me to \ndecide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or \nnewspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to \nprefer the latter.'' We take our free press for granted because it is \nso ingrained in our history. But we need only look at free press \nmovements in fledgling democracies to appreciate how sometimes fragile \nand easily chilled freedom of press truly is.\n  The Free Flow of Information Act protects the public interest by \nensuring an informed citizenry. In the past three years the Department \nof Justice has provided inconsistent numbers of subpoenaed journalists \nto the Judiciary Committee. We know from the public record, however, \nthat at least 19 journalists have been subpoenaed by federal and \nspecial prosecutors for confidential source information since 2001 \nclaim. Among them are Judith Miller, Matt Cooper, Tim Russert, Lance \nWilliams, Mark Fainaru-Wada, and Philip Shenon. We also know 4 \njournalists have been imprisoned at the request either of the DoJ, U.S. \nAttorneys, or special prosecutors since 2000. Josh Wolf, Judith Miller, \nJim Taricani, Vanessa Leggett. Collectively, these journalists have \nspent over 19 months imprisoned. Journalists who are not jailed for \nfailing to comply with subpoenas still suffer the prospect of being \nheld in contempt. Several have suffered this fate: Toni Locy, James \nStewart, Walter Pincus, Jim Taricani.\n  In addition to the subpoenas from special prosecutors mentioned \nabove, more than a dozen reporters have received subpoenas in civil \nsuits, such as the Wen Ho Lee and Hatfill privacy lawsuits against the \ngovernment. A preliminary report on the 2007 Media Subpoena Survey \nconducted by Professor RonNell Andersen Jones at the Law College \nFoundation at the University of Arizona states: 761 responding news \norganizations reported receiving a total of 3,602 subpoenas seeking \ninformation or material relating to newsgathering activities in \ncalendar year 2006. Of these, 335 were subpoenas arising out of \nproceedings that took place in a federal forum. Sixty-four percent of \nresponding newsroom leaders believe the frequency of media subpoenas to \nbe greater than it was five years ago. Fifty percent of the media \ncompanies believe the risk of their own organization receiving a \nsubpoena is greater than it was five years ago, while only 5 percent \nbelieve the risk to be less.\n  This bipartisan legislation would establish a qualified reporters' \nprivilege protecting them from being compelled to identify confidential \nsource information. The bill seeks to reconcile reporters' need to \nmaintain confidentiality, in order to ensure that sources will speak \nopenly and freely with the media, with the public's right to effective \nlaw enforcement and fair trials. The situation in the United States \ntoday is that journalists are subject to a compulsory process to \ndisclose confidential informants--at least in Federal courts. At the \nState level, there are many laws providing qualified privileges for \njournalists. Prior versions of this bill garnered the support of \nnumerous bipartisan cosponsors, as well as 39 media organizations, \nincluding the Washington Post, The Hearst Corporation, Time Warner, ABC \nInc., CBS, CNN, The New York Times Company, and National Public Radio.\n  In 2005 I cosponsored two prior bills and was principle author of yet \nanother. In the 110th Congress, I introduced S. 1035 the Free Flow of \nInformation Act of 2007, along with Senator Schumer, and Senators \nLugar, Graham, and Dodd other senators to join as cosponsors were \nSenators Leahy, Johnson, Boxer, Klobuchar, Salazar, Obama, Clinton, \nDole, Murray, Landrieu, Webb, Tester, Lieberman, Durbin, Baucus, and \nLautenberg. On October 4, 2007, the Committee on the Judiciary \nfavorably reported S.2035 out of committee by a 15-4 vote, which marked \nthe first time a reporters' privilege bill had ever passed out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\n  On March 6, 2008, I, along with Senator Leahy, sent a letter to \nMajority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell asking that S. 2035 \nreceive floor time for full Senate consideration. They answered our \ncall. On July 30, 2008, the Senate entertained a cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to the measure that failed by a vote of 51-43. \nNonetheless, the bill continues to enjoy broad bipartisan support--\nincluding the pledged support of former Senator, now--President Barack \nObama. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing the Free Flow \nof Information Act of 2009, its high time we stop jailing or holding in \ncontempt reporters who, in good faith, protect their confidential \nsources even in the face of a government subpoena.\n  There has been a growing consensus that we need to establish a \nFederal journalists' privilege to protect the integrity of the news \ngathering process, a process that depends on the free flow of \ninformation between journalists and whistleblowers, as well as other \nconfidential sources.\n  Under my chairmanship, the Judiciary Committee held three separate \nhearings on this issue at which we heard from 20 witnesses, including \nprominent journalists like William Safire and Judith Miller, current \nand former Federal prosecutors, including former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Paul McNulty, and First Amendment scholars.\n  These witnesses demonstrated that there are two vital, competing \nconcerns at stake. On one hand, reporters cite the need to maintain \nconfidentiality in order to ensure that sources will speak openly and \nfreely with the news media. The renowned William Safire, former \ncolumnist for the New York Times, testified that ``the essence of news \ngathering is this: if you don't have sources you trust and who trust \nyou, then you don't have a solid story--and the public suffers for \nit.'' Reporter Matthew Cooper of Time Magazine said this to the \nJudiciary Committee: ``As someone who relies on confidential sources \nall the time, I simply could not do my job reporting stories big and \nsmall without being able to speak with officials under varying degrees \nof anonymity.''\n  On the other hand, the public has a right to effective law \nenforcement and fair trials. Our judicial system needs access to \ninformation in order to prosecute crime and to guarantee fair \nadministration of the law for plaintiffs and defendants alike. As a \nJustice Department representative told the Committee, prosecutors need \nto ``maintain the ability, in certain vitally important circumstances, \nto obtain information identifying a source when a paramount interest is \nat stake. For example, obtaining source information may be the only \navailable means of preventing a murder, locating a kidnapped child, or \nidentifying a serial arsonist.''\n\n  As Federal courts have considered these competing interests, they \nadopted rules that went in several different directions. Rather than a \nclear, uniform standard for deciding claims of journalist privilege, \nthe Federal courts currently observe a ``crazy quilt'' of different \njudicial standards.\n  The confusion began 36 years ago, when the Supreme Court decided \nBranzburg v. Hayes. The Court held that the press' First Amendment \nright to publish information does not include a right to keep \ninformation secret from a grand jury investigating a criminal matter. \nThe Supreme Court also held that the common law did not exempt \nreporters from the duty of every citizen to provide information to a \ngrand jury.\n  The Court reasoned that just as newspapers and journalists are \nsubject to the same laws and restrictions as other citizens, they are \nalso subject to the same duty to provide information to a court as \nother citizens. However, Justice Powell, who joined the 5-4 majority, \nwrote a separate concurrence in which he explained that the Court's \nholding was not an invitation for the Government to harass journalists. \nIf a journalist could show that the grand jury investigation was being \nconducted in bad faith, the journalist could ask the court to quash the \nsubpoena. Justice Powell indicated that courts might assess such claims \non a case-by-case basis by balancing the freedom of the press against \nthe obligation to give testimony relevant to criminal conduct.\n  In attempting to apply Justice Powell's concurring opinion, Federal \ncourts have split on the question of when a journalist is required to \ntestify. In more than three decades since Branzburg, the Federal courts \nare split in at least three ways in their approaches to Federal \ncriminal and civil cases.\n  With respect to Federal criminal cases, five circuits apply Branzburg \nso as to not allow journalists to withhold information absent \ngovernmental bad faith. Four other circuits recognize a qualified \nprivilege, which requires courts to balance the freedom of the press \nagainst the obligation to provide testimony on a case-by-case basis. \nThe law in the District of Columbia Circuit is unsettled.\n  With respect to Federal civil cases, 9 of the 12 circuits apply a \nbalancing test when deciding whether journalists must disclose \nconfidential sources. One circuit affords journalists no privilege in \nany context. Two other circuits have yet to decide whether journalists \nhave any privilege in civil cases. Meanwhile, 49 States plus the \nDistrict of Columbia have recognized some form of reporters' privilege \nwithin their own jurisdictions. Thirty-one States plus the District of \nColumbia have passed some form of reporter's shield statute, and 18 \nStates have recognized a privilege at common law.\n  There is little wonder that there is a growing consensus concerning \nthe need for a uniform journalists' privilege in Federal courts. This \nsystem must be simplified.\n  Today, we move toward resolving this problem by introducing the Free \nFlow of Information Act of 2009. The purpose of this bill is to \nguarantee the flow of information to the public through a free and \nactive press, while protecting the public's right to effective law \nenforcement and individuals' rights to the fair administration of \njustice.\n  The bill provides a qualified privilege for reporters to withhold \nfrom Federal courts, prosecutors, and other Federal entities, \nconfidential source information and documents and materials obtained or \ncreated under a promise of confidentiality. However, the bill \nrecognizes that, in certain instances, the public's interest in law \nenforcement and fair trials outweighs a source's interest in remaining \nanonymous through the reporter's assertion of a privilege. Therefore, \nit allows courts to require disclosure where certain criteria are met.\n  Under the legislation, in most criminal investigations and \nprosecutions, the Federal entity seeking the reporter's source \ninformation must show that there are reasonable grounds to believe that \na crime has occurred, and that the reporter's information is essential \nto the prosecution or defense. In criminal investigations and \nprosecutions of leaks of classified information, the Federal entity \nseeking disclosure must additionally show that the leak caused \nsignificant, clear, and articulable harm to national security. In \nnoncriminal actions, the Federal entity seeking source information must \nshow that the reporter's information is essential to the resolution of \nthe matter.\n  In all cases and investigations, the Federal entity must demonstrate \nthat nondisclosure would be contrary to the public interest. In other \nwords, the court must balance the governmental need for the information \nagainst the public interest in newsgathering and the free flow of \ninformation.\n  Further, the bill ensures that Federal Government entities do not \nengage in ``fishing expeditions'' for a reporter's information. The \ninformation a reporter reveals must, to the extent possible, be limited \nto verifying published information and describing the surrounding \ncircumstances. The information must also be narrowly tailored to avoid \ncompelling a reporter to reveal peripheral or speculative information.\n  Finally, the Free Flow of Information Act adds layers of safeguards \nfor the public. Reporters are not allowed to withhold information if a \nFederal court concludes that the information is needed for the defense \nof our Nation's security, as long as it outweighs the public interest \nin newsgathering and maintains the free flow of information to \ncitizens, or to prevent an act of terrorism. Similarly, journalists may \nnot withhold information reasonably necessary to stop a kidnapping or a \ncrime that could lead to death or physical injury. Also, the bill \nensures that both crime victims and criminal defendants\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\nwill have a fair hearing in court. Under this bill, a journalist who is \nan eyewitness to a crime or tort or takes part in a crime or tort may \nnot withhold that information on grounds of the qualified privilege. \nJournalists should not be permitted to hide from the law by writing a \nstory and then claiming a reporter's privilege.\n  It is time for Congress to clear up the ambiguities journalists and \nthe Federal judicial system face in balancing the protections \njournalists need in providing confidential information to the public \nwith the ability of the courts to conduct fair and accurate trials. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation and help create a fair \nand efficient means to serve journalists and the news media, \nprosecutors and the courts, and most importantly the public interest on \nboth ends of the spectrum.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 449. A bill to protect free speech; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I am introducing the Free Speech \nProtection Act of 2009 to address a serious challenge to one of the \nmost basic protections in our Constitution. American journalists and \nacademics must have the freedom to investigate, write, speak, and \npublish about matters of public importance, limited only by the legal \nstandards laid out in our First Amendment jurisprudence, including \nprecedents such as New York Times v. Sullivan. Despite the protection \nfor free speech under our own law, the rights of the American public, \nand of American journalists who share information with the public, are \nbeing threatened by the forum shopping of libel suits to foreign courts \nwith less robust protections for free speech.\n  These suits are filed in, and entertained by, foreign courts, despite \nthe fact that the challenged speech or writing is written in the United \nStates by U.S. journalists, and is published or disseminated primarily \nin the United States. The plaintiff in these cases may have no \nparticular connection to the country in which the suit is filed. \nNevertheless, the U.S. journalists or publications who are named as \ndefendants in these suits must deal with the expense, inconvenience and \ndistress of being sued in foreign courts, even though their conduct is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\n  An example of why the legislation is necessary is found in litigation \ninvolving Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld, a U.S. citizen and Director of the \nAmerican Center for Democracy, whose articles have appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal, the National Review, and the Los Angeles Times. She has \nbeen a scholar with Columbia University, the University of New York \nSchool of Law, and Johns Hopkins, and has testified before Congress. \nDr. Ehrenfeld's 2003 book, ``Funding Evil: How Terrorism is Financed \nand How to Stop It'', which was published solely in the United States \nby a U.S. publisher, alleged that a Saudi Arabian subject and his \nfamily financially supported Al Qaeda in the years preceding the \nattacks of September 11. He sued Ehrenfeld for libel in England, \nalthough only 23 books were sold there. Why? Because under English law, \nit is not necessary for a libel plaintiff to prove falsity or actual \nmalice as is required in the United States.\n  Dr. Ehrenfeld did not appear, and the English court entered a default \njudgment for damages, an injunction against publication in the United \nKingdom, a ``declaration of falsity'', and an order that she and her \npublisher print a correction and an apology.\n  Dr. Ehrenfeld sought to shield herself with a declaration from both \nfederal and state courts that her book did not create liability under \nAmerican law, but jurisdictional barriers prevented both the Federal \nand New York State courts from acting. Reacting to this problem, the \nGovernor of New York, on May 1, 2008, signed into law the ``Libel \nTerrorism Protection Act.'' Congress must now take similar action. I \nnote that the person who sued Dr. Ehrenfeld has filed dozens of \nlawsuits in England, and there is a real danger that other American \nwriters and researchers will be afraid to address this crucial subject \nof terror funding and other important matters. Other countries should \nbe free to have their own libel law, but so too should the United \nStates. Venues that have become magnets for defamation plaintiffs from \naround the world permit those who want to intimidate our journalists to \nsucceed in doing so. The stakes are high. The United Nations in 2008 \nnoted the importance of free speech and a free press, and the threat \nthat libel tourism poses to the world.\n  Following the New York example, the legislation my co-sponsors and I \nintroduce today confers jurisdiction on federal courts to bar \nenforcement of foreign libel judgments if the material at issue would \nnot constitute libel under U.S. law. Significantly, it also deters \nforeign suits in the first place by permitting American defendants to \ncountersue from the moment papers are served on them. Damages available \nin the countersuit include the amount at issue in the foreign libel \nsuit as well as treble damages if the foreign suit is part of a scheme \nto suppress a U.S. person's first amendment rights.\n  This deterrent mechanism is critical because those who bring these \nforeign libel suits are more interested in intimidating the authors \nthan in actually collecting damages. They know that even if a foreign \njudgment cannot be enforced in the United States, the cost of defending \nthe suit and the penalty for taking a default judgment can have a \nchilling effect on American writers and publishers. In particular, \nunder English law a contempt citation may issue against authors or \npublishers who fail to satisfy default judgments, pursuant to which \ntheir property may be seized and they may be imprisoned. What is worse, \ndefendants can no longer skirt the consequences merely by avoiding \ncontact with England. Under recent European Commission regulations, \ndefault judgments for monetary claims are enforceable in all EU \ncountries except Denmark.\n  The potentially severe ramifications of a default judgment make clear \nthat merely barring enforcement of a foreign libel judgment in U.S. \ncourts is entirely insufficient particularly for publishers with \nEuropean offices. While it is important to bar enforcement, in the \nwords of a New York Times editorial, that does ``not go as far as it \ncould.''\n  I often remark that the Senate is the world's greatest deliberative \nbody and all the facts and arguments ought to be examined before it \nacts. Accordingly, I must address a letter in opposition to this bill \nfrom a prominent British libel lawyer and explain why his arguments are \nunpersuasive.\n  He notes that a ``U.S. citizen . . . knocked down by the negligent \ndriving'' of a London taxi driver is ``just as entitled as any British \ncitizen'' to sue in England for damages. Why should a U.S. citizen \n``not be entitled on the same basis, like any other UK citizen, to sue \nfor damages to his reputation?'' The answer, of course, is that the \nanalogy is inapt. In that hypothetical, the plaintiff sues the \ndefendant in the defendant's jurisdiction for a harm committed and \nsuffered there, an injury that is universally recognized as a tort. By \ncontrast, the plaintiff in a foreign libel action purposely avoids \nsuing in the jurisdiction where the defendant journalist writes and \npublishes, a jurisdiction where the material is not libelous. The \nproper analogy would be if the injured American had sued the taxi \ndriver in the United States instead of England because the driver's \nconduct would not constitute negligence under English law. That hardly \nseems fair play. Our bill is designed specifically to prevent such \nforum shopping.\n  That essay also asks whether ``legislators will extend their \nintervention'' to commercial matters such as contracts and debts and \nwarns that such extension could trigger ``retaliatory action on the \npart of UK legislators.'' Actually, such extension has already \nhappened, but at the hands of British legislators not American ones. In \nthe antitrust context, British law bars enforcement of foreign \njudgments for treble damages such as those awarded by U.S. courts. In \naddition, it allows a British corporation, against whom a judgment for \ntreble damages was entered in a foreign court, to recover from the \nplaintiff any excess over actual damages. In any event, this bill is \nconfined to the narrow area of core First Amendment rights.\n  ``Perhaps of most significance'' he continues in his letter, is that \nto his knowledge ``very few of these claims have actually come before \nUK courts.'' But it is the chilling effect and the\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\nmere threat of litigation that suffices to silence authors; there is no \nneed to try the cases. In 2004, fear of a lawsuit forced Random House \nUK to cancel publication of ``House of Bush, House of Saud,'' a best \nseller in the U.S. that was written by an American author. Similarly, \nin 2007, the threat of a lawsuit compelled Cambridge University Press \nto apologize and destroy all available copies of ``Alms for Jihad,'' a \nbook on terrorism funding by American authors. Indeed, an October 2008 \nstudy reported in The Guardian found that ``[m]edia companies are \nbecoming less willing to fight defamation court cases all the way to a \nverdict. . . . With the burden of proof effectively resting on the \ndefendant'' and attorneys' fees paid by the loser, defendants ``are \nforced to enter into settlement negotiations.''\n  Numerous organizations have endorsed the bill we offer today, \nincluding the ACLU and the Anti-Defamation League, as well as numerous \njournalists and publishers groups. Op-eds and editorials supporting our \nefforts have run in national papers, including the New York Times on \nSeptember 15, 2008 and the New York Sun on July 28, 2008. Also drawing \nattention to the issue was an op-ed Senator Lieberman and I penned that \nran in the Wall Street Journal on July 14, 2008.\n  Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of expression of \nideas, opinions, and research, and freedom of exchange of information \nare all essential to the functioning of a democracy. They are also \nessential in the fight against terrorism.\n  I thank Senators Lieberman and Schumer, as well as Congressman Pete \nKing and his cosponsors for working with me on this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 450. A bill to understand and comprehensively address the oral \nhealth problems associated with methamphetamine use; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce the Meth \nMouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act in the 111th Congress.\n  In December 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Drug \nIntelligence Center, NDIC, reported the increasing availability of \nhigh-purity methamphetamine throughout the country and the expansion of \nmethamphetamine networks. According to the 2005 National Survey on Drug \nUse and Health, NSDUH, an estimated 10.4 million Americans aged 12 or \nolder used methamphetamine at least once in their lifetimes for \nnonmedical reasons, representing 4.3 percent of the U.S. population in \nthat age group. Its use has been destructive to individual people, \nfamilies and communities in our nation. Lung disease, fatal heart \nattacks, mental illness and decaying teeth have been implicated with \nits prevalent use.\n  Dental problems are common among drug users. Many do not care for \ntheir teeth regularly and most do not see a dentist often. But \nmethamphetamine seems to be taking a unique and horrific toll inside \nits user's mouths.\n  In those populated areas where its use is highly concentrated, more \nand more dentists are encountering patients with a distinct, painful \nand often debilitating pattern of oral decay. The condition, known as \n``meth mouth'', is characterized by teeth that are blackened, stained, \nrotting and crumbling or falling apart. Some believe meth mouth is \ncaused by the drug's acidic nature, its ability to dry the mouth, the \ntendency of users to grind and clench their teeth and a drug-induced \ncraving for sugary drinks. Often the damage is so severe that \nextraction is the only viable treatment option.\n  The Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act authorizes \nfunding for local, school-based initiatives to educate primary and \nelementary school students about the dangers of methamphetamine usage. \nIt will also provide for enhanced research and professional training in \nsubstance use disorders, oral health and the provision of dental care.\n  The bill I am putting forth here today will begin to address our \nNation's need to better understand and educate our population along \nhelping the dental health providers treat the oral disease originating \nfrom this drug's abuse. The studies funded and treatment offered here \nwill begin to stem the tide on this terrible affliction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 450\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Meth Mouth \n     Prevention and Community Recovery Act''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to investigate and report on all aspects of meth mouth, \n     including its causes, public health impact, innovative models \n     for its prevention, and new and improved methods for its \n     treatment;\n       (2) to ensure dentists and allied dental personnel are able \n     to recognize the signs of substance abuse in their patients, \n     discuss the nature of addiction as it relates to oral health \n     and dental care, and facilitate appropriate help for patients \n     (and family members of patients) who are affected by a \n     substance use disorder;\n       (3) to determine whether, how, and to what degree educating \n     youth about meth mouth is an effective strategy for \n     preventing or reducing the prevalence of methamphetamine use; \n     and\n       (4) to underscore the many ways that dentists and other \n     oral health professionals can contribute to the general \n     health of their patients, their communities, and the country \n     as a whole.\n\n     SEC. 2.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated for the purpose of \n     carrying out this title $1,000,000 for each of fiscal years \n     2010 through 2012. Amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     under this section are in addition to any other amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for such purpose.\n\n              TITLE II--METH MOUTH RESEARCH INVESTMENT ACT\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) As the number of regular methamphetamine users has \n     increased, so has a peculiar set of dental problems linked to \n     the drug. The condition (known as ``meth mouth'') develops \n     rapidly and is attributed to the drug's acidic nature, its \n     ability to dry the mouth, the tendency of users to grind and \n     clench their teeth, and a drug-induced craving for sugar-\n     laden soft drinks.\n       (2) Meth mouth is regarded by many as an anecdotal \n     phenomenon. Few peer-reviewed studies have been published \n     that examine its causes, its physical effects, its \n     prevalence, or its public health costs.\n       (3) Enhanced research would help to identify the prevalence \n     and scope of meth mouth. Such research would also help \n     determine how substances of abuse can damage the teeth and \n     other oral tissues, and offer the possibility of developing \n     new and improved prevention, harm-reduction, and cost \n     management strategies.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for \n     enhanced research examining all aspects of meth mouth, \n     including its causes, its public health impact, innovative \n     models for its prevention, and new and improved methods for \n     its treatment.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this title:\n       (1) Clinical research; health services research.--The terms \n     ``clinical research'' and ``health services research'' shall \n     have the meanings given to such terms in section 409 of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284d).\n       (2) Indian; indian tribe; tribal organization.--The terms \n     ``Indian'', ``Indian tribe'', and ``tribal organization'' \n     shall have the meanings given to such terms in section 4 of \n     the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \n     (25 U.S.C. 450b).\n       (3) Meth mouth.--The term ``meth mouth'' means a distinct \n     and often severe pattern of oral decay that is commonly \n     associated with methamphetamine use.\n       (4) Public health research.--The term ``public health \n     research'' means research that focuses on population-based \n     health measures.\n       (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       (6) Substance use disorder.--The term ``substance use \n     disorder'' means any harmful pattern of alcohol or drug use \n     that leads to clinically significant impairment in physical, \n     psychological, interpersonal, or vocational functioning.\n\n     SEC. 202.

STUDY OF METHAMPHETAMINE-RELATED ORAL HEALTH COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In carrying out section 202, the Secretary \n     shall conduct a study to determine whether, how, and to what \n     degree methamphetamine use affects the demand for (and \n     provision of) dental care. The study shall account for both \n     genders, all racial and ethnic groups (and subgroups), and \n     persons of all ages and from all geographic areas as \n     appropriate for the scientific goals of the research.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish a special \n     report detailing the results of the study described in \n     subsection (a), with findings that address--\n       (1) the prevalence and severity of oral health problems \n     believed to be associated with methamphetamine use;\n       (2) the criteria most commonly used to determine whether a \n     patient's oral health problems are associated with \n     methamphetamine use;\n       (3) the therapies most commonly used to treat patients with \n     meth mouth;\n       (4) the clinical prognosis for patients who received care \n     for meth mouth; and\n       (5) the financial impact of meth mouth on publicly financed \n     dental programs.\n\n     SEC. 204. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated for the purpose of \n     carrying out this title, $200,000 for each of fiscal years \n     2010 through 2012. Amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     under this section are in addition to any other amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for such purpose.\n\n     TITLE III--SUBSTANCE ABUSE EDUCATION FOR DENTAL PROFESSIONALS\n\n     SEC. 301. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The use of certain therapeutic agents in dental \n     treatment can jeopardize the health and affect the relapse \n     potential of patients with substance use disorders.\n       (2) Screening patients for substance abuse is not a common \n     practice among dentists, according to several peer-reviewed \n     articles published in the ``Journal of the American Dental \n     Association''. Limited time, inadequate training, and the \n     potential for alienating patients are among the reasons often \n     cited.\n       (3) Dentists receive little formal education and training \n     in screening patients for substance abuse, discussing the \n     nature of addiction as it relates to oral health and dental \n     care, and facilitating appropriate help for patients, and \n     family members of patients, who are affected by a substance \n     use disorder.\n       (4) The American Dental Association maintains that dentists \n     should be knowledgeable about substance use disorders in \n     order to safely administer and prescribe controlled\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\n     substances and other medications. The American Dental \n     Association further recommends that dentists become familiar \n     with their community's substance abuse treatment resources \n     and be able to make referrals when indicated.\n       (5) Training can greatly increase the degree to which \n     dentists, allied dental personnel, and other health \n     professionals can screen patients for substance abuse, \n     discuss the nature of addiction as it relates to oral health \n     and dental care, and facilitate appropriate help for \n     patients, and family members of patients, who are affected by \n     a substance use disorder.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for \n     enhanced training and technical assistance to ensure that \n     dentists and allied dental personnel are able to recognize \n     the signs of substance abuse in their patients, discuss the \n     nature of addiction as it relates to oral health and dental \n     care, and facilitate appropriate help for patients, and \n     family members of patients, who are affected by a substance \n     use disorder.\n       (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this title:\n       (1) Allied dental personnel.--The term ``allied dental \n     personnel'' means individuals who assist the dentist in the \n     provision of oral health care services to patients, including \n     dental assistants, dental hygienists, and dental laboratory \n     technicians who are employed in dental offices or other \n     patient care facilities.\n       (2) Continuing education.--The term ``continuing \n     education'' means extracurricular learning activities \n     (including classes, lecture series, conferences, workshops, \n     seminars, correspondence courses, and other programs) whose \n     purpose is to incorporate the latest advances in science, \n     clinical, and professional knowledge into the practice of \n     health care (and whose completion is often a condition of \n     professional licensing).\n       (3) Continuing education credit.--The term ``continuing \n     education credit'' means a unit of study that is used to \n     officially certify or recognize the successful completion of \n     an activity that is consistent with professional standards \n     for continuing education.\n\n     SEC. 302. SUBSTANCE ABUSE TRAINING FOR DENTAL PROFESSIONALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In carrying out title V of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290 et seq.), the Administrator \n     of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration shall support training and offer technical \n     assistance to ensure that dentists and allied dental \n     personnel are prepared to--\n       (1) recognize signs of alcohol or drug addiction in their \n     patients and the family members of their patients;\n       (2) discuss the nature of substance abuse as it relates to \n     their area of expertise;\n       (3) understand how certain dental therapies can affect the \n     relapse potential of substance dependent patients; and\n       (4) help those affected by a substance use disorder to find \n     appropriate treatment for their condition.\n       (b) Continuing Education Credits.--The Administrator of the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration may \n     collaborate with professional accrediting bodies--\n       (1) to develop and support substance abuse training courses \n     for oral health professionals; and\n       (2) to encourage that the activities described in paragraph \n     (1) be recognized for continuing education purposes.\n\n     SEC. 303.

Res. 49\n\n       Whereas public diplomacy is the conduct of foreign \n     relations directly with the average citizen of a country, \n     rather than with officials of a country's foreign ministry;\n       Whereas public diplomacy is commonly conducted through \n     people-to-people exchanges in which experts, authors, \n     artists, educators and students interact with their peers in \n     other countries;\n       Whereas effective public diplomacy promotes free and \n     unfiltered access to information about the United States \n     through books, newspapers, periodicals, and the Internet;\n       Whereas public diplomacy requires a willingness to discuss \n     all aspects of society, search for common values, foster a \n     long-term bilateral relationship based on mutual respect, and \n     recognize that certain areas of disagreement may remain \n     unresolved on a short term basis;\n       Whereas a BBC World Service poll published in February 2009 \n     that involved 13,000 respondents in 21 countries found that \n     while 40 percent of the respondents had a positive view of \n     the United States, 43 percent had a negative view of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Freedom House's 2008 Global Press Freedom report \n     notes that 123 countries (66 percent of the world's countries \n     and 80 percent of the world's population) have a press that \n     is classified as ``Not Free'' or ``Partly Free'';\n       Whereas the Government of the United Kingdom, of France, \n     and of Germany run stand-alone public diplomacy facilities \n     throughout the world, which are known as the British Council, \n     the Alliance Francaise, and the Goethe Institute, \n     respectively;\n       Whereas these government-run facilities teach the national \n     languages of their respective countries, offer libraries, \n     newspapers, and periodicals, sponsor public lecture and film \n     series that engage local audiences in dialogues that foster \n     better understandings between these countries and create an \n     environment promoting greater trust and openness;\n       Whereas the United States has historically operated similar \n     facilities, known as American Centers, which--\n       (1) offered classes in English, extensive libraries housing \n     collections of American literature, history, economics, \n     business, and social studies, and reading rooms offering the \n     latest American newspapers, periodicals, and academic \n     journals;\n       (2) hosted visiting American speakers and scholars on these \n     topics; and\n       (3) ran United States film series on topics related to \n     American values;\n       Whereas in societies in which freedom of speech, freedom of \n     the press, or local investment in education were minimal, \n     American Centers provided vital outposts of information for \n     citizens throughout the world, giving many of them their only \n     exposure to uncensored information about the United States;\n       Whereas this need for uncensored information about the \n     United States has accelerated as more foreign governments \n     have restricted Internet access or blocked Web sites viewed \n     as hostile to their political regimes;\n       Whereas following the end of the Cold War and the attacks \n     on United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, budgetary \n     and security pressures resulted in the drastic downsizing or \n     closure of most of the American Centers;\n       Whereas beginning in 1999, American Centers began to be \n     renamed Information Resource Centers and relocated primarily \n     inside United States embassy compounds;\n       Whereas of the 177 Information Resource Centers operating \n     in February 2009, 87, or 49 percent, operate on a ``By \n     Appointment Only'' basis and 18, or 11 percent, do not permit \n     any public access;\n       Whereas Information Resource Centers located outside United \n     States embassy compounds receive significantly more visitors \n     than those inside such compounds, including twice the number \n     of visitors in Africa, 6 times more visitors in the Middle \n     East, and 22 times more visitors in Asia;\n       Whereas Iran has increased the number of similar Iranian \n     facilities, known as Iranian Cultural Centers, to about 60 \n     throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Secretary of State should initiate a reexamination \n     of the public diplomacy platform strategy of the United \n     States with a goal of reestablishing publicly accessible \n     American Centers;\n       (2) after taking into account relevant security \n     considerations, the Secretary of State should consider \n     placing United States public diplomacy facilities at \n     locations conducive to maximizing their use, consistent with \n     the authority given to the Secretary under section \n     606(a)(2)(B) of the Secure Embassy Construction and \n     Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (22 U.S.C. 4865(a)(2)(B)) to \n     waive certain requirements of that Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2345-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2345-S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 50--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                  SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted the following resolution;

Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas Larry King was a 15-year-old boy from Oxnard, \n     California who was shot by a fellow student during English \n     class on February 12, 2008 and died in the hospital 2 days \n     later;\n       Whereas the police classified the murder as a hate crime;\n       Whereas in 2008, more than 150 vigils were held across the \n     Nation in Larry's memory, and more than 18,000 students from \n     more than 6,500 middle and high schools came together to \n     commemorate his death;\n       Whereas one year later, vigils continue to be organized to \n     call for an end to violence, bullying, and harassment in \n     schools in the United States;\n       Whereas in 2007, 85 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \n     transgender students were verbally harassed at school because \n     of their sexual orientation, and more than 20 percent of \n     those students were physically assaulted because of their \n     sexual orientation;\n       Whereas the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network's \n     2007 National School Climate Survey showed that when students \n     are harassed or assaulted at school, they find it difficult \n     to focus on their school work, their grades drop, and they \n     attend school less often; and\n       Whereas schools should be a place where all children can \n     learn and grow in a safe environment, free from bullying and \n     harassment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors and remembers the life of Lawrence ``Larry'' \n     King;\n       (2) condemns all hate crimes; and\n       (3) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, and the people of the United States to take \n     immediate steps to stop bullying and harassment in the \n     Nation's schools.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution to \nhonor the memory of Lawrence ``Larry'' King, a 15-year-old boy who was \nshot and killed at a California junior high school on this day last \nyear.\n  Larry's story is a tragic and is a poignant reminder of why it is so \nimportant to stop bullying and violence in our schools.\n  Larry King was a spirited boy who grew up in Oxnard, California.\n  At the age of 10, he told the other kids at school that he was gay, \nand many of them teased and taunted him as a result. At his first \nschool, the bullying became so harsh that his parents had to transfer \nhim to a different school. But the transfer seemed like a good one, and \nalthough Larry still endured teasing, he made some very close friends.\n  Near the beginning of last year, Larry decided to change the way he \ndressed. He started wearing girls' accessories, makeup, and a pair of \nhigh heels that he bought for himself at Target.\n  In February, he asked one of his male classmates to be his Valentine. \nThe boys exchanged heated words, and the next morning Larry came to \nschool dressed plainly and looking nervous and out of sorts.\n  He had English as his first class and he sat with the other students, \nincluding the boy he had asked to be his Valentine. The class was in \nthe school's computer lab and the students sat typing up their papers.\n  At 8:30 a.m., the other boy stood up and fatally shot Larry. He had \nhidden a handgun in his bag, which he took out, and simply stood up \nsilently and shot Larry twice in the back of the head. Larry died in \nthe hospital two days later.\n  This act of violence is shocking and devastated his parents, and the \nOxnard community.\n  I strongly oppose hate crimes of all kinds. When victims are targeted \nbecause of who they are--because of their race, their religion, their \nsexual orientation, or national origin--the harm runs very deep.\n  Hate crimes can cause lengthy emotional trauma; they can make people \nafraid to express their identities; and they are deeply divisive and \ncan tear our communities apart.\n  Hate crimes and bullying in schools can cause even deeper harm.\n  According to a School Climate Survey in 2007, over 85 percent of gay, \nlesbian, bisexual, and transgender students were verbally harassed at \nschool. And more than 20 percent of these students had been physically \nassaulted.\n  The survey also found that when children were bullied or harassed, \nthey attended school less and their grades began to drop.\n  This bullying and violence has to stop. I am introducing this \nresolution today to commemorate the life of this young boy and to draw \nattention to the need for increased efforts to end bullying and \nviolence in our schools. Schools should be safe places where children \ncan learn and grow, free from harassment or any threat of physical \nattack.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to urge my colleagues to pass \nhate crimes legislation this year so that our federal law will be clear \nthat crimes based on a person's sexual orientation, gender identity, or \ndisability are crimes of hate and must be vigorously prosecuted because \nof the great harm that they cause to our communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2346-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2346-S2347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on small business and entrepreneurship\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

We hope to complete this bill by the end \nof the week.\n  I would recognize that the House is going to take up, the week we get \nback, the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Friday, February 26, is an announced no-vote day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2348-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, just in closing, it has been a long, hard \nseveral weeks for our valiant staff, and there is not any way anyone \ncould suggest well enough the enormous contributions they make to \nmaking this body flourish the way it does.\n  We have gotten a tremendous amount of work done this first working \nperiod of this Congress. We should be proud of what we have done. We \nhave passed the most sweeping environmental bill in more than 25 years. \nWe have passed the discrimination bill, the Lilly Ledbetter bill, which \nis an important piece of legislation for women all over America. We \npassed the Children's Health Insurance Program, which allow millions of \nAmerican children to have health insurance coverage that they would not \nhave ordinarily. And we just passed this bill to help our struggling \neconomy. So I think the American people should see that we have worked \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to accomplish a lot.\n  We are so fortunate to have our new President. It is a pleasure to \nwork with him. I have had, this past couple of weeks, the ability to \nvisit with him firsthand in legislative combat.\n  They are competent. I am so impressed. The President's chief of staff \nRahm Emanuel--we could not have done this without his assistance, \nguidance, and directness.\n  We had the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Peter Orszag, \nwho I called personally last night to tell him that I know he is not a \nlongtime person involved in politics, but he is a natural. He is a \nbrilliant man. He has a degree from Princeton. He has a Ph.D. from the \nLondon School of Economics. I am very impressed with this man, who I \ndid not know other than to say hello to, but I have gotten to know him \nwell because we have spent days together in the last short period of \ntime.\n  The President's representative up here, who we will deal with all the \ntime, Phil Schiliro, has done a really wonderful job.\n  Rob Nabors, who was the longtime staff assistant, director of the \nAppropriations Committee for Chairman Obey, has been magnificent in his \nwork for the White House, working as Peter Orszag's assistant.\n  There are a lot of people who allowed us to get to where we are, and \nI appreciate very much their help. It was a real long, hard pull.\n  The Presiding Officer, my dear friend, the senior Senator from the \nState of Illinois, who came to Washington with me in 1982, has been \ninvaluable during this very difficult time working on this bill.\n  Senator Schumer of New York, of course, works with me and Senator \nDurbin on all the things we do.\n  And the final point of that legislative team is Patty Murray. She is \nsuch a contributor to this Senate. I have such respect for her. She has \nsuch a soft touch, but she is as strong as anybody in the Senate.\n  I am not going to go through the entire list of people. Many, many \nworked hard.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye, is a \nhero in many different ways. He is a Member of the Senate who has had \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor awarded to him for his valiant efforts \nin World War II.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, was involved \nin this from the very beginning and did such a great job.\n  My personal staff has spent longer hours than I have put in. My chief \nof staff Gary Myrick is very quiet but such a help to me and the \nSenate; Randy Devalk, everyone in the Senate depends on him. He is a \nwealth of knowledge, a fountain of legislative information, and he has \njust been, really, a remarkably good person.\n  Mr. President, I am sure I have left off people, but this piece of \nlegislation, I am so happy we were able to get it done.\n  I will never, ever forget the valiancy of those three brave \nRepublicans who broke from the pack and stood alone to tell America \nthat we needed to do something with our economy which needed help: \nSenator Snowe from Maine, and Senator Collins from Maine, Senator \nSpecter from Pennsylvania. But for them we would not be where we are.\n  Senator Inouye was masterful in what he did. Senator Baucus was \ntremendous in the Finance Committee, and his staff. Senator Baucus's \nstaff was really very good, led by Russ Sullivan, who we depend on--all \nof us--for his knowledge. He is a CPA. He has been a feature in the \nSenate for a long time and he was so very important.\n  I did not mention a person we have come to depend on in the Senate--\nall of us--because he has been the chief person on the Appropriations \nCommittee for Senator Byrd, and that is Chuck Kieffer, who was with us \nall the time, as was Senator Inouye's chief clerk on the Appropriations \nCommittee, Charlie Houy.\n  Now, as I said, I am sure I have missed a few people because this \nwas, really, a big team effort.\n  In my own mind, this piece of legislation is the most important piece \nof legislation I have worked on for the country. The country is in \ntrouble, and we are so fortunate we were able to get it passed. It is \ngoing to give this country a shot in the arm. My State of Nevada needs \nthis so very much. We are going to have a number of meetings in Nevada \nnext week to talk about all the good that will flow to Nevada as a \nresult of its passage.\n  As usual, Lula Davis is so important to how we function here. She is \nthe person who tells us how we can move forward on things. She is \ninvaluable to every Democratic Senator, and especially to me.\n  As I announced earlier, Mr. President, the next vote will occur at 11 \na.m., Tuesday, February 24. That vote will be on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to the District of Columbia House \nvoting rights legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/13/senate-section/article/S2348-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2009, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
