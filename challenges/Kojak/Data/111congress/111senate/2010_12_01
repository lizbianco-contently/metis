Mr. President, last night we began the rule XIV process on \ntwo important bills--the DREAM Act and Firefighters Collective \nBargaining.\n  It had been my intent to file cloture on both of these bills. \nHowever, supporters of the original bills requested that modifications \nbe made.\n  Those changes are reflected in the bills we introduced last night, \nand I intend to move forward on both of these.\n  In addition, I intend to file cloture this week on the 9/11 health \nbill. So I will file cloture on all three at the same time.\n  The current continuing resolution expires this Friday. We are \nawaiting House action on short term CR which we will receive later this \nweek.\n  I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will allow us to act \nquickly on this short term CR when we receive it.\n  As we work to clear the short term CR, the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees are working on legislation to fund the \ngovernment for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n  Earlier this morning, I received a letter from my Republican \ncolleagues indicating they will filibuster any legislative matter \nbrought to the floor prior to the completion of the spending and tax \nbills. No one is more eager to put both these issues behind us than I; \nhowever, passing either will require Republican votes. I wish I could \nreport we are close to wrapping up action on both bills, but we are \nnot.\n  The first meeting that was requested by the President is taking place \nthis morning. Senator McConnell chose Senator Kyl to represent \nRepublicans. I chose the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nBaucus, to represent Democrats. So they are moving forward on that to \nsee if there is something that can be worked out. My Republican \ncolleagues knew this, as they\n\n[[Page S8310]]\n\ndrafted this letter; therefore, they also know that the true effect of \nthis letter is to prevent the Senate from acting on many important \nissues that have bipartisan support. With this letter, they have simply \nput in writing the political strategy the Republicans have pursued this \nentire Congress; namely, obstruct and delay action on critical matters \nand then blame Democrats for not addressing the needs of the American \npeople. It is cynical but obvious and transparent.\n  We must move forward on matters of importance. We have numerous \njudges who need to be taken care of. I am trying to work something out \nwith the Republican leader on those. I hope everyone understands there \nare issues we need to deal with. There are meetings going on as we \nspeak to try to help us move forward and to allow us to complete action \nat the earliest possible date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8310-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the last 2 years, Democratic \nleaders in Washington have spent virtually all of their time ticking \noff items on the liberal wish list while they have had the chance: \ngovernment-run health care, a national energy tax, financial \nregulations, bigger government, bigger deficits, union bailouts, \ngovernment takeovers. So here we are, with just a few weeks left in the \nsession, and they are still at it.\n  Last month, the American people issued their verdict on the \nDemocratic priorities. Democrats have responded by doubling down. For 2 \nyears, they legislated as if they were not in the middle of a national \njobs crisis, and now they are legislating as if they do not realize the \ngovernment is about to run out of money and every taxpayer in America \nis about to get slammed with a giant tax hike.\n  With just a few weeks to go before the end of the session, Democrats \ncontinue to place their priorities over the priorities of the American \npeople. These are the things Democrats have chosen to do instead of \npreventing a massive tax hike that economists tell us would stifle the \neconomy.\n  Republicans have pleaded with Democrats to put aside their wish list, \nto focus on the things Americans want us to focus on. They have ignored \nus. The voters repudiated their agenda at the polls. They have ignored \nthem. Time is running out, and they are ignoring that.\n  The election was a month ago. It is time to get serious. It is time \nto focus on priorities.\n  Now, a little while ago, I delivered a letter to Senator Reid signed \nby all 42 Senate Republicans. It says every Republican will vote \nagainst proceeding to any legislative matter until we have funded the \ngovernment and protected every taxpayer from a tax hike. Basically, \nwhat it means is, first things first.\n  With time running out in this session, we need to focus on these \ncritical priorities. As the letter states:\n\n       Our constituents have repeatedly asked us to focus on \n     creating an environment for private-sector job growth; it is \n     time that our constituents' priorities become the Senate's \n     priorities.\n\n  At the moment, every taxpayer in the country stands to get a massive \ntax increase and a cut in pay on December 31. We need to show the \nAmerican people we care more about them and their ability to pay their \nbills than we do about the special interest groups' legislative \nChristmas list. Republicans are united in our opposition to proceeding \nto any of these things until Democrats make the priorities of the \nAmerican people their own.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to Senator \nReid I just referenced be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 29, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, Capitol Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: The nation's unemployment level, stuck \n     near 10 percent, is unacceptable to Americans. Senate \n     Republicans have been urging Congress to make private-sector \n     job creation a priority all year. President Obama in his \n     first speech after the November election said ``we owe'' it \n     to the American people to ``focus on those issues that affect \n     their jobs.'' He went on to say that Americans ``want jobs to \n     come back faster.'' Our constituents have repeatedly asked us \n     to focus on creating an environment for private-sector job \n     growth; it is time that our constituents' priorities become \n     the Senate's priorities.\n       For that reason, we write to inform you that we will not \n     agree to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to any \n     legislative item until the Senate has acted to fund the \n     government and we have prevented the tax increase that is \n     currently awaiting all American taxpayers. With little time \n     left in this Congressional session, legislative scheduling \n     should be focused on these critical priorities. While there \n     are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the \n     Senate's attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters \n     above the critical issues of funding the government and \n     preventing a job-killing tax hike.\n       Given our struggling economy, preventing the tax increase \n     and providing economic certainty should be our top priority. \n     Without Congressional action by December 31, all American \n     taxpayers will be hit by an increase in their individual \n     income-tax rates and investment income through the capital \n     gains and dividend rates. If Congress were to adopt the \n     President's tax proposal to prevent the tax increase for only \n     some Americans, small businesses would be targeted with a \n     job-killing tax increase at the worst possible time. \n     Specifically, more than 750,000 small businesses will see a \n     tax increase, which will affect 50 percent of small-business \n     income and nearly 25 percent of the entire workforce. The \n     death tax rate will also climb from zero percent to 55 \n     percent, which makes it the top concern for America's small \n     businesses. Republicans and Democrats agree that small \n     businesses create most new jobs, so we ought to be able to \n     agree that raising taxes on small businesses is the wrong \n     remedy in this economy. Finally, Congress still needs to act \n     on the ``tax extenders'' and the alternative minimum tax \n     ``patch,'' all of which expired on December 31, 2009.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you in a \n     constructive manner to keep the government operating and \n     provide the nation's small businesses with economic certainty \n     that the job-killing tax hike will be prevented.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mitch McConnell, Republican Leader; Jon Kyl, Republican \n           Whip; Robert F.

Mr. President, I wasn't planning to actually come to the \nfloor this morning, but as we prepare for the day, sometimes we watch \nthose who make comments and reflect on what was talked about yesterday \nand what we discussed and what we see on the floor. I have this new \nattitude that as I see people put information on the floor that has to \nhave a balance to it, I am going to come out and give that balance when \nI can. The biggest one is on the economy.\n  I sat here yesterday and heard some folks on the other side \ncomplaining that it took us a week to deal with the food safety law, \nand they wondered why. Well, it is because the other side continues to \nrequire filibusters for 30 hours. I know the Presiding Officer has been \nworking aggressively on this to try to figure out a way to get things \non this floor more quickly so we can have a debate. But what shocked me \nis, they complained that it took a week when, in fact, their delay \ntactics caused the week delay. So they wonder why. They create the \nproblem and then they complain about the problem.\n  The bigger issue is on the economy. The Presiding Officer and I came \nhere 2 years ago. We came and were sworn in, in this Chamber, in \nJanuary of 2009. This economy was collapsing. It was a disaster. It did \nnot matter if you were from Alaska or New Mexico; wherever you went, \nyou heard the stories about the problems with the economy and where we \nwere headed. It was incumbent upon us to do as many things as possible \nto assist the economy to grow, to figure out the pathway. Not all ideas \nwe laid on the table that passed were perfect, but they were multiple \nand multifaceted, to figure out what to do. The converse is, the other \nside just kept saying no, no, no. They weren't interested in doing \nanything to move this economy forward. We were in a crisis moment.\n  When we think about issues and we look back--and always at the time \nwe are making decisions and we are hoping for the best and we are \ntrying everything possible--it is helpful to remind ourselves where we \nwere. It didn't matter, again, as I said, if you were from Alaska or \nNew Mexico, the economic condition of this country and this world was \nat risk. So we made some moves that were controversial, and today many \nof us don't like to talk about them because the pollsters will tell us: \nThat is bad news; don't talk about it. The public hates it. Maybe it is \nthe TARP or the bailout or the stimulus. Figure out the list.\n  Every day I read Business Week, the Wall Street Journal, CNBC. I look \nat all the business publications online and in print. What I like to \nsee is not what politicians are saying about how the economy is going \nbut what other people are saying--the people who actually work every \nsingle day to try to build this economy. I can speak to this. Meaning \nno disrespect--I know the Presiding Officer is an attorney. I mean no \ndisrespect to the attorneys who are here. We have lots of them in the \nSenate.\n  I am from the private sector. My first business license was at the \nage of 14. My wife owns four retail stores. We are businesspeople. We \nunderstand what it takes to go to the bank and try to scratch a loan \nfrom them to build a business, expand a business. We understand when a \nbanker says no, so we have to go raise capital from other folks to try \nto make our dreams come true.\n  There are a lot of people who come to this floor on the other side \nwho talk a lot about business who have never been in it, who have never \nhad to make a payroll. They have worked their way through another means \nof income. So it is frustrating to me when I hear people who have never \nbeen in it come out on this floor and talk about the business world.\n  Let me give some data points. I will probably do this more often than \nI should over the next several months because the American people have \nheard the story from the other side over and over.\n  I was no big fan of the auto bailout--a lot of us weren't--but 10 \ndays ago, a little blip in the news: GM had the largest initial public \noffering in stock market history. The first day they estimated that \nabout $17 billion would be subscribed to it. Then it was $20 billion. \nThe latest news is $23 billion. The American people put their money on \nthe table and bet on GM: $23 billion. Unbelievable. Actually, what \ntruly shocked me was when I grabbed--and I get it every day, I read it, \nand I think there are incredible news stories. It is not a liberal \nnewspaper--the Wall Street Journal. It has very conservative views on a \nlot of things. But their headline: ``GM Stock Sale in High Gear. \nGovernment-backed carmakers on pace to score one of the largest U.S. \nIPOs ever.''\n  The government owned 61 percent then. With this IPO, it is now down \nto about 26 percent. It clearly shows, even though it was controversial \nand still is controversial, even though no one wants to talk about it, \nthat investment to save an American company in order for it to sustain \nAmerican jobs in this country is succeeding. It is not because I am \nsaying it. It is not because the Presiding Officer might say it or the \nother side now wants to take some credit, which is amazing--I love some \nof the quotes I read.\n  When this first was kicked around, they called it socialism, the \nworld was collapsing, the sky was falling. Now you read the quotes from \nsome of the folks on the other side and they say: Well, with our help, \nwe made it a better deal. They didn't vote for anything to make it a \nbetter deal. That is just a fact. The fact is, we took the risk to make \nan American company survive. That is what we did on this side of the \naisle. Today, that company is more profitable than ever before.\n  When you look at the data, the private sector is successful and the \nAmerican people are investing in that company. That is the true test of \nthe work we did--even though it was controversial--what the outcome \nwas.\n  As I sit here in the last couple of days, I am going to read a couple \nmore data points. Again, it is not me saying this or writing these \nissues; it is the private sector that is identifying where we are going \nin this economy. Later this week, we will get a report--on Friday. I \nheard today in some of the comments that we should let the private \nsector do as much as it can. I 100 percent agree. I come from the \nprivate sector. Many on the other side talk about it, but they have \nnever been there. The private sector added 93,000 jobs last month.\n  When you look at another one, the number I like to look at is \nconsumer confidence. When consumers are more confident about the \neconomy, they will spend more money, drive our economy, and invest in \ntheir country.\n  Interestingly, ``Consumer, Manufacturing Reports Beat Forecasts.'' \nThat came out yesterday. Again, it is another indicator that the \neconomy is moving in the right direction. It is still rough and \nfragile, and the policies are controversial, yes, but we took the risk \nand bet on the American people. That is what the Democrats did. We said \nthat we believe in America, our ingenuity, innovation, and the capacity \nto pull us out of this recession. We are going to help them with some \ntools. They are making it happen.\n  I can tell you this from my wife being in the retail business. Black \nFriday--the Friday after Thanksgiving--is what retailers focus on when \nmoving into the fourth quarter. Is it going to be successful? If you \nlook at all the reports compared to a year ago, retailers have strong \nmomentum coming out of Black Friday. Everyone did very well. That is \nanother good indication.\n  As a matter of fact, one encouraging sign--and this is out of another \nbusiness document. CNBC did this. It comes from the NPD Group, figuring \nout where consumers are after Black Friday and other shopping days. \nShoppers are starting to buy items for themselves. In addition to gifts \nfor others, about 35 percent of shoppers told NPD on Black Friday that \nthey also made purchases for themselves. If shoppers are starting to \nsplurge on themselves, that is an important development. It can push \nthe holiday season past the forecasts.\n  I am not making this up. This is what is happening because, again, \nthis side of the aisle said: We are going to bet on the American \npeople. We are going to bet that the work we did in early 2009, trying \neverything possible\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\nto jump-start this economy, is going to have a payoff down the road \nbecause we are going to focus on the private sector, helping them get \nthe tools they need, just as we did before the August break in passing \nthe small business incentive program and tax incentives and loan \ncapacity. We only received two votes from the other side for that. So \nbe it. We go the road alone. The net result for the last 2 years is \nthat--I have been here for 2 years, and the occupant of the chair has \nbeen on the other side for a decade or so. But we came here to get work \ndone. It may be controversial at times. Leadership is not easy. It is \nnot just saying we are going to do that because everybody loves it. \nSometimes the tough decisions are the ones the public has the hardest \ntime with in the worst situations--the recession. We made some \ndecisions--again not perfect--but the results are slowly and surely \ncoming true.\n  The economy is moving in the right direction. Every time I hear from \nthe other side that the private sector needs to do more--absolutely. As \na matter of fact, the largest companies have more cash in their bank \naccounts today than they have had in decades because they have done \nwell in the last few years in preparing for the new growth that is \noccurring right now in our economy.\n  I didn't plan to come down here. I was getting prepared for a \nCommerce Committee hearing. The occupant of the chair and I are both on \nthat committee. Anybody who suggests we are not focused on this economy \nor on job creation or figuring out how to make sure the middle-class \ntaxpayers of this country get a fair shake and make sure they have a \ntax break coming forward and continuing forward--those who say we are \nnot focused on that are mistaken. I learned this when I was a mayor: We \ncan do more than one thing at a time.\n  The reason I came down to talk is that nobody was talking. It is a \ndead zone. That is what happens. When they come down here and say: Gee, \nI wish we would be working on this or that--well, quit filibustering \nand doing the 30-hour delays and get on with the work. We are \nmultitasking. The American people have asked us to work on jobs, the \neconomy, taxes, and the budget. We are 100 people, and we can do this. \nAnybody who sits around and thinks we are not focused on the economy--\nas someone who lived in the private sector, comes from it, who deals \nwith small businesspeople every single day, I understand exactly what \nthey are feeling. So those who have never experienced that should \nexperience it once and understand that every day is an opportunity.\n  I am going to continue to come down here and talk about the positive \nnews, the opportunities that are occurring from the work we have done \nin the last 2 years. The other side may complain or argue over was it \nright or wrong. The proof will be in the pudding in the fact that other \npeople--not politicians jawboning about it--in the private sector are \ntelling us. We have had some good news over the last several months.\n  The last point I will leave on is another bit of good news. It was \nsmall business again. They do an indicator and try to determine the \nconfidence level of a small businessperson. That is important because \nthe small business community is the largest driver of new employment \nnow and in the future. So you want to make sure their confidence level \nis high. Well, in the last 5 months, it has increased every single \nmonth. I believe it is because of actions we have done here to give \nthem faith that we believe in them, in the American people, and we \nbelieve the ability to move this economy forward is ahead of us, and we \nare doing it today.\n  Again, I will continue to come down here with data points and \narticles--not out of liberal magazines or publications. I heard earlier \ntoday about some liberal agenda. I don't know what that is about. I \nknow what the American agenda is. I know what Alaska's agenda is. That \nis what I am here to do. If we just get off of these partisan kinds of \nactivities and focus on what is right, we can get a lot done around \nthis place. So I will continue to come down here and talk about the \npositive aspects of what is going on in the economy. Believe in the \nfuture and have an attitude of being positive about what we can do, and \nit is amazing what this country and this economy can do.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time I have had to discuss this \nissue. I warned my staff as I left--I said: Turn on the TV. I didn't \ntell them why I was coming here. They will ask me when I get back what \nI was doing. I will come down and talk about the positive aspects of \nthis economy and will no longer listen to the other side naysay with \nnegative attitudes. We have an economy that is improving--fragile but \nimproving in the right direction because we on this side bet on the \nAmerican people. I believe we bet right.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, we are a few hours into the month of \nDecember, 2010. Normally, the month of December means holiday times for \nmost American families. For Jewish Americans, Hanukkah starts at \nsundown. As anyone who visits a department store knows, Santa Claus is \nalready as much a fixture as the shelves and lights. The congressional \nChristmas tree will be lit in a few days.\n  This should be a happy time for families. But the festive mood is \ndampened by the high unemployment and the slow economic growth rate in \nthis country.\n  Too many businesses are struggling. Too many investors are holding \nback their capital. Too many workers are idled. And here in Washington, \nwe hear too much talk and take too little action to effectively address \nthese problems.\n  For almost 4 years, our friends on the other side have failed to take \naction on the tax increase that will soon hit virtually every income \ntaxpaying American.\n  There is bipartisan resolution staring us all in the face. It is the \nonly bipartisan compromise. I am talking about a seamless extension of \ncurrent bipartisan tax policy that was enacted in 2001 and 2003. How is \nit the only bipartisan compromise on the table?\n  Look no further than the statements of members themselves. I am aware \nof no Republican in the House or Senate favoring less than a full \nprevention of the widespread tax hikes set to kick in in 31 short days.\n  Democrats are split. That is why we have seen no action for almost 4 \nyears. It seems they may be split three ways.\n  I have heard rumors that many Democrats in both bodies would \nprivately prefer current law; that is, they would prefer to leave the \nlaw as it is and let the tax hikes kick in. But that is a privately \nheld sentiment. The politics of advocating a tax increase on virtually \nevery American income taxpayer are not, shall we say, compelling. This \nis the first group.\n  The second group is aligned with President Obama's budget. That \nposition would guarantee a marginal tax rate hike on all small business \nowners with incomes above $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married. \nThat's the second group.\n  A significant number of Democratic House and Senate Members have \nsignaled that a short-term seamless extension of all current law tax \nrelief is their preferred course. That is the third group.\n  There might be a fourth group who think that we ought to raise that \n$200,000 to $500,000, and that $250,000 to $1 million. But that still \nhits small business right in the face at a time when we need to create \njobs. We Republicans understand that. I cannot understand why my \nDemocratic friends do not seem to understand that. The Presiding \nOfficer understands that.\n  Republicans generally support a permanent tax freeze. That position \nis embodied in Leader McConnell's bill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor \nof that bill. But we Republicans know that, as good as that policy is, \nwe will not likely find at least 18 Democrats to join us. We likely \nwill not get 60 votes for it now. We would make it permanent if we \ncould.\n  The wisdom of the bipartisan compromise is that it keeps intact the \npolitical glue that made the bipartisan tax relief possible in the \nfirst place.\n\n[[Page S8313]]\n\n  Republicans supported the original plan because of the mix of two key \ntax relief policies. The first policy was tax relief for America's \nfamilies. The second policy was tax relief designed to spur economic \ngrowth.\n  The fact that we are divided now is due to the Democratic \nleadership's insistence that the growth incentives part of the \ncompromise be broken off. They want to break it off, using language \nlike ``decoupling,'' and discard the pro-growth policy.\n  That is the essence of the difference.\n  Democrats are split, but the Democratic leadership is united on the \npoint of breaking off the pro-growth piece of the policy.\n  In an effort to avoid the obvious compromise, two members of the \nSenate Democratic leadership have put forward a new proposal. The \nproposal would apply the pending rate hikes to single taxpayers at \n$500,000 of income and married couples at $1 million of income. This \nlatest partisan proposal is said to be necessary for fiscal reasons. \nFinance Committee Republican staff, using data from the non-partisan \nJoint Committee on Taxation, conducted a preliminary analysis of this \nproposal. They concluded that less than half the revenue sought by the \nDemocratic leadership would be raised by this proposal. That tells me \nthe reason behind this new proposal may be ideological.\n  Now, some may ask why Republicans do not give in and agree to hike \ntaxes on those earning over $500,000 or $1 million. Certainly, it puts \na fine point on the usual political game of class warfare.\n  To those of us on this side of the aisle, the sting of the proposal's \npolitical shot is far outweighed by its economic harm. Why is it so \nimportant?\n  Let me turn to two broad principles where Democrats and Republicans \ngenerally agree. The first principle is that a healthy growing economy \nis a very good antidote to our fiscal ailments. The second principle is \nthat small business will be the source of new jobs. Do not think you'll \nfind much daylight between Republicans and Democrats on these \nprinciples.\n  Now, let's consider the merits of this so-called ``millionaire'' tax \nin light of these bipartisan principles.\n  Fiscal history shows, without question that revenues will grow and \ntemporary social safety net entitlement spending will drop if the \neconomy grows. I have a chart that shows this history. If you follow \nthis chart, you will see revenue is very sensitive to the changes in \ngrowth. Revenue is red, GDP is green. Growth goes up. Revenue goes up. \nGrowth goes down. Revenue goes down.\n  It is well established that capital is the lifeblood of business. \nAccording to Answers.Com and I quote:\n\n       CAPITAL is the life by which the body [of business] \n     operates. A business without finance is like a body in coma. \n     No matter how great the environment is, the entity is \n     considered dead. It is the blood that keeps men alive. Drain \n     the blood and watch life end for even the strongest and most \n     privileged human that exists.\n\n  No one disputes the notion that taxpayers with incomes above $500,000 \nfor singles and $1 million for married couples are a small fraction of \nthe taxpaying population. But they account for a lot of capital gain \nincome.\n  A proposal to raise the marginal rate on capital gain income by 33 \npercent on this group may seem like it would have minimal impact on the \npool of capital income. Internal Revenue Service data indicate the \ncontrary is true. The latest data from IRS Statistics of Income \ndivision are revealing.\n  According to SOI, taxpayers at $1 million and over accounted for \n56\\1/2\\--percent of the net long-term capital gain income for 2008. \nThis figure reached close to 70 percent the year before. Keep in mind \nthat statistic understates the impact. The reason is that the capital \ngain income for single taxpayers with income between $500,000 and $1 \nmillion is not counted.\n  The proposed so-called millionaire's tax would pile up rates on this \nlarge pool of capital income. I have a chart that illustrates the \nimpact. The chart shows the current tax rate for this group of \ntaxpayers rising to almost 24 percent in a little over two years. That \nmeans an almost 60 percent higher tax take on earnings from capital \nfrom current law.\n\n  If capital is the lifeblood of business, does it make sense to make \nthe investment of it dramatically less attractive? Considering the \ncurrent slow growth, jobless recovery, should we put in place policy \nthat drives down the after-tax rate of return on capital?\n  I have talked only about the hike on capital income since flow-\nthrough small business income would be adversely affected by the tax \nhikes on ordinary income. You can see I am concerned. Look what that \nmeans. It is true that these small business owners would be earning \nover $500,000 if single and over $1 million if married. They represent \na significant portion of the ownership of small businesses that will \ncreate new jobs. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation, the President's tax hikes would hit half of flow-through \nsmall business income. I do not have the same calculation for this \nrevised proposal. But do we have the margin for error? In this rough \npatch of our economic history, shouldn't the policy bias be towards \nbusiness expansion? Why should we send the opposite signal? In this \neconomic climate, what justifies a higher marginal rate of 17 percent \non the most successful of our small businesses? Why hit the small \nbusinesses most likely to expand and hire people and give them jobs?\n  The way is clear. To my friends in the Democratic leadership, and \nthey are my friends, I dare say, everybody in this body is a friend of \nmine. There are good people here. Why are we not working in a \nbipartisan way to solve these proposals? I say throw down the partisan \nweapons. Don't sharpen them with a more partisan, edgy proposal, like \nthe so-called ``millionaire's tax.'' On our side, we would like to keep \nthe current low tax rates in effect. We want them to be permanent. We, \nhowever, recognize that the legislative calendar of this session is \nabout to end. We are ready to take a short-term time out with a \nseamless short-term extension of current tax relief. I ask our friends \non the other side to do the same.\n  Now, it is no secret that 42 all 42 Republicans have said we should \ngo to work on these problems right now and quit playing games around \nhere. And we are unwilling to let anything else go forward until we \nsolve these problems. These problems are the problems of extending the \ncurrent tax relief for everybody.\n  We would like it to be permanent. Most of the Democrats would not \nlike it to be permanent. There has to be a way of bringing us together. \nWe are not going to agree, it seems to me. We are not going to be free \nto go to what our friends on the other side want to do and increase \ntaxes at this time in the economic history of this country.\n  All 42 Republicans have signed a letter making it clear we will not \nget cloture on anything until we resolve these problems. Then let's go \nto work after that. If the leadership does want to keep playing around \nin December, in the holiday season, let's at least go to work on other \nproblems. I can think of a lot of other problems. For instance, the so-\ncalled SGR doc fix. The Democrats have taken $500 billion out of \nMedicare. If they took $282 billion of that, that solves the doc fix. \nWe don't have to worry about it every year as we do right now. That \nmoney is there. What about the death tax? If we don't solve the death \ntax, it dramatically goes up. Who does it hurt? Small businesspeople, \nfarmers, and others who don't have all the lawyers in the world to help \nthem evade those taxes.\n  What about the alternative minimum tax? That was a tax that was \nsupposed to affect 155 multimillionaires who didn't pay taxes that \nyear. Today it will affect 23 to 26 million people, many in the middle \nclass. Democrats always talk like they want to get rid of it, but they \nlove it because it means more revenue for them to spend. Why don't we \nget rid of it? Even if we don't have an offset, I prefer to get rid of \nit because it goes up every year. We have to patch it every year, it \ncosts billions of dollars, where if we do it once, it is a one-hit \nthing that at least we know where we are and we can work the deficit \ndown from there.\n  What about the research and development tax credit? Virtually \neverybody in this body knows how important that is to our high-tech \nindustry, which in some ways is not competitive because we always foul \nit up. It has now been absent for a year because even though the \nDemocrats have had abject control\n\n[[Page S8314]]\n\nof this body and could have done anything they wanted to do to preserve \nit and protect it, they haven't done a doggone thing. As somebody who \nworks on intellectual property issues day in and day out and has done \nso for 34 years in the Senate and has done so in a bipartisan way--and \nI don't think anybody on the other side can say I haven't worked with \nthem in these areas; Senator Leahy and I worked together very closely \non these issues--why aren't we making it possible for our high-tech \nworld to create jobs by being more competitive, by giving them what we \nall basically agree they should have and do it permanently; that is, \nthe research and development tax credit.\n  These are just a few things I think we ought to be able to get \ntogether on in a bipartisan way and accomplish at the end of this year.\n  If I was the President--and I am not, but if I was, and it is nice to \nspeculate every once in a while, especially on the floor of the Senate, \nwhen we see all these problems--I would be banging on Democrats and \nRepublicans to resolve these problems I have been discussing today. The \nPresident would have all December. He would have all January, \nvirtually, since we don't get geared up and going very much until \nFebruary. He would have most of February, and he might even have most \nof March almost all to himself and to his organization in the White \nHouse. I can't understand, for the life of me, why the President isn't \nweighing in to get this problem solved now as well as the problems I \nhave been talking about. It is to his advantage. Instead, we will play \nthese phony political games right up to Christmas Day. We have done \nthat before. I can live with that. I can work on Christmas Day, as far \nas I am concerned. But it is ridiculous what is going on around here. \nIt is ridiculous. Here we have 3 or 4 days gone, where hardly anything \nis going to be done, where we could resolve these problems.\n  We have this group together. It is a good group with good \nrepresentatives from the House and Senate and, of course, the Treasury \nSecretary and the Director of OMB. I have high hopes they will wise up \nand come to a conclusion that this is what we have to do and do it as \nquickly as we can, in the best interests of the country, so there is \nsome certainty for our business community to create jobs and our banks \nto start loaning again and for others to get involved in the economy. \nThis is to the advantage of the President. I don't understand why he is \nnot beating on the guys on the other side and over there in the House \nto wake up and do what is right. Then let's get this over with and get \nthis country back on track again.\n  Republicans are dedicated to try to resolve the problem. We will not \nget pushed around on this. Frankly, we want to solve it with our \nfriends on the other side. I just hope we can.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we come to the end of the year and \nthe end of the session, I want to talk about what is happening for the \nAmerican people, for small businesses, what is happening in terms of \nthe Senate, and what is at stake as we come to the end of the year for \nAmerican families, folks who are struggling every day, people trying to \nkeep in the middle class, get into the middle class, a small business \ntrying to keep its head above water, as well as our manufacturers, and \nso on.\n  It is extremely concerning to me that colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle--and they have shown it again today in a letter that was \nwritten to the leader--are willing to risk everything in order to get a \nbonus round of tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. They are \nliterally willing to stop everything, risk everything in the economy, \nin order to get an extra tax cut.\n  The reason I say ``extra'' or ``bonus'' is because we have in front \nof us an agreement that 97 percent of the public who earn less than \n$250,000 a year for their family should be continuing to receive tax \ncuts permanently. Everyone who has income up to $250,000, whether their \nreal income is $1 billion or not, they get a tax cut up to $250,000 of \ntheir income. So the question we will be answering this month is \nwhether millionaires and billionaires get a bonus, get an extra tax cut \non top of that.\n  Here, as shown on this chart, is what the Republicans are willing to \nput at risk. I say to the Presiding Officer, who heard it as well as I \ndid throughout the year, talking about the deficit, how we needed to \nstop the exploding deficit, that we need to bring deficits down, in \norder to get a bonus tax cut for millionaires and billionaires, they \nare willing to risk the Federal deficit, balloon it another $700 \nbillion--not paid for.\n  Now they are saying we ought to pay for unemployment benefits for \nsomebody who lost their job in this economy through no fault of their \nown. But $700 billion? The average tax cut is $100,000 for somebody \nearning $1 million. Mr. President, $100,000 is more than the average \nperson in Michigan makes. My guess is, in West Virginia it is the same.\n  So in order to keep $100,000 a year going in a bonus tax cut for \npeople earning $1 million, they are willing to risk the Federal deficit \nexploding. They are willing to risk jobs because we have seen a policy \nin the last 10 years of basically giving tax cuts to folks at the top \nand everybody else waiting for them to trickle down. My folks are \ntired. I think colleagues on the other side of the aisle just think we \nhave not waited long enough for this to trickle down to everybody else. \nBut the reality is that policy they want to continue, that explodes \ndeficits, gives a bonus tax cut for people at the top, has not created \njobs.\n  In fact, my question is, after 10 years of tax cuts for the wealthy, \nwhere are the jobs? My State has lost over 800,000 jobs during the \nperiod of this bonus tax cut policy for millionaires and billionaires. \nIf it had worked, if we had created 800,000 jobs in Michigan rather \nthan losing 800,000 jobs, I would be on the floor of the Senate \nfighting to continue this policy.\n  This is not partisanship. This is about common sense and what works. \nWe have had a policy in place that has not worked, so why would we \ncontinue it? They say we have to continue this because we are in a \nrecession.\n  This is part of the reason we are in a recession in terms of the fact \nthat it did not invest in the right way. If we want to take those \ndollars and put them back into clean energy manufacturing and focus on \nmaking things in America, if we want to put it into what that we know \nis actually going to focus on jobs, good-paying, middle-class jobs, I \nam all for it. But $700 billion of a policy that has not worked for 10 \nyears makes no sense.\n  So that is my question. Where are the jobs? Show me the jobs, and I \nwill be the first person on the Senate floor voting yes to continue it. \nBut they are willing to risk the deficit. They are willing to risk \njobs. They are willing now, in the letter they have sent to the leader \ntoday, to risk tax cuts for middle-class families and small businesses \nby saying: Do you know what. We are not going to do anything else until \nwe continue the tax cuts for everybody in this country, including \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  They are not willing to work with us to make sure middle-class \nfamilies, who are the folks who need to have money back in their \npockets, and small businesses, that need that money back in their \npockets, get permanent help. Then we can work on the rest of it where \npeople disagree.\n  We are going to hear a lot about small business. And I find it quite \nsurprising that colleagues have filibustered in the last 2 years 16 \ndifferent tax cuts for small business--a small business jobs bill to \nmake capital available for small business so they can keep their heads \nabove water, refinance, grow their business. Personally, I am not going \nto be lectured by people who voted against 16 different tax cuts in the \nlast 2 years for small businesses, who are now using small businesses \nto hide behind--the folks who are hiding behind small businesses that \nthey are holding up as the ones for whom they are fighting.\n  We are happy on our side. We take a back seat to no one on fighting \nfor\n\n[[Page S8315]]\n\nsmall business. I thank our Chair, Mary Landrieu, who was on the Senate \nfloor over and over from the Small Business Committee and a wonderful \ngroup of colleagues who fought and fought to make sure we put forward a \nbill--it took way too long because of foot dragging, everybody trying \nto throw sand in the gears, but we finally got it passed, a tremendous \namount of effort to increase capital and to add eight tax cuts in the \nsmall business jobs bill, on which only two Republican colleagues had \nthe courage to step across the aisle and join us. We are very grateful \nthey were willing to do that.\n  But the Senate Republican caucus is willing to put all of that in \njeopardy, hold hostage tax cuts needed by people--working people, \nmiddle-class families, small businesses--if they cannot get a bonus tax \ncut for millionaires and billionaires.\n  They are also willing, frankly, to jeopardize Social Security and \nMedicare. We have a debt commission coming up with proposals that are \nvery concerning. There are tough decisions about Social Security and \nMedicare going forward because we have a deficit. They are saying: Oh \nwell, wait a minute. First, you have to increase the deficit by $700 \nbillion in order to give millionaires and billionaires a tax cut. No, \nwe don't care. We don't care if that impacts Social Security and \nMedicare and tough decisions that have to be made for seniors who live \non Social Security and Medicare.\n  The most important thing--and we have heard this over and over--is we \ndon't care if it is paid for, it doesn't matter if it is paid for or if \nanything else gets done for national security. We are not going to take \nup the START treaty. We don't care about our relationship with Russia. \nWe don't care about national security issues. We want a tax cut for our \nfriends, the millionaires and billionaires, adding $700 billion to the \ndebt. They are willing to risk it all, stop the tax cuts for middle-\nclass families and small businesses, in order to get that bonus tax \ncut.\n  Finally--and most insulting to me of all--is they can stand and say \nwe will not support helping people who are out of work in an economy \nthat is way beyond normal, where there are five people looking for \nevery one job. In my State, you are talking about folks who have never \nbeen out of work before in their life and they are mortified and they \nare doing everything they can to hold it together. They are trying \ndesperately to keep their heads above water, while their houses are \nunderwater, and they may not have been able to have their kids continue \nin college this year. Folks are trying to make it, and they are saying \nwe didn't create this economy, create the crisis on Wall Street or \ncreate all the rest of this. They have done nothing but play by the \nrules their whole lives, and now they are in a situation where they \ncan't find a job.\n  I have talked to a lot of folks, 50, 55, 60 years old, who worked all \ntheir lives. We are coming up to the holidays now. All they want to do \nis what we have always done as a country in the case of high \nunemployment; that is, allow them to receive unemployment benefits to \nget them through a tough time temporarily, while we should be focusing \non jobs because people want to work. People don't want to get $200 or \n$300 in unemployment benefits. They want to work. They want the dignity \nof work. Americans know how to work and they want to work. They are \nlooking to us to create a climate of certainty in the marketplace, \nworking with businesses so they can get a job.\n  But here we have a situation where the Republicans in the House \nturned down unemployment benefits yesterday. Senator Jack Reed came to \nthe floor to ask unanimous consent--which I will ask again--to be able \nto extend unemployment benefits, just the regular system. I also \nbelieve we need to add additionally for people who have run out of \ntheir benefits, the ``ninety-niners.'' We need to help them as well. \nThis is just to keep the regular system going, so somebody who loses \ntheir job today or is beginning to lose their job is treated as fairly \nas the person who lost their job on Monday. Right now, the system is up \nin the air.\n  We hear on the other side: My goodness. We can't possibly extend \nunemployment benefits without ``paying for it'' and cutting someplace \nelse. It is, for a year, about $50 billion. That is a lot of money; I \nam not saying it is not. But how about we help pay for it by not giving \na bonus tax cut to millionaires in this country--$700 billion--and \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle do not believe that should be \npaid for. Somehow tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires have \ndifferent rules than a little bit of help for somebody who lost their \njob, through no fault of their own, and is trying to keep their family \ntogether and a roof over their heads in these times.\n  That is a heck of a choice in terms of values. I am amazed. But what \nwe have, as we come to the end of the year, is a situation where \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have indicated they are going \nto continue to block everything. Well, the filibuster is not new. It \nhas been done every day on this floor for the last 2 years. Now they \nare saying that in addition to extending--obviously, getting the budget \ndone, and we all agree with that. But if we don't extend the tax cuts \nfor everybody--meaning millionaires and billionaires--then they are \ngoing to filibuster everything else, including unemployment benefits.\n  Let me say, in closing, that we are in a situation where right now, \ntoday, we could give 97 percent of the public certainty going forward \nabout tax cuts, small businesses, middle-class families, by simply \njoining on a proposal to protect and extend permanently middle-class \ntax cuts and those for the vast majority of small businesses. We \ncertainly can come together in a way that does more for small business. \nThis is the side that voted 16 times for tax cuts for small businesses. \nBut we believe it is economically and morally wrong to allow an average \n$100,000 in additional tax relief for a millionaire next year, while \nsomebody who worked all their life and lost their job, through no fault \nof their own cannot keep a roof over their head this year. It is \nabsolutely not right.\n  By the way, let me just reiterate--because we are going to hear a lot \nabout small businesses--this is not about small businesses. We are \nwilling to come together, as we always have, for small businesses. This \nis about a few people, and not even everyone in that category is asking \nfor a tax cut, by the way. A lot of these folks understand we have the \nbiggest deficit in the history of the country. They are blessed through \ntheir circumstances to be very well off, and many are saying: I want to \ndo my part and I am willing to do my part. Ask me to do my part and I \nwill. They are not asking to hurt people who are out of work in order \nfor them to get another tax cut.\n  Unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle, our colleagues are \nwilling to risk everything--the deficit, jobs, Social Security, \nMedicare, tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses, and help \nfor people who are out of work in order to give a bonus tax cut for a \nprivileged few people. That is not what we are about. That is not what \nwe are about or what we are going to fight for.\n  At this point, because it is absolutely critical that we understand \nwhat families are going through now in this holiday season and that \nsomeone who is losing a job today should be treated as fairly as \nsomebody who lost their job 2 days ago, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Finance Committee be discharged of S. 3981, a bill to provide for \ntemporary extension of unemployment insurance provisions; that the \nSenate then proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be \nread the third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, I understand Senator Brown of Massachusetts objected to \nthis request yesterday and offered a fully offset alternative. \nTherefore, on his behalf, I do object and ask unanimous consent that \nhis proposal be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the unanimous-consent \nrequest offered by Senator Stabenow.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I simply want to say it is a sad day for millions of \nfamilies in this country. This is a message we should\n\n[[Page S8316]]\n\nall be embarrassed to have sent; that millionaires and billionaires \nshould be the ones who are being fought for on the floor of the Senate \nand that millions of people who are out of work don't count. I regret \nthat.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 (Purpose: To provide for a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, welcome to the Senate. It is a pleasure \nto have the Senator from West Virginia joining this body. I will tell \nthe Senator that ever since the health care law has been passed, I come \nto the floor every week as a physician, as someone who has practiced \nmedicine for a quarter of a century, taking care of families across the \nState of Wyoming, to give a doctor's second opinion about the health \ncare law. I bring that each week, bringing a different story of someone \nwho has not been helped by the health care law, someone who has been \nhurt by it, an identifiable victim of the health care law.\n  I heard it at home over Thanksgiving from doctors, nurses, as well as \npatients. I believe this law is going to be bad for patients, for \nproviders, the nurses and doctors who take care of them, as well as for \ntaxpayers. It has been no surprise to me that Americans want and expect \nrepeal of this health care law.\n  The most recent Rasmussen poll showed that Americans support repeal \nof ObamaCare by a margin of 21 percent; 58 percent are for repeal and \n37 percent are not. Independent voters support repeal by 24 percentage \npoints, 59 to 35 percent.\n  So I continue to come to the floor to bring out to our colleagues the \nconcerns I have about the health care law and the concerns I hear at \nhome from patients and from providers and from taxpayers.\n  I wish to mention that recently the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, Kathleen Sebelius, sent a letter to members of the medical \nschool class of 2014. These would be the incoming medical students, \nfirst year medical students in your State and mine. In the letter that \ngoes to about 15,000 or 16,000 first-year medical students, she talks \nabout this health care law and about how she believes it will be good \nfor them as medical students and good for their patients.\n  One of the things she talks about in the letter, interestingly \nenough, is she said that many of you and your siblings are undoubtedly \nunder the age of 26, as many first-year medical students are. She then \nraises the issue that says you will now be able to stay on your \nfamily's insurance policies until you are 26.\n  As you know, this was one of the selling points behind this health \ncare law, that young people would be able to stay on their insurance \npolicies until the age of 26. The Secretary points that out to all \nincoming medical students. I think it came as quite a surprise--it did \nto me, and I think it should have to these medical students and \nothers--to read a story on November 20 in the Wall Street Journal that \ntalks about--the headline is: ``Union Drops Health Coverage for \nWorkers' Children.''\n  The idea was that children were supposed to be covered under this \nhealth care law. I will start by reading this:\n\n       One of the largest union-administered health insurance \n     funds in New York is dropping coverage for the children of \n     more than 30,000 low-wage home attendants, union officials \n     say.\n\n  This is the Service Employees International Union. They are dropping \ncoverage for about 6,000 children. The President has said no children \nwill be dropped. The Secretary said no children will be dropped. Yet a \nunion, which has encouraged, through its lobbying efforts, support of \nthe health care law is now dropping 6,000 children. Why are they doing \nit? It says the health care reform legislation requires plans with \ndependent coverage to expand the coverage up to age 26. What they say \nis:\n\n       Our limited resources are already stretched as far as \n     possible, and meeting this new requirement would be \n     financially impossible.\n\n  During the entire debate on the health care law, people said that \nmany of these rules and regulations and requirements are going to be \nfinancially demanding. Yet this body, before the occupant of the chair \narrived, crammed\n\n[[Page S8317]]\n\nthis law down the throats of the American people--the American people \nwho don't want it or like it and have asked that it be repealed and \nreplaced. Now even one of the unions that lobbied for it is saying: We \nare actually going to drop 6,000 children who had previously been \ncovered because of the legislation, and they say it would be \nfinancially impossible to comply with.\n  So, Mr. President, I looked at the Secretary's letter, I looked at \nthis response, and Tom Coburn, another physician in the Senate, and I \nhad a lot of concerns about the letter the Secretary sent to the \nmedical students of this country. So we also sent a letter, an open \nletter, to America's medical students in the first year of their \nmedical school.\n  What we wanted to do was to first congratulate these young men and \nwomen on dedicating their time, their talent, and their skill in the \nservice to others. We talked about the importance as physicians and as \nmedical students of truly listening to their patients because one of \nthe basic tenets of medicine is nothing should come between a doctor \nand his or her patients. It is important for them to be able to have \nthe time to listen, to focus, and to spend time and not allow anyone or \nanything to come between the doctor and the patient. Yet here in the \nSenate we passed a health care law that puts Washington and faceless \nbureaucrats between the doctor and the patient. We talked about the \nsignificant change in the doctor-patient relationship in this letter \nSenator Coburn and I sent to medical students and our concerns that \nWashington is now going to have more power to determine the care these \nmedical students and future doctors are going to be able to deliver to \ntheir patients. We talked about the 150 new government regulating \nbodies coming out as a result of this 2,700-page bill and that they are \ngoing to intrude upon the doctor-patient relationship. We talked about \nour concerns about what is called cookbook medicine--follow these \nrules--because of the new authorities that have been provided by these \n150 new bodies that have been created by the law and that decisions \nwill be made based on cost rather than on what may be best for the \nindividual patients.\n  The President continues to talk about providing coverage for more \npeople. Well, there is a lot of difference between coverage and care, \nand that is why, when a leader in Saudi Arabia had a recent health \nproblem within the last 2 weeks, he chose to come to the United \nStates--because it is the best care in the world. The World Health \nOrganization may have someone else listed at No. 1, but the ruler from \nSaudi Arabia decided to come to the United States. He didn't go to Cuba \nor England or Canada; he came here for our care. We want the young men \nand women who are in medicine, who are going into medicine and training \nin medicine to be able to provide that kind of care. And we want the \nAmerican people to be able to continue to receive that kind of care. \nUnfortunately, in this body, political passion overtook good policy, \nand a law was passed that I think is not going to be good for patients \nor for providers or for those people paying the bill.\n  So that is what I hear every weekend at home in Wyoming. It may be \nwhat you hear as well. I know you have heard that in your home State. \nYet the President of the United States sat for a wide-ranging interview \nwith Barbara Walters on television the other evening, and when he \ndescribed this health care law, he said he was extraordinarily proud of \nhealth care reform. What I consider a health spending bill he calls a \nlasting legacy which he said, ``I am extraordinarily proud of.''\n  That is one reason I was surprised to see the headline in the \nWashington Post, which actually, I believe, was the same day as the \nPresident's interview with Barbara Walters. In the Washington Post \nedition of Friday, November 26, the front-page headline reads ``Doctors \nSay Medicare Cuts Forcing Them to Shift Away From Elderly.'' Medicare \ncuts are forcing them to shift away from the elderly. This is what we \ntalked about during the debate on the floor of the Senate when that \nhealth care law was being debated, that they have taken $500 billion \naway from Medicare--not to save Medicare, not to help our seniors, not \nto extend the life of Medicare, no, but to start a whole new government \nprogram.\n  That is why every week I come to the floor to offer a doctor's second \nopinion and share with all those in this Chamber and the American \npeople why I believe, as a doctor who has practiced medicine for a long \ntime, that this is a health care law that we need to repeal and \nreplace--replace it with something that is good for patients, good for \nproviders, and good for the taxpayers of this country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8317-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8317-S8318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JOBS, THE ECONOMY, AND HOUSING\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first of all, let me congratulate you on \nyour victory and welcome you to the Senate. I know you will be a great \naddition to the Senate. I have already enjoyed serving with you on the \nHELP Committee this morning.\n  Mr. President, I rise for just a few minutes to talk about three \nissues--jobs, the economy, and housing--that I think all of us around \nthe country will recognize are the three biggest problems thwarting our \nrecovery. There are some realistic solutions that are out there that I \nthink we could all come together on if we would just take the time to \nrealize that working on disagreement rather than finding agreement is \nnot serving the Senate very well right now.\n  One of the reasons we have had a slow job recovery is because of the \nuncertainty American businesses and American wage earners have in what \ntheir tax rates are going to be.\n  I ran a company. It started out as a small company, and it became a \npretty good-sized company. This was the time of year--every December--\nwhen we had our managers' retreat, and we would plan what we would do \nthe next year. We would do our budget, we would talk about new hires, \nnew departments, and new ideas.\n  Right now, corporations and small businesses in this country that are \nsitting around their planning retreats and talking about next year do \nnot know what their tax rates are going to be, they do not know what \ntheir regulatory environment is going to be. So they are doing what \nevery business does: They are making conservative decisions. They are \nnot risking capital. They are going to wait until their future tax \nlives and regulatory lives have some degree of certainty.\n  So one way to bring back jobs to America and bring them back quicker \nthan anything else would be for this Senate and the House to come \ntogether and extend the existing tax rates for a predictable, \nforeseeable period of time so businesses know what the playing field is \ngoing to look like. The absence of certainty between now and the end of \nthe year means that no one will make a decision to hire anybody until \nwe first make a decision on what their taxes are going to be. If we \ndecide they are going to go up, if we capitulate and let the current \nsunset take place, then American businesses, at a time of high \nunemployment and low productivity in terms of business activity, will \nsee an increase in their tax rate and we will see a decrease in \nemployment next year in the United States. I hope that doesn't happen. \nI hope we will find common ground and find a way to extend the existing \ntax rates.\n  Secondly, I wish to talk about housing for a second because it is an \nimportant part of jobs. I know there have been two speeches on the \nfloor this week talking about some stimulus to bring the housing market \nback. One stimulus that will bring it back is to make taxes certain \nbecause if taxes become certain, people know what the taxes will cost \nthem and they make important big-purchase decisions. When they have \nuncertainty in what their income or their net is going to be, they do \nnot make big-ticket purchases, whether it is an automobile or a house.\n  But there are other problems in housing as well. We need to \nfundamentally return to a marketplace that has some degree of liquidity \nin it for acquisition and purchases. Right now, except for the FHA and \nan occasional lender in terms of a jumbo lender to a big-ticket client, \nthere is basically no mortgage money in the United States for an \nAmerican home buyer. Because of mark to market being applied by the\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\nFDIC and the other cease-and-desist orders the banking institution and \nlenders are under, nobody is extending credit.\n  In my State of Georgia--in Atlanta, GA--in 2006 there were 63,000 \nhousing permits. That was 2006, 4 years ago. This year, there were \n5,300. That is a 90-percent reduction in new construction. Granted, we \nwere in a hypereconomy in 2006 and, granted, overbuilding probably \ncontributed to the decline of the economy later on, but a 90-percent \nreduction is unhealthy. If we continue to sustain that reduction, we \nwill continue to sustain what is a difficult economic period now.\n  We need to be looking to the future. So my recommendations are, \nfirst, give us a platform of predictability by extending existing tax \nrates and not raising them in a rescession. That is No. 1. Secondly, \nrecognize there is no liquidity in mortgage money in the United States.\n  The longer we wait to address the question of what happens after \nFreddie and after Fannie, the longer the housing market will suffer. So \nI propose a solution for that problem in terms of housing finance. I \ndon't think there is any question that Freddie and Fannie have to be \nwound down. They are in a conservatorship now. They have already cost \nus billions of dollars, and they will cost us billions more, which is \nwhy I worked hard to get them under the financial reregulation bill so \nwe could peel back the layers of the onion and figure out what went \nwrong, but this body decided not to do that.\n\n  But whatever happens, we have to create a new entity, and whatever \nhappens, it will have to look, in some ways, like Freddie and Fannie \nbut in other ways remarkably different. But there has to be a solution. \nThe long-term solution can't be a government-sponsored entity or an \nimplied government guarantee. That is what imploded in terms of Freddie \nand Fannie. And the taxpayers of America don't want you or me pledging \ntheir future full faith and credit behind a mortgage entity just to \nprovide mortgage money. By the same token, they want us to be leaders, \nto find a way to get from where we are now, with no liquidity, to where \nwe need to be, and that is with good liquidity.\n  Here is my suggestion: we create a new entity to replace Freddie and \nFannie--an entity that ends up having a government-implied sponsorship \nor guarantee, but over a 10-year period of time, it declines 10 percent \na year to zero. During that same 10-year period of time, on every \nmortgage loan made in the United States, a fee will be attached to it \nat closing--maybe it is 50 basis points or half a percent, whatever it \nmight be--that goes into a sinking fund. That sinking fund is walled \noff, and it grows over 10 years. As it grows, the government guarantee \ndeclines--for example, a-100 percent guarantee in the first year of the \nfund, 90 percent in the second year, 80 in the third, going down to \nzero in 10 years. As that fund guarantee goes down, the fund builds up, \nso it becomes the backstop for another failure that may or may not \nhappen in the future but one for which we have to plan.\n  This is not a new idea. There are not a lot of new ideas. In Great \nBritain, they have had Pool Re for years. That is the sinking fund they \nset up to handle catastrophic losses in terms of insurance. It has \nbuilt up to be able to withstand the largest of catastrophic calls and \nhas made their insurance system work very well.\n  We need to establish a way for the government to sponsor an entity \nthat gets out of the guaranteeing business but gets into the building \nof liquidity business and becomes an entity that can supply mortgages \nin the United States because there is not one now and there will not be \none in the future until we create an entity that gives a foundation for \nliquidity to come back to the housing market. So here we are, 30 days \nfrom the end of the year. We don't know what our taxes are going to be \nnext year, and if we wanted to go buy a house, we wouldn't know where \nwe would find the mortgage money.\n  This Senate can act and act quickly to make changes that see to it \nthat jobs come back, and that is by extending the existing tax rates.\n  When we come back together next year, I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on the other side and my colleagues in the Senate to \ncreate a mortgage-sponsored entity that will work and begin to bring \nliquidity back to the housing market so that construction returns, jobs \ncome back, and America recovers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8318-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8318-S8323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, before the Thanksgiving Day \nrecess, I urged Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to come \ntogether and take action to begin to end the vacancy crisis that is \nthreatening our Federal courts. My call was not extreme nor radical nor \npartisan. I asked only that Senators follow the Golden Rule. \nRegrettably, that did not happen, and that is really too bad for the \ncountry.\n  There are now 38 judicial nominees being delayed who could be \nconfirmed before we adjourn--38 judicial nominees who have had their \nhearings and whose qualifications are well established.\n  Two weeks ago, I asked the Republican leadership to treat President \nObama's nominees as they would have those of a Republican President. I \nasked for nothing more than that we move forward together in the spirit \nthat we teach our children from a young age by referring to a nearly \nuniversal rule of behavior that extends across most major religions and \nethical behavior systems.\n  I urged adherence to the Golden Rule as a way to look forward and \nmake progress. I had hoped that we could remember our shared values. \nThat simple step would help us return to our Senate traditions and \nallow the Senate to better fulfill its responsibilities to the American \npeople and the Federal judiciary.\n  Yesterday, I listened to my dear friend, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd. He gave a lesson similar to others I have heard \nfrom Senators over the years--it could have been said by Senators of \neither party--about why in the Senate we need to work together on \ncertain shared issues. We have 300 million Americans, but only 100 of \nus have the privilege to serve in this body to represent all 300 \nmillion. Senators should certainly stand up for their political \npositions, but there are certain areas in which the American people \nexpect us to come together. They certainly do not expect us to stall \njudicial nominations for the sake of stalling, especially nominations \nthat have the strong support of both Republicans and Democrats and that \ncome out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously.\n\n  Had we adhered to the Golden Rule, 16 of the judicial nominees being \nheld hostage without a vote, who were each reported unanimously by all \nRepublicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, would have been \nconfirmed before Thanksgiving. So too would an additional nominee \nsupported by all but one of the committee's 19 members. They would be \non the Federal bench and Federal judicial vacancies would have been \nreduced to less than 100. Instead, the across-the-board stalling of \njudicial nominations that I have been trying to end has continued. We \nhave noncontroversial nominations being delayed and obstructed for no \ngood reason. There is no good reason to hold up consideration for weeks \nand months of nominees reported without opposition from the Judiciary \nCommittee. I have been urging since last year that these consensus \nnominees be considered promptly and confirmed. If Senators would merely \nfollow the Golden Rule, that would have happened.\n  As the Senate recessed, the Washington Post and the Charlotte \nObserver each criticized the stalling of noncontroversial judicial \nnominees in editorials published the weekend of November 19. The \nWashington Post entitled its editorial ``Unconscionable Delays for \nPresident Obama's Court Picks'' and recognized that ``even nominees \nwithout a whiff of opposition are being blocked'' and concluded ``the \nhold-up of nominees who have garnered unanimous, bipartisan support is \nparticularly offensive.'' The Charlotte Observer entitled its editorial \n``Senate Must End Games, Confirm Strong N.C. Judges'' and called what \nis going on ``infantile political gamesmanship'' and ``partisan high \njinks'' in its comments about the delays in considering Judge Albert \nDiaz and Judge Catherine\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\nEagles. In an opinion column in Politico, a former judge appointed by a \nDemocratic President and one appointed by a Republican joined together \nto call for the Senate to address the judicial vacancies crisis. They \ncited the use of ``secret holds and filibusters to block the votes'' \nand observed:\n\n       Fewer nominees have been confirmed during the Obama \n     administration than at any time since President Richard Nixon \n     was in office. These tactics are, as one senator noted, \n     ``delay for delay's sake.'' They are creating an \n     unprecedented shortfall of judicial confirmations and, \n     ultimately, a shortage of judges available to hear cases. For \n     many Americans, this means justice is likely to be \n     unnecessarily delayed--and often denied.\n\n  I will ask that copies of these pieces be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  In addition to letters from the President of the United States, the \nChief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit, the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the American Bar Association that I placed in \nthe record with my statement on November 18, I have now received a copy \nof the November 19 letter to Senators Reid and McConnell from the \nFederal Bar Association that I will ask also be print in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my statement.\n  The Federal Bar Association President notes that ``the large number \nof judicial vacancies prevents the prompt and timely administration of \njustice'' and that this ``is causing unnecessary hardship and increased \ncosts on individuals and businesses with lawsuits pending in the \nfederal courts.'' She also notes that seven of the judicial nominees \nwho were reported with near unanimity but are being stalled would fill \njudicial emergency vacancies: Albert Diaz of North Carolina, Kimberly \nMueller of California, Ray Lohier of New York, John Gibney of Virginia, \nSusan Nelson of Minnesota, Mary Murguia of Arizona and Charlton Reeves \nof Mississippi.\n  As of today there are 110 vacancies on the Federal courts around the \ncountry; 50 of them are for vacancies deemed judicial emergencies by \nthe nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. We already \nknow of 20 future vacancies. In addition, the Senate has not acted on \nthe request by the Judicial Conference of the United States to \nauthorize 56 additional judges, which will allow the Federal judiciary \nto do its work. So we are currently more than 190 judges short of those \nneeded. I urged, before the last Presidential election, that we pass \nlegislation to create additional judgeships, but unfortunately it was \nblocked.\n  The vast majority of the President's judicial nominees are consensus \nnominees and should be confirmed by large bipartisan majorities. Many \nof them will be confirmed unanimously. These are well-qualified \nnominees with the support of their home State Senators, both \nRepublicans and Democrats. I have not proceeded in the Judiciary \nCommittee with a single nominee who is not supported by both home State \nSenators. I have worked with all Republican Senators to make sure they \nwere included in this process. President Obama has worked hard with \nhome State Senators regardless of party affiliation, and by doing so \nhas done his part to restore comity to the process, as have I as \nchairman.\n  Regrettably, despite our efforts and the President's selection of \noutstanding nominees, the Senate is not being allowed to promptly \nconsider his consensus nominees. To the contrary, as the President has \npointed out, nominees are being stalled who, if allowed to be \nconsidered, would receive unanimous or near unanimous support, be \nconfirmed, and be serving in the administration of justice throughout \nthe country.\n  We have had nominees on whom we have had to file cloture to get to a \nvote, then the rollcall vote is 100 to 0 or 99 to 0. This makes no \nsense. It breaks with every tradition in this body. I speak as one who \nhas been here 36 years. There is only one Member of this body who \nserved here longer than I have. I know both Republican and Democratic \nleaders and Republican and Democratic Presidents and we have never seen \nthis happen. It is counterproductive.\n  Like the President, I welcome debate and a vote on those few nominees \nthat some Republican Senators would oppose. Nominees like Benita \nPearson of Ohio, William Martinez of Colorado, Louis Butler of \nWisconsin, Edward Chen of California, John McConnell of Rhode Island, \nand Goodwin Liu of California. I have reviewed their records and \nconsidered their character, background and qualifications. I have heard \nthe criticisms of the Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee as \nthey have voted against this handful of nominees. I disagree, and \nbelieve the Senate would vote, as I have, to confirm them. That they \nwill not be conservative activist judges should not disqualify them \nfrom serving.\n  But that is not what is happening. Republican Senators are not \ndebating the merits of those nominations, as Democratic Senators did \nwhen we opposed the most extreme handful of nominees of President Bush. \nWhat is happening is that judicial confirmations are being stalled \nvirtually across the board.\n  What is new and particularly damaging is that 26 judicial nominees \nwho were all reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nwithout Republican opposition, are still being delayed. These nominees \ninclude Albert Diaz and Catherine Eagles of North Carolina. They are \nboth supported by Senator Hagan and Senator Burr. Sadly, Senator Burr's \nsupport has not freed them from the across the board Republican hold on \nall judicial nominees. Judge Diaz was reported unanimously in January, \nalmost 12 months ago, and still waits for an agreement from the \nminority in order for the Senate to consider his nomination so that he \nmay be confirmed.\n  Also being delayed for no good reason from joining the bench of the \nmost overloaded Federal district in the country in the Eastern District \nof California is Kimberly Mueller, whose nomination was reported last \nMay, more than seven months ago, without any opposition. Her nomination \nis one of four circuit and district nominations to positions in the \nNinth Circuit currently on the Executive Calendar that Republicans are \nblocking from Senate consideration. In addition to the Liu and Chen \nnominations, the nomination of Mary Murguia from Arizona to the Ninth \nCircuit has been stalled since August despite the strong support of \nSenator Kyl, the assistant Republican leader.\n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Republican nominated by a Republican \nPresident, spoke to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference about \nskyrocketing judicial vacancies in California and throughout the \ncountry. He said:\n\n       It's important for the public to understand that the \n     excellence of the federal judiciary is at risk.\n\n  He added:\n\n       If judicial excellence is cast upon a sea of congressional \n     indifference, the rule of law is imperiled.\n\n  The Advisory Board of the Ninth Circuit sent a letter last week to \nthe majority and minority leaders urging action on pending nominations \nto address the growing vacancy crisis in that circuit. The Board \nwrites: ``Allowing the current judicial vacancy crisis to continue and \nexpand--as it inevitably will if nothing changes--is unacceptable. The \ncurrent situation places unreasonable burdens on sitting judges and \nundermines the ability of our federal courts to serve the people and \nbusinesses of the Ninth Circuit.'' I will ask that this letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The District of Columbia suffers from four vacancies on its Federal \nDistrict Court. We have four outstanding nominees who could help that \ncourt, but they are now being delayed. Beryl Howell was reported by the \ncommittee unanimously. She is well known to many of us from her 10 \nyears of service as a counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is \na decorated former Federal prosecutor and the child of a military \nfamily. Robert Wilkins was also reported without opposition. James \nBoasberg and Amy Jackson could have been reported before Thanksgiving, \nbut were needlessly delayed in Committee for another 2 weeks.\n  John Gibney of Virginia, James Bredar and Ellen Hollander of \nMaryland, Susan Nelson of Minnesota, Edmond Chang of Illinois, Leslie\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\nKobayashi of Hawaii, and Denise Casper of Massachusetts are the other \ndistrict court nominees reported unanimously from the Judiciary \nCommittee and could have been confirmed as consensus nominees long ago.\n  Another district court nominee is Carlton Reeves of Mississippi, who \nis supported by Senator Cochran and is a former president of the \nMagnolia Bar Association. Only Senator Coburn asked to be recorded as \nopposing his nomination. I believe Mr. Reeves would receive a strong \nbipartisan majority vote for confirmation.\n  Counting Judge Diaz, there are seven consensus nominees to the \ncircuit courts who are being stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar. \nJudge Ray Lohier of New York would fill one of the four current \nvacancies on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \nHe is another former prosecutor with support from both sides of the \naisle. His confirmation has been stalled for no good reason for more \nthan 6 months, as well. Scott Matheson is a Utah nominee with the \nsupport of Senator Hatch who was reported without opposition. Mary \nMurguia is from Arizona and is supported by Senator Kyl and was \nreported without opposition. Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio, nominated \nto the Federal Circuit, was reported without opposition. Susan Carney \nof Connecticut was reported with 17 bipartisan votes by the Judiciary \nCommittee to serve on the Second Circuit. James Graves of Mississippi \nwas reported unanimously to serve on the Fifth Circuit.\n  Many of these nominees could have been considered and confirmed \nbefore the August recess. 23 of them could have been considered and \nconfirmed before the October recess. They could and should have been \nconfirmed before the Thanksgiving recess. They were not. They are being \nheld in limbo. They do not know where their life should be at this \npoint, and their courts are empty.\n  They were not considered because of Republican objections that, I \nsuspect, have nothing to do with the qualifications or quality of these \nnominees. These are not judicial nominees whose judicial philosophy \nRepublicans question. Most of them were voted for by every single \nRepublican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  The President noted, in his September letter to Senate leaders, that \nthe ``real harm of this political game-playing falls on the American \npeople, who turn to the courts for justice,'' and that the unnecessary \ndelay in considering these noncontroversial judicial nominations ``is \nundermining the ability of our courts to deliver justice to those in \nneed . . . from working mothers seeking timely compensation for their \nemployment discrimination claims to communities hoping for swift \npunishment of perpetrators of crimes to small business owners seeking \nprotection from unfair and anticompetitive practices.''\n  I think the Senate should end this across-the-board blockade against \nconfirming noncontroversial judicial nominees. Democrats did not engage \nin such a practice with President Bush, and Republicans should not \ncontinue in their practice any longer. With 110 vacancies plaguing the \nFederal courts, we do not have the luxury of indulging in these kinds \nof games.\n  The Senate is well behind the pace set by the Democratic majority in \nthe Senate considering President Bush's nominations during his first 2 \nyears in office. In fact, at the end of President Bush's second year in \noffice, the Senate, with a Democratic majority, had confirmed 100 of \nhis Federal circuit and district court nominations. I know because they \nall, every one of them, were considered and confirmed during the 17 \nmonths I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. Not a single nominee \nreported by the Judiciary Committee remained pending on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar at the end of the Congress.\n  In sharp contrast, during President Obama's first 2 years in office, \nthe minority has allowed only 41 Federal circuit and district court \nnominees to be considered by the Senate. In fact, in 2002, we proceeded \nin the lameduck session after the election to confirm 20 more of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. There are 34 judicial nominees \nready for Senate consideration and another 4 noncontroversial \nnominations on the committee's business agenda. That is 38 additional \nconfirmations that could be easily achieved with a little cooperation \nfrom Republicans. That would increase the confirmation from the \nhistorically low level of 41 where it currently stands, to almost 80. \nThat would be in the range of judicial confirmations during President \nGeorge H.W. Bush's first 2 years, 70, while resting below President \nReagan's first 2 years, 87, and pale in comparison to the 100 confirmed \nin the first 2 years of the George W. Bush administration or those \nconfirmed during President Clinton's first 2 years, 127.\n  During the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years, I scheduled 26 hearings for the \njudicial nominees of a Republican President and the Judiciary Committee \nworked diligently to consider them. During the 2 years of the Obama \nadministration, I have tried to maintain that same approach. The \ncommittee held 25 hearings for President Obama's Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees this Congress. I have not altered my approach \nand neither have Senate Democrats.\n  One thing that has changed is that we now receive the paperwork on \nthe nominations, the nominee's completed questionnaire, the \nconfidential background investigation and the America Bar Association, \nABA, peer review almost immediately after a nomination is made, \nallowing us to proceed to hearings more quickly. During 2001 and 2002, \nPresident Bush abandoned the procedure that President Eisenhower had \nadopted and that had been used by President George H.W. Bush, President \nReagan and all Presidents for more than 50 years. Instead, President \nGeorge W. Bush delayed the start of the ABA peer review process until \nafter the nomination was sent to the Senate. That added weeks and \nmonths to the timeline in which hearings were able to be scheduled on \nnominations.\n  I was puzzled to hear the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee say a few weeks ago that ``President Obama's nominees have \nfared better and moved better than President Bush's nominees.'' I have \nworked with the ranking Republican in connection with our consideration \nand confirmation of the President's two nominees to the Supreme Court, \nJustice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan. He opposed both, but agreed that \nthe process was fair. I have worked with him on procedures to consider \nthe President's other nominees and with some exceptions we have been \nable to have the Judiciary Committee consider and report them. In terms \nof comparisons, however, we actually reviewed far more of President \nBush's nominees during his first 2 years than we have been allowed to \nconsider during President Obama's first 2 years.\n  The comparison is that I held 26 hearings for 103 of President Bush's \nFederal circuit and district court nominees and the committee favorably \nreported 100 of them. All 100 were confirmed by the Senate. We did that \nin 17 months. By comparison, during the 19 months the committee has \nbeen holding hearings on President Obama's Federal circuit and district \ncourt nominees, we have held 25 hearings for 80 nominees. Of the 75 \nfavorably reported, only 41 have been considered by the Senate. Several \nrequired cloture petitions and votes to end unsuccessful Republican \nfilibusters. There were no Democratic filibusters of President Bush's \nnominees during the first 2 years of his Presidency.\n\n  In sum, the bottom line is that the Senate has been allowed to \nconsider and confirm less than half of the Federal circuit and district \ncourt nominees we proceeded to confirm during President Bush's first 2 \nyears. Forty-one confirmations does not equal or exceed the 100 \nconfirmations we achieved during the first 2 years of the Bush \nadministration. For that matter, the 75 Federal circuit and district \ncourt nominees voted on and favorably reported on by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee does not equal the 100 we reported out in less time \nduring the Bush administration. How the ranking Republican can contend \nthat President Obama's nominees ``have fared better and moved faster \nthan President Bush's nominees'' during their first 2 years in office \nis beyond me.\n  When I became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee midway \nthrough President Bush's first tumultuous year in office, I worked hard \nto\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\nmake sure Senate Democrats did not perpetuate the judge wars as a tit-\nfor-tat. Despite the fact that Senate Republicans pocket-filibustered \nmore than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations and refused to \nproceed on them while judicial vacancies skyrocketed during the Clinton \nadministration, in 2001 and 2002, during the 17 months I chaired the \ncommittee during President Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 100 of his judicial nominees.\n  This chart shows where we were. President Clinton became president \nand in the first couple of years we went from the 109 vacancies down to \n49. Then the Republicans took over, they started pocket-filibustering, \nand the vacancies went up to 110.\n  Democrats were in charge for 17 months with a Republican President. \nWe said we were not going to play the games that they did with \nPresident Clinton. We brought judicial vacancies down to 60 under \nPresident Bush. We actually moved judges faster for President Bush than \nthe Republicans did when they regained control of the Senate.\n  Towards the end of President Bush's presidency, we got the vacancies \ndown to 34. However, since President Obama has been in power, \nconfirmations have been held up, and vacancies again reached 110. That \nmight sound good in some kind of fund-raising letter. It doesn't sound \ngood if you are the one trying to have your case heard in a court. It \ndoes not sound very good if you are the prosecutor and you want a \ncriminal prosecuted and the judge is not there.\n  What I cannot understand is why, having worked with President Bush to \nbring the Federal court vacancies down from 110 to 34, and the Federal \ncircuit vacancies which were at a high of 32, down to single digits, \njudges are still being blocked. It looks like old habits die hard.\n  By refusing to proceed on President Clinton's nominations while \njudicial vacancies skyrocketed during the 6 years they controlled the \npace of nominations, Senate Republicans allowed vacancies to rise to \nmore than 110 by the end of the Clinton administration. As a result of \ntheir strategy, Federal circuit court vacancies doubled. When Democrats \nregained the Senate majority halfway into President Bush's first year \nin office, we turned away from these bad practices. As a result, \noverall judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from more \nthan 10 percent to less than 4 percent. During the Bush years, the \nFederal court vacancies were reduced from 110 to 34 and Federal circuit \ncourt vacancies were reduced from a high of 32 down to single digits.\n  This progress has not continued with a Democratic President back in \noffice. Instead, Senate Republicans are returning to the strategy they \nused during the Clinton administration of blocking the nominations of a \nDemocratic President, again leading to skyrocketing vacancies.\n  Last year, the Senate confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges, the lowest total in 50 years. The judiciary is not \nsupposed to be political or politicized. When litigants are in a \nFederal court, they assume they will get impartial justice, regardless \nof whether they are a Republican or a Democrat. But this kind of game \nplaying, of holding up nominees of a Democratic President, hurts the \nwhole administration of justice.\n  This year we have yet to confirm 30 Federal circuit and district \njudges. We are not even keeping up with retirements and attrition. As a \nresult, judicial vacancies are again at 110, more than 10 percent.\n  There are also the personal consequences. We have highly qualified \npeople who get nominated for the Federal court, with backing from the \nRepublican and Democratic Senators from their State. They are in a law \npractice, and everybody congratulates them. However, their firms are \nlimited in what cases they can take if the nominee stays on, and they \nend up in limbo.\n  Many of those people are taking a huge cut in pay to go on the \nFederal bench. Suddenly, they are forced to wait for 6, 7, 8 months, \nwithout being able to earn anything. Then eventually they are confirmed \n100 to 0. This needs to change.\n  Regrettably, the Senate is not being allowed to consider the \nconsensus, mainstream judicial nominees favorably reported from the \nJudiciary Committee. It has taken nearly five times as long to consider \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations as it did to consider President \nBush's during his first 2 years in office. During the first 2 years of \nthe Bush administration, the 100 judges confirmed were considered by \nthe Senate an average of 25 days from being reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. The average time for confirmed circuit court nominees was 26 \ndays. By contrast, the average time for the 41 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court judges confirmed since President Obama took office is 90 \ndays and the average time for circuit nominees is 148 days--and that \ndisparity is increasing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the materials to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 19, 2010]\n\n        Unconscionable Delays for President Obama's Court Picks\n\n       Mary Helen Murguia enjoys the support of her two Republican \n     home state senators, Jon Kyl and John McCain of Arizona. The \n     Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved her \n     nomination in August. Yet Ms. Murguia, President Obama's pick \n     for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, \n     has yet to receive a full vote on the Senate floor.\n       Albert Diaz, a 4th Circuit nominee, has waited even \n     longer--nearly one year--for his floor vote after receiving a \n     thumbs-up from all 19 of the Judiciary Committee's members \n     and winning the backing of his Republican home state senator, \n     North Carolina's Richard Burr.\n       Even trial court nominees--typically not the target of \n     stall tactics or intense attacks--are getting caught up in \n     the perplexing political game. Kimberly J. Mueller, for \n     example, also earned unanimous approval from the Judiciary \n     Committee for a California trial court that is among the \n     busiest in the country; she has spent the past six months \n     waiting for final approval.\n       In all, 23 of Mr. Obama's nominees are awaiting a Senate \n     floor vote; 16 of them received unanimous approval from the \n     Judiciary Committee and the vast majority were deemed ``well \n     qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Eight--including \n     the three mentioned above--have been tapped for seats \n     designated ``judicial emergencies'' because of the length of \n     the vacancy and the workload of the court.\n       There is plenty of blame to go around for the delays, \n     starting with the president, who has been slow and often late \n     in sending up names. The White House has also been timid in \n     fighting for nominees. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid \n     (D-Nev.) has not been assertive in scheduling floor votes, \n     and the push by some interest groups to win confirmation for \n     liberal favorites such as controversial 9th Circuit pick \n     Goodwin Liu may be holding up progress on the broader slate \n     of more moderate nominees. Republicans, including Minority \n     Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have been all too eager to \n     object to votes even on nominees with bipartisan support. The \n     stall tactics are undoubtedly payback for Democratic \n     filibusters of controversial but highly qualified nominees of \n     President George W. Bush. The difference today is that even \n     nominees without a whiff of opposition are being blocked.\n       Presidents deserve significant deference in judicial \n     nominations, and every nominee deserves an up-or-down vote. \n     But the hold-up of nominees who have garnered unanimous, \n     bipartisan support is particularly offensive. These nominees \n     should be confirmed swiftly before Congress recesses next \n     month.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, Nov. 21, 2010]\n\nSenate Must End Games, Confirm Strong N.C. Judges; Congress' Failure To \n                    Approve Diaz, Eagles Is Shameful\n\n       So here we are, 297 days after the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee unanimously--unanimously!--recommended Judge Albert \n     Diaz of Charlotte for a seat on the federal appeals court. \n     Thanks to infantile political gamesmanship, the Senate still \n     has not confirmed him. And so a judge that most everyone \n     agrees is well-qualified languishes in limbo and a busy court \n     one step below the U.S. Supreme Court remains in a staffing \n     crisis.\n       Time is running out on the Senate to do the right thing. If \n     it does not confirm Diaz in the current lame duck session, \n     his nomination expires. That would be an ignominious chapter \n     for that once-august body. Facing the same fate: Catherine \n     Eagles of Greensboro, another qualified, non-controversial \n     nominee who in May easily won the Judiciary Committee's \n     approval for a federal judgeship in North Carolina.\n       Diaz and Eagles are among a couple dozen capable judges \n     whose careers are being hamstrung by partisan high jinks. The \n     whole farce helps explain why the public is disgusted with \n     how Congress operates these days. Many members put party \n     before country.\n       Democrats and Republicans alike have blocked skilled \n     judicial nominees over the years, particularly in North \n     Carolina. Today,\n\n[[Page S8322]]\n\n     each party claims that the other is to blame for the current \n     impasse. It appears, though, that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-\n     Ky., is the biggest impediment.\n       Republican Sen. Richard Burr and Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan \n     both support Diaz and Eagles. Burr should publicly and \n     privately work to persuade McConnell to permit up-or-down \n     votes on these nominees, without a paralyzing 30 hours of \n     debate on each and every one of them.\n       This all matters because dozens of seats have reached a \n     level of ``judicial emergency,'' according to the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, meaning the \n     workload is unsustainable and judges are needed. That \n     includes the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, \n     Va. North Carolina is the largest of five states in the \n     circuit but until recently had only one of its three seats on \n     the bench filled.\n       Diaz, a special Superior Court judge specializing in \n     complex business litigation, is trying to fill a seat that \n     has been vacant for three and a half years. Eagles, a senior \n     resident Superior Court judge, would fill a judgeship that \n     has been vacant for nearly two years. Both received the \n     highest rating from the American Bar Association--\n     ``unanimously well qualified.''\n       McConnell recently reversed his position on earmarks. If he \n     has any sense, he'll now reverse himself on blocking \n     qualified judges this state and the nation need.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Politico, Nov. 18, 2010]\n\n                   Let's Fix Judicial Nominee Process\n\n                 (By: Abner J. Mikva and Timothy Lewis)\n\n       When the Senate left for the election recess, it had \n     confirmed just one of the 48 pending judicial nominees. Its \n     failure to consider nominations has exacerbated a vacancy \n     crisis for our federal courts that has reached critical \n     proportions.\n       Almost one in eight seats on the federal bench is empty and \n     has been for months. This grave problem is only likely to \n     worsen as more judges retire and senators block efforts to \n     appoint new ones.\n       As federal judges appointed by presidents from different \n     parties, we urge the Senate to end the excessive \n     politicization of the confirmation process that is creating \n     these delays.\n       This obstruction and the way it undermines our democratic \n     process would be outrageous at any time. But it is especially \n     shameful now, because many of these qualified nominees \n     received bipartisan support when nominated and were then \n     approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with broad \n     support. Yet they have waited more than a year to be \n     confirmed because the Senate never put their nomination to a \n     vote.\n       Instead of confirming these nominees, some senators have \n     used secret holds and filibusters to block the votes, leaving \n     nominees in limbo for a year or more and undermining the \n     credibility of our judiciary. Fewer nominees have been \n     confirmed during the Obama administration than at any time \n     since President Richard Nixon was in office.\n       These tactics are, as one senator noted, ``delay for \n     delay's sake.'' They are creating an unprecedented shortfall \n     of judicial confirmations and, ultimately, a shortage of \n     judges available to hear cases. For many Americans, this \n     means justice is likely to be unnecessarily delayed--and \n     often denied.\n       There are now 106 vacancies on the federal courts, almost \n     half deemed so debilitating that they are labeled \n     ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \n     Courts. An additional six seats are slated to become vacant \n     in the next few months. This is untenable for a country that \n     believes in the rule of law.\n       An increasing number of public officials are now speaking \n     out. President Barack Obama called on the Senate to ``stop \n     playing games'' with the judicial nominations process. \n     Supreme Court Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader \n     Ginsburg each independently criticized the partisanship that \n     has permeated the confirmation process. Several other former \n     federal judges joined us in writing a letter to Senate \n     leaders, expressing our dismay and calling for a better \n     confirmation process.\n       With the Senate now back for the lame-duck session, \n     political pressure on nominations may not be so intense. This \n     is the time for the Senate to return to an effective process \n     for confirming judges--one that can eliminate the appearance \n     of excessive partisanship and apply to both Democratic and \n     Republican administrations.\n       Only in this way can we begin to restore the public's faith \n     in the integrity of our judiciary, a crucial element of our \n     Constitution's delicate system of checks and balances and \n     fundamental to our democratic system of government.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Federal Bar Association,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                               New Orleans, LA, November 19, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: I \n     write on behalf of the approximately sixteen thousand members \n     of the Federal Bar Association (FBA) to encourage expedient \n     Senate floor action on the judicial candidates reported out \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee and awaiting a Senate floor \n     vote. As the Senate reconvenes, there is a very real need--in \n     the interest of our federal court system--for the Senate to \n     fulfill its constitutional responsibility to vote on these \n     pending nominees.\n       The FBA is the foremost national association of private and \n     public attorneys engaged in the practice of law before the \n     federal courts and federal agencies. We seek the fair and \n     swift administration of justice for all litigants in the \n     federal courts. We want to assure that the federal courts are \n     operating at their full, authorized capacity and that justice \n     is timely delivered by the federal courts. The large number \n     of judicial vacancies prevents the prompt and timely \n     administration of justice in the federal courts. This is \n     causing unnecessary hardship and increased costs on \n     individuals and businesses with lawsuits pending in the \n     federal courts.\n       Our Association's interest is focused upon prompt, \n     dispositive action by the Senate in filling vacancies as they \n     arise on the federal bench. Prompt, dispositive action by the \n     Senate on judicial candidates will assure that lawsuits filed \n     in our federal courts are heard and decided with out delay. \n     The justice system suffers when vacancies are not filled in a \n     timely manner. Vacancies create a burden of added litigation \n     and economic costs that at times overwhelm the system and its \n     ability to hear and decide matters in a timely and effective \n     manner.\n       Seventeen of the 23 federal judicial candidates who await a \n     Senate floor vote have been approved by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee by unanimous consent or without controversy. These \n     candidates deserve an up-or-down vote before the 111th \n     Congress reaches an end.\n       In particular, 7 of these 17 noncontroversial judicial \n     candidates cleared by the Senate Judiciary Committee have \n     been nominated to circuit and district court judgeships that \n     have stood vacant for substantial periods of time and are \n     associated with courts with especially high caseloads. These \n     vacancies have been designated as ``judicial emergencies'' by \n     the Judicial Conference, the policy-making body of the \n     federal judiciary, because each vacancy has existed for a \n     significant period of time and is associated with a court \n     that has caseloads that are considerably higher than normal.\n       The 7 candidates associated with judicial vacancies that \n     have been designated as ``judicial emergencies'' are:\n       Albert Diaz, nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals (North Carolina), to the judgeship vacated by Judge \n     William Wilkins on July 1, 2007; this vacancy has existed for \n     1237 days.\n       Kimberly Mueller, nominated to the Eastern District of \n     California, to the judgeship vacated by Judge Frank C. \n     Damrell on January 1, 2009; this vacancy has existed for 1091 \n     days and is located in the federal district court with the \n     highest caseload in the nation.\n       Raymond Lohier, nominated to the Second Circuit Court of \n     Appeals (New York), to the judgeship vacated by Justice Sonia \n     Sotomayor on August 6, 2009; this vacancy has existed for 470 \n     days.\n       John A. Gibney, nominated to the Eastern District of \n     Virginia, to the judgeship vacated by Judge Robert E. Payne \n     on May 7, 2007; this vacancy has existed for 1293 days.\n       Susan R. Nelson, nominated to the District Court of \n     Minnesota, to the judgeship vacated by Judge James R. \n     Rosenbaum on October 26, 2009; this vacancy has existed for \n     389 days.\n       Mary H. Murguia, nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals (Arizona), to the judgeship vacated by Judge Michael \n     Daly Hawkins on February 12, 2010; this vacancy has existed \n     for 280 days.\n       Carlton W. Reeves, nominated to the Southern District Court \n     of Mississippi, to the judgeship vacated by Judge William \n     Henry Barbour, Jr. on February 4, 2006; this vacancy has \n     existed for 1748 days, the longest period of any of these \n     seven candidates.\n       The Federal Bar Association as a matter of policy takes no \n     position on the credentials or qualifications of specific \n     nominees to the federal bench. The FBA's foremost interest \n     lies in the assurance of prompt, dispositive action by the \n     President in nominating qualified federal judicial candidates \n     and the Senate in either confirming or not confirming them in \n     a prompt manner. Such action will ultimately reduce the \n     number of vacancies to a more tolerable level.\n       The Federal Bar Association firmly believes that all \n     judicial candidates, once cleared by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, deserve a prompt up-or-down vote by the Senate. \n     Swift action is particularly needed on those candidates \n     associated with federal circuit and district courts whose \n     caseloads are in emergency status. We urge the Senate to vote \n     upon these pending nominees before the end of the current \n     legislative session.\n       Thank you for your support of the nation's federal court \n     system and your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Ashley L. Belleau.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                          Advisory Board of the Ninth Circuit,\n\n                                                November 24, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We write to you as \n     members of the Advisory Board of the Ninth Circuit to seek \n     your assistance and commitment to solve a growing--and \n     increasingly urgent--crisis facing the federal courts of the \n     Ninth Circuit: the ever expanding number of vacancies on both\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\n     our district and appellate courts. This growing crisis \n     threatens the effective delivery of justice to the people and \n     businesses who come before our federal courts.\n       We recognize that you cannot solve this problem alone. The \n     President must select and submit to the Senate for review \n     nominees to fill these vacancies. Consequently, we are \n     seeking the assistance and commitment of the President to \n     address this crisis as well.\n       It is no exaggeration to call the growing number of \n     judicial vacancies on our federal courts a crisis. Between \n     1981 and 2008, there were on average 48 vacancies each year \n     for all of the lower federal courts, including vacancies \n     created by two bills expanding the number of federal judges. \n     Over this same period, the nomination and confirmation \n     process filled only 43 vacancies on average each year, \n     causing the vacancy rate to more than double in the last 30 \n     years. In the Ninth Circuit, the number of vacancies has \n     doubled in the last 22 months.\n       This fact alone would signal a serious problem but the \n     situation is very likely to get worse. Over the next decade, \n     the number of vacancies on the lower federal courts is likely \n     to increase because of the age of current judges and the need \n     to expand the judiciary to keep up with caseload growth. The \n     Justice Department has estimated that annual vacancies over \n     the coming decade will average closer to 60 positions each \n     year. In the last two years, however, only 41 federal judges \n     have been nominated and confirmed to the federal district and \n     appellate courts nationwide. Unless something changes quickly \n     and dramatically, at the end of the coming decade, half the \n     seats on the lower federal courts could be empty.\n       The Ninth Circuit is fully immersed in this growing crisis. \n     There are currently 18 vacancies among the 142 authorized \n     appellate and district court Article III judges in the \n     Circuit. The President has forwarded to the Senate \n     nominations for ten of these vacancies but the Senate has yet \n     to act on them. While the Senate has confirmed seven nominees \n     to vacancies within the Circuit since January 1, 2009, seven \n     have been pending without a confirmation vote for more than \n     120 days and three of these have been voted out of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and forwarded to the full Senate for \n     action with little or no Committee opposition.\n       As you know, our federal judiciary at all levels is a \n     beacon of justice across the country and around the world. \n     The judges who sit on our federal courts are dedicated to \n     their jobs and committed to both the rule of law and the \n     ideal of justice for all. Allowing the current judicial \n     vacancy crisis to continue and expand--as it inevitably will \n     if nothing changes--is unacceptable. The current situation \n     places unreasonable burdens on sitting judges and undermines \n     the ability of our federal courts to serve the people and \n     businesses of the Ninth Circuit.\n       We recognize that both the President's role in nominating \n     individuals to serve as federal judges and the Senate's role \n     in reviewing and determining whether to confirm those \n     nominees are solemn and serious duties. The health and \n     integrity of an entire branch of our government depends on \n     the faithful and careful execution of these duties. We \n     believe, however, that a crisis in one of our branches of \n     government also demands swift, effective, and appropriate \n     action from the coordinate branches. According to the Library \n     of Congress, from 1977 to 2003, the average time from \n     nomination to confirmation for lower federal court judges was \n     less than 90 days. Current vacancies nationwide have been \n     pending for an unsustainable 516 days. On average, the \n     vacancies filled by the 41 judges confirmed during the 111th \n     Congress were pending 803 days from vacancy creation to \n     confirmation. We can and must do better.\n       For this reason, we ask you to make a commitment to a \n     confirmation vote in the Senate for each judicial nominee \n     within no more than 120 days after the Senate receives a \n     nomination from the President. We will make a similar request \n     of the President to forward nominations to the Senate within \n     no more than 120 days after the President learns of a \n     judicial vacancy. While Congress will ultimately need to pass \n     legislation to expand the federal judiciary, filling the \n     current vacancies in a more timely manner will do much to \n     alleviate the immediate crisis and improve the delivery of \n     judicial services to those who come before the federal \n     courts.\n       We are convinced that with your leadership and that of the \n     President we can solve the vacancy crisis facing our federal \n     courts. We urge you to make a clear and open commitment to \n     address the vacancy crisis in the Ninth Circuit as \n     expeditiously as possible. Thank you for your consideration \n     of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Todd D. True (Chair), Seattle, WA; Steve Cochran (Past-\n           Chair), Los Angeles, CA; Robert A.

Mr. President, I will in a moment--in the spirit \nof fair play, we are waiting for some Republicans to enter the \nChamber--I will ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be \ndischarged from S. 3981 so we can bring up and move forward on \nmaintaining unemployment benefits for thousands of people. In my State \nalone, last night at midnight, 88,000--that is 1,000 people in every \ncounty; we have 88 counties in Ohio--Ohioans saw their unemployment \nbenefits stopped because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndo not want to maintain unemployment benefits. What is shocking to me \nis that this Senate and the House of Representatives, regardless of \nparty, for years, when our country has been in bad economic times, have \nmaintained unemployment benefits for laid-off workers.\n  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, has made a couple comments \nthat disturb me and make it very hard to do this. We need a \nsupermajority. We need 60 votes. They continue to filibuster or \nthreaten to filibuster. Senator McConnell has made two statements, one \nthrough a letter in the last 24 hours and one 3 or 4 weeks ago when he \nsaid his No. 1 goal is that Barack Obama be a one-term President. I \nunderstand political parties, but his No. 1 goal is that President \nObama serve only one term? Minority Leader McConnell, in a letter \nsigned by all his Republican colleagues, which was sent to Senator \nReid, signed by every Republican, said:\n\n       We write to inform you we will not agree to invoke cloture \n     on the motion to proceed on any legislative item until the \n     Senate has acted to fund the government and we have prevented \n     the tax increases that currently will happen in January.\n\n  What the Republicans are doing, I don't even understand it. They are \nsaying they insist on a millionaire and billionaire tax cut come \nJanuary, and they will, for all intents and purposes, shut down the \ngovernment if they don't get their way. They are saying: Forget \nextending unemployment benefits, forget food safety legislation, forget \ndon't ask, don't tell, forget the Russian-American START treaty--it \nused to be that politics ended at the water's edge; those days are \nover--and forget a middle-class tax cut. They are saying: We will shut \ndown the government if we can't get a tax cut for billionaires and \nmillionaires. My first priority is extending unemployment benefits to \nthe 60 or 70,000 Michiganders; perhaps from the State of Senator \nSchumer, I would guess over 100,000 New Yorkers; from New Mexico, I \nwould guess probably 10,000; and Alaska, thousands in that State. They \nare willing to say to those unemployed workers--and this is not \nunemployment welfare; this is unemployment insurance. Every worker in \nthe State, he or his employer--academicians will debate whether the \nemployee or employer actually pays it, but they put into the \nunemployment insurance fund. When they are laid off, they get money out \nof the fund. It is similar to health insurance or car insurance. You \ndon't want to collect on it, but it is called insurance. You hope you \nare working so you don't have to collect on it, but they need to.\n  There are five people applying for every open job, on average. In \nMichigan and Ohio, it is probably worse than that. These are not people \nsitting around with nothing to do, not wanting to work. I will not do \nthis today, but I have read letter after letter from Ohioans saying: \nHere is my story. I have lost my medical coverage because I don't have \na job, and you are cutting off my unemployment benefits--``you'' \nmeaning the Republican filibuster.\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\n  They will say: I am about to lose my house, and I have to tell my 12-\nyear-old daughter we will have to switch schools, and I don't even know \nwhat school we will go to because we are going to live in an apartment \nsomewhere else because the house is foreclosed on. They are now going \nto the food bank they used to give money to.\n  Do my Republican colleagues know any of these people? Do they go out \nand talk to people who have lost their jobs and have to explain to \ntheir families that they will lose their house and explain to the wife \nthat their insurance has been canceled because they will not extend \nunemployment benefits? This is not a big, new welfare program. This is \nextending unemployment benefits. I just don't get it. They would rather \ndo tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. They would rather borrow \n$700 billion from the Chinese, put it on a credit card that their kids \nand grandkids will have to pay off, and then give it to billionaires \nand millionaires. That is the choice they are making.\n  It is clear whose side people are on here. Are you on the side of \nmaintaining unemployment benefits or are you on the side of \nmillionaires and billionaires? Are you for giving a tax cut to the \nmiddle class, moving to pay down the budget deficit? It is so clear \nwhat we need to do.\n  My colleagues still aren't here to make the request. I will add a few \nmore comments.\n  The other reason to maintain unemployment benefits is all economics. \nSenator McCain, when he was a candidate, his chief economic adviser \nsaid the best way to grow the economy, the best stimulus dollar you can \nspend is unemployment insurance. Because when you put a dollar in a \nlaid-off worker's pocket from Lima or Zaynesville, she will spend it at \nthe local grocery store, the local shoe store, to pay property tax, to \npay the gas bill, whatever.\n  That money is recycled in the economy. You give a tax cut to upper \nincome people--a millionaire or billionaire--according to John McCain's \neconomic adviser, you only get a 32-cent bang for your buck out of that \nversus $1.60 when you extend unemployment benefits, when you pay \nunemployment benefits. What that means clearly is the best thing to do \nfor our economy is these unemployment benefits, not tax cuts for \nsomebody already making $3 million a year. They are not going to buy \nanything more. They already have what they need. To give them another \n$30,000 or $50,000 in tax cuts simply does not mean anything.\n  It is so important for purposes of the budget deficit, it is so \nimportant for purposes of growing this economy, and it is so important \nbecause it is the right thing to do for our workers, our laid off \npeople, our communities that suffer if these workers are not spending \nthese dollars in our communities. It is just so important that we move \nforward and do that.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor for one of my colleagues who \nhas another unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before my colleague sits down, would he \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  The beginning of this letter, signed by 42 of our Republican \ncolleagues, says:\n\n       The Nation's unemployment level, stuck near 10 percent, is \n     unacceptable to Americans.\n\n  I just want to clarify what my colleague is saying. We will all be \ntalking about this. It is more important to the people on the other \nside of the aisle to get tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires \nthan move forward on unemployment insurance. We are going to ask \nunanimous consent on that proposal and on other proposals which we will \nhear from.\n  But is my colleague basically saying, despite the fact that our \ncolleagues admit unemployment is high--many are out of work--their \nsolution to unemployment and people looking for jobs is to give tax \nbreaks to people who are making millions and billions of dollars and \npeople who did very well over the last decade--the only group? Is that \nbasically it?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Yes, that is it. To illustrate that further to \nSenator Schumer and to the Presiding Officer, as to the last two big \ntax cuts that were done in this country for the wealthy--in 2003 by \nPresident Bush, in 2001 by President Bush--we know what happened from \nthose two tax cuts. In the 8 years of President Bush, the hallmark of \nhis economic policy was two major tax cuts for the wealthy, and there \nwas a 1 million job increase in those 8 years during George Bush's \nPresidency--a million jobs--not even a net increase, not even enough to \nkeep up with people coming out of the Army or coming out of college or \nhigh school.\n  During the Clinton years, where they had a mix of tax cuts, some \nincreases for higher income people, and they balanced the budget, did \nsome budget cuts that Senator McCaskill supports--some of those--we \nended up during President Clinton's 8 years with a 22 million job \nincrease. There was a 22 million job increase by managing the budget \nright and giving assistance to middle-class people.\n  In the Bush 8 years, with tax cuts for the wealthy: 1 million jobs. \nYet Republicans now are arguing that the most important thing, \npossibly, to do for the economy, the most important thing to do for our \ncountry, is to reward the people who have already done very well in the \nlast 10 years, at the expense of the broad middle class who have seen \nbasically stagnant wages or worse during this decade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  We are here on the Senate floor, and we will be staying on the Senate \nfloor for a little while to make one point. I would say this to the \nAmerican people: We have an economy that needs improvement, and our \ncolleagues have said they will not let anything happen, whether it be \ntax credits for employers who hire the unemployed, which I am talking \nabout, help for the energy industry, tax credits to help manufacturers \nhire people, or unemployment insurance. All of those will be put on \nhold until we give tax breaks to the millionaires and billionaires \nwho--God bless them--are wonderful. They are part of the American \ndream. But they are the one group that has done well. It seems to me, \nas we will talk about for the next little while, it is absolutely \nabsurd to say that should be the linchpin of our economic policy.\n  We will ask unanimous consent to bring forth proposals that we think \nwill do far more to get people back to work and help the middle class \nstretch the paycheck than giving tax breaks to the billionaires.\n  I yield the floor because I know my colleague wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, just to follow with my colleagues--and I \nso appreciate the Senator from Ohio and his comments regarding what is \nhappening to people who have lost jobs through no fault of their own--\nfive people at least are looking for every one job that is available. \nThere is a critical urgency families feel. I thank the Senator from New \nYork for his passion as well as my other colleagues.\n  Let me take a moment to emphasize what we are talking about. The \nRepublicans--and they have now done through a letter to the leader--are \nbasically saying they are willing to risk everything--everything--to \ngive a bonus tax cut--as my friend and colleague from Alaska talks \nabout, not a tax cut. Everyone is going to get a tax cut on their first \n$250,000 of income. They want a bonus tax cut on millionaires and \nbillionaires that for the average millionaire will be about $100,000 \nnext year, which is more than the average person in Michigan makes in a \nyear. So they are willing to shut this place down and risk everything \nin order to be able to get a bonus tax cut for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  What does that mean? Well, they are willing to risk the deficit. They \nsay we cannot help people who are out of work because it will cost $50 \nbillion unless it is totally paid for. But $700 billion for their \nwealthiest friends and supporters is OK. So they will risk the deficit.\n  They will risk jobs. Where are the jobs? We have had 10 years of this \npolicy, 10 years of this policy of tax cuts at the top waiting for it \nto trickle down. They think we just have not waited long enough. Folks \nin Michigan\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\nhave waited far too long for it to trickle down. We are tired of \nwaiting. We want a proposal that works.\n  I will put forward a unanimous-consent request on something that has \nworked, an advanced manufacturing tax credit that has allowed now a \nnumber of businesses--I think over 12 businesses--to open in Michigan \nwith clean energy manufacturing, stamped ``Made in America.'' In fact, \nwe want to see ``Made in Michigan'' stamped on everything. We need to \nextend this tax credit because it is putting people back to work in \nMichigan and across the country. I will be making that unanimous \nconsent request in just a moment. But they are willing to risk jobs, go \nhome without focusing on jobs.\n  They are willing to hold tax cuts for middle-class families and small \nbusinesses hostage for a tax cut for a few people at the top. We will \nnot be lectured by them about small business, by a group of folks who \nhave filibustered 16 different tax cuts for small businesses in this \nCongress--16 different tax cuts--including 8 tax cuts for small \nbusinesses in the small business jobs bill that added capital for small \nbusinesses last fall. So, believe me, we are here for small business as \nwell as middle-class families.\n  Social Security and Medicare: The debt commission is coming out with \nvery serious recommendations that are focused on Social Security and \nMedicare. They are willing to risk that by adding more to the debt. \nDoes that mean more changes to Social Security and Medicare?\n  Then, finally, help for people who are out of work: They are willing \nto say our country, our great country, is not good enough, is not \nstrong enough to step up when our families need it the most--families \nwho never before in their lives have needed help. For the families in \nmy State, the average person is 50, 55, 60 years old, who has worked \nall their life and never dreamed they would find themselves in this \nsituation. But here they are, through no fault of their own.\n  Now, in this holiday season, when we are asking that we just extend \nthe regular program, not even dealing with the long-term unemployed, \nwhich is also what I want to do, but to extend the regular program so \nthe person who today loses their job gets the same kind of opportunity \nto get help as the person who lost their job on Monday, because today \nover 100,000 people in Michigan are going to lose the opportunity to \nget any kind of temporary help because they lost their job.\n  So our colleagues have set their priorities, big letters, tax cuts \nfor millionaires and billionaires. They do not want us to do anything \nelse until that gets done. We have a different set of priorities on \nbehalf of American families, middle-class families, small businesses, \npeople who need help right now.\n  I am going to yield the floor at the moment, but I am going to be \nhappy to have a unanimous consent request regarding a very effective \njobs tax credit that we could pass today and get going and get people \nback to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Earlier today I spoke on the Senate floor and talked about how the \neconomy is fragile but going in the right direction and how many of us \non this side of the aisle--as a matter of fact, all of us on this side \nof the aisle--took a lonely road over the last 2 years on some \ncontroversial issues that the public sees as controversial, but we knew \nwe had to do something--something--to get this economy moving, and we \nare now seeing the benefits.\n  Every time I open--I do not care if it is the Wall Street Journal, \nBusiness Week--you name the business magazine or newspaper--which are \nnot the liberal magazines; they are very conservative magazines and \nnewspapers, or on the Internet--they will show you statistic after \nstatistic that we are moving in the right direction. For this last \nmonth, I think it is 92,000 new jobs the private sector created. But in \norder to do it, we need to do some more.\n  I am a little frustrated by the letter. I also have a unanimous \nconsent request that I hope to be able to bring up on HUBZones and to \namend the Small Business Act. It is the idea of rebuilding local small \nbusinesses. What amazes me about this letter is it seems as though for \nsome reason we can only do one thing at a time in this place.\n  Now, I come from local government where, as a mayor, we had to do \nmultiple tasks because we always had many of them on the table. It did \nnot matter whether it was public safety or creating jobs or rebuilding \na neighborhood or working with the community, we had to do multiple \nthings.\n  This country has multiple issues in front of it. We have an important \nSTART treaty that needs to be done. I am a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. Our national security is at risk, but for some reason the \nother side wants to wait until we give--I am not even going to call it \na tax cut. I call it a bonus for the millionaires and billionaires. It \nis a bonus. It is not a tax cut. It is a bonus they want to give, $700 \nbillion of money we do not have. We cannot afford it. The working class \nof this country cannot afford it. The middle class cannot afford it. My \nson cannot afford it. My son's future kids cannot afford it--$700 \nbillion of more debt to give a bonus to the people who drove our \neconomy into the ditch. I do not really get it.\n  It seemed as though when I came here there was going to be a logical \nthought process, great debate. Once again, we are down here. Nothing on \nthe other side. They will come out. I know they will have their charts \nand one-liners about how the economy will fall if we do not give \nmillionaires and billionaires another tax break or bonus. It is not \ngoing to. We are on the road to recovery because this side took that \nlonely road when people told us: Wow, that is politically going to hurt \nyou, and it did. We lost some people this last election. But leadership \nis not about taking the easy road, the easy answer, the simple \nsolution.\n  We are in a very complex time with many issues facing us \ninternationally and nationally--economic, energy, world issues. We have \nto be able to juggle those all and move them forward. The public \ndemands it of us.\n  So this ultimatum, or whatever it is, this letter that they wrote \njust shows the classic tactic they have used the last 2 years. I \nmentioned this morning, and I will mention again, that I read in one of \nthe political news stories yesterday that someone on the other side, \none of the Senators from the other side, one of my colleagues, said: I \ncan't believe it took us a week--a week--to do food safety. Neither can \nI. But it was not anyone on this side of the equation. Over there, they \ndemanded us to have two 30-hour periods to debate food safety that \nended up passing with over three-quarters of the body supporting it. \nWhy? Because it is a good bill. But they wanted to delay it so we don't \nget to the main issues.\n  Again, Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I want to \ngive it. We thought they would be down here at 3:30. We thought they \nwould be down here at 3:45. Now it is 4 o'clock. They told us to get \nbusy. We are trying to get busy by doing some unanimous consent \nrequests on job creation. But I will just tell you, it is important for \nus to recognize what their goal is here: delay, delay, not helping the \nAmerican people, and basically giving bonuses to millionaires and \nbillionaires, which is unreal.\n  I see my colleague from New York wants to jump in, so I am going to \nyield for my colleague from New York. Again, I am hopeful there will be \nMembers on the other side so we can get on with propounding unanimous-\nconsent requests to get the Senate moving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know my colleague from New Mexico wants \nto say a few words about some of the job-creating proposals he has that \nhave been held up by Republicans blocking for their millionaire tax \ncuts, but here is a headline I wanted to alert my colleagues and the \nAmerican people to. This is Newsweek. It came out today. I want to read \nthis headline to the American people. And this is not a Democratic \npublication. ``Republicans Hold Senate Ransom for Rich Tax Cut.'' Let \nme repeat that. ``Republicans Hold Senate Ransom for Rich Tax Cut.'' I \ncouldn't have said it better myself. That is exactly what the other \nside is doing. They are so eager to reward the wealthiest among us with \na huge tax cut--even though we have a deficit, even though we have \nunemployment, even though we have so many\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\nother things to do--that they are holding up the entire Senate.\n  Enough already. Enough already. And I would like them to come to the \nfloor and defend holding everything up for a tax cut for the \nmillionaires. We are willing, and many of us--I know the Senator from \nMissouri and myself--are saying: Give the tax cut to the middle class \nbut not to the wealthiest among us, not because we don't like them, not \nbecause we don't admire them but, rather, because they are doing well, \nwe have a deficit, and we have other problems.\n  ``Republicans Hold Senate Ransom for Rich Tax Cut.'' That says it \nall.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield for a question.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I say to the Senator through the Chair that an awful \nlot of economists have met with I think all the Senators about the \nfrustrations we have with this economy. So the question we have asked \nover and over is, What is the most stimulative thing we can do for the \neconomy? What can we do in terms of our actions that will provide \ninjection of the most money into the economy and therefore create the \nmost jobs?\n  I am wondering if the Senator could share with us what it is that is \nthe most stimulative thing we can do.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Missouri for the question, \nwhich I will answer through the Chair.\n  The most stimulative thing we can do is to extend unemployment \nbenefits. Those folks will spend every dollar in our stores, in our \nrestaurants, and it will create jobs. If we give a tax break to \nmultimillionaires, oh, yeah, they will rush right to the supermarket to \nbuy that prime rib because they didn't have the money. Please.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Let me ask another question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield for another question.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. We obviously passed this tax cut a decade or so ago, \nand they decided to make it temporary, not permanent, when it was \npassed. So there was a decision made by the Senate that it wasn't \nworthy of being permanent, that it was temporary. So now here we are, \nit was temporary, and we have to decide whether we make it permanent. \nThat is really where the rubber meets the road because--and correct me \nif I am wrong--they made it temporary to see if this tax cut for the \nwealthy would create jobs.\n  I am so sick of hearing on every TV show in America, well, if you \ngive a 3-percent tax differential to the wealthiest people in America, \nthey are going to create all these jobs. Well, I am trying to figure \nout where the jobs are that this tax cut for the wealthy created. This \nwas an experiment. It didn't work. It didn't create the jobs. That is \nwhy we have this debate right now.\n  We have to decide whose side we are on. Are we on the side of the \nmiddle class, with shrinking income, with more frustration because they \ncan't do some of the basic things with their families that they always \nassumed they would be able to do in America or are we going to continue \na bonus to the wealthiest Americans which doesn't even stimulate jobs?\n  In fact, what we are going to do today is we are going to make a \nnumber of unanimous consent requests for things that will create jobs \nand see whether we can get our Republican colleagues to go along.\n  The Senator was here for that debate, but I am assuming one of the \nreasons it was temporary was to see if this experiment in more bonuses \nfor the wealthy would trickle down and create these jobs. It has been a \ndecade, and I ask the Senator, how well has it worked?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My colleague asks an excellent question. It has not \nworked. Unemployment is higher today with these tax cuts in effect than \nit was before they went into effect. We have had the slowest job growth \nin this decade even before the recession with these so-called breaks \nfor the wealthy in effect.\n  Let's go back a decade. The tax rate was, for the wealthiest, at 40 \npercent. We are not talking about a huge increase here; we are talking \nabout the difference between 35 and 39.6. But during that time, jobs \nwere created at a much more rapid rate, No. 1; No. 2, middle-class \nincomes expanded at a quicker rate than they did in this decade; and \nNo. 3, we had a surplus, not a deficit.\n  The bottom line is very simple: The tax cuts for the wealthy did not \nwork. The tax cuts for the wealthy did not work. They may have their \nideological reasons to give them, but I would rather see that money go \nnot only for unemployment insurance--and I will talk later about this--\nbut also for the HIRE Act, which gives breaks to businesses, where they \ndo not have to pay the payroll tax if they hire someone who is \nunemployed; for energy tax credits, which my colleague from New Mexico \nwill talk about; and for all kinds of different activities that have \nbeen proven to work.\n  I know my colleague from New Mexico is waiting, but I will once more \nread the headline from Newsweek, an article by Ben Adler, ``Republicans \nHold Senate Ransom for Rich Tax Cut.'' How do you like that, America?\n  I yield the floor because I know my colleague from New Mexico has \nbeen waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I would emphasize what all my \ncolleagues are saying, particularly what the Senator from Missouri \nsaid--a State that, as of last night at midnight, probably had some \n40,000 to 50,000, to 60,000 unemployed people lose their unemployment \nbenefits they had earned because they had worked and they and their \nemployer paid into it, but I would especially emphasize what she said.\n  Ten years ago, these tax cuts primarily, overwhelmingly, went to the \nwealthiest Americans, and it was an economic experiment. I opposed \nthem. I was in the House then. Congresswoman Stabenow opposed them. She \nwas in the Senate then, I guess. But it is clear they haven't worked--1 \nmillion jobs during the Bush years, 22 million jobs during the Clinton \nyears.\n  As a result--and I would emphasize this too--all of these proposals \nwe are going to bring forward now--and we will ask unanimous consent to \nget these passed to get the economy up and running--the cost of all of \nthem is less than the cost of this tax cut to millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee \nbe discharged of S. 3981, a bill to provide for a temporary extension \nof unemployment insurance provisions; that the Senate then proceed to \nits immediate consideration, the bill be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements \nrelating thereto appear at the appropriate place in the Record as if \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, we have heard here and in \nspeaking with the Senators here on the floor about a really appalling \naction that has been taking place. I have a letter here signed by all \nof the Republicans who are really threatening to bring this place to a \nhalt, completely bring it to a halt. They have written a letter to \nSenator Reid, and in the letter, they say:\n\n       We write to inform you that we will not agree to invoke \n     cloture on a motion to proceed to any legislative item.\n\n  They will not proceed to any legislative item until they get what I \nwould characterize as these taxpayer-funded bonuses for millionaires \nand billionaires. So they are going to bring the entire Senate to a \nstop.\n  Their letter quotes President Obama saying:\n\n       We owe it to the American people to focus on those issues \n     that affect their jobs.\n\n  Well, I have a bill right here that will affect the jobs of the \nAmerican people. It is called the clean energy bill. This is a clean \nenergy bill. It is S. 1574, the Clean Energy for Homes and Buildings \nAct.\n  As all of us know, clean energy is going to be the industrial \nrevolution of the future, trying to move us toward renewable energy--\nsolar, wind, biomass, and geothermal. This is where we are going to see \njob growth in the future. This is our chance to be out there in front \non the technology we invented here in the United States. This is the \nway you create clean energy jobs.\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\n  So the demand they have issued to us--the ultimatum, really--is, you \ncan't bring a clean energy jobs bill, which we have worked on very hard \nto get to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Energy Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 1574; that the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read three \ntimes and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate, and that any statements relating to \nthe measure be printed in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this \nrequest just came to us moments ago. This is the first time we have \nseen this request, and I cannot speak to the merits of this bill or the \nproblems that may exist.\n  What I do know is that 42 Senators from this side of the aisle have \nsigned a letter to say that what we ought to do and what we need to do \nis to find a way to fund the government and prevent a tax hike on every \nAmerican come January 1.\n  Mr. President, some of these requests may have bipartisan support, \nbut we don't know anything about the specific legislation as we have \njust received this request. I think almost every bill in this package \nof requests that we are going to be considering now is still in \ncommittee, so we don't even know if the ranking member of that \ncommittee has concerns or potential changes.\n  This is not the way to handle this. This is December; it is a \nlameduck session. Let's stop the theater and get to the business we all \nknow we need to address.\n  I object.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming has \nsaid these bills we are trying to bring to the floor here aren't out of \ncommittee. I believe he is incorrect when it comes to things such as \nthe START treaty.\n  Here we have the Republican Party saying they aren't going to \nconsider anything else until they get these taxpayer-funded bonuses for \ntheir millionaires and billionaires. That is what they are saying. Yet \nwe have a treaty that is pending. It is on the calendar, Mr. President. \nIf we look on that Executive Calendar there, it is on the calendar. We \nwant to bring that up. In fact, I believe Senator Kyl said today that \nwe are not going to bring that up. We are going to stop everything. I \nsaw him on television talking about how we are going to stop everything \nand that we are just not going to bring up that treaty.\n  So there are things pending on the calendar that are ready to go. And \nthis treaty in particular deals with our national security. National \nsecurity used to be an issue where Democrats and Republicans worked \ntogether. But with this letter, it looks as if they are not going to be \nbipartisan. They are going to issue this ultimatum, and they are not \ngoing to try to work with us on these kinds of issues.\n  While they are doing that, we no longer have inspections, we no \nlonger are allowed to go to Russia and look at their sites and find out \nif they are complying with previous treaties. This new START treaty \nwould allow us to do that. But, instead, what we are seeing here, over \nand over again, are these kinds of objections.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague from Wyoming a \nquestion in reference to what he just spoke about? I thank him for \nyielding for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, my colleague said he wanted to make sure \nhis colleagues on that side of the aisle didn't want to do anything \nelse until they made sure there was a tax cut for every American. Let \nme pose a hypothetical. Let's say we gave a tax break to every American \nwhose income was below $1 million but not to people above $1 million. \nWould he and his colleagues continue to block things, such as the \nunemployment insurance, the HIRE Act, and energy tax credits? In other \nwords, when the Senator says a tax break for every American, does he \nmean it has to be for millionaires?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, my statement was, what I do know is that \n42 Republicans have signed a letter to say what we ought to do and what \nwe need to do is to find a way to fund the government and prevent a tax \nhike on every American come January 1.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague yield for another question, a \nfollowup?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would be happy to read the entire letter that was \nsent to Senator Reid if there is some question as to what was exactly \nin that letter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My question is very simple. The Senator said he wanted \nto prevent a tax hike on every American. Hypothetically, if we \nprevented a tax hike on every American except the small number whose \nincome was over $1 million last year, would my colleague and his \ncolleagues continue to block efforts to do any other piece of \nlegislation?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am not going to answer a hypothetical. \nWhat I will tell you is, we did send a letter to Leader Reid. I will be \nhappy to go through the entire letter at this point:\n\n       Dear Leader Reid: The nation's unemployment level, stuck \n     near 10 percent, is unacceptable to Americans. Senate \n     Republicans have been urging Congress to make private-sector \n     job creation a priority all year. President Obama in his \n     first speech after the November election said ``we owe'' it \n     to the American people to ``focus on those issues that affect \n     their jobs.'' He went on to say that Americans ``want jobs to \n     come back faster.'' Our constituents have repeatedly asked us \n     to focus on creating an environment for private-sector job \n     growth; it is time that our constituents' priorities become \n     the Senate's priorities.\n       For that reason, we write to inform you that we will not \n     agree to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to any \n     legislative item until the Senate has acted to fund the \n     government and we have prevented the tax increase that is \n     currently awaiting all American taxpayers. With little time \n     left in this Congressional session, legislative scheduling \n     should be focused on these critical priorities. While there \n     are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the \n     Senate's attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters \n     above the critical issues of funding the government and \n     preventing a job-killing tax hike.\n       Given our struggling economy, preventing the tax increase \n     and providing economic certainty should be our top priority. \n     Without Congressional action by December 31, all American \n     taxpayers will be hit by an increase in their individual \n     income-tax rates and investment income through the capital \n     gains and dividend rates. If Congress were to adopt the \n     President's tax proposal to prevent the tax increase for only \n     some Americans, small businesses would be targeted with a \n     job-killing tax increase at the worst possible time, \n     Specifically, more than 750,000 small businesses will see a \n     tax increase, which will affect 50 percent of small-business \n     income and nearly 25 percent of the entire workforce. The \n     death tax rate will also climb from zero percent to 55 \n     percent, which makes it the top concern for America's small \n     businesses. Republicans and Democrats agree that small \n     businesses create most new jobs, so we ought to be able to \n     agree that raising taxes on small businesses is the wrong \n     remedy in this economy. Finally, Congress still needs to act \n     on the ``tax extenders'' and the alternative minimum tax \n     ``patch,'' all of which expired on December 31, 2009.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you in a \n     constructive manner to keep the government operating and \n     provide the nation's small businesses with economic certainty \n     that the job-killing tax hike will be prevented.\n\n  With that, I tell you that all 42 members of the Republican Party, \nthis side of the aisle, have signed their names.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I have a great deal \nof respect for my colleague from Wyoming, but he has not answered the \nquestion and it is obvious why, because the Republican Party and all 42 \nmembers care as much or more about giving a $100,000 tax break to \nsomeone whose income is $1 million as they care to give a small tax \nbreak to somebody whose income is $50,000. That is what we are here \ntalking about.\n  The reason this letter and the response of my good friend from \nWyoming to my question doesn't answer the question is because they are \nhiding. They are hiding behind the curtain of protecting the \nmillionaires. We are\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\npulling that curtain open and we are showing the American people and \nwill continue to show that the No. 1 goal of the Republican Party is \nnot jobs, it is not helping the middle class, it is not getting our \ngreen energy industry going, it is not helping small businesses hiring \npeople as in the HIRE Act, it is to give the millionaires a huge tax \nbreak and hold hostage that the middle class will not get their tax \nbreak. We are going to continue to go at it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I agree with one thing my friend from \nWyoming said in the letter they signed, which is we should not be \ncontinuing job-killing practices. I would say after 10 years of tax \ncuts for the wealthy, where are the jobs? If there ever was a policy \nthat didn't work, it was that one. We have lost, in Michigan alone, \nover 800,000 jobs under the policy they want to continue. In the \ncountry we have lost over 8 million jobs under the economic policy they \nwant to continue--not helping the middle class, not helping small \nbusiness but giving the bonus benefit, the extra tax cut to those at \nthe top, hoping it will trickle down. Frankly, we are tired of waiting \nfor it to trickle down.\n  What we are proposing and I am going to offer as a unanimous consent \nrequest is to continue something that is actually working, that is \nactually creating jobs in this country and beginning to turn \nmanufacturing around.\n  I think the exchange between the distinguished Senator from New York \nwith my friend from Wyoming is very telling. Even if we were talking \nabout tax cuts for those up to $1 million, that is still not enough.\n  This is not about small business. People on the other side of the \naisle have filibustered and voted against 16 different tax cuts for \nsmall businesses in the last 18 months, 8 of those in September and \nOctober. This is not about small business. We are the folks who have \nbeen fighting for small business and will continue to do that, as well \nas those in the middle class.\n  I am going to ask, in a moment, unanimous consent for something that \nis an extremely effective and exciting new focus for our country; that \nis, on something called clean energy manufacturing. We are committing \nto making it in America. We want to see the words ``Made in America'' \nagain. I want to see ``Made in Michigan,'' frankly, on all those \nproducts.\n  One of the things that 18 months ago we passed as part of the \nRecovery Act was something called an advanced manufacturing tax credit, \nto allow companies to deduct 30 percent of their costs for new plants, \nnew equipment, hiring people in the area of green energy: wind, solar, \nelectric, batteries, and so on. We have seen across the country now, \n183 new manufacturing facilities in 43 different States across the \ncountry as a result of that. People are being hired, and every month we \nare seeing manufacturing numbers go up rather than down in the last 18 \nmonths. If, in fact, we add another $5 billion, another small \ninvestment compared to the $700 billion for millionaires and \nbillionaires in the tax cut--if we just invest $5 billion of that, it \nis estimated we will unleash at least $15 billion in total capital \ninvestments, partnering with the private sector, and create tens of \nthousands of new construction and manufacturing jobs.\n  That is our priority--things that work, focusing on jobs and making \nthings in America again.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3324, the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration and the bill be read \nthree times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements relating to \nthe measure be printed in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this \nrequest, again, has come to us just moments ago. This is the first time \nwe have had a chance to look at this. I will not speak to the merits of \nthe bill and the problems that may exist, but this is not the way to \nhandle this. As you know, we are now in December, in the lameduck \nsession. There are things that could have been brought up any time in \nthe last 1\\1/2\\ years to 2 years, and we have focused specifically on \nmaking sure taxes are not increased for Americans between now and \nJanuary 1. All Americans are concerned about those taxes going up.\n  As a result, I think it is time to stop the theater we have and get \nto the business we all know we need to address and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is not theater. This is about real \npeople in my State who want to work. This is about investing in middle-\nclass jobs and manufacturing. It is about taking a policy that has been \nin place now for 18 months that has worked and being able to extend it.\n  In terms of bringing this up for the first time, we have focused on \nit and have been debating it and discussing it over and over. The bill \nI asked unanimous consent for is bipartisan. This is not new. We have \nnot been able to get through the obstructionism, the throwing of sand \nin the gears, and the filibustering to bring this up. If we want to \nfocus on something between now and the end of the year, let's focus on \njobs and getting people back to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4915, something we have \nbeen discussing the last week, and that all after the enacting clause \nbe stricken and the substitute amendment at the desk, a fully offset \nrepeal of section 9006 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, the Small Business 1099 paperwork mandate, be agreed to, that the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed and that the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nindicate, as someone who has voted in fact to repeal this particular \nprovision, I think it is important we get that done. We actually have a \nmajority of Members who have supported getting that done. Senator \nBaucus, the chair of the Finance Committee, brought forward a proposal \nthat unfortunately did not get the bipartisan support necessary to be \nable to do it, but we are committed to getting this done. It is \nsomething I hope our colleagues will join with us in as we bring the \ntax bill to the floor before the end of the year. It is important, in \nmy judgment, that we repeal this provision, which I do believe is \nonerous for small business, but it needs to be done in the context of \nthe broader package, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wyoming still has the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by my \ncolleague from Michigan because this was brought to the floor \npreviously but with a threshold of 67 votes, and there were two \ndifferent approaches to trying to help the small businesses across the \ncountry that are all being held hostage by a very onerous paperwork \nrequirement in filing. But the threshold of needing 67 votes was too \nhigh, even though people from both sides of the aisle voted for both \nthe measures that were offered.\n  We want to help small businesses around the country and eliminate \nwhat the IRS says is going to be almost impossible to comply with, what \nsmall businesses say is going to be expensive to carry out, and what \nSenator Johanns, in an amendment, has a paid-for solution. I think this \nis something we should, as a Senate and as a body, be committed to \nadopting. The President of the United States says this needs to be \nsolved.\n  What I heard now is an objection to something I think is a very \nreasonable request, and I am sorry that objection has been made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let me just indicate again, as a Senator who voted for \nboth proposals that were in front of us, I could not agree more. We \nhave to get this done. I believe there is a commitment on both sides of \nthe aisle to get\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\nthis done. You are correct that the 67-vote threshold was very high. We \nneed to come back in a different context and get this done. I am \ncommitted to working with my colleague to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, my friend from Wyoming, who is a good \nguy, just said that the motions we are making, unanimous-consent \nmotions--that these things could have been brought up earlier. Oh, if \nonly it were true. If only it were true that we could have brought \nthese things up earlier. If anybody has been paying attention, they \nwould understand that our friends across the aisle have been blocking \neverything, including motherhood and apple pie, for the last year. They \nhave voted unanimously to move judicial nominations out of the \nJudiciary Committee, and then they languish and they will not allow us \nto bring them up for a vote.\n  Then my friend said we need to stop the theater. Well, let me tell \nyou what theater is. Theater is when a Senator says: If we cannot get \neverything resolved and all of the spending decisions made by Monday, \nwell, then, I just don't think we can do the START treaty. Theater is \nhaving 42 Senators say: We will not participate unless you do what we \nwant to do today. That is theater. That is theater. Theater is saying: \nWell, you could have brought this up earlier, when everyone knows they \nblocked everything we wanted to bring up. That is theater. What you are \nseeing on this side right now is a healthy dose of indignation on \nbehalf of the American people who are hurting.\n  I think back. I think back to elections past when great patriots were \naccused in the most vivacious ways of being soft on national security. \nI remember a Senator who lost his limbs in battle who had \nadvertisements run against him that somehow he was soft on terror \nbecause of a twist and distortion of a vote he had cast in the Senate.\n  Now fast forward. We have a treaty that the military unanimously \nsupports, that the Secretaries of State for those Republican Presidents \nwho warned us about loose nuclear weapons and terrorists--their \nSecretaries of State have stood up and said this is the thing to do. \nThe ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, \nSenator Lugar--is there anyone more respected on what we should be \ndoing to protect this Nation than Senator Dick Lugar? And they are \nholding this treaty hostage to protect millionaires. Has it come to \nthat? They now are willing to risk national security, the security of \nthis Nation, because they refuse to allow us to stop the extra-big tax \nbonuses to millionaires and billionaires. Can you imagine what would \nhave happened to somebody in my party who had the nerve to stand up in \nthe face of our allies, our military, bipartisan support, everyone from \nPat Buchanan to Colin Powell, who has said to the American people that \nthis START treaty is necessary? And they are saying: Well, if you don't \ngive us a tax break for millionaires by Monday, we are going to go \nhome. Really? It takes your breath away. It just takes your breath \naway. I have some unanimous-consent requests I will also make today, \nbut I really want that to sink in.\n  We have reached every goalpost they have put up on the START treaty, \nand then they have moved it. We have no verification of nuclear weapons \nin Russia right now, and we haven't for months, and they are nibbling \naround the edges because--do you know what I believe this might be? I \nmight believe this is part of the strategy that was announced by the \nleader of the Republican Party that their No. 1 priority is to defeat \nPresident Obama, to damage him. They want to deny the passage of this \ntreaty, I believe--it certainly has the appearance, anyway, that this \nis about damaging President Obama.\n  We should be focused on our national security. We should be focused \non giving tax cuts to Middle America. We should be focused on tax cuts \nto small businesses. We have done net tax cuts in this country of $300 \nbillion in the last 18 months, and all of those tax cuts were focused \nlike a laser on the middle class and on small businesses.\n  Do not let anybody sell you a bill of goods that the Democratic Party \nis not fighting for tax cuts for Middle America and small business. \nNow, we are not so excited about the millionaires. Those are not \nstimulative. They have not created the jobs. It has been an economic \nexperiment that has failed. Once again, the trickle down did not \ntrickle. And it is time for us to get busy, make these tax cuts \npermanent for the middle class, and continue to try to reduce our \ndeficit.\n  I see my friend. Nobody has worked harder, and I have tried to be a \npartner with him to reduce spending in the Federal Government. But this \nall of a sudden ``we are going to take our football and go home if you \ndon't give us what we want by Monday''--and here is the richest part of \nthis. The person who is saying ``we are going to go home on Monday if \nwe don't get it by Monday'' is the person who is negotiating. He is \nsupposed to be negotiating at 5:30. I mean, it is like looking in the \nmirror and saying: Hey, if you don't get it done by Monday--if he wants \nto get it done by Monday, then be reasonable about the millionaires. Be \nreasonable about the millionaires, and we can get this done, and we can \ngo home and celebrate Christmas with our families and come back and \nstart hard next year to reduce this deficit with a good downpayment--\n$300 billion going to reduce the deficit because we are not going to \ngive a very small, incremental tax increase to people who have plenty \nof cash right now. What they really need, those millionaires, they need \nthe middle class to have some money to spend to create the demand. That \nis the economic policy that makes sense in this climate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent I wish to do, \nbut before I do that, I want to say that I know the Senator from \nWyoming is not here right now, but I want to echo the point that we are \ngoing to deal with the 1099s. It is a question of making sure we pay \nfor it the right way. I do not think anyone in this body--we are \nmotivated and I think a lot of us are working in a bipartisan way to \nresolve that issue.\n  As someone who has been in the small business world since the age of \n14, who has had a business license since that age, I have aggressively \ntalked about the issue of small business, I have lived small business, \nand I clearly understand what the 1099 is all about. I talked about \nthis issue back in July and made it clear that we need to deal with it \nand get rid of it. So we are going to be working on it. We will see \nthis, hopefully, as part of the tax package, a tax extender package, \nand we will deal with it.\n  I come to the floor because I also have a unanimous consent I would \nlike to do in regard to small business. This is a bill that will help \nwhat they call HUBZones, HUB areas that are high unemployment to the \ntune of 140 percent of the average adjusted unemployment rate. These \nhave been very helpful for many different communities across this \ncountry as well as in our State.\n  This is the Rebuilding Local Business Act of 2010. It amends the \nSmall Business Act and designates HUBZones and gives them another 3 \nyears of opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Small Business \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3563 and that \nthe Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration, the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwonder if I might be recognized to speak following the objection I \nintend to make--reserving the right to object, Republicans have said \nthat we believe the single most important step we can take to create \njobs is to keep the current tax rates, which will go up automatically \non January 1; secondly, we need to fund the government--funding expires \nthis Friday; and that after that, we can move to whatever else the \nDemocratic leader would like to bring up. We should fund the \ngovernment, keep the tax rates where they are, freeze spending, and go \nhome.\n  I object.\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, still having the floor, let me respond. \nFirst off, I want to make sure, as the public is watching this, what \nthat means. Keeping the tax rates where they are means millionaires and \nbillionaires continue to get a bonus because that is what it is, with \nno disrespect to my colleague on the other side. I mean, corporations, \nbusinesses today--and I can speak about this, again with no disrespect \nto my colleague, as someone in the small business world. Our family is \nin this business. My wife owns four retail stores, started from \nscratch, just as I did in many of my businesses. The small business \ncommunity--the small business community--benefits not by the people \nover the 2 percent, the top 2 percent; the small business community are \nthe ones below that. Half of the businesses in this country, the small \nbusinesses, gross less than $25,000. That is a fact.\n  So for us to just kind of continue business as usual and keep these \ntax rates where they are for the millionaire and billionaire club--that \ndidn't help us the last 3 years. The fact is, right now they have those \ntax breaks. Right today, they have those. They had them last year. They \nhad them the year before. And what happened to this economy? It crashed \nand burned almost to the ground. What has happened to the millionaire \nand billionaire club? They have more money in their bank accounts today \nthan ever before. That is not me saying it; that is other independent \ndata out there. Corporations have more cash on hand today than they \nhave had in decades.\n  So for us now to say: Hey, let's give the millionaires and \nbillionaires another bonus for the next year for running our economy \ninto the ground doesn't make any sense to me and doesn't make sense to \nthe people back home in my State, the Alaskans I talk to every single \nday. As a matter of fact, when I came here in January of 2009, we were \nin our fourth or fifth month, if I remember right, of losing 500,000 to \n700,000 jobs a month. Do you know what that is equal to? That is the \ntotal population of my State every single month being lost.\n  People who are saying we have to make sure the millionaires and \nbillionaires have this $700 billion bonus, paid for by the taxpayers of \nthis country, to drive us more into debt, and believe that is going to \nsolve this economic problem is absolutely wrong. I have had to scratch \nnickles and dimes together to build businesses. I have done it before. \nI have succeeded and failed. That is not what grows business, giving \nmillionaires and billionaires breaks. What makes a difference, for \nexample, is the small business bill we passed, where we only got two \nvotes on the other side, a small business bill that brought money to \nloan small businesses. That is what makes a difference, or extending \nthe tax credit, which we did, not only during the recovery bill, the \nstimulus bill, which I know everyone on the other side hates, but also \nduring our small business bill so people can buy equipment and \ndepreciate it in the first year, write it off in the first year. That \nis of real benefit to small businesses. Extending the SBA loan program, \nexpanding it from the limitations they had before to $5 million to make \nsure that the front-end fees do not have to be charged, what did that \ndo in my State? It tripled--tripled--the loan capacity of SBA to small \nbusinesses. That was supported on this side. You want to grow small \nbusiness. That is how you do it, because the way it has worked, we \ndrove into the biggest recession since the Great Depression.\n  So I respect the comments on the other side, but for us to say to the \nAmerican taxpayers: Hey, we are going to give another $700 billion to \nmillionaires and billionaires, is beyond comprehension--beyond \ncomprehension, especially when we tell them: Oh, by the way, it is \ngoing to be debt financed. So my son, who is 8 today, and his kids, my \ngrandkids, maybe, in the future, will still be paying that bill because \nwe were told that by Monday we have to make a decision.\n  I am not doing that. I didn't come here to play those games, to swap \noff the START treaty or national security for the benefit of \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  The other thing I have learned about this place, we can multitask. I \ncame down here this morning, no one was on the Senate floor. I go to \ncommittee meetings--there is supposed to be 15, 25 people--2 people \nshow up, maybe 4. I don't know what other people are doing. I am \nshowing up because that is what I was sent here to do by the people of \nmy State, to come here and work. For us to sit around and say we can \nonly do one thing at a time--I talk to families every single day. They \nare doing multiple things every day, every single day. Why we can't, \nwith all the staff we have, all the abilities we have, focus on more \nthan one thing is ridiculous.\n  Again, no disrespect to the Senator from Tennessee. I mean him no ill \nwords. I am frustrated. I didn't come here for these kinds of games. We \nput a 1099 amendment on the Food Safety Act. People are asking: What \nare we doing? I heard yesterday, why did we spend a week on the food \nsafety bill. The other side wanted to delay it because it was good \npolitics for them to delay and drag it out. So here we are. We have a \ndeadline. We have to get this passed or we are going home. If you don't \nwant to be around here, then go home. But the fact is, the American \npeople sent us here, Alaskans sent me here to not just do one issue but \nto do multiple issues. That is what our country is about. It is \ncomplex. There is no single issue that drives the economy. But giving \nmillionaires and billionaires a $700 billion tax bonus is ridiculous.\n  I appreciate the comments. I am sorry my colleague objected to this \none item because in order to build this economy, we have to have \nmultiple things in play. This gives more tools to the private sector to \ngrow their neighborhoods and businesses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I appreciate the opportunity to rant for a little bit and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8330-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8330-S8340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Alabama here. I \ndon't want to take time from him. Let me see if I can go back to the \nbeginning.\n  The government runs out of money Friday. Taxes go up at the end of \nthe month. Republicans have written a letter to the majority leader \nthat says: Let's focus on those two things. Let's fund the government \nand let's keep the tax rates where they are which would be the single \nbest thing we could do in the middle of an economic downturn to help \ncreate jobs, and then we are ready to go home.\n  We think we heard the results of the election. Our friends on the \nother side keep on insisting on an encore after a concert which \nattracted a lot of boos. What the American people were saying to us is, \nfund the government, keep the tax rates where they are, freeze \nspending, and go home. Bring the new Congress back in January, and \nlet's begin to work on the priorities of the American people which are, \nNo. 1, to make it easier and cheaper to create private sector jobs; No. \n2, bring spending closer to revenues; and No. 3, be smart and strategic \nin dealing with terror. So one, two, three--those should be our \nobjectives.\n  In the last 2 weeks in this so-called lameduck session, insisting on \nan encore after a concert that attracted a lot of boos shows a lot of \ntone deaf politicians.\n  What we Republicans have asked is extraordinarily reasonable. The \nPresident--and I give him great credit for this--had a bipartisan \nleadership meeting. It was the best one he has had since he has been \nPresident. It was constructive. As a result, the Republican and \nDemocratic leaders who met together said: We will designate a smaller \ngroup to see if we can work out the tax part of this. Then, in the \ndiscussion that came afterwards, we, on our side, made it clear to the \nPresident and to the Democratic leader that after you fund the \ngovernment--remember, the money runs out Friday. We have to do this. \nNobody wants the government to shut down. After we deal with taxes--\nremember, they go up automatically at the first of the year--then we \nwill go to wherever the majority leader of the Senate wants to go. He \nis the single person who can bring up something,\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nand if he chooses to go to the DREAM Act, if he chooses to go to Don't \nAsk, Don't Tell, if he chooses to go to a whole laundry list of other \nissues, that is entirely his prerogative.\n  We, under the traditions of the Senate, have the right to make the \nvoices heard of the people we represent and amend and debate things. If \nthe majority leader says: I have listened to the President. He thinks \nthe New START treaty is the most important thing to go to next. He can \nbring that up if he wishes to. We can debate that. We would want ample \ntime to do that. That is a part of the Senate tradition as well.\n  There is nothing in the letter that 42 Republicans signed that says \nanything about national security or the New START treaty. It talks \nabout legislative proposals. We recognize that until some fortuitous \nevent should occur that we might have the majority, it is up to the \nDemocratic leader what comes up.\n  The Senator from Missouri was talking about the New START treaty. We \nare not talking about it. In fact, we are meeting on it. We are working \nwith the administration to see if nuclear modernization can be properly \ndone.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will not. I will continue my remarks and the Senator \nmay gain the floor later.\n  We are working on making certain that if the New START treaty is \napproved, we are not left with a collection of wet matches. We want to \nmake sure the nuclear warheads we have work.\n  I am one Republican who is open to voting for the New START treaty. I \nsee the advantages of the data and of the inspections that come from \nit. I know the tradition of disarmament and nuclear arms control. I am \ndeeply concerned about the condition of the facilities that do our \nnuclear modernization. I am impressed with the progress the President \nis making in that area. Let's continue to make that progress. If the \nmajority leader wants to move to that, he can. But instead this \nafternoon we get a long list of new proposals that have come in here \nthat we haven't read, that haven't been through committee. It reminds \nme of Christmas Eve a year ago. Let's just bring a bunch of bills in \nhere. Nobody has read them. It doesn't matter.\n  The American people said in November they didn't like that. So they \nsent a bunch of new people here.\n  With all respect, we understand what it is like to lose an election. \nWe have lost a lot of them lately. We had very few Republicans elected \nin 2006. We had very few elected in 2008. We thought the people had \nsomething to say to us. We tried to learn from that. We hadn't been \ndoing some things well. We are trying to work our way back. We are \ntrying to re-earn the confidence of the American people going step by \nstep. We think the steps that are appropriate today are to keep the tax \nrates where they are in the middle of an economic downturn. It makes no \nsense to tax job creators at a time when unemployment has been above \n9.5 percent for 16 out of the last 17 months and when it has only been \nthat high for 30 out of the last 862 months.\n  What we are suggesting is the kind of thing that President Obama's \nformer budget director has suggested, Mr. Orszag. He said: Let's extend \nit for 2 years because raising taxes in the middle of an economic \ndownturn makes no sense because it doesn't create jobs. We would like \nfor them to be permanent. That is a possible area of compromise. Keep \nthe tax rates where they are, deal with funding the government, and \nthen let's move to whatever subject the majority leader would like to \nmove to, including the New START treaty, if he thinks that is the most \nimportant area.\n  I wish to make sure the Republican position is well understood. I \nunderstand we have printed in the Record our letter to Senator Reid of \nyesterday which says very simply: Dear Mr. Majority Leader, we 42 \nRepublicans believe that we should keep tax rates where they are \nbecause they go up at the end of the month, and we should fund the \ngovernment because it runs out of money Friday. And after those two, we \ncan move to whatever legislative item you would like to. Of course, we \nhave no comment on whether you move to a treaty such as the New START \ntreaty. That is our position. We believe that is a reasonable position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be brief, but I do appreciate so much the \ncomments of the Senator from Tennessee. He is one of our most valuable \nMembers. He is an honest person. He can summarize complex matters in \nways even I can understand. I think he stated honestly and fairly where \nwe are today.\n  Not only did President Obama's own Office of Management and Budget \nDirector, Peter Orszag, say we ought to keep the rates where they are, \nnot go up on the upper income people at this time of economic stress \nand job loss, not raise taxes on them--although my colleague is saying \nthat somehow if we pass this legislation it would be a bonus. For 10 \nyears these rates have been at this level. We are talking about raising \nthe rates if we don't take action.\n  I am going to recall that Senator Alexander serves on the Budget \nCommittee, as does Senator McCaskill. We worked hard on some important \nlegislation together that I think will be helpful in containing \nspending.\n  We recently had a Budget Committee hearing a few months ago. I think \nSenators Alexander and McCaskill were there. We had three premier, \nexceedingly well-known economists testify, two called by the majority \nand one called by the Republican minority. That is sort of traditional. \nWe had Mr. Zandi from Moody's, Allen Blinder of Princeton, and John \nTaylor of the Taylor rule. The violation of his rule by Mr. Bernanke \nwas a significant factor in the bubble in housing. But Mr. Taylor was a \nRepublican witness. All three said: Don't raise taxes now in this \neconomy.\n  It is offensive to me a bit to have my colleagues stand up and in a \ndemagogic way say: You are trying to give a tax benefit, a bonus to \nmillionaires. I don't believe that is accurate. These three premier \neconomists, two of them called by the Democratic majority, said: Don't \nraise taxes.\n  Do you think these economists were saying this because they want to \nhelp millionaires, or do you think they were making that opinion \nbecause they believe it would be best for the economy and help more \nAmericans who are out of work get work?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Assuming the Senator from Alabama still has the floor, \nI agree with him, in answer to the question. The idea is that you don't \nraise taxes in the middle of an economic downturn because it makes it \nharder to create jobs. And that raising those taxes now makes no sense. \nThat is simply the argument.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And Mr. Orszag was a former Congressional Budget Office \nhead and also was chosen by President Obama when he first came to \noffice for that significant, premier center of the government, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, a student of these issues, far more \nliberal in ways than I would be in a lot of matters. But he has \nindicated he did not think we should raise taxes now that he has left \nthe administration.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, that is his point. He wrote that in the Wall \nStreet Journal shortly after he left the administration. I believe, in \nfairness to Mr. Orszag, he said tax rates ought to be differentiated, \nand he expects that we would have a big argument about the levels of \ntaxation, if we are doing something in a permanent way. But he did say \nvery clearly that given the length and severity of the economic \ndownturn, that the logical thing to do would be to keep the current \nrates exactly where they are for at least 2 years because not to do so \nwould clearly cause job loss.\n  If we are listening to the American people and we have our eyes open, \nmaking it easier and cheaper to create private sector jobs should be \nour main objective, and raising taxes on anybody in an economic \ndownturn runs against that objective.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for sharing those thoughts. I would \nsay it is concerning that this gets boiled down to some sort of an idea \nthat we are just trying to protect the rich.\n  What we are trying to do is to do something to help this economy to \nallow the private sector to create jobs and reduce this unemployment, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\nis maddeningly remaining at very high, unacceptable levels. Everybody, \nall the economists and others, tells us the economy will not come back \nuntil we have a lower unemployment rate. Raising taxes is not the way \nto lower unemployment, and we are talking about a significant increase \nto 39.6 percent on upper income taxpayers.\n  These are small businesspeople. I met one gentleman who has 10 fast \nfood restaurants and 200 employees. He told me with the health care \nbill and the stress he is seeing, he expects to be laying off 70 of \nthose employees. We do not need to even be laying off 7. We need to be \nable to hire more, if we can, so we can have more people working.\n  Then we have, in addition, a 2.9-percent increase on upper income \npeople, a 2.9-percent additional tax for Medicare. That makes the total \ntax rate about 42.8 percent or 42.6 percent. Plus, my State of Alabama \nhas a 5-percent income tax. That makes it 47 percent. Some have 10 \npercent income tax. Then we pay sales taxes. Then we pay property \ntaxes, and other taxes, gasoline taxes and those things. So the idea \nthat we can just continue to ratchet up taxes without consequence to \nthe economy is not accurate.\n  I do remember and would say one more thing. I talked to a businessman \nat an airport of an international company. He is the CEO for North \nAmerica. He told me they had sought to obtain an environmental chemical \nprocess in the United States at their plant, and he thought he had won \nit. The people in Europe, who evaluate the proposals--it would have \nadded 200 jobs in my State of Alabama--they said: Sorry, you have lost \nbecause you did not count taxes. And tax rates are higher in the United \nStates than for the competing company. They had plants all over the \nworld. This other plant, in another country that had lower taxes, was \ngoing to get it. We lost 200 jobs in the United States as a direct \nresult of higher taxes.\n  So I just want to repeat, it is an absolute myth that we can just \nraise taxes on productive enterprises and small businesspeople who do a \nsubchapter S and take their money directly rather than through \ncorporate taxes; that we can raise those taxes and it will not have a \njob impact. It will have a job impact. That is why all three of the \neconomists who testified before the Budget Committee--two of them \nDemocrats--said: Don't raise taxes now. That is why Mr. Orszag said: \nDon't raise taxes now.\n  I see my colleague seeking the floor, and I am pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I yield the floor so the Senator from \nNew York can be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding the \nfloor. I will be brief.\n  I would first like to ask my colleagues a question of any of my \nRepublican colleagues. They say we have to do this by Monday. It is one \nof the most important economic issues we have. If today we were to \noffer you--certainly I would; I cannot speak for every one of my \ncolleagues--we will keep the tax rates the same for everyone whose \nincome is below $1 million and have them go up to what they were in the \nClinton years for people $1 million or higher, how is that for a \ncompromise? Would you accept it? Well, I would ask any of my colleagues \nto come on the floor and tell us why they would or would not accept it.\n  We all know there was greater prosperity in the Clinton years than \nthere was during the Bush years. We all know there was less of a \ndeficit--in fact, a surplus at the end of the Clinton years--and a huge \ndeficit in the Bush years. We also all know just about every economist \ntells us that tax cuts, taxes for millionaires, do not create jobs. \nThis is not capital gains. This is not an investment tax credit. This \nis personal income of millionaires and billionaires. It is one of the \nleast effective ways to create jobs.\n  So, again, I would ask my colleagues, are you willing to accept that \ncompromise? I am.\n  I would like the Record to show no Republican colleague has accepted \nthat compromise.\n  I have another proposal I would like to offer before I yield back \nquickly to my colleague from Missouri.\n  Orrin Hatch and I passed a bipartisan bill, a tax cut for small \nbusinesses and large businesses, called the HIRE Act. It said if you \nhired somebody during the course of 2010, and they were unemployed for \n60 days, they did not pay payroll tax. It has been regarded as a \nsuccess. Five million jobs have been created since it passed. We cannot \nattribute all of them to the HIRE Act, but certainly it had to do with \na good number of them. I would like to see us move that bill right now. \nIt is a tax cut. It is for business. It creates jobs.\n  So I ask unanimous consent--and I would like to do that now, not to \nwait until we give a tax break to millionaires. These could be retired \npeople who do nothing, who have a load of money, not small businesses \nworking hard that would get a tax break.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. 3623 and that the Senate then proceed \nto its immediate consideration, the bill be read three times and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate, and that any statements related to the \nmeasure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would say as to the question raised by my esteemed \ncolleague, I respect his economic judgment, but I respect the economic \njudgment more of Mr. Zandi of Moody's, Mr. Blinder of Princeton, and \nMr. Taylor of the Taylor rule. They all have said without exception: Do \nnot raise taxes in this economy, and those persons who might be making \nhigher incomes most likely are the people who have the most employees \nand could be affected. They could pay for that by reducing employees. I \nwould also cite him Mr. Peter Orszag, President Obama's own former \nbudget director. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield for my colleague from Missouri \nwho graciously yielded to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, sometimes we selectively like certain \ntestimony and dislike other testimony around here. My friend from \nAlabama is so proud of Mr. Zandi. I think it is important we put on the \nrecord what else Mr. Zandi said.\n  Mr. Zandi said if we had not passed the stimulus, we would have a \ndepression. Now I hear the other side saying there was nothing worse \nthan the stimulus. Mr. Zandi said if we had not done the stimulus, we \nwould have a depression.\n  Now, I think Mr. Zandi would also say, if he were here right now, \nthat the least stimulative tax cut we could do is a personal tax rate \nat the very highest bracket. Do you know what he would say is the most \nstimulative thing we could do to the economy right now? Unemployment \nbenefits. And what are we fighting over? They are blocking the most \nstimulating thing we can do for the economy to do the least stimulating \nthing for the economy for the millionaires and billionaires.\n  Let's go over that again to make sure we understand this. The same \neconomist my Republican friend is hanging his hat on has said, time and \ntime again, the only thing that stood between this country and a \ndepression was passing the stimulus. Now my colleagues want to use that \nsame economist to justify holding up unemployment benefits, holding up \nthe START Treaty, national security, and holding up any other business \nof the Senate, judicial nominations, work that needs to be done, to \nprotect the millionaires and billionaires.\n  We do not need to argue about whether tax cuts are good. I think we \nhave shown that. The proof is in the pudding. All my Republican friends \nknow we have passed tax cut after tax cut. We have passed tax cuts for \nalmost everybody in America. We passed tax cuts through payroll taxes. \nWe passed middle-class tax cuts. We passed tax cuts for small \nbusinesses, which they were busy opposing. That is rich. They\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\nopposed the tax cut for small businesses, and now they want to go to \nthe mat for the millionaires.\n\n  People need to understand what they are saying. The reason the \neconomists say do not raise taxes in a down economy is because we want \nmoney to go into the economy in a recession. We are trying to get money \nto circulate. We are trying to get investment. We are trying to get \npeople to buy things. So that is why we look at spending on an \nemergency basis like a stimulus. And we look at tax policy and figure \nout what is the most stimulative thing we can do with the Tax Code to \nhelp this economy. That is why we focused on the middle class and small \nbusinesses. And they are stuck with those millionaires.\n  Now, I am very blessed; my husband's first job out of college was in \na steel mill. I worked my way through college as a waitress. My husband \nhas been very successful in business. When I talk to him--and he is an \neconomist, very bright--when I talk to him about the various things we \ncan do to stimulate investment--he has invested in many businesses \nthrough the years, created thousands and thousands of jobs--when I ask \nhim is a 3-percent differential in your tax rate going to make a \ndifference in your investment decisions next year, he kind of laughs. \nIt may make a difference in terms of how much money he has to invest in \none thing or another, but this is not the engine of our economy--a 3-\npercent difference in the tax rate for people who make millions of \ndollars. What does make a difference is a tax cut for the rest of \nAmerica.\n  Here is where their argument falls apart even further. How many times \nhave we heard our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about the \ndeficit? Here is the dirty little secret. They do not want to extend \ntaxes temporarily because we have a down economy. They want to do it \npermanently. They want to go borrow trillions of dollars from China to \nmake sure we keep this tax break there for the millionaires \npermanently. They are not focused on the next year. They are not \nfocused on the next 2 years. They want to blow the lid off this deficit \nand not pay for a dime of it by extending them permanently.\n  So he can say: Well, we don't raise taxes in a down economy. Then \nthey ought to immediately acknowledge that this should only be a 2-year \nextension. But they will not even acknowledge that at this point. We \nagree on permanent tax relief for the middle class. Book it, Danno. We \nagree on that. Let's get that done: permanent tax relief for the middle \nclass. All of us agree on that.\n  I, frankly, think it is time we start looking at the deficit, take \nthe least stimulative money that we spend, which is this extra money \nfor millionaires, and put that against the deficit. We will never get \nthis deficit solved if anybody thinks we can do it on discretionary \nspending.\n  I have worked hard on discretionary spending. Senator Sessions and I \nhave sponsored an amendment and put it before the Senate time after \ntime trying to get our colleagues to accept a cap on spending. We have \nnot been able to get it across the finish line. I am confident we will \nin the coming months, and we will put a cap on spending. That is part \nof the equation: take a hard look at entitlements, figure out if we \nreally need to be buying prescription drugs for millionaires with tax \ndollars when we are in debt. I do not know. I do not think that makes a \nlot of sense. That is part of the entitlement program I think we should \ntake a look at, as to how many rich people we are buying prescription \ndrugs for. Then, finally, we need to look at tax policy. If we can't \nbring the tax rate for millionaires--not talking about a corporate tax \nrate, not talking capital gains, not talking about dividends, I am \ntalking about the permanent tax rate--if we can't bring it back to the \n1990s--find me a millionaire that didn't do well in the 1990s. I would \nlike to meet one. Man, it was tall cotton in the 1990s for wealthy \npeople in this country and, by the way, it hasn't been bad for the last \n10 years. We haven't seen a lot of job creation after this tax cut. We \ncreated 22 million jobs in the Clinton years with the tax rate we want \nto go to for the millionaires, and they created 1 million after this \ntax cut was created--22 million versus 1 million. Really? We want to \nblow the lid off a deficit for that kind of job creation? No, we don't.\n\n  I wish to clarify one thing. Senator Kyl didn't yield for a question. \nI didn't ever say there was a threatening on START in the letter \nwritten by the Republicans. I said Senator Kyl today--and let me read \nthe quote.\n\n       If taxes all can't be resolved and voted on and completed, \n     and spending for the government for the next 10 months \n     completed by next Monday, I don't know how there is enough \n     time to complete START.\n\n  Keep in mind, we have had 16 hearings on START; close to 1,000 \ncongressional inquiries. It is hard to find somebody who understands \nthe threat who doesn't support START. They are saying: Well, the \nverification doesn't go far enough. We have no verification now.\n  So Senator Kyl is the one who is saying that if we don't get \neverything done by Monday, they are done on the START treaty. I think I \ncan speak for my colleagues on this side of the aisle. We are not done. \nWe are not ready to go home. We want to stay here until we make sure we \ncut taxes for the middle class and continue that tax cut for the middle \nclass. We want to stay here until we get that START treaty done, and we \nwant to stay here and make sure we get an agreement to continue to fund \nthe government. We will stay here, and I think most of us are willing \nto stay here weekends, all night, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the \nday after Christmas. I think we will stay here as long as it takes to \ncomplete this work.\n  So the sooner we find out the compromises they are willing to make, \nthe better. Will they hold the middle class hostage, are they holding \nunemployment benefits hostage, and now will they hold the START treaty \nhostage for tax cuts for millionaires, the least stimulative tax break \nwe can give? I hope not. For the sake of our economy, the future of \nthis country, our grandchildren, deficit reduction, and national \nsecurity, I hope not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nMissouri for her outstanding words.\n  Again, let us take three facts. First, over the last decade, middle-\nclass incomes have declined for the first time since World War II. \nSecond, over the last decade, if you made over $1 million, you did just \ngreat. Third, in 2001, when George Bush took over, until today, we have \ngone from a surplus of $300 billion to a huge deficit. Yet what are my \ncolleagues suggesting we do? That we hold up the entire government \nuntil we get tax breaks for the wealthy, the people who have done well, \nthe people who have plenty of money, the people who, when they get a \ntax break, don't rush out to the grocery store or to the clothing store \nbecause they haven't had enough money to buy things.\n  That is what they want to do. It is hard to believe. It is hard to \nbelieve politics aren't at stake; that there aren't a group of very \nwealthy people who believe they made all their money all by themselves \nand they do not want to pay any taxes and that is what is pulling that \nparty so far to the right.\n  My good friend from Tennessee talked about elections. I want him to \ncome to the floor and tell me that in this election the electorate \ncried out: Give more tax breaks to the millionaires. Everyone knows \nthey didn't. They said: Help the middle class. If our party had a \nfault--and I believe we did--we didn't pay enough attention to the \nmiddle class. But they are not going to convince us that because they \nwon a few seats in the Senate and picked up the House that the election \nwas a mandate to give more tax breaks to the people who need it the \nleast--the millionaires and billionaires. Oh, no.\n  In fact, we are listening to the electorate far more than they are. \nWe are saying: Give the middle class tax breaks and deal with the \ndeficit not by preventing unemployment insurance from being extended, \nnot by preventing the HIRE Act from being enacted, and not by \npreventing tax breaks for manufacturing or green energy. Oh, no. We \nwant to do those things, and we want to deal with the deficit by not \ngiving an extra huge tax cut to the millionaires and billionaires.\n  Here is another thing I don't want to hear from my colleagues, if \nthey persist with this policy. I don't want to hear them say: The \ndeficit is the reason we can't spend money on middle-\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nclass needs such as education or transportation or unemployment \ninsurance, because there are lots of middle-class people unemployed.\n  I don't want to ever hear that again. If they are willing to increase \nthe deficit by $300 billion or $400 billion to give tax breaks to the \nwealthy--unpaid for--I don't want to hear about deficit reduction from \nthe other side because they are not honest about it. ``Deficit \nreduction'' is code for giving more money to the wealthy and less money \nto the middle class.\n  I am somebody who believes in the American dream, and I think people \nwho have made a lot of money in America are great. I think they are \nterrific, and they do create jobs. A whole lot of wealthy people--many \nof them--have inherited money, it is true, but many more made it by \nthemselves. God bless them. But it is only a small percentage of the \nwealthy who are so eager to get a tax break when they know the country \nhas so much trouble. Lots of wealthy people I speak to--Republicans in \nmy State--say: You know what. I know the rates could go back up to what \nthey were in the Clinton years for me, and I can afford it. If the \nmoney goes to a good purpose--improving our schools, building our roads \nor decreasing our deficit--I am all for it. So we are not talking about \nclass warfare. We are talking about an economic problem America faces. \nMiddle-class incomes are declining and they need a tax break. Upper \nincomes are greatly increasing and they can help reduce the deficit and \nimprove America.\n  I have heard the economists whom my good friend from Alabama was \ntalking about, and I believe that if you talk to them, they will also \ntell you that you get far more bang for the buck in other types of \npolicies to get the economy going than in giving an additional huge tax \nbreak to the millionaires and the billionaires.\n  We are not going to stop. The Republicans have hidden for 15 or 20 \nyears behind the idea of ``don't increase taxes on anybody.'' Those are \ncode words. It means, don't increase taxes on millionaires. That is \nwhat they care about. Because right now I have offered them a deal. \nGive everybody else the tax break except the millionaires. Are they \ngoing to take it? Of course not, because the millionaires come first in \nthe economic books of my friends--most of my friends--on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  I remember when my Republican friends discovered the words ``death \ntax.'' It had its effect in a way I didn't like, but it had its effect. \nWell, now we have the millionaire tax break. Millionaire tax. You know \nwhat. It is going to have the same effect, and we are going to finally \nbe able to show America what the other party has been all about: tax \nbreaks for the wealthy, above all--above the deficit, above helping the \nmiddle class, above creating jobs. The days of hiding behind the screen \nare over because the tax debate we are having now pulls back that \nscreen and shows exactly where my Republican friends are.\n  So again I repeat my offer. I see my good friend from Tennessee is on \nthe floor. I would offer him, if he wants to improve this by Monday--\nhere are more colleagues--I will offer this deal. We will take the tax \nbreak for everyone below $1 million. Will you accept it--that is a \ngreat compromise--or are you going to say: Oh, no, we are holding out \nfor the millionaires. Take it or leave it.\n  I can't speak for my whole party, but I can speak for myself and my \ncolleague from Missouri and many others on our side. We can solve this \nproblem tonight. Tax breaks for everybody else but not for the \nmillionaires. Take it or leave it. You said you wanted to negotiate, \nhere is an offer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank the Senator \nfrom New York for mentioning me.\n  There is a little problem with our negotiating. We weren't invited to \nthe meeting. The Senator from New York and I were in the Capitol doing \nour work, tending to constituencies, while the President and the \nDemocratic leaders and the Republican leaders were at the White House. \nThey had a very constructive meeting, from what I understand, and they \ndesignated certain Democrats and certain Republicans to see if they \ncould come up with a compromise.\n  One of those who might have been at the meeting may have just walked \nonto the Senate floor and maybe he can inform us, but the negotiations \nare continuing where they should continue. I was delighted to see the \nPresident invite the leaders down to the White House for such a good \nmeeting. I know they have had some joint meetings before, but we are \nnever going to get anywhere in the Senate where we have a relatively \nequal number of Members--as we now do or are now about to--unless we \nswap ideas. So I assume they are down there swapping ideas.\n  I assume they can read the calendar, and I assume they can remember \nthat last year we were standing here in the worst snowstorm in decades \nin the middle of the night--1 a.m.--voting on bills nobody had read. I \ndon't think we want to do that kind of thing again. So we Republicans \nhave said, very simply, let's deal with the tax issue because taxes go \nup automatically at the end of the month, let's fund the government \nbecause it runs out of money on Friday, and then, if we have any time \nleft, let's do whatever the Democratic leader would like to do.\n  If he wants to bring up the new START treaty, that would be fine. We \nwould have time to debate it. If he wants to bring up a whole string of \nother things, that is up to him.\n  What would the terms of the tax agreement be? I guess it will be \nwhatever that group who discusses, our negotiators, come back with. If \nthe President were to say, for example, he agrees with his former \nBudget Director, that raising taxes on anybody in the middle of an \neconomic downturn makes it harder to create jobs--and in my words, \ntherefore, makes no sense--he would probably get a welcome response on \nour side.\n  So while the Senator from New York is one of the most skillful \ndebaters and negotiators anywhere on the planet, and he would be very \ngood in any sort of discussion on taxes--he is a member of the Finance \nCommittee, and he is chairman of the Rules Committee--he wasn't in the \nmeeting and neither was I and those in the meeting are having the \ndiscussion and they will make a recommendation. My hope is they make a \nrecommendation that permits tax rates to stay right where they are \nbecause raising taxes on anybody in the middle of a recession is a bad \nidea because it makes it harder to create jobs.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, through the Chair, may I ask my good \nfriend from Tennessee a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I understand we are not in the \nnegotiating room right now, but he and I are both in the leadership of \nour respective parties. We are good friends. I have tremendous respect \nand admiration for my friend from Tennessee. I do. I think he is a fine \nman, and we have passed some good legislation together. So I understand \nthe negotiators are doing their negotiating, but we might be able to \nhelp.\n  Again, I repeat my offer: Will my colleague--just he and I can agree. \nThat might break the ice. We will give tax breaks to everyone--Bush tax \ncuts--below $1 million. We will continue their capital gains rates at \nthe same rate, we will continue their dividend rates at the same rate \nbut not the people above $1 million because, as I mentioned, their \nincomes are doing fine. Most economists will tell you it is a highly \ninefficient way to get jobs or money flowing into the economy. \nUnemployment insurance, which my colleagues insist be paid for, is much \nbetter.\n  Let just he and I agree that that is a good idea, a good starting \npoint. Will he?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am delighted to hear the eloquence of \nthe Senator from New York. As I was listening to him I was reminded \nthat most of the people whose taxes he is trying to raise live in New \nYork. They are not in Tennessee. We are a relatively low-income State. \nSo I admire him for his courage--it is almost a tax earmark to be so \nspecific that we are going to raise taxes on just a small number of \npeople, most of whom live on Wall Street and in New York. That makes a \npretty good line.\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\n  But what I agree with is what I repeatedly said, what the Republican \nleader said, and the former budget director said. Let me just say it \nagain because it makes very good sense, and I think most Americans \nwould instinctively agree with this. We are in the middle of a very \nsevere economic recession. We have had more than 9.5 percent \nunemployment for 16 out of the last 17 months. We have only had 30 \nmonths in modern history where we have had unemployment that high. \nAlmost half of those months have been lately.\n  Making it easier and cheaper to create private sector jobs should be \nour main objective. Almost every economist--the President's former \nbudget director, almost everyone who has looked at this--says raising \ntaxes on anybody in the middle of an economic downturn makes it harder \nto create jobs.\n  We may want to have a big argument when the economy recovers about \nwhether people in New York should pay more and people of more modest \nmeans in Tennessee should pay less. We could have that argument at some \npoint. But what we are saying is at the end of the year, taxes are \ngoing up, almost everyone except some on that side seem to agree that \nit makes it harder to create jobs if we raise taxes on anybody. We are \nsaying let's not raise taxes on anybody. We want that permanently. But \nmost of us are saying, if we would do what Mr. Orszag says, that would \nhave wide support here.\n  That is our position. We respect the position of the Senator from New \nYork. Maybe someday we will have a debate about what the permanent tax \nrates ought to be. But right now the goal is to make it easier and \ncheaper to create private sector jobs. The single best thing we can do \nis keep tax rates where they are before they automatically go up at the \nend of the month.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York and my \ncolleague from Missouri who was here a moment ago and all those who \ncame to the floor to talk. I assume my colleagues are aware of the fact \nthat all across America there have been cable TV subscribers who have \nbeen calling in and asking for a refund because when they turned on C-\nSPAN to see the Senate they saw an empty Chamber and nothing going on, \nand at least now we give them a little activity on the Senate floor. \nBut, unfortunately, that activity is not going to lead to anything \nmeaningful. The Senator from New York even offers a legislative idea \nthat doesn't seem to be greeted by any applause on the other side or \nany counteroffer of any conciliatory magnitude.\n  I was at the meeting the Senator talked about yesterday, and it was a \nhistoric meeting with the President and Senator Kyl, Senator McConnell, \nSenator Reid, myself, the President, the leaders of the House, as well \nand some members of the President's Cabinet--Secretary Geithner, for \nexample. Vice President Biden was there.\n  I would say the reports generally have been accurate, that the \nPresident said: I want to change the environment, I want to change the \ndialog, I want there to be more meetings like this, open to suggestions \nfrom the other side about how we can work together and solve the \nproblems facing our Nation.\n  Then the President did something which those of us who have been \nfortunate to visit the White House once in a while really considered to \nbe rare. He stood up and said: I would like to ask the elected Members \nand the Vice President to come with me to my private dining room off \nthe Oval Office.\n  We went in and had another cup of coffee and in a much more isolated \nand private setting had an even more candid conversation. I really felt \ngood at the end of it. I felt we were starting at least to develop the \nkind of dialog the American people asked for in the November 2 \nelection.\n  The President asked us, Senator Reid and some others: Pick someone \nand let's sit down and talk about this tax situation. Let's try to find \nsome common ground if we can, and I understand the group met this \nmorning and again this afternoon. It is all, from my point of view, a \nvery positive development and good for our Nation.\n  But what troubles me, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, is this \nletter. I see the letter is dated November 29, so it started \ncirculating even before this peacemaking meeting we had. It seems that \nthis letter which was sent to Senator Reid is basically an ultimatum. \nThe ultimatum is, we are not going to do anything on the floor of the \nSenate until we act on the tax measure and funding our government--\nnothing. It says basically that your side, the Republican side, the 42 \nSenators who signed it, are going to object to moving to any other item \nof business--anything.\n  Now we are back into the cable TV problem, where people are going to \nsee this empty Chamber and wonder why, with all the things we could be \ndoing in the Senate, why we can do nothing--nothing whatsoever, \naccording to this letter--until we reach an agreement on the tax issue.\n  I think we all concede the fact that we need to do it. We all concede \nthe fact we need to fund the government. But what is the point? Really, \nif we are going to draw a paycheck for coming into the Senate, \nshouldn't we at least do the people's business? Do we have to sit here \nwith empty desks and an empty Chamber and quorum calls day after day \nbecause of this threat that says: Don't try to bring up another issue?\n  It strikes me as odd. I know the Senator from Tennessee is an \nindustrious man. He served as Secretary of Education. He was a \nGovernor. He plays the piano. The man sings songs. He has more talents \nthan most people I ever met. To think you would want us to just do \nnothing--nothing on the floor of the Senate.\n  The Senator from New York has offered an idea--I think a reasonable \nidea. Let's agree. Let's agree that people making $1 million or less \nwill have the same tax cuts that they had before, no questions asked, \nto invigorate the economy. But let's say to Paris Hilton and Bill Gates \nand Warren Buffett, no; you are not going to get a $100,000 tax cut \neach year. If you make $1 million, that is the average. We don't think \nthat really invigorates the economy.\n  I would add as a postscript to what the Senator from New York raised, \nwouldn't it be reasonable for us also to say if we are going to give \ntax cuts to the wealthiest people in America, and add to our deficit in \nthe process, shouldn't we help those who are unemployed in Tennessee--I \nsee the two Senators from Tennessee--or Wyoming--I see the Senator from \nWyoming is here--or Minnesota or Illinois? Do you think it is right for \nus to cut off unemployment benefits for people in the midst of this \nholiday season?\n  There are 127,000 people in the State of Illinois who will lose their \nunemployment benefits this month. Merry Christmas.\n  I know what those people receive. It is about $300 a week. I don't \nknow any of us who could survive on that. They try, they try to keep \ngoing. Yet we cut them off. There have been efforts on the Senate \nfloor, unanimous consent requests to fund the unemployment benefits for \nanother year, objected to by the Republican side of the aisle.\n  I find it hard to follow the logic on the Republican side that we \ncannot afford to help those who are out of work through no fault of \ntheir own but we can afford to give a tax break, a huge tax break to \nWarren Buffett--who is not asking for it, incidentally--Bill Gates, \nParis Hilton, or any of these others. I don't follow the logic.\n  I think, although the Senator is fervent in his belief that tax cuts \nare the key to prosperity--some of us may question how much they are \nthe key--it really is fundamentally unfair that those who are \nunemployed would face this kind of problem.\n\n  I am going to make a unanimous consent request on another issue that \nI think will help create jobs. It will save jobs in Tennessee and \nWyoming and Illinois and Minnesota, and it relates to something that is \nnot new because it is already on the calendar. For those who want to \nfollow this and say where is this coming from, turn to page 73, the \nCalendar of Business of the Senate, and go to order No. 578, S. 3816, a \nbill I introduced with others to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986, create American jobs, and prevent offshoring of such jobs \noverseas.\n  It was actually read the second time and placed on the calendar \nSeptember 22 of this year. It relates to something\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nwhich has affected the Senator's State and mine. When a company in \nTennessee decides to send jobs overseas, to close down a local \nproduction facility, and to ship those jobs and that production \nfacility to another country--China, Mexico, wherever it happens to be--\nwe reward them. We give them tax benefits and tax deductions to help \nfacilitate that decision.\n  Many of us believe that is upside-down. If a company thinks it is in \nits best interest, profit motive and best interest to locate overseas, \nso be it. Let them make that decision. But we should not encourage it. \nWe should not subsidize it. We should not reward it. The reward should \nactually go to the many businesses that stay in Minnesota and Illinois \nand Tennessee and Wyoming, hiring American workers, paying them a \ndecent wage and giving them basic benefits and retirement. That is \nwhere the reward ought to be in the Tax Code. It should not be in the \narea where we are creating tax incentives for companies to move jobs \noverseas.\n  If the economy, prosperity, and jobs are really the No. 1 goal here--\nI think they are, and I think they should be--then let's change this \nprovision in the Tax Code. That is what this does. It tries to slow \ndown the exodus of jobs from the United States. It will save jobs in \nTennessee and save jobs in other places as well. This provision called \n``Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act'' that I introduced \nwith Senators Harry Reid, Byron Dorgan, and Senator Schumer is a simple \nbill with three commonsense provisions.\n  Let me describe it before I make the unanimous consent request. I \nwill be brief.\n  First, we make two changes that discourage U.S. companies from giving \nout pink slips to Americans while they open their doors abroad. We will \nsay to firms: If you want to shut down operations here and move them \nsomewhere else, we are not going to let you take tax deductions on the \nshutdown expenses.\n  We also say to firms: If you want to sell your products in this \ncountry, we are not going to let you start making those goods abroad, \nship them back to this country, and avoid paying taxes on your profits.\n  Second, we make it more attractive for companies to bring the \nproduction of goods back home. We say to firms: If you bring jobs home \nfrom another country, you don't have to pay your share of payroll taxes \non those U.S. workers for 3 years, repatriating jobs from overseas back \ninto the United States. It is not radical, it is basic.\n  There are a lot of folks who defend this loophole I am trying to \nclose: the Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers. \nThey oppose this. Republican leaders have spoken out in the past \nagainst it, but I think these two brilliant leaders from Tennessee on \nthe floor of the Senate are not going to join that group. They are \ngoing to stand by their workers and companies from Tennessee. I am sure \nof that when I make this unanimous consent request.\n  So I hope they will join me in this effort. With this measure we can \nliterally bring to the floor of the Senate a measure which will help \nsave American jobs and create American jobs. We can debate it and get \nit over for a final vote in a matter of hours, and we can still have \nnegotiations going on about taxes. We can walk and chew gum in the \nSenate. We can do more than one thing at a time. We should not be \nvictims of an ultimatum that says: You will either do the tax cuts and \nfunding the government or else.\n  So I am going to make this unanimous consent request that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of Calendar No. 578, \nS. 3816, the bill be read three times and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object and say, as \nis the Senator from New York, the Senator from Illinois is most \neloquent, and I always enjoy listening to his comments. I agree with \nhim that many attributes regarding the senior Senator from Tennessee \nare all true--and many more, I might add. He is a multitalented person.\n  But I say the President's commission on deficit reduction actually is \naddressing this issue.\n  And they have actually made many bold steps in trying to address the \nmany deficit issues, the tax expenditure issues which cause our \ncountry, in many cases, not to be as competitive as we could be around \nthe world. So knowing that it is imminent, that this group is meeting \non Friday, I object.\n  I would like to say for the C-SPAN watchers that there is not really \nmuch happening on the floor right now that matters. I would agree with \nthe Senator from Tennessee, the senior Senator, that there is a great \nnegotiation that is taking place, and I applaud the President for \nbringing members of both parties together. I think there is a lot of \nactivity.\n  I just came in from the hallway. I know one of our negotiators was \nrushing to a meeting. I know that in a meeting about an hour ago, he \nhad to step out because the President had called regarding this very \nissue we are talking about regarding taxes, regarding keeping the \ngovernment operating. So I think there is work taking place in the \nSenate. I know there is work looking at nuclear modernization, and \nthere is all kinds of activity throughout the course of this building \nand other buildings adjacent. It is just that here on the floor, we \nhave somewhat of a charade taking place while that is occurring.\n  So I look forward to fruitful activity. I think most Americans \nrealize that on Friday, our government is going to shut down, and I \nthink what Republican Senators have said is that we think it is \nimportant that we deal with actually funding our government so it \ncontinues to operate past Friday. We think it is important to deal with \nthe tax issues since forms are going out across our country--some have \nalready gone out, as a matter of fact--and Americans want to know what \nthey are going to be paying as it relates to tax rates.\n  And actually, what the letter said is any legislative item. I think \nthe Senator from Illinois, whom I greatly respect, knows full well that \nthings such as the START treaty are not legislative items, they are \nexecutive items.\n  That was excluded in our letter on purpose so that in the event the \nSTART treaty wanted to be brought to the floor by the leader, it could \nbe brought to the floor. I know the President has said this is \nsomething of great national interest.\n  So all we are trying to do is prioritize. We know any debate that is \ntaking place on the floor right now over taxes has no real meaning. The \nreal debate will take place after these negotiators finish their \ndiscussions. I think, again, they are being done in a very fruitful and \nearnest manner, and after that the debate that takes place will be \nreal. We will be talking about something we have given leaders of each \nparty the ability to negotiate. So that is when the real debate will \ntake place. I hope the C-SPAN watchers who were alluded to will \nactually tune in at that time. All of this discussion now is really not \nnearly as relevant as what is happening in other places. I think there \nis a lot of work taking place.\n  I would just add that I think all of us on our side have been \nwatching as the majority party has met for hours and hours and hours \neach day trying to figure out what they feel should come to the floor. \nAnd we understand that. But I think what we have said is that instead \nof debating things that could be well debated next year, that do not \nhave the urgency of causing government to continue to function, when \nyou have two wars underway and you have all kinds of issues that need \nto be dealt with, we have said: Please, we ask you to prioritize. Let's \ndeal with those most important issues first. If you want to bring up \nthe START treaty, that is not a legislative item, that is an executive \nitem, bring it up. But let's deal with those issues that are most \nimportant to the American people first. If there is time to deal with \nall of these other issues, certainly after that is done, we would be \nmore than glad to stay as long as the other side would like to debate \nall of those issues.\n  I thank you for the time to speak. I thank the Senator from Illinois \nfor all of the kind comments he has made about the senior Senator and \nme. I\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nthank him. I thank him for the leadership he shows on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wanted to give my friend from Tennessee \ntime to make his objection in its entirety. I thank him for that. I am \nglad he clarified the fact that we could bring the START treaty to the \nfloor. I sincerely hope we do. I think it would be a serious mistake \nfor us to leave Washington for the holiday season without voting on \nthat treaty on the floor.\n  This is a treaty which the President has worked on and which is \nsupported by previous administrations, Democratic and Republican. It is \nan effort to reach an agreement with the Russians. It should be based \non a premise that most Republicans applaud because it goes back to an \nearlier statement by President Reagan that we should ``trust but \nverify.'' The fact is, for over 1 calendar year, we have not had any \ninspectors on the ground in Russia to verify the safety and treaty \ncompliance of their nuclear weaponry.\n  Senator Lugar, on that side of the aisle, a man whom I greatly \nrespect, supports this treaty, and if there is one person in the Senate \nwho is probably more expert than any other when it comes to this issue \nof nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon control and modernization, it is \nSenator Lugar of Indiana. He supports this treaty and wants it to come \nforward. I hope Senators feel he is right. I think he is.\n  I hope we can do this. The notion that we do not have time--I said at \nan appearance a few days ago that we had time to create the Department \nof Homeland Security in a lameduck session because two extraordinary \nSenators--Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican, and Joseph Lieberman, \nthen a Democrat of Connecticut--worked overtime to put together a \nbipartisan bill which we considered in a lameduck session and literally \nreorganized the intelligence structure of America. It was an amazing \nundertaking and one I believe has served us well. We did it in a \nlameduck session, and no one stood up and said: I object; do not go \nforward. I object; I need 2 weeks. People really worked together to get \nit done.\n  We can do it in that same spirit when it comes to the START treaty. \nLet's get that done. Let's get the tax provision done. Let's get \nfunding the government done. And let's get the START treaty done before \nwe go home. We can do this. We are capable of doing this. But an empty \nChamber and empty desks and no Senators on the floor will not achieve \nthat.\n  I am glad the Senator clarified that he is not stepping in the way of \nconsidering the START treaty with this ultimatum that was sent out from \n42 Republican Senators. I wish we could do a few other things, too, \nsuch as extend unemployment benefits, but apparently there is an \nobjection to that.\n  So I hope we can work forward from this point in a more positive way. \nI truly value my friendship and the fact that I can serve with these \ntwo fine Senators from Tennessee. Although I spent a lot of time \nextolling the virtue of the senior Senator from Tennessee, I guarantee \nyou, next time, I will extoll the virtues of the junior Senator so that \nhe has a positive feeling about our relationship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if I can just briefly indulge, I wish to \nthank the Senator, and actually, based on his closing comments, I think \nhe may have actually signed the letter himself had it been presented, \nbecause I agree that we should fund the government, we should deal with \nthe tax issue, and that if we did that, there would be ample time to \ndeal with the START treaty. It is not to say we do not want to deal \nwith all of those other issues; it is to say: Let's prioritize based on \nthose things that are of most national significance.\n  The issue he recalled regarding homeland security was of national \nsignificance at the time. I think most Americans would agree that \nmaking sure the government functions beyond this Friday is of national \nsignificance.\n  So I thank him for his comments. I thank him for his good humor and \ntone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I also rise to talk about the importance \nof creating jobs and how the Republican plan is the exact opposite. We \nhave on our desks this letter that was put forward that says there \nshould be tax cuts for all Americans. Well, you know what, that is the \nDemocratic plan. That is the plan we have been putting forward that \nwould create tax cuts on the first $250,000 that every single American \nmakes. But if you scanned the letter the Republicans signed, you find \nin the fine print, down there in the third paragraph that, no, it is \nnot tax cuts for all Americans that they want; they want a version that \ncreates bonuses, paid by the taxpayer, for billionaires. Bonuses for \nbillionaires. That is the only version they want to see debated, the \nonly version they say they will vote for, and it is the sole goal they \nput as an obstacle to every other important piece of legislation to get \nAmerica back to work.\n  We have been trying so hard this year to get job-creation bills on \nthe floor of the Senate, and we have endured a recordbreaking number of \nfilibusters.\n  When I came here as an intern back in 1976, bills were passed by \nmajority vote. Upon rare occasion, someone would say an issue is so \nimportant as to obstruct the Senate. But not our Republican majority. \nNot this year in 2010. Not last year in 2009. No. My colleagues have \nsaid: It is our goal to paralyze the Senate. It is our goal not only to \nprevent legislation from occurring but to damage the executive branch \nby obstructing nominations in unprecedented numbers and to damage the \njudicial branch by obstructing nominations.\n  This attack on the American system of government has gone way too \nfar, and now my friends across the aisle say: Unless we get bonuses for \nbillionaires, paid for by the taxpayers of the United States of \nAmerica, we will block every effort to create jobs in this country. At \nsome point, it needs to be said on the floor of the Senate--and so I am \nsaying it now--that is simply wrong. It is misguided to put the top \npriorities to be billionaire bonuses. I think the American public \nweighed in on this in the discussion over Wall Street. It is wrong to \nfund those bonuses out of the pockets of working Americans who are \npaying their taxes, and it is certainly wrong to bring this body to a \nstandstill once again in order to get those bonuses for billionaires.\n  I would like to ask my friends across the aisle to reconsider the \nsubstance of their vision for America, a vision in which ordinary \nworkers fund extravagant bonuses for the richet Americans--how big a \nbonus? An average of $100,000. Now, I can tell you, in my working-class \nneighborhood, there are very few people who earn $100,000 a year. There \nare folks who might not earn $100,000 in the course of multiple years \nbecause they are working for minimum wage. They may be earning, if they \ncan get a full-time minimum wage job, $16,000. If they are working two \njobs and their spouse is working, maybe they can bring home $30,000 or \n$40,000.\n  So I would suggest that stopping the business of the Senate to create \na $100,000-per-taxpayer bonus--and I say ``bonus'' because it is on top \nof the tax cut they would get under the Democratic plan--is simply \ncompletely out of touch with the challenges faced by ordinary working \nAmericans who are trying to make ends meet, who would like to see us \nspend the funds in our Treasury to create jobs because they know the \nbest program for any single person is the opportunity to have a living-\nwage job. It not only creates the finances that shore up the \nfoundations of the family, it creates a sense of pride, it creates a \nsense of work ethic, it provides a strong example to our children, it \nbuilds a family. But a $100,000 bonus for the richest Americans does \nnot build those financial foundations for working Americans, and \nfunding it out of the pockets of the working Americans is absolutely \none of the most diabolical plots I could have ever imagined--in fact, I \ncouldn't probably have imagined. If it would have been in a novel that \nmy colleagues are bringing the work of the Senate to a stop in order to \ndo $100,000 bonuses for the richest Americans, funded by the rest of \nthe taxpayers, I would have said: No way. That plot is beyond anything \nthat could possibly happen on the Senate\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nfloor. But today we have it right here in writing that it has to be the \nbillionaire bonus plan or none at all.\n  But at any point, the Senate can, by unanimous consent, come back to \nits senses and pursue that which builds our economy, builds opportunity \nfor working Americans. There have been a host of bipartisan bills that \nhave said: There is a strategy that is estimated to create more jobs \nthan any other per dollar invested, and that is low-cost loans for \nenergy-saving renovations. This core idea recognizes that very few of \nus can go out and put double-paned vinyl windows in our house or full \ninsulation in our house because we do not have the money in our bank \naccount for the upfront costs. But if we can get a low-cost loan, then \nwe can, in fact, pay for those vinyl windows out of the savings on our \nelectric bill.\n  This basic concept is a concept now embodied in the HOME Star bill, a \nbipartisan bill. It is the basic concept embodied in the Building Star \nbill, which aims more at commercial buildings. It is the same basic \nconcept embodied in the Rural Energy Savings Program, which is not only \na bipartisan bill but is fiercely advocated for by our rural electrical \nco-ops that understand this would be a tremendous value to Americans in \nrural America. Knowing we can bring the Senate back to do good work \nthrough unanimous consent, I am going to ask for such unanimous \nconsent.\n  I will start with a bill, which is the rural energy savings plan \nbill, supported by rural co-ops across America so rural Americans such \nas those in rural Oregon, such as those in rural Illinois, such as \nthose in rural Tennessee, such as those throughout rural America \neverywhere can pursue these low-cost, easy-to-arrange loans through \ntheir local electric co-op. One of the reasons people get excited about \nthis concept is, it is not just about the fact that your house now \nfunctions a lot better with these energy-saving renovations. It is not \njust about the fact that now the monthly cost of your electric bill or \nyour gas bill goes down, often more than your loan payments would be, \nbut it is the fact that through this kind of conservation, we actually \ncreate jobs--installation jobs and jobs producing the products for \nthose energy-saving installations. Because virtually every aspect, from \ncaulk to pink fiberglass to double-paned windows, is made here in \nAmerica, manufactured in America. So people know they are not only \ncreating jobs locally, but they are creating jobs in manufacturing \nAmerica. If we don't build things in America, we will not have a middle \nclass in America. People understand this at their core.\n  There is something else they like about this. Every time we address \nour energy needs domestically, we are decreasing our demand for foreign \noil. Why does that make Americans smile? Because we would rather have \nred, white, and blue American energy and American energy savings than \nimport oil from overseas. When we buy that oil from overseas, the money \ngoes out of the economy. It doesn't go into the local grocery store. It \ndoesn't go into the local retailer on Main Street. It doesn't build the \nfinancial foundations of American families. It goes to places such as \nIraq and Saudi Arabia and Nigeria and Venezuela. What is happening with \nthe money that goes overseas to places such as that? Some of it ends up \nin the hands of terrorists who oppose our policies around the world.\n  It has been said by national security experts that our current wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan are the first American wars where we are \nfunding both sides. What they are referring to is our purchase of \nforeign oil. So when we engage in energy savings here, we are doing \nwhat is right for our economy and for our families and for our national \nsecurity.\n  By the way, these types of jobs cannot be shipped overseas, \ninstallation cannot be shipped overseas. Not only are the materials \nmade in America, the installation can't be shipped overseas. It is the \nperfect strategy to help address the challenges in our current economy. \nThat is why I have some hope my colleagues across the aisle will join \nin this unanimous consent to get this bill done so we can help folks in \nrural America get back to work, improve their homes, shore up their \nfinancial foundations and, in the process, improve our national \nsecurity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Agriculture Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. 3102; that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration, the bill be read three times and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action \nor debate, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there \nmust be something about the interval between the Thanksgiving holiday \nand Christmas and the effect it has on our Democratic friends. Again, \nthis year, as they did last year, they begin to disappear for hours at \na time into a room together, without any Republicans or any other kind \nof person there to talk and they get excited about issues and they come \ntogether. They persuade each other that they are right, and then they \nrush to the Senate floor after several hours and offer a bill of the \nmost urgent kind. In this case, it is about double-paned vinyl windows. \nHere we are. The Senator from Oregon, a good colleague, a distinguished \nfriend--this may be a good bill, but he is asking by his request that \nwe not debate, that we not amend, and that we just pass it.\n  He is saying, at the same time, that this must be the most urgent \nthing before us. When he is finished with his other matters, I wish to \nsay a little bit more. But let me reiterate what I have said over and \nover again. We have suggested to the majority leader that we focus on \ndealing with funding the government first, since we run out of money \nFriday, and deal with the tax issue next since taxes automatically go \nup the first of the year. After we have done those two things, we move \nto whatever the majority leader brings up. He may wish to bring up the \nnew START treaty. He could bring up the new START treaty today. We said \nnothing about that in our letter. So all this talk I just heard has \nnothing to do with our letter, with what has been said on the floor.\n  I will have more to say about that in a moment. But we should fund \nthe government, keep tax rates where they are. Then I think what the \nAmerican people said to us was: Go home, bring this new Congress back, \nand let's begin to deal with the debt. We have a report of the debt \ncommission coming out. We should be making it easier and cheaper to \ncreate private sector jobs. The best way to do that is not to raise \ntaxes on anybody in the middle of an economic downturn. That makes it \nharder to create jobs and makes no sense. We want to do that first. \nTherefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate that my good friend from \nTennessee rose to defend his caucus's letter. I certainly enjoy working \nwith him. Here I am talking about energy efficiency. We have had the \npleasure of working together on a bill that is about deployment of \nelectric cars that can save enormous amounts of fuel and have many \nbeneficial effects that I have been speaking to in regard to the \nimportation of foreign oil, cutting off that flow of oil from abroad, \nand the American money that goes out to buy it. I certainly treasure \nthat relationship, that working relationship. But we couldn't have a \nmore different perspective. We couldn't have a broader disagreement on \nthis issue. I have noted that the Democrats have laid out a plan that \nprovides tax cuts for all Americans. But my good friend from Tennessee \njust noted he wants the version that has no increase on anyone.\n  What he didn't explain--but I will--is that the difference between \nthe two is additional bonus tax cuts for the richest Americans. Those \nare the tax cuts that are $100,000 per person. Those are the tax cuts \nthat will create a $700 billion addition to the national debt over the \nnext 10 years. When I have families who are struggling to get by on the \nbest jobs they can find--and those jobs are paying near minimum wage, \nand they are lucky to make $16,000 to $20,000 a year, if they can find \na minimum wage job--is it justifiable to give bonuses paid by other \ntaxpayers or by additional debt on our children to the richest \nAmericans to the tune of $100,000 each? I would say, no, that is a bad \ndecision. In that regard, we are coming from different places.\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\n  I can tell my colleagues, if there is something in the air in this \nperiod between Thanksgiving and Christmas, it is that it further \nincreases or should increase our connection to the fact that American \nfamilies are suffering. They need jobs, and it is our duty to create \nthem, not our role to charge working Americans so $100,000 bonuses can \nbe handed out to the richest Americans.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I could reflect for a few minutes on \nwhat we have heard. There is a lot of passion in the Senate. This is \nactually a place where there is supposed to be. We come here to debate \nthe most important issues that are before us. Let me talk first about \nwhat Republicans have suggested. I have said this a few times during \nthe debate, but I wish to say it again. We have suggested setting \npriorities in the Senate. We have a right to be heard. There are 42 of \nus now. There will be 47 after January. It is not our voices. It is the \nvoices of the American people. They expect to be heard. Just a few \nweeks ago they said to us and to the entire country:\n  We have had a government of too much taxes, too much debt, too much \nspending, and too many Washington takeovers. We would like Members of \nCongress to focus on making it easier and cheaper to create private \nsector jobs, No. 1; bring spending under control so we don't have such \na debt, No. 2; and be smart about terror, No. 3. That is what we would \nlike to do.\n  This lameduck session is a period after an election where people \nusually listen to the voters. So our recommended view is we should keep \nthe tax rates where they are, fund the government, consider the debt \ncommission's report, which we hope to receive this week, and go home \nand bring the new Congress back, which was just elected, to begin to \ndeal with jobs, debt, and terror.\n  If the President feels it is sufficiently important for the new START \ntreaty to be dealt with before Christmas, his majority leader can bring \nit up any day he wants to. He has a right to do that tonight, this \nafternoon. He can put it on the floor, and we can have several days of \ndebate. But remember, the government runs out of money Friday. Tax \nforms are being filled out because taxes automatically go up in January \nfor almost everybody, and we are saying: Why have we waited so late to \ndeal with this? Let's do it.\n  There is nothing wrong with priority in government. In fact, I \nrespectfully suggest that for the last couple years the lack of \npriorities has been a big part of the problem. We have had a lot of \nvery smart people in the government, but managers, leaders usually say: \nHere is the most important thing. Let's work on it until we fix it.\n  We do not have to go far back in history to have General Eisenhower, \nrunning for President in 1952, saying: I shall go to Korea. He did not \nannounce 23 different things he needed to do. He said: I shall go to \nKorea. In October he said that, and in November he was elected. By the \nbeginning of December he was in Korea, and he said: I shall spend my \ntime on this until I get it done, and the people of the world and of \nthe United States believed in him because they knew that a President of \nthe United States who throws himself into almost any subject, with as \nmuch as he has for as long as it takes, can get a pretty good result.\n  We should be doing that with jobs. There is no magic formula on that. \nBut virtually every economist who has testified--either those called by \nthe Democrats or the Republicans--have said to us this simple fact that \nI bet most Americans would agree with: Raising taxes on anybody in the \nmiddle of an economic downturn makes it harder to create jobs. If our \nNo. 1 priority is to make it easier and cheaper to create private \nsector jobs, raising taxes makes no sense as a policy. That is our \nposition.\n  We would like for those tax rates to be permanent. The President's \nformer Budget Director, Mr. Orszag, after he left the President's \nemploy just a few months ago, said: Well, perhaps a 2-year extension of \nthe current tax rates would be a good idea because it does make it \nharder to create jobs. He is aware, as all of us are aware, that for 16 \nout of the last 17 months unemployment has been at more than 9.5 \npercent.\n  So it is all right to consider a bill to deal with double-paned \nwindows, but when tax rates are going up on everybody in America, \nincluding the job creators, if we want to take a step toward making it \neasier and cheaper to create private sector jobs, not more government \njobs, we need to keep the tax rates right where they are right now and \nsend that signal to the American people. All we are saying to the \nDemocratic majority is, let's do that first, let's fund the government, \nand then let's go to the other issues.\n  The President, to his great credit, had a meeting yesterday which had \na decidedly different tone to it. I had been mystified by the \nrelationship of the President and the Republican leader over the last 2 \nyears. I came up here 40 years ago in the Senate as a young aide. I \nremember Senator Howard Baker's story of when he first came here. I was \nhis legislative assistant. He said he was sitting in there in the \nRepublican leader's office, the phone rang, and it was President \nJohnson calling Senator Dirksen. He heard Senator Dirksen say: No, Mr. \nPresident, I can't come down and have a drink with you tonight. I did \nthat last night and Louella is very mad at me.\n  Then, about 30 minutes later, there was a big rustle outside and the \nnoise came up and two beagles came through the door with the President \nbehind them and the President said to the Republican leader: Everett, \nif you won't come have a drink with me, I will have one with you.\n  David Gergen told me that President Johnson called the Republican \nleader at 5 o'clock almost every afternoon. That was the kind of \nrelationship they had.\n  Yet for the first 2 years, the current President and the Republican \nleader had only one one-on-one meeting because the whole attitude \naround here was: We won the election. We will write the bill.\n  So you jammed the health care law through last Christmas, which \nnobody had a chance to read, feeling pretty good about it. So there \nhave been immediate, multiple efforts to repeal it from the day it \npassed.\n  Compare that with the relationship 40 years ago when the civil rights \nbill passed. It was written in the Republican leader's office, even \nthough the Democratic majority was large and the President was a \nDemocrat, because they not only wanted to pass it, they wanted it to be \nsupported by the country. When it was passed, even though Senator \nRussell, for whom one of the buildings here is named, had opposed it \nfor years--the Civil Rights Act of 1968--he went back to Georgia and \nsaid: It is the law of the land. We should enforce it, because he \nrespected the process by which it had been done.\n  So this attitude that we won the election, we will write the bill, we \nwill jam it down your throat whether you like it or not--that was the \nlast 2 years, but that is over. When 47 Republicans come in, it is \ngoing to be a balanced Senate. There is going to be a change toward \nmore balance, and that is an important part of what the American people \nvoted for just a few weeks ago.\n  The President, to his credit, recognizes that. He had a meeting \nyesterday at the White House which had a decidedly different tone it \nto. Everybody who was a part of it says that, both Democrats and \nRepublicans. One thing they talked about was taxes. We have to deal \nwith it. So they formed a little group, and they are busy trying to \nwork that out. The other thing is fund the government. We run out of \nmoney Friday. We are busy trying to work that out.\n  On the New START treaty, senators have very strong opinions: Senator \nKyl, Senator Corker, Senator Lugar. We respect the President on matters \nof national security, and if he says something is important, it is \nimportant to us, even if he is a Democratic President and we are \nRepublicans. So the majority leader may want to bring that up. But he \nis the majority leader. It is up to him to bring it up. We cannot do \nthat until we have the majority, which we hope we do someday. So he can \nbring it up.\n  So we have said: Let's set a couple of priorities around here: deal \nwith taxes, fund the government, and then if there is time left, Mr. \nMajority Leader, bring\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nup what you want. If you want to bring up a bill about double-paned \nwindows, that is fine. If you want to bring up don't ask, don't tell, \nthat will take a week of debate. If you want to bring up a bill about \nthis, that or the other, that is fine. You set the priorities.\n  There is one other thing I heard during this discussion: Why aren't \nwe working?\n  I will tell you why we are not working. It is because of the schedule \nof the Democratic leader. Forty times he has brought up legislation, \nand then he said there will be no amendment and no debate. That is like \nhaving the Grand Ole Opry open and saying: There will be no singing. \nThat is what we do. We offer amendments. We debate on behalf of the \nAmerican people. This is the only body in the world where you have \nunlimited debate and unlimited amendment.\n  When you bring up any bill, whether it is the double-paned windows \nbill that was so urgently presented a moment ago, whether it is the New \nSTART treaty, which has to do with our nuclear modernization and our \nnational security, we bring it up, hopefully, after it has had careful \nconsideration by the committees, where the military experts and the \nforeign policy experts have weighed in, and then we have a debate and \neveryone gets to offer their amendments and everyone gets to say what \nthey think about those amendments. If we have to stay Monday night, we \nshould stay Monday night--and Tuesday night and Wednesday night and we \ncan even stay Friday. We have not voted on one Friday this year. That \nis not because of the Republican schedule. We are not in charge of the \nschedule. So, why is there nobody here to debate? Because there is \nnothing to debate. The Democratic leader brings up a bill and then he \nsays there will be no amendment and no debate.\n  My hope is that as a result of this more evenly balanced Senate and \nthe good will of the Democratic leader, whom I greatly respect, and the \nRepublican leader--he and Senator Reid are very much veterans of the \nSenate. They respect this institution greatly. I would like to see us \nget back to the point at which we were not very long ago.\n  I can remember the Senate in the days of the late Senator Byrd and \nSenator Baker, with whom I first came to the Senate as a staff member. \nThey basically had an agreement that worked like this: Senator Baker \nwas majority leader for 4 years, Senator Byrd majority leader for 4 \nyears, but they led their parties for 8 years. When they did, Senator \nBaker would say to the committees: Don't bring a bill to the floor \nunless it has the chairman and the ranking minority committee member \nboth agreeing to it. Then, when it came to the floor, they would say: \nAll right, let everybody offer their amendments. There might be 300 \namendments. Then, after a while, they would offer a motion to agree to \nhave no more amendments, and usually they would get that. Then they \nwould, by discussion, narrow that down to a number and then people \nwould get their amendments. You might have to be here late one night. \nYou might have to be here Friday. You might have to be here Saturday. \nSenators would say: Well, I wonder how important this amendment is. But \nthe American people were heard on the floor of the Senate.\n  So it is my great hope that in the new Congress, where there will be \na relatively even number of Senators--Democrats will still be setting \nthe agenda, they can bring up whatever they wish--I would hope what we \nagree to do is to go back to this body being what it was and can be and \nshould be.\n  We have 16 new Senators, 3 of them Democratic, 13 Republican. They \nran for this office in very difficult races. It is not easy to do these \ndays. They are here not just for their voices to be heard but for the \nvoices of the people of their States to be heard--for the people of \nKentucky, for the people of Wyoming, for the people of Pennsylvania, \nfor the people of Delaware. They want to be heard here.\n  If we bring up the New START treaty or the double-paned window bill \nor the tax bill or whatever it is, the Senator from Delaware, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Tennessee ought to have a \nchance to amend it, ought to have a chance to be heard. Then, after we \ndo that, we can decide: OK. That is enough of that. Let's have a vote.\n  That is the way we do things. I think we can do that. I have seen it \nhappen time and time again. We did it on the energy bill. We tried it \non the immigration bill. Sometimes it works; sometimes it does not. It \nis a great way to legislate. So it would again be a joy to be a Member \nof the Senate.\n  This period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is not a great time to \ndo very much. We have been here for 2 years. We just had an election. \nWe are waiting for the new Members to come. They have their marching \norders. I said to some of my friends the other day: My friends on the \nDemocratic side keep insisting on an encore for a concert that drew a \nlot of boos.\n  I think what most Americans would like for us to do is keep the tax \nrates right where they are, fund the government before it runs out of \nmoney, consider the proposals for reducing the debt, and go home. If \nthe President thinks it is important for us to deal with the New START \ntreaty before Christmas, then he might say a word to the Democratic \nleader that after we deal with taxes and fund the government, that \nmaybe that ought to be the next order of business instead of the \ndouble-paned window bill or any other variety of bills, all of which \nmay be fine legislation. But you just do not walk in here 3 weeks \nbefore Christmas with some bill with nobody here and ask it be passed \nby unanimous consent. That is not the way the American people want us \nto do business, and that does not give this body the respect it \ndeserves.\n  So I greatly appreciate my friends on the other side and their \npassion for their point of view. I respect that passion. I think one of \nthe cardinal rules of this body is never to question the motive of \nanother Senator and always to respect the passion and point of view of \nanother Senator. But I would like for us to get back to the point where \nyou bring up something and we debate it--not you bring up something and \nyou cut off amendments, you cut off debate, and then you do not do \nanything for a week. That is why nobody is here.\n  I will conclude with these remarks, by just restating our position. \nWe sent this letter at the beginning of the week saying that the 42 \nRepublican Senators want to use our voices to say that first we should \nfund the government, since we run out of money by the end of the week, \nand, second, we should deal with taxes so we can prevent a tax increase \non anybody in the middle of an economic downturn. Then we should go to \nany other legislative item the majority leader wishes. Of course, he is \nfree to bring up something like the New START treaty any time he wants \nto.\n  That seems, to me, to be a very reasonable approach, presented at the \nright time, in the right way, during a time when the President and the \nRepublican and Democratic leaders are meeting together, when \nnegotiations are going on about what the tax bill might be, when \ndiscussions are going on about how to fund the government, and when we \nare all in meetings right through this stretch about whether we are \nmodernizing our nuclear weapons sufficiently so we can, in good \nconscience, vote to ratify the New START treaty.\n  Those are the most important issues, and that is what we should be \ntalking about this month.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8340-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8340-S8342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JOB CREATION AND SPENDING\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the issues and \nthe topics this body badly needs to get to. Just a month ago there was \nan election in this country, and the people of this country spoke \nloudly and clearly. What they said is they wanted this Congress to \nfocus on two things: No. 1, they wanted us to focus on creating jobs. \nThis is the most difficult economy anyone who is working now has ever \nhad to experience.\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\n  In my home State of Florida, unemployment is nearly 12 percent. If \nyou figure in all the people who are underemployed--who have lost their \njob and now must work two or three jobs to make even less than what \nthey used to make to barely get by, to provide for their families--\nnearly one out of five people of working age in Florida are unemployed \nor underemployed.\n  We are in the top three in mortgage foreclosures. In the first half \nof the year, Floridians were No. 1 on being behind on their mortgage \npayments. Although there are some spots of hope and some things to look \nat as potentially growing our economy again, we just recently found out \nthat in southeast Florida--which in many ways has been ground zero for \nmortgage foreclosures--mortgage foreclosures have gone up in the third \nquarter more than 25 percent over the second quarter.\n  Times are tough in Florida. Times are tough all across this country. \nSo the people of this country spoke, and they sent new people to \nWashington who will be taking office--some have already taken office, \nmost will take office in January--to get this country back to work. \nWhat they asked this Congress to do is to focus on job creation.\n  The second thing they want this Congress to do is to stop the out-of-\ncontrol spending. This government is putting this country on the brink \nof financial disaster. We know from the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich keeps count of spending in this country, that this last year, \n2010, the Congress spent $1.3 trillion more than it took in--$1.3 \ntrillion more than it took in. It took 200 years for this country to go \nin debt. Yet just this last year, this Congress went $1.3 trillion in \ndebt.\n  Our national debt--the total amount of deficits that have accumulated \nover time--is nearly $14 trillion. In the past 4 years, the national \ndebt has gone up $5 trillion. The American people are worried about \nthis. When I go around Florida and talk to my constituents, they tell \nme they are concerned about the future for their kids, for their \ngrandkids. They wonder whether our children are going to grow up in a \ncountry that has the same promise and opportunity that we have all \nexperienced.\n  So these have been the two big issues. They are resounding. If you \nturn on the television and watch any of these cable talk shows, the two \nissues that come up are jobs and the out-of-control spending. Yet \ndespite the overwhelming chorus from the people of this country--which \nmanifested itself a month ago on election day--this Congress is failing \nto address these two primary issues.\n  Why in the world are we talking about a bunch of ancillary issues--\nalbeit important in their own right--when the most pressing issues \nfacing this country, and what the American people want us to do, is to \nfocus on these two issues?\n  Part and parcel of the economic problem is the uncertainty that is \nbeing caused by Washington. For the past 2 years, instead of focusing \non creating jobs, creating an environment that would allow businesses \nto create jobs, we have created all sorts of uncertainty for American \nentrepreneurs. I come from a State of small businesses. There are not a \nlot of big businesses in Florida. When I meet with small business, they \ntell me there is so much uncertainty that it is preventing them from \nhiring.\n  They cite the health care bill. How do we know if we can hire a new \nperson? If we do we may be under some new mandate, some new penalty or \nfine that will make us pay more. We don't know whether we can afford \nthat new employee. Therefore, they do not hire. No wonder unemployment \nis so high and has not come down.\n  They wonder about the financial regulatory reform bill. One business \nin Florida told me they will move some of their employees overseas so \nas to not come under the restrictions of that bill.\n  Most of all what they tell me is they do not know what their taxes \nare going to be next year. They do not know what they are going to pay \nin taxes. Because they can't plan, they cannot hire. Because they can't \nplan, they do not buy that new piece of equipment. Because they can't \nplan, they do not take on that extra lease space or hire the \nconstruction company to build an addition on their building or build a \nnew facility.\n  So all of this uncertainty created by Washington not having its focus \non what the American people want Washington to have its focus on is \nexacerbating the problem with the economy. So why in the world--knowing \nfor the past 2 years that these tax cuts were set to expire--have we \nnot addressed them?\n  When we voted to adjourn before the election, I voted not to adjourn \nbecause I thought it was fundamentally unfair to the businesses and job \ncreators in this country for us to leave and not finish our work with \nthem not knowing what their taxes would be next year. I knew that would \nhurt the effort to employ more people in my State. Yet here we are, the \nfirst day of December, just a month left in the time of this Congress, \nand we still have not addressed the tax issues.\n  We are talking about food safety, we are talking about the DREAM Act, \nwe are talking about the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. However you \nfeel about those issues--and I respect that people have differing \nviews--that is not what the American people are focused on. We should \nbe about the work of focusing on the issues that matter most, putting \nfirst things first. What should be first is creating an environment so \nthat entrepreneurs and job creators can get people back to work.\n  Secondly, we must tackle this issue of spending. We just saw the \nreport from the debt commission, and we are all still reviewing the \ngood work they have done. Let me say, first of all, this is a serious \nproposal from serious and responsible people, and it is the kind of \nwork that should be done in Washington. I don't agree with all of its \nprovisions, but I am proud of the work they have done because it is \nserious, it is sober, and it addresses the compelling crisis that \nconfronts us and threatens the very future of this country.\n  As the cochairmen of that commission--Erskine Bowles and former \nSenator Simpson--have said this crisis will not wait 10, 20 years. This \ncrisis is now.\n  But as much as I respect the work they have done, it doesn't go \nnearly far enough. Realize that the proposals they have made will cut \nthe national debt and deficit $4 trillion. That is a lot of money. It \nis a good start. It is being widely condemned by Democrats and \nRepublicans. It tackles defense spending, so some Republicans don't \nlike it. It tackles Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, so some \nDemocrats don't like it. I think the Speaker of the House, Nancy \nPelosi, dismissed it because of what it does on Social Security. But \nrealize this: It only cuts $4 trillion out of the next $12 trillion \nthat will be incurred in the next decade.\n  So let's put it in perspective. Right now our national debt is nearly \n$14 trillion. It is projected to be $26 trillion by 2020. If we adopted \nevery proposal of the debt commission--every single one of them--we \nwould reduce the projected national debt from $26 trillion to $22 \ntrillion, and that is not enough. It is not even close to being enough.\n  Now, why is that the case? It is the case because we spend $200 \nbillion a year right now in our current budgetary environment on debt \nservice--$200 billion a year paying interest on money we have borrowed \nfor things we should not have spent money on in the past.\n  Here is the truth the American people have not been told: For the \npast 30 or 40 years, this government has spent much more money than it \nhas taken in. What it did first was it took the money out of Social \nSecurity and wrote an IOU to Social Security. When the Social Security \nmoney was unable to be raided anymore by Congress, which has been just \nrecently, then this government had to go out and borrow the money from \nforeign countries such as China and Japan. That is why we have this \nhuge unfunded portion of Social Security that is tens of trillions of \ndollars and that is why we have this national debt that is racking up.\n\n  For the last 30 or 40 years, this Congress has spent way more than it \nhas taken in. Now we are in a situation where we put the future of this \ncountry in peril. At the end of this decade, if we have a $26 trillion \nnational debt--and even if it is $22 trillion if we adopted every \nmeasure from the debt commission--we will still be $800 to $900 billion \nin debt service by the end of the decade, $800 billion to $900 billion. \nWhen\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\nwe are that far into our debt service payments--basically for the \naverage American family this is similar to, thinking of this like a \ncredit card, when you can't pay the minimum balance and every month the \namount you owe keeps cascading more and more. That is where the \nAmerican Government is headed.\n  When we get to $800 billion or $900 billion a year in interest \npayments, the government will not function. As Erskin Bowles said \ntoday, the world markets will not wait for that point. So what you are \nseeing in Europe right now with Greece and Ireland and Portugal and \nSpain will happen here, except there will not be a European Union or \nanybody else to bail out the United States of America.\n  It is a crisis. Yet this Congress is not doing anything about it. We \nare talking about adopting a continuing resolution because this \nCongress will not do an appropriations bill. A continuing resolution at \nits best will freeze spending at last year's level.\n  Some of my colleagues will say: That is good. See, we are not \nincreasing the spending.\n  It is not an accomplishment, when last year we were more than $1 \ntrillion in deficit, to freeze spending at that level.\n  The two issues the American people want us to deal with are jobs and \nout-of-control government spending. Yet we are failing to do both. \nThere is a lot of frustration in this Chamber. I watched some of my \ncolleagues on the other side today come speak on the floor, and they \nare frustrated that we are not getting things done. I am frustrated \ntoo. Two of my colleagues are proposing a change to the way the \nprocedures of this body work. They do not think it should take 60 votes \nfor us to do some things.\n  I do not agree with them, but I share their frustration because, as \nmuch as I am privileged to be here--and I am in awe of this \ninstitution--the way this Congress works and this body works is \ndysfunctional. The way it should work and the way it used to work, from \nwhat people tell me who were here before, is that a proposal would come \nup, a piece of legislation, and it would come to the floor and we would \nall have a chance to offer an amendment. We would all have a chance to \nmake it better.\n  My constituents in Florida think I have the opportunity to offer \namendments and let their voices be heard through my actions. If my \nproposal is not good or not worthy, then it should not pass. But it \nshould see the light of day. This was a time when Senators stayed by \ntheir desks and listened to the proposals and amendments of other \nSenators and were able to quickly call home to the group that the \nproposal might affect. Say it was an agricultural proposal. They might \ncall their local farmers or if it would affect banks, they might call \nbanks to see how it would affect their constituents in their home \nState, and the level of discourse was better.\n  The people of this country expect us to get to work. They expect us \nto get to work on the issues that matter most. They are suffering and \nwe should get about the work that they want us to do because the future \nof the country is at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8342-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSE PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the need to \ntransition the Advanced Practice Registered Nurse--APRN--programs at \nthe Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences--USUHS--to the \nDoctorate of Nursing Practice. It was my hope to establish a program to \neducate advanced practice nurses at USUHS and in 1993 Congress founded \nthe Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Graduate \nSchool of Nursing, GSN. Doctoral nursing programs are designed to \nprepare advanced practice nurses and Ph.D.s for the unique challenges \nof military health care. The GSN students explore the fields of nursing \nthrough a signature blend of science, research, and field training. The \nlessons learned on the USU campus and beyond the traditional classroom \nprepare the GSN graduates to take on a diverse range of challenges that \nhave led to their success in any environment.\n  The American Association of Colleges of Nursing--AACN--Position \nStatement on the Doctorate of Nursing Practice, DNP, dated October \n2004, identified 13 advanced practice degree recommendations in \nresponse to the increasing complexity of healthcare and rising patient \nacuities. In recommendation 10 of its position statement, the AACN \nstated, ``the practice doctorate be the graduate degree for advanced \nnursing practice preparation including, but not limited, to the four \ncurrent APRN roles: clinical nurse specialist, nurse anesthetist, nurse \nmidwife and nurse practitioner.'' Additionally, the American \nAssociation of Colleges of Nursing and the American Association of \nNurse Anesthetists, Council on Accreditation have stated that APRN \nprograms should be converted from the master's degree to Doctorate of \nNursing Practice programs by 2015 and 2025, respectively. These \nendorsements were preceded by almost 4 years of research and consensus-\nbuilding by an AACN task force charged with examining the need for the \npractice doctorate with a variety of stakeholder groups. Of the 388 \nAPRN programs in the country, 72 percent are offering or planning DNP \nprograms. To maintain professional standards for military APRNs and \nremain competitive for high quality students, the Graduate School of \nNursing at USUHS must transition to the DNP for its APRN programs. A \nreport is requested from USUHS, within 180 days, outlining the GSN's \nprogress toward DNP program transition and planned implementation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8342-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8342-S8343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD AIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, next year marks the 30th anniversary of \nthe first diagnosis by the Centers for Disease Control of acquired \nimmune deficiency syndrome or AIDS. This year, 33.3 million people are \nliving with HIV. Last year 2.6 million people were infected with HIV, \nand 1.8 million people died from AIDS. And today we commemorate World \nAIDS Day, acknowledging the suffering and death that AIDS has caused \nand reaffirming our commitment to fight the global AIDS pandemic.\n  For three decades this preventable disease has devastated families \nand communities. But there also has been a global response from the \nresearch community, government, health workers, and patient advocates \nto fight this disease and save lives. This battle has yielded notable \nvictories. Fewer people are becoming infected with HIV, biomedical \ninnovations have created drugs that can transform AIDS into a chronic \ndisease rather than a death sentence, more people have access to HIV \ntreatment, and mothers can prevent their babies from becoming infected \nwith HIV. A recent CDC report, indicating that 11.4 million more people \nwere tested for HIV in 2006 compared to 2009, highlights the \nadvancements that have been made.\n  The U.S. has been at the frontline combating the AIDS pandemic. We \nhave established aggressive and effective programs, notably the Ryan \nWhite HIV/AIDS Program and the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global \nLeadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act, known more \ncommonly as PEPFAR. These programs provide funding and support to \ninitiatives combating AIDS and providing critical services to people in \nthe U.S. and developing countries.\n  Progress has certainly been made, but the U.S. must continue to be a \nleader in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the United States over 1.1 \nmillion people have HIV, but one in five of these people do not know \nthey are infected. Each year 56,300 Americans become infected with HIV.\n  We can bring this number to zero. While Black Americans represent 12 \npercent of the U.S. population, they account for almost half of people \nliving with HIV and half of new infections each year. We can alter the \ntrajectory of this disease and eliminate these disparities.\n  World AIDS Day causes us to remember those who have been lost to this \ndisease, but it is also an opportunity to renew our commitment to \nfighting the AIDS pandemic, to eliminating stigma against those with \nthis disease, and to stopping the spread of HIV.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to make these goals a \nreality.\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8343-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist David S. Robinson\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor SPC David S. Robinson, 25, \nof Fort Smith, AR, who died November 20, 2010, in Zabul Province, \nAfghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. According to \ninitial reports, Specialist Robinson died of injuries sustained when \nhis military vehicle overturned.\n  My heart goes out to the family of Specialist Robinson, who made the \nultimate sacrifice on behalf of our Nation. Along with all Arkansans, I \nam grateful for his service and for the service and sacrifice of all of \nour military servicemembers and their families.\n  More than 11,000 Arkansans on Active Duty and more than 10,000 \nArkansas reservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September \n11, 2001. These men and women have shown tremendous courage and \nperseverance through the most difficult of times. As neighbors, as \nArkansans, and as Americans, it is incumbent upon us to do everything \nwe can to honor their service and to provide for them and their \nfamilies, not only when they are in harm's way but also when they \nreturn home. It is the least we can do for those whom we owe so much.\n  Specialist Robinson was assigned to A Troop, 2nd Squadron, 2nd \nStryker Cavalry Regiment, V Corps, Vilseck, Germany. His mother resides \nin Fort Smith, AR, and his father in Canton, PA. His wife and children \nreside in Clarksville, TN.\n\n\n                   Staff Sergeant Kevin Matthew Pape\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SSG Kevin \nMatthew Pape of the U.S. Army and Fort Wayne, IN.\n  Staff Sergeant Pape was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, in the \n75th Ranger Regiment at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia. He was 30 \nyears old when he lost his life on November 16, 2010, while bravely \nserving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Kunar Province, \nAfghanistan. He was on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan, after \nthree tours in Iraq.\n  A native of Fort Wayne, Staff Sergeant Pape graduated from Concordia \nHigh School in 1998. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2005 and graduated \nfrom the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program in 2006, where he \nserved as a machine gunner, team leader and squad leader.\n  COL Michael Kurilla, Commander of the 75th Ranger Regiment, recalled \nthat Staff Sergeant Pape, ``had two priorities in his life--his family \nand the Rangers he led. By the manner in which he lived his life, Staff \nSergeant Pape defined sacrifice, dedicated, and selfless service.''\n  Staff Sergeant Pape's numerous awards and decorations include the \nRanger Tab, the Expert Infantry Badge, the Combat Infantry Badge and \nthe Parachutist Badge. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Purple Heart and the Meritorious Service Medal.\n  Today, I join Staff Sergeant Pape's family and friends in mourning \nhis death. He is survived by his wife Amelia Rose Pape and his daughter \nAnneka Sue, both of Savannah, GA, and his father Marc Dennis Pape of \nFort Wayne, IN.\n  We take pride in the example of this dedicated soldier and American \nhero, even as we struggle to express our grief over this loss. We \ncherish the legacy of his service and his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have \nconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world \nwill little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \nforget what they did here.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of SSG Kevin Matthew Pape in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8343-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, without congressional action, \nhundreds of thousands of Americans will lose their unemployment \nbenefits. Earlier this week, along with 19 of my colleagues, I \nintroduced the Unemployment Insurance Stabilization Act of 2010--the \nUSA bill. Our bill would reauthorize the Federal unemployment benefits \nprogram.\n  Unemployment benefits are the only lifeline that many workers in \nMontana and across the nation have left in this tough economy. These \nbenefits help millions of Americans to put food on the table and roofs \nover their heads. These benefits pump money into our economy and help \nto create jobs.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that unemployment \nbenefits have one of the largest effects on economic output and \nemployment per dollar spent of any policy.\n  This Congress has spent a lot of time reauthorizing unemployment \nbenefits for a few months at a time. This bill would reauthorize the \nprogram for a full year.\n  A longer reauthorization of the unemployment benefits program would \nprovide certainty. It would provide certainty for our economy. And it \nwould provide the certainty that Americans looking for work need.\n  This bill would fund unemployment insurance for people who have lost \ntheir jobs in the latter portion of the recession.\n  This bill would not provide anyone with more than 99 weeks of \nbenefits. This bill would ensure that out-of-work Americans who lost \ntheir jobs recently would get benefits similar to those received by \ntheir neighbors who lost their jobs earlier in the recession.\n  The Department of Labor reports that for every dollar spent on \nunemployment insurance, two dollars are reinvested in the economy.\n  This bill is crucial to our economy. This bill is about jobs.\n  This bill is about jobs because unemployment insurance goes to people \nwho will spend it immediately. That increases economic demand. And that \nhelps to support our fragile economic recovery.\n  CBO says that aid to the unemployed is among the policies best suited \nto creating jobs per dollar of budgetary cost.\n  With unemployment at 9.6 percent, now is not the time to stop \ninvesting in economic recovery. This bill would keep in place a major \nsource of our recovery. This bill would support Americans who have \nworked, are looking for work, and will work again.\n  For millions of people, unemployment insurance is the bridge to the \nnext job. This bill would provide a bridge over troubled waters.\n  I think of a woman from Helena, MT, who called my office. She told us \nthat unemployment benefits are keeping her family afloat. She was laid \noff when she was 8 months pregnant. And she wants the Senate to know \nthat she has worked since she was a teenager. She wants to work. And \nshe will work again.\n  And I think of a Montana father with three small children who was \nlaid off after 18 years of service. The company could no longer pay his \nwages. He has no income. But he continues to look for work. His home is \ngoing into foreclosure. Unemployment insurance has been his only \nincome. It is what puts food on the table for his family.\n  This is America. When there is an emergency, we don't leave people \nbehind.\n  We cannot take Federal unemployment insurance benefits away before \nour economy and out-of-work Americans have found their footing.\n  Let's not leave the unemployed behind.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8343-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8343-S8344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to continue \nto urge my colleagues for quick passage of my legislation that would \nrestore access to life-saving medicines for children's hospitals.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I introduced independent legislation in \nSeptember that would protect the lives of the most vulnerable among \nus--our Nation's children--by immediately restoring access and ensuring \nchildren's hospitals across the country are able to purchase orphan \ndrugs at a discount.\n  Children's hospitals lost access to these medicines when Congress \npassed\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  That wasn't right.\n  And so my legislation sought to fix it and restore access to these \nlife-saving medicines for children's hospitals. Without this fix, \nchildren's hospitals across the country will be faced with higher drug \ncosts. I introduced this legislation with the support of several of my \nRepublican colleagues. And I know that my Democratic colleagues support \nthe intent of my legislation too.\n  Unfortunately, and despite passage in the House, the Senate has not \npassed legislation to correct this flaw in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act.\n  But I am hopeful that the Senate will take action soon. I continue to \nwork with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and with Senate \nleadership to ensure that the Senate acts swiftly to correct this error \nin the Federal health care reform bill.\n  As my colleagues are aware, access to orphan drugs are critically \nimportant to children, many of whom, if they are ill, suffer from rare \ndiseases or conditions. Orphan drugs, by definition, are designed and \ndeveloped to help and treat diseases or conditions that affect fewer \nthan 200,000 people, many of whom are children. On a daily basis, the \nChildren's Hospital of Boston uses most of the 347 medicines that are \ndesignated orphan drugs.\n  I will say again that my legislation has the support of my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle. And I have this support because fixing \nthis provision and restoring access to life-saving medicines is the \nright thing to do.\n  My legislation restores and protects the ability for children's \nhospitals to access those outpatient medicines through the 340B drug \ndiscount program authorized in the Public Health Services Act. Access \nto this program and the corresponding discount saves the Children's \nHospital of Boston nearly $3 million annually, but more importantly, \nChildren's Hospital of Boston is able to save lives as a result. \nHospitals and doctors at children's hospitals are able to access life-\nsaving medicines, children live better lives, and families are given \npeace of mind.\n  Passing my bill quickly is the right thing to do and I encourage my \ncolleagues in the Senate to act swiftly to enact my legislation to \nensure that children's hospitals can once again receive discounted \npricing on these life-saving medicines.\n  There is no cause for delay. The House has passed this restorative \nlanguage twice already. The Senate needs to do the same. And we should \ndo so before the end of this year.\n  I believe quick passage is possible--quick passage should be \npossible--because of the support and efforts that I have seen \ndemonstrated by my fellow Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8344-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COLORADO RAPIDS SOCCER TEAM\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I congratulate and honor the \ntenacious play of the Colorado Rapids soccer team, that recently fought \ntheir way to victory over F.C. Dallas in the MLS Cup. This was truly a \ncome-from-behind victory. The Rapids struggled against F.C. Dallas in \ntwo games earlier this season, and in the championship game, Dallas \nscored first, early in the first half. But as they had done throughout \nthe playoffs, the Rapids relied on their character, concentration, and \ngrit and came back in the championship game to win 2 to 1 in overtime.\n  This is the first MLS Cup championship victory in Colorado Rapids \nhistory. And it is a testament to the resiliency of the team. From the \ncreativity of our strikers to the concentration of our goalkeeper, our \nside showed that they have what it takes to win, again and again. The \nRapids have proudly represented our State and the Colorado ideal that \nhard work and determination pay off. That is a lesson I am proud to \nshare with my three daughters, all of whom play soccer. The Rapids have \nproven that we have world-class teams and world-class fans in Colorado. \nI am proud to support the Colorado Rapids and again congratulate them \non this remarkable accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8344-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DOMINIC CALABRO\n\n Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ndistinguished career of Mr. Dominic Calabro of Tallahassee, FL, who is \nin his 30th year of public service with Florida TaxWatch, a \nnonpartisan, nonprofit government watchdog and research institute that \nhas served the taxpayers for decades in my home State of Florida. The \ngroup has been chaired for the past 2 years by the distinguished \nleadership of David A. Smith of Jacksonville, FL.\n  Florida TaxWatch first hired Mr. Calabro in 1980 as a senior research \nanalyst. His hard work and dedication was quickly recognized, as he was \npromoted to executive director in 1982 and CEO in 1986. Mr. Calabro has \nguided the growth of TaxWatch into a dynamic, influential organization \ndedicated to improving government productivity and taxpayer value \nthrough research and civic engagement. Approximately 70 percent of \nTaxWatch's recommendations have been adopted by Florida's government, \nsaving billions of dollars for Florida taxpayers.\n  Under Mr. Calabro's leadership, Florida TaxWatch has grown from an \norganization with a membership of approximately 30 and annual revenues \nof approximately $64,000 to a statewide organization boasting a \nmembership of nearly 1,000 individuals and organizations and revenues \nthat have grown more than twentyfold to over $1,500,000.\n  In addition to identifying and working to improve government spending \nin the public interest, Mr. Calabro and TaxWatch are the key players in \nthe annual Prudential-Davis Productivity Awards, a nationally unique \npublic-private partnership that recognizes and rewards exceptional \nFlorida state employees whose innovative work measurably increases \nproductivity and saves taxpayer money. Mr. Calabro has received \nnumerous honors and awards, including being named by the National \nJunior Chamber of Commerce as one of Ten Outstanding Young Americans \nfor 1994.\n  Mr. Calabro has been supported in all of his endeavors by his loving \nwife of 31 years, Debbie. They are devoted to their four children, \nDiana, Dominic, Christina, and Danny.\n  Mr. Calabro is also a driving force for improvements in public \neducation. He is on the Board of Advisors for Florida State \nUniversity's Graduate School of Social Work. Mr. Calabro also serves on \nthe Florida Education Foundation and Communities in Schools of Florida.\n  Many Florida TaxWatch recommendations have served as the impetus for \nimportant changes to Florida budgetary and taxation policy, including \nthe Taxpayers Bill of Rights of 1992, the Government Performance \nAccountability Act of 1994, the complete phase-out of the Intangibles \nTax, and a recent Government Cost Savings Task Force that so far has \nsaved the state nearly $3 billion to weather the current economic \nclimate.\n  I congratulate Mr. Calabro on his 30 years of service with Florida \nTaxWatch, and to wish him nothing but the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8344-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8344-S8345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING FATHER ALLEN NOVOTNY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on October 27th the Gonzaga \nCollege High School and Jesuit community lost a leader and dear friend. \nFather Allen Novotny served as the president of the oldest private high \nschool in Washington, DC, and led the charge to modernize the school's \naging facilities. When I moved my family to Washington, DC, I knew that \nunder the leadership of Father Novotny, my two sons would receive the \nbest education possible at Gonzaga. The school, which is known for its \nmotto ``Men for Others'' encourages students to participate in service \nprojects throughout DC, the country, and the world. During his 16 years \nat Gonzaga, Father Novotny increased the funding and variety of these \nessential service projects that gave thousands of young men the \nopportunity to grow in their faith and serve those in need.\n  Allen Paul Novotny was born in Baltimore in 1952 and received his \neducation at the Sacred Heart of Jesus School in Baltimore and then \nLoyola High School in Towson. He entered the Society of Jesus at the \nNovitiate of St.\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\nIsaac Jogues in Wernersville, PA, in 1970, and received a degree in \nhistory from Fordham University in 1975. He then went on to teach \nhistory at his alma mater Loyola, and by 1989 had received three \nmaster's degrees in divinity, pastoral counseling, and business \nadministration. These credentials along with Father Novotny's passion \nto provide a productive learning environment for the young men at \nGonzaga resulted in a $30 million campaign to renovate and expand the \nschools aging cafeteria, classrooms, gymnasium, and other facilities.\n  Along with his tireless efforts to improve the school structurally, \nFather Novotny also ensured the spiritual and educational improvement \nof the student body, parents, and faculty. With his calm demeanor and \nstrong faith, he guided the school through times of national tragedy in \n2001 when the September 11 attacks took the lives of family and friends \nin the Gonzaga community and again in 2002 during the Washington DC, \nsniper shootings. He also led the school to great educational and \nathletic triumphs. During his tenure, courses offered for college \ncredit at Gonzaga significantly increased and Gonzaga's basketball \nprogram has consistently been nationally ranked.\n  Father Novotny had a very personal connection with his students, \nwhich I always admired as a parent. He constantly attended the games of \nGonzaga's various sports teams and participated with the students in \ntheir service projects. In the weeks since his passing, there has been \nan outpouring of condolences from thousands of former and current \nstudents, parents, faculty, and friends who have shared their stories \nof the influence that Father Novotny had on their lives. Gonzaga will \nnow have to search for a replacement to serve as the school's \npresident, but we will never be able to replace in our hearts such a \ngreat leader, mentor, teacher, and friend. May he rest in \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8345-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8345-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8345-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:16 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 4783) to \naccelerate the income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions \nfor the relief of victims of the earthquake in Chile, and to extend the \nperiod from which such contributions for the relief victims of the \nearthquake in Haiti may be accelerated.\n                                  ____\n\n  At 12:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5866.

A bill to expand geothermal production, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nfrom Idaho and Oregon, Senator James Risch, Senator Mike Crapo, and \nSenator Jeff Merkley, in introducing the Geothermal Production \nExpansion Act of 2010. This legislation will amend an already existing \nlaw--the Geothermal Steam Act--governing the way the Federal Government \nleases public lands for the development of geothermal energy projects.\n  Geothermal energy facilities provide a continuous supply of renewable \nenergy with very few environmental impacts. Although the United States \nhas more geothermal capacity than any other country, this potential has \nbeen barely tapped. This shortfall is partly due to the high initial \ncost and risk involved in locating and developing geothermal resources. \nLike oil and natural gas exploration, until exploration and production \nwells are actually drilled, the true energy value of the site is not \nknown nor is the full extent of the underground reservoir or energy \nsource.\n  This legislation is intended to expand the future production of \ngeothermal energy on federally-owned lands by taking some of the \nuncertainty and guess work out of the leasing and development process \nby allowing the Interior Department to issue geothermal leases for \nadjacent lands on a non-competitive basis, based on fair-market value. \nThis would allow a geothermal developer to expand a successful \ngeothermal lease without being forced into a bidding war with \nspeculators or uncooperative competitors who might threaten project \nexpansion or even prevent the project from reaching commercial scale.\n  Under current law, the Department of Interior is charged with issuing \ngeothermal energy leases through a competitive lease sale. There are, \nhowever, several situations where the Department is allowed to issue \nnon-competitive leases, for example, if there were no competitive bids \noffered, or where there is an already existing mining claim, or where \nthe geothermal energy will be used directly on site for heating or \nother uses and not sold as electricity. This legislation would add an \nadditional category of non-competitive leases for lands that are \nimmediately adjacent to an existing, competitively-awarded, geothermal \nlease where there is an identified, validated geothermal energy \ndiscovery. They would not just be given away to an existing lease \nholder. These non-competitive leases would be made at fair-market value \nas independently determined by the Department of Interior. They could \nalso not be taken away from any existing lease holder, if they were \nalready leased, nor could they be removed from competitive leasing if \nthey had already been nominated to be competitively leased.\n  These safeguards are intended to insure that this new non-competitive \nlease authority is a limited exception to the general policy of \ncompetitive leasing for geothermal resources on our public lands. At \nthe same time, this new authority will help ensure that when and where \na geothermal resource has been discovered, the project developer will \nbe able to tap that resource and turn it into a viable, commercial \nenergy business and provide clean, renewable energy for our country.\n  This bill is a companion to bipartisan legislation sponsored by \nRepresentative Jay Inslee in the House of Representatives. The House \nCommittee on Natural Resources held hearings on the underlying House \nbill, H.R. 3709, in February of this year. The legislation Sen. Risch \nand I are introducing today incorporates changes resulting from those \nhearings, primarily making it clear that any non-competitive leases \nissued under this authority would be at fair-market value.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Production \n     Expansion Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the best interest of the United States to \n     develop clean renewable geothermal energy;\n       (2) development of that energy should be promoted on \n     appropriate Federal land;\n       (3) under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 et \n     seq.), the Bureau of Land Management is authorized to issue 3 \n     different types of noncompetitive leases for production of \n     geothermal energy on Federal land, including--\n       (A) noncompetitive geothermal leases to mining claim \n     holders that have a valid operating plan;\n       (B) direct use leases; and\n       (C) leases on parcels that do not sell at a competitive \n     auction;\n       (4) Federal geothermal energy leasing activity should be \n     directed towards persons seeking to develop the land as \n     opposed to persons seeking to speculate on geothermal \n     resources and artificially raising the cost of legitimate \n     geothermal energy development;\n       (5) developers of geothermal energy on Federal land that \n     have invested substantial capital and made high risk \n     investments should be allowed to secure a discovery of \n     geothermal energy resources; and\n       (6) successful geothermal development on Federal land will \n     provide increased revenue to the Federal Government, with the \n     payment of production royalties over decades.\n\n     SEC. 3. NONCOMPETITIVE LEASING OF ADJOINING AREAS FOR \n                   DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES.\n\n       Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. \n     1003(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Adjoining land.--\n       ``(A) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       ``(i) Fair market value per acre.--The term `fair market \n     value per acre' means a dollar amount per acre that--\n\n       ``(I) except as provided in this clause, shall be equal to \n     the market value per acre as determined by the Secretary \n     under regulations issued under this paragraph;\n       ``(II) shall be determined by the Secretary with respect to \n     a lease under this paragraph, by not later than the end of \n     the 90-day period beginning on the date the Secretary \n     receives an application for the lease;

A bill to direct the Administrator of the General Services \nAdministration to install Wi-Fi hotspots and wireless neutral host \nsystems in all Federal buildings in order to improve in-building \nwireless communications coverage and commercial network capacity by \noffloading wireless traffic onto wireless broadband networks; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Warner, to \nintroduce pro-consumer wireless legislation, which will improve \nwireless coverage and go a long way toward preventing the annoying \ndropped phone calls that many of us frequently experience indoors and \nin rural areas.\n  Specifically, the Federal Wi-Net Act would require the installation \nof small wireless base stations, such as femtocells or similar \ntechnologies, and Wi-Fi hot-spots in Federal buildings to improve \nwireless coverage and network capacity. In addition, the bill would \nstreamline Federal rights-of-way and wireless transmitter sitings on \nFederal buildings, which will simplify and expedite the placement of \nwireless and broadband network infrastructure, resulting in the \nexpansion of coverage and more reliable service to consumers and \nbusinesses.\n  Over the past year, there has been growing concern about a looming \nradio spectrum crisis given the significant growth in the wireless \nindustry. Currently, there are more than 276 million wireless \nsubscribers in the U.S., and American consumers use more than 6.4 \nbillion minutes of air time per day. While the foundation for wireless \nservices has been voice communication, more subscribers are utilizing \nit for broadband. According to the Pew Research Center, 56 percent of \nadult Americans have accessed the Internet via a wireless device. And \nABI Research forecasts there will be 150 million mobile broadband \nsubscribers by 2014--a 2,900 percent increase from 2007.\n  To meet this growing demand, a multi-faceted solution is required \nthat includes fostering technological advancement and more robust \nspectrum management. Such technologies as femtocells and Wi-Fi hotspots \nwill help alleviate growing wireless demand by offloading that traffic \nonto wireline broadband networks.\n  To that point, approximately 40 percent of cell phone calls are made \nindoors and more than 25 percent of U.S. households have ``cut-the-\ncord,'' relying solely on cell phones to make voice calls. On the data \nside, Cisco's Virtual Network Index reports that approximately 60 \npercent of mobile Internet use is done inside--either at home or at \nwork.\n  As the Federal Communications Commission's National Broadband Plan \nhighlights, most smartphones sold today have Wi-Fi capabilities to take \nadvantage of the growing ubiquity of wireless networks. According to a \nNovember 2008 report from AdMob, 42 percent of all iPhone traffic was \ntransported over Wi-Fi networks rather than AT's cellular network. So \ninstalling more mini-base stations, such as femtocells, and Wi-Fi \nhotspots will improve indoor coverage and wireless network capacity.\n  But in addition to improving indoor coverage and network capacity, we \nmust take steps to expand wireless coverage--primarily in rural areas. \nThe General Services Administration, GSA, manages approximately 8,600 \nbuildings across the country that can be used to house wireless and \nbroadband infrastructure.\n  As the National Broadband Plan acknowledges, ``to effectively deploy \nbroadband, providers often need to be able to place equipment on this \nfederally controlled property, or to use the rights-of-way that pass \nthrough the property.'' So we must make it a priority to streamline the \nprocesses, zoning, and permitting to ensure that carriers have \nreasonable, timely, and appropriate access to Federal buildings. Doing \nso will, without question, dramatically improve the service \navailability on which more than 276 million wireless subscribers rely \ndaily.\n  The increasing importance of wireless communications and broadband \nhas a direct correlation to our Nation's competitiveness, economy, and \nnational security and therefore demands that we make the appropriate \nchanges to current spectrum policy and management to avert a spectrum \ncrisis and continue to realize the boundless benefits of spectrum-based \nservices. That is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues join Senator \nWarner and me in supporting this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8350-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4722.

On average, 18 veterans commit suicide \n     each day, but just 5 such veterans-or 27 percent-are under \n     the care of the Department of Veterans Affairs at the time.\n       (2) The 2010 Army Health Promotion Risk Reduction Suicide \n     Prevention Report states that the current suicide problem in \n     the Army is exacerbated by an acceptance of\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\n     high risk behaviors, which have been increasing since fiscal \n     year 2004. The report contains recommendations that could \n     result in the separation from the Armed Forces for \n     disciplinary reasons of members who have a potential for \n     suicide.\n       (3) To address this possibility, the Department of Defense \n     and the Department of Veterans Affairs should jointly develop \n     policies and procedures to specifically mitigate the risks \n     associated with such separations.\n       (b) Suicide Prevention Monitoring.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs shall jointly carry out a program to \n     monitor members of the Armed Forces who are administratively \n     separated from the Armed Forces for high risk behavior during \n     their transition to receipt of care from the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs and to otherwise assist such members in that \n     transition. The program shall be known as the ``DOD-to-VA \n     Suicide Prevention Pipeline Program''.\n       (2) Elements.--Under the program, the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall jointly assign to \n     each individual who is administratively separated from the \n     Armed Forces for high risk behavior a case worker who shall \n     meet with such individual, with such frequency as the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     jointly determine appropriate, in order to monitor the \n     behavior of such individual, offer support to such \n     individual, and encourage such individual to take advantage \n     of benefits and care provided by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs. Such meetings shall continue for a given individual \n     until the individual is under the effective jurisdiction of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs otherwise \n     jointly determine such meetings are no longer necessary.\n       (3) High risk behavior.--For purposes of this subsection, \n     high risk behavior includes attempted suicide, illicit use of \n     drugs (whether prescription or illegal), substance abuse, \n     criminal activity, gambling, infidelity, excessive spending, \n     reckless driving, and other such behavior that alone or in \n     combination with other behavior results in administrative \n     separation from the Armed Forces.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall jointly submit to the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and Committee on \n     Armed Services of the House of Representatives a report on \n     the program required by subsection (b). The report shall set \n     forth a description of the program and an assessment of the \n     effectiveness of the program in preventing suicide among \n     individuals who are administratively separated from the Armed \n     Forces for high risk behavior.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4723.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for Mr. Durbin) proposed an amendment to the \nbill S. 987, to protect girls in developing countries through the \nprevention of child marriage, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Protecting \n     Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Child marriage, also known as ``forced marriage'' or \n     ``early marriage'', is a harmful traditional practice that \n     deprives girls of their dignity and human rights.\n       (2) Child marriage as a traditional practice, as well as \n     through coercion or force, is a violation of article 16 of \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, \n     ``Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full \n     consent of intending spouses''.\n       (3) According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), an estimated 60,000,000 girls in developing \n     countries now ages 20 through 24 were married under the age \n     of 18, and if present trends continue more than 100,000,000 \n     more girls in developing countries will be married as \n     children over the next decade, according to the Population \n     Council.\n       (4) Between \\1/2\\ and \\3/4\\ of all girls are married before \n     the age of 18 in Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the \n     Central African Republic, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and \n     Nepal, according to Demographic Health Survey data.\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\n       (5) Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, a \n     lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls, \n     parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within marriage, \n     the dowry system, and the perceived lack of value of girls.\n       (6) Child marriage has negative effects on the health of \n     girls, including significantly increased risk of maternal \n     death and morbidity, infant mortality and morbidity, \n     obstetric fistula, and sexually transmitted diseases, \n     including HIV/AIDS.\n       (7) According to the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID), increasing the age at first birth for a \n     woman will increase her chances of survival. Currently, \n     pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause \n     of death for women 15 to 19 years old in developing \n     countries.\n       (8) Most countries with high rates of child marriage have a \n     legally established minimum age of marriage, yet child \n     marriage persists due to strong traditional norms and the \n     failure to enforce existing laws.\n       (9) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that \n     child marriage is ``a clear and unacceptable violation of \n     human rights'', and that ``the Department of State \n     categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child \n     abuse''.\n       (10) According to an International Center for Research on \n     Women analysis of Demographic and Health Survey data, areas \n     or regions in developing countries in which 40 percent or \n     more of girls under the age of 18 are married are considered \n     high-prevalence areas for child marriage.\n       (11) Investments in girls' schooling, creating safe \n     community spaces for girls, and programs for skills building \n     for out-of-school girls are all effective and demonstrated \n     strategies for preventing child marriage and creating a \n     pathway to empower girls by addressing conditions of poverty, \n     low status, and norms that contribute to child marriage.\n\n     SEC. 3. CHILD MARRIAGE DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``child marriage'' means the marriage \n     of a girl or boy, not yet the minimum age for marriage \n     stipulated in law in the country in which the girl or boy is \n     a resident or, where there is no such law, under the age of \n     18.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) child marriage is a violation of human rights, and the \n     prevention and elimination of child marriage should be a \n     foreign policy goal of the United States;\n       (2) the practice of child marriage undermines United States \n     investments in foreign assistance to promote education and \n     skills building for girls, reduce maternal and child \n     mortality, reduce maternal illness, halt the transmission of \n     HIV/AIDS, prevent gender-based violence, and reduce poverty; \n     and\n       (3) expanding educational opportunities for girls, economic \n     opportunities for women, and reducing maternal and child \n     mortality are critical to achieving the Millennium \n     Development Goals and the global health and development \n     objectives of the United States, including efforts to prevent \n     HIV/AIDS.\n\n     SEC. 5. STRATEGY TO PREVENT CHILD MARRIAGE IN DEVELOPING \n                   COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Assistance Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The President is authorized to provide \n     assistance, including through multilateral, nongovernmental, \n     and faith-based organizations, to prevent the incidence of \n     child marriage in developing countries through the promotion \n     of educational, health, economic, social, and legal \n     empowerment of girls and women.\n       (2) Priority.--In providing assistance authorized under \n     paragraph (1), the President shall give priority to--\n       (A) areas or regions in developing countries in which 40 \n     percent or more of girls under the age of 18 are married; and\n       (B) activities to--\n       (i) expand and replicate existing community-based programs \n     that are successful in preventing the incidence of child \n     marriage;\n       (ii) establish pilot projects to prevent child marriage; \n     and\n       (iii) share evaluations of successful programs, program \n     designs, experiences, and lessons.\n       (b) Strategy Required.--\n       (1) In general.--The President shall establish a multi-year \n     strategy to prevent child marriage and promote the \n     empowerment of girls at risk of child marriage in developing \n     countries, which should address the unique needs, \n     vulnerabilities, and potential of girls under age 18 in \n     developing countries.\n       (2) Consultation.--In establishing the strategy required by \n     paragraph (1), the President shall consult with Congress, \n     relevant Federal departments and agencies, multilateral \n     organizations, and representatives of civil society.\n       (3) Elements.--The strategy required by paragraph (1) \n     shall--\n       (A) focus on areas in developing countries with high \n     prevalence of child marriage;\n       (B) encompass diplomatic initiatives between the United \n     States and governments of developing countries, with \n     attention to human rights, legal reforms, and the rule of \n     law;\n       (C) encompass programmatic initiatives in the areas of \n     education, health, income generation, changing social norms, \n     human rights, and democracy building; and\n       (D) be submitted to Congress not later than one year after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than three years after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President should submit to \n     Congress a report that includes--\n       (1) a description of the implementation of the strategy \n     required by subsection (b);\n       (2) examples of best practices or programs to prevent child \n     marriage in developing countries that could be replicated; \n     and\n       (3) an assessment, including data disaggregated by age and \n     sex to the extent possible, of current United States funded \n     efforts to specifically prevent child marriage in developing \n     countries.\n       (d) Coordination.--Assistance authorized under subsection \n     (a) shall be integrated with existing United States \n     development programs.\n       (e) Activities Supported.--Assistance authorized under \n     subsection (a) may be made available for activities in the \n     areas of education, health, income generation, agriculture \n     development, legal rights, democracy building, and human \n     rights, including--\n       (1) support for community-based activities that encourage \n     community members to address beliefs or practices that \n     promote child marriage and to educate parents, community \n     leaders, religious leaders, and adolescents of the health \n     risks associated with child marriage and the benefits for \n     adolescents, especially girls, of access to education, health \n     care, livelihood skills, microfinance, and savings programs;\n       (2) support for activities to educate girls in primary and \n     secondary school at the appropriate age and keeping them in \n     age-appropriate grade levels through adolescence;\n       (3) support for activities to reduce education fees and \n     enhance safe and supportive conditions in primary and \n     secondary schools to meet the needs of girls, including--\n       (A) access to water and suitable hygiene facilities, \n     including separate lavatories and latrines for girls;\n       (B) assignment of female teachers;\n       (C) safe routes to and from school; and\n       (D) eliminating sexual harassment and other forms of \n     violence and coercion;\n       (4) support for activities that allow adolescent girls to \n     access health care services and proper nutrition, which is \n     essential to both their school performance and their economic \n     productivity;\n       (5) assistance to train adolescent girls and their parents \n     in financial literacy and access economic opportunities, \n     including livelihood skills, savings, microfinance, and \n     small-enterprise development;\n       (6) support for education, including through community and \n     faith-based organizations and youth programs, that helps \n     remove gender stereotypes and the bias against girls used to \n     justify child marriage, especially efforts targeted at men \n     and boys, promotes zero tolerance for violence, and promotes \n     gender equality, which in turn help to increase the perceived \n     value of girls;\n       (7) assistance to create peer support and female mentoring \n     networks and safe social spaces specifically for girls; and\n       (8) support for local advocacy work to provide legal \n     literacy programs at the community level to ensure that \n     governments and law enforcement officials are meeting their \n     obligations to prevent child and forced marriage.\n\n     SEC. 6.

RESEARCH AND DATA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President and all \n     relevant agencies should work through the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development and \n     any other relevant agencies of the Department of State, and \n     in conjunction with relevant executive branch agencies as \n     part of their ongoing research and data collection \n     activities, to--\n       (1) collect and make available data on the incidence of \n     child marriage in countries that receive foreign or \n     development assistance from the United States where the \n     practice of child marriage is prevalent; and\n       (2) collect and make available data on the impact of the \n     incidence of child marriage and the age at marriage on \n     progress in meeting key development goals.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S COUNTRY REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS \n                   PRACTICES.\n\n       The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended--\n       (1) in section 116 (22 U.S.C. 2151n), by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) The report required by subsection (d) shall include \n     for each country in which child marriage is prevalent at \n     rates at or above 40 percent in at least one subnational \n     region, a description of the status of the practice of child \n     marriage in such country. In this subsection, the term `child \n     marriage' means the marriage of a girl or boy, not yet the \n     minimum age for marriage stipulated in law or under the age \n     of 18 if no such law exists, in the country in which such \n     girl or boy is a resident.''; and\n       (2) in section 502B (22 U.S.C. 2304), by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(i) The report required by subsection (b) shall include \n     for each country in which child marriage is prevalent at \n     rates at or above 40 percent in at least one subnational \n     region, a description of the status of the practice of child \n     marriage in such country. In this subsection, the term `child \n     marriage' means the marriage of a girl or boy, not yet the \n     minimum age for marriage stipulated in law or under the age \n     of 18 if no such law exists, in the country in which such \n     girl or boy is a resident.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, with the passage of the \nInternational Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act, the \nSenate takes a step toward ending child marriage.\n  Child marriage is often carried out through force or coercion. It \ndeprives young girls, and sometimes boys, of their dignity and human \nrights. And it poses grave health risks. In some countries, it is not \nuncommon for girls as young as 7 or 8 years old to be married.\n  Child marriage also undermines U.S. foreign assistance to developing \ncountries. We invest in education and skills-building for girls, \nimproving maternal and child health, ending the transmission of HIV/\nAIDS, preventing gender-based violence, and reducing poverty. But where \nthe girls targeted for assistance are married, these development \nstrategies only go so far.\n  UNICEF estimates that 60 million girls in developing countries now \nages 20 to 24 were married under the age of 18. The Population Council \nestimates that the number will increase by 100 million over the next \ndecade if trends continue.\n  The International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act \nseeks to reverse those trends. Thanks to Senator Olympia Snowe and 41 \nother cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, the leadership of \nSenators John Kerry and Richard Lugar on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and Representatives Betty McCollum and Ander Crenshaw in the \nHouse for supporting the legislation to make ending child marriage a \npriority in foreign affairs.\n  I would also like to thank The Elders, a group of world leaders \nincluding Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and President Jimmy Carter, who \nwork together to address major causes of human suffering around the \nglobe. Their help and persistence on the legislation have been \ninvaluable.\n  The human rights community has rightly identified the practice of \nchild marriage as a major concern that treats young girls as property \nand traps them in a life of servitude. It denies girls educational and \neconomic opportunities, sustaining a cycle of poverty in some of the \nworld's poorest countries.\n  Many child brides live their lives in crushing hopelessness. Some are \ndriven to attempt suicide to escape their misery.\n  A recent New York Times article entitled, ``For Afghan Wives, a \nDesperate, Fiery Way Out,'' shared the story of Farzana, engaged at 8 \nand married by 12. By the age of 17, she had endured years of verbal \nand physical abuse from her husband and his family.\n  She thought of ways to get out. She thought of running away but \nworried it would offend her family's sense of honor.\n  Finally, seeing no other way out and desperate, Farzana doused \nherself in cooking fuel and lit herself on fire.\n  Before this hell, Farzana had dreamed of becoming a teacher. Now, \nafter 57 days in the hospital and multiple skin grafts, she has \nrecovered from burns that covered more than half of her body.\n  Today she says, ``Five years I spent in his house with those people. \nMy\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nmarriage was for other people. They should never have given me in a \nchild marriage.'' Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, stories \nlike these are common. Except, unlike Farzana, many succeed in killing \nthemselves. Young girls in the developing world should not be made to \nface the choice between life as a child bride without hope or dying at \ntheir own hands to escape their torment.\n  In addition to denying tens of millions of women and girls their \ndignity, child marriage also endangers their health. Marriage at an \nearly age puts girls at greater risk of dying as a result of \nchildbirth. Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading \ncause of death for women 15 to 19 years old in developing countries. \nTheir children also face higher mortality rates.\n  In September 2009, a highly publicized example of this occurred in \nYemen. A 12-year-old girl died of severe bleeding after three agonizing \ndays in labor. Her child died as well. She was married to a 24-year old \nman. Child brides are also at an increased risk of contracting a \nsexually transmitted disease, including HIV and AIDS.\n  The bill we passed today would require our government to develop an \nintegrated, strategic approach to combating child marriage with the \ngoal of eliminating this scourge worldwide. It authorizes assistance to \nprevent child marriage in developing countries and to promote the \neducational, health, economic, social and legal empowerment of girls \nand women. It would require priority for regions in developing \ncountries with a high prevalence of child marriage.\n  The bill also would require the Federal Government to do a better job \nof tracking child marriage prevalence overseas.\n  In the Senate today, we take a big step toward helping children we \nwill never meet in places we will never visit. There are some issues we \nmust look at through the shared experience of humanity. Ensuring that \nchildren throughout the world do not have their childhoods robbed of \nthem is one such issue.\n  The United States has always tried to be a leader in international \nhuman rights. By passing this bill, the Senate shows its determination \nto keep the United States at the forefront of human rights protection \naround the world.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to work with Representatives \nMcCollum and Crenshaw and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman \nHoward Berman and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Speaker Pelosi \nto do the same.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the Durbin amendment be \nagreed to; the committee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to; \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed with no \nintervening action or debate; and that any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4725) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 987), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8355-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n  A resolution (S. Res. 686) designating December 11, 2010, as \n``Wreaths Across America Day.''\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in honor of the hard work and generosity \nof all those involved in the Wreaths Across America project, U.S. \nSenators Olympia J. Snowe and I have submitted a resolution in the \nSenate that would designate Saturday, December 11, as ``Wreaths Across \nAmerica Day.''\n  On Saturday, December 11, a convoy of Mainers will arrive at \nArlington National Cemetery to honor our Nation's fallen heroes. At \neach of the thousands of gravesites at our country's most hallowed \nresting place, citizens from Maine will lay Maine-made balsam wreaths \nat each gravesite that identifies one of our Nation's fallen veterans. \nJoining them will be the Patriot Guard Riders, an organization made up \nof men and women who have volunteered a portion of their lives to \nconsecrating the sacrifice of the service men and women who gave their \nall for our country. Together, they will continue their tradition of \nescorting and driving tractor-trailers filled with donated wreaths on \nthe journey from Harrington, ME, to Arlington National Cemetery. This \nis the 19th consecutive year that Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester \nWreath Company in Harrington, has made this generous donation. And once \nagain, more than 100,000 wreaths will be placed in more than 400 \nlocations, including Arlington National Cemetery and at veterans \ncemeteries in America and abroad.\n  The holiday season is one that many Americans enjoy by spending time \nin the comfort and company of their family and close friends. Many \nfamilies who have lost loved ones serving their country will not share \nthe same comfort and joy during this holiday season. The men and women \nbehind the Wreaths Across America project work hard to honor these \nfamilies and their lost love ones. Our resolution is a modest way for \nthe U.S. Senate to honor these men and women, as well as the veterans \nand families who sacrifice so much in order to make it possible for us \nto celebrate this holiday season in freedom.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 686) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 686\n\n       Whereas 19 years ago, the Wreaths Across America project \n     began an annual tradition, during the month of December, of \n     donating, transporting, and placing Maine balsam fir holiday \n     wreaths on the graves of the fallen heroes buried at \n     Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas since that tradition began, through the hard work \n     and generosity of the individuals involved in the Wreaths \n     Across America project, hundreds of thousands of wreaths have \n     been sent to national cemeteries and veterans memorials in \n     every State and to locations overseas;\n       Whereas in 2009, wreaths were sent to over 400 locations \n     across the United States, 100 more locations than the \n     previous year, and 24 sites overseas;\n       Whereas in December 2010, the Patriot Guard Riders, a \n     motorcycle and motor vehicle group that is dedicated to \n     patriotic events and includes more than 200,000 members \n     nationwide, will continue their tradition of escorting a \n     tractor-trailer filled with donated wreaths from Harrington, \n     Maine, to Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas thousands of individuals volunteer each December to \n     escort and lay the wreaths;\n       Whereas December 12, 2009, was previously designated by the \n     Senate as ``Wreaths Across America Day''; and\n       Whereas the Wreaths Across America project will continue \n     its proud legacy on December 11, 2010, bringing 15,000 \n     wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery on that day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 11, 2010, as ``Wreaths Across \n     America Day'';\n       (2) honors the Wreaths Across America project, the Patriot \n     Guard Riders, and all of the volunteers and donors involved \n     in this worthy tradition; and\n       (3) recognizes the sacrifices our veterans, members of the \n     Armed Forces, and their families have made, and continue to \n     make, for our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "01", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/01/senate-section/article/S8356-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2010\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
