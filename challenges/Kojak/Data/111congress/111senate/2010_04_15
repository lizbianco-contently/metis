Madam President, two things have become increasingly \nclear over the past week in the debate about the need to protect \ntaxpayers from the mistakes of Wall Street: No. 1, both parties are \nunited in the need to take action--we agree on that--and No. 2, the \nbill our colleagues across the aisle are insisting on as the remedy is \nseriously flawed.\n  The good news is that the bill can be improved, and both sides have \nexpressed a willingness to make the changes needed to ensure without \nany doubt--without any doubt--that this bill would not allow future \nbailouts of Wall Street banks. We need to make sure future bailouts of \nWall Street banks never occur again.\n  I was encouraged to hear the President yesterday acknowledge that it \nis his hope that the bill which emerges from this debate will not allow \nfor bailouts. I share that hope. Republicans believe the solution is \nfor the bipartisan talks to resume between Chairman Dodd and Ranking \nMember Shelby and others and not for one side to insist on a take-it-\nor-leave-it approach.\n  Like the President, I hope we can get back together and address this \nvery important issue on a bipartisan basis. Republicans and Democrats \nalike believe the flaws in the Democratic bill--flaws that would allow \ntaxpayer dollars to bail out Wall Street banks--can and should be \ncorrected. Let's get this done. Let's take away any possibility that \ntaxpayers will once again be told they will be on the hook for mistakes \non Wall Street.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2332-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2332-S2333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak this morning about two \ntopics. One is the recent work the President has done on nuclear \nsecurity and some progress we have made this week, and the issue of tax \npolicy in the United States of America.\n  First, I rise today to talk about the threat posed by nuclear \nterrorism and the historic progress made by President Obama and his \nadministration at the Nuclear Security Summit this week and some \nobservations on Iran's nuclear program.\n  The threat posed by so-called loose nuclear material is real. We know \nthat more than 2,000 tons--2,000 tons--of plutonium and highly enriched \nuranium exist in dozens of countries with a variety of peaceful as well \nas military uses. There have been 18 documented cases of theft or loss \nof highly enriched uranium or plutonium--that is 18 documented cases--\nthroughout the world.\n  In September of 1961, President Kennedy addressed nuclear weapons in \na speech to the United Nations General Assembly. He said:\n\n       Every man, woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of \n     Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of \n     being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or \n     madness.\n\n  Today, the threat of a nuclear strike is more likely to come from \nterrorist actors, not a state. These groups are harder to deter because \nthey may not have a geographic base. Moreover, they are not threatened \nby the concept of mutually assured destruction.\n  President Obama noted that we are paradoxically more vulnerable today \nto a nuclear attack than we were during the Cold War. Today's sword of \nDamocles still hangs by the slenderest of threads, but we have the \nability to prevent this threat by minimizing the access such terrorist \ngroups would have to nuclear materiel.\n  So what did the United States accomplish at the Nuclear Security \nSummit? First, I believe it was important for the President to elevate \nthis threat in the minds of international leaders, particularly among \nthe so-called nonaligned movement--those nations across the world that \nare not aligned on these issues.\n  Many leaders around the world do not see nuclear terrorism as an \nexistential threat. This summit was an important first step towards \naccurately defining the threat that nuclear terrorism holds for us all \nand building broad political support for higher security standards.\n  This political support is important because we can't stop nuclear \nterrorism on our own. Securing nuclear materials requires the active \nparticipation of a host of actors including governments, militaries, \nborder guards, parliaments, intelligence services, local law \nenforcement, and citizens. We need increased vigilance and an \nunderstanding that a nuclear strike anywhere in the world will have a \nprofound impact on us all.\n  The administration was also able to attract concrete support for \nseveral initiatives. In fact, every country in attendance pledged to do \nmore to tighten regulation of nuclear materials and several made \nconcrete commitments to comply with international treaties on nuclear \nsecurity. Most notably, our allies decided to do the following: By way \nof example, Canada returned a large amount of spent highly enriched \nuranium fuel from their medical isotope production reactor to the \nUnited States and committed to funding highly enriched uranium removals \nfrom Mexico and Vietnam; Chile removed all highly enriched uranium in \nMarch; Italy and the U.A.E. signed Megaports agreements with the U.S. \nwhich will include installation of detection equipment at ports; \nKazakhstan will convert a highly enriched uranium research reactor and \neliminate its remaining highly enriched uranium; Mexico will convert a \nhighly enriched uranium research reactor and eliminate their remaining \nhighly enriched uranium by working through IAEA; Norway will contribute \n$3.3 million over the next 4 years to the IAEA nuclear security fund \nwhich are flexible funds for activities in developing countries; Russia \nsigned the Plutonium Disposition protocol, decided to end plutonium \nproduction and will make contributions to the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency's Nuclear Security Fund; finally, Ukraine will remove all \nhighly enriched uranium by the next Nuclear Security Summit in 2012 and \nhalf of it by year's end.\n  This conference was only the beginning of a renewed international \nfocus on fulfilling commitments to U.N. resolution 1540 and the nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty. In December, representatives from each \nparticipating country will reconvene to measure commitments made \nagainst concrete results. This effort to focus the international \ncommunity will lead to even more tangible progress looking ahead to the \nnext nuclear security summit in Seoul in 2012.\n  Ultimately, real progress will be found in the consistent enforcement \nof rules already in place for monitoring and controlling the \nestablishment and movement of nuclear material in these countries. This \nis not exciting work but very important as countries safeguard and \nreduce their weapons-grade material, and we will begin to build a more \nsecure future.\n  I was also encouraged at President Obama's ability to use the summit \nto continue building support for strong sanctions on Iran. I believe \nthat his face to face meeting with President Hu will pay dividends as \nthe U.N. Security Council negotiated a resolution imposing sanctions on \nIran. Given China's recent opposition to new sanctions, I was \nencouraged by President Hu's apparent willingness to consider the \nresolution. We are not there yet, but the administration has laid the \ndiplomatic groundwork necessary for a strong sanctions package. We need \nto move forward on this pressure track and we need to move quickly.\n  At the end of March, I traveled to the International Atomic Energy \nAgency--IAEA--in Vienna for an update on its work to track the Iranian \nnuclear program. While I was impressed with the agency staff and \nleadership of Director General Yukiya Amano, I came away convinced that \nthe international community needed to do more to confront Iran's \nnuclear program.\n  My concerns have grown with reports that Iran may be planning two \nadditional nuclear enrichment sites. In a recent interview with the \nIranian Student News Agency, the head of Iran's\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\nAtomic Energy Organization said President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had \nordered work to begin soon on the two new enrichment plants. The \nplants, he said, ``will be built inside mountains,'' presumably to \nprotect them from attacks.\n  If Iran's nuclear program were peaceful in nature, they would have \nnothing to hide from international inspectors. Iran has all but \nrejected the Geneva deal of October 1, 2009, that would have seen \nIran's low enriched uranium--L.E.U.--shipped out the country and the \neventual return of uranium enriched to 20 percent, well below weapons \ngrade, for use in a Tehran medical research reactor. Iran would have \nagreed to this very good deal offered repeatedly by the international \ncommunity if it wanted a nuclear program for medical and other peaceful \npurposes.\n  If the United States is committed to demonstrating that international \nlaw is not an empty promise, obligations must be kept and treaties must \nbe enforced so that the Iranian regime knows we mean business. The \nIranian regime must face penalties for violating its commitments to the \nU.N. and the IAEA. France, the United Kingdom, the U.S., China, Russia \nand Germany have made serious attempts to engage with Iran through the \nP5+1 process. These efforts have been repeatedly rebuffed and in some \ncases scorned by the regime in Tehran. Iran's leaders continue to pass \nup extraordinary opportunities to integrate their country with the rest \nof the world, a desire felt by so many of Iran's citizens.\n  I supported these engagement efforts as a means towards changing the \nbehavior of the regime. Unfortunately, it has not worked. Noncompliance \nwith the U.N. and IAEA must have consequences and the international \ncommunity must move quickly to show Iran that we are serious.\n  During my trip, I also attended a conference on transatlantic \nrelations in Brussels with American and European leaders. I called on \nour European allies to support an aggressive multilateral sanctions \npackage and was heartened to see that many participants heeded this \ncall to action. I appeared on a panel alongside Yossi Kuperwasser, \nDeputy Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs, \nwho also made an impassioned appeal to those assembled, not only on \nbehalf of Israel but the broader international community. Iran's \npursuit of nuclear weapons would spark an arms race in the region, \nwhich does not advance Iran's or any other country's security. The \nclock is ticking, he said, and free people around the world have a \nshared interest in stopping Iran's nuclear program.\n  I could not agree more with our friend from Israel when he made that \nstatement.\n\n\n                               Tax Policy\n\n  Next, I will move for a few moments to the other topic I want to \nspeak about briefly, tax policy. We are in this season of not only \ntaxes--the focus on Tax Day, it is April 15--but we are also in the \nseason of debate about the budget and about our economic future. That \nis as it should be. But I think when we step back and look at what has \nhappened over the last 18 months or so, we see, and I think the \nevidence is abundantly clear now, that Democrats in the Senate, working \nwith President Obama and a very few number of Republicans, have \nprovided meaningful tax cuts to hard-working middle-class families \nthroughout America.\n  Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the so-called \nstimulus bill, or the recovery bill as I like to call it, we will \ncontinue to fight to provide this kind of tax relief for middle-income \nfamilies so they can fully reap the benefits of their hard work and \nstabilize their families' finances.\n  I think, on this side of the aisle, if we look at the record of the \nlast more than a year, we have been on the side of middle-income \nfamilies as they work very hard to make ends meet in a very difficult \neconomy. I think this record stands in stark contrast with the record \nof our Republican friends who tried to sell their tax breaks over the \npast decade as beneficial to all Americans, when in reality they gave \naway nearly $3 trillion--let me say that again--$3 trillion in tax cuts \nto the wealthiest 20 percent of U.S. households.\n  What happened after that? Our economy went into the ditch, and we \nhave been in the ditch for far too long. At the same time that was \nhappening, Democrats were trying and have been succeeding in making \nsure we understand what middle-income families are up against. In the \npast year, Democrats have provided 98 percent of Americans with a tax \ncut. A new study shows middle-class tax cuts included in the recovery \nbill have saved taxpayers an average of $1,158 on their tax returns \nthis year. Every single working- and middle-class family and \nindividual--and here we are talking about the bottom 80 percent of \nincome earners--have received a tax cut.\n  This analysis accounts for the following parts of our policy: First, \nthe Making Work Pay tax credit, which has been available to 94 percent \nof all working families and individuals; second, changes to the child \ntax credit; third, an increase in the earned-income tax credit; and, \nfinally, relief from the alternative minimum tax, as well as a new, \npartially refundable education tax credit. The cite for this is \nCitizens for Tax Justice, April 13 of this year.\n  I think the record is pretty clear when it comes to recent history on \ntax policy. Democrats have been on the side of middle-income families, \nproviding tax cuts for so many Americans who were not getting that kind \nof relief before. Republicans in Washington have a long record of \nmaking sure wealthy Americans get their tax cuts. But what we see from \nthat is an economy in the ditch. We are thankfully moving out of that \nditch.\n  We saw in January and February of 2009 more than 1.5 million jobs \nlost. Contrast that with January and February of 2010. There was much \nless job loss, in the tens of thousands, and even by the revised \nestimates actual growth in jobs, certainly growth in jobs in the month \nof March 2010. I think the record is pretty clear.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my colleague from Delaware, Senator \nKaufman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2333-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2333-S2334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN PRAISE OF THELMA STUBBS SMITH\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise once again to speak about one of \nour Nation's great Federal employees.\n  We have just returned to Washington, and I know we have a long and \nbusy work period ahead in the Senate. All of us will be relying on our \nstaff--especially our schedulers and personal assistants--to keep us \nabreast of the latest vote schedules and meetings with constituents and \ncolleagues.\n  I cannot overstate how much those of us in positions of leadership \ndepend on the hard work and expertise of those who keep us organized \nand ever-prepared. This is not just true for me and my colleagues in \nthe Senate but also for Members of the House, Cabinet Secretaries, \nagency heads, and other senior officials.\n  That is why I have chosen to honor as this week's great Federal \nemployee a woman whose long career did so much to help keep our Nation \nsafe during the Cold War.\n  Thelma Stubbs Smith served for over 40 years in the Defense \nDepartment as a personal assistant.\n  She worked for seven consecutive Secretaries of Defense--both \nRepublican and Democratic. Before that, Thelma served under six \nAssistant Secretaries in the Department.\n  A native of Chicago, Thelma began her public service career during \nWorld War II, when she worked for the Selective Service System and the \nOffice of Price Administration. After the war, she worked as a \nsecretary at the Veterans Administration before coming to Washington to \nwork for the Pentagon's Guided Missiles Committee.\n  Thelma briefly served on the staff of Illinois Congressman Melvin \nPrice in 1952, but she soon returned to the Pentagon.\n  In the 1950s and 1960s, Thelma served as the personal assistant to \nsix Assistant Secretaries of Defense, including William Bundy, John \nMcNaughton, and Paul Nitze. During this time, she began accompanying \nthem on what would later total 85 trips overseas during her career. As \npart of her duties during that period, she worked closely with \nSecretary Robert McNamara.\n  One of the most harrowing moments in her life came on the 13th day of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\nCuban Missile Crisis. Thelma spent that evening personally burning \nimportant cables and notes in a small office at the Pentagon, as they \nwere too sensitive to be shredded with other papers. When she finally \nleft after midnight, she was one of the few Americans who knew just how \nprecarious the situation was, and she could not say with certainty \nwhether the Pentagon would be there the next morning.\n  But, thankfully, that morning came.\n  In 1969, when Melvin Laird was confirmed as Secretary of Defense, he \nasked Thelma to serve as his personal assistant. She agreed to do so on \na temporary basis.\n  I know personally how a ``temporary basis'' can evolve into a life's \npursuit. When Joe Biden asked me to help him set up his Senate office \nin 1972, I took a 1-year leave of absence from my job with the DuPont \nCompany, and I ended up staying with Joe Biden for 22 years.\n  In that way, Thelma began her service as the personal assistant to \nevery Secretary of Defense from Melvin Laird to Frank Carlucci.\n  During the course of her service, Thelma visited every corner of the \nworld. She was awarded 10 Meritorious Civilian Service Medals and the \nSecretary of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, which is \nthe highest medal a civilian employee of the Pentagon can earn.\n  A paragon of professionalism and discretion, Thelma always answered \nthose who urged her to write a book by saying that ``It would be 500 \nblank pages, and the title would be `My Lips are Sealed.' ''\n  All of us who serve in positions of leadership with enormous \nresponsibility to the American people owe so much to great organizers \nand assistants like Thelma.\n  I know firsthand how Thelma's dedication to public service was passed \non to her family. Her daughter, Sheryl Rogers, and son-in-law, Geoff \nRogers, have lived in my home State of Delaware for over 20 years, and \nboth were Federal employees as staffers here in the Senate.\n  Sheryl used to work in the office of former Virginia Senator John \nWarner, and Geoff spent a few years in then-Senator Joe Biden's office, \nback when I was chief of staff.\n  Thelma, now retired, resides in Northern Virginia, not far from the \nPentagon, where she served for so many years.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring the great contribution \nThelma Stubbs Smith has made to our Nation as well as thanking all \nthose who serve as personal assistants in the Defense Department and \nacross our government.\n  They are all truly great Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nfinancial reform. I know we have a number of issues before the body \nright now, and it will be a couple of weeks, maybe 3, before this body \ntakes up what I think is a very important piece of legislation, \nfinancial reform.\n  It is something the Banking Committee has been having hearings on now \nfor about a year and a half. It is an issue that I think is very \nimportant to our country and Americans from all walks of life. At \npresent, the bill that has come out of the committee is a partisan \nbill. It came out of committee on a 13-10 vote; came out of committee, \nbelieve it or not, a 1,336-page bill, came out in 21 minutes with no \namendments, on a party-line vote and no debate.\n  I could talk a lot about this function and activities on both sides \nof the aisle that may have put us where we are today. But the fact is, \nwe have a very important piece of legislation that is getting ready to \ncome before this body. It is one I believe we need to deal with in a \nbipartisan way.\n  The stated reason by the chairman of the committee as to why we \nhandled the bill the way we did in committee a few weeks ago--not to \nhave amendments, not to debate the bill--was to, after the bill came \nout of committee, negotiate a bipartisan bill before it came to the \nfloor and then have a debate on some of the smaller issues.\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric flying around here over the last \ncouple of weeks, some of which came from the White House, some of it \ncame from the Democratic leadership, some of it came from our side of \nthe aisle. It is evident that what is happening right now, instead of \nseeking a real bipartisan bill, what is happening is, one member, two \nmembers, two members on the Republican side are being reached out to to \ntry to snag somebody and to make that, in fact, a bipartisan bill.\n  That is not my understanding of what a good bipartisan bill is. That \ncertainly was not my understanding as to why the Banking Committee \nhandled the bill the way we did. Again, I want to say one more time, a \n1,336-page bill, coming out of committee in 21 minutes with no \namendments.\n  The reason that was done, or the stated reason, was so the two sides \nwould not harden against each other, and that before the bill actually \ncame to the floor, we would reach a true bipartisan amendment.\n  I came here to try to solve problems for our country and put in place \ngood policy. I think everybody knows I have worked hard, along with \nothers on our side of the aisle, to reach a real, solid, good \nbipartisan bill, a bill that ends too big to fail. I think everybody in \nthis country, on both sides of the aisle, of all walks of life, wants \nto expunge from the American vocabulary the fact that any company in \nthis country is too big to fail.\n  The bill that has come out of committee tried to address that. There \nare many good provisions in the bill under the title of ``Orderly \nLiquidation'' that deal with that. But what happened at the very end \nwas, as one would expect, Treasury got involved, the FDIC got involved. \nThey wanted to create some flexibility for themselves, as any agency or \nadministration wishes to have. But in creating that flexibility, that \nfoam on the runway, as some would call it, what has happened is we \nactually have a bill that does not end too big to fail.\n  It is my belief--and I had a colloquy with my friend from Virginia \nyesterday, Senator Warner--that we could solve that in about 5 minutes. \nMaybe that is an exaggeration, maybe it is 15, maybe it is 30.\n  But the fact is, there are provisions that we know could fix this \npiece of legislation so that it ends any chance of a company seeping \nthrough, if you will, and actually being bailed out. My guess is, if we \nagain sat down as adults we could solve that problem. As a matter of \nfact, I think some of that activity, some of those discussions actually \nbegan yesterday.\n  I think all of us want to make sure that consumers are protected. \nThere is no question, both sides of the aisle understand that in many \nways there needs to be more transparency, there needs to be more \naccountability.\n  I had some great negotiations with Senator Dodd from Connecticut. We \nreached a middle ground. I will say that again. We reached a middle \nground. We had an understanding that leadership on our side of the \naisle was in agreement with. What I would say is let's get back there. \nLet's get this consumer protection, let's get this new agency back in \nthe middle of the road, let's protect consumers, and let's make sure at \nthe same time that it does not undermine the safety and soundness of \nour financial system. We can do that. We can do that in 2 or 3 or 4 \ndays. It can be done. It is not that complicated. We have worked \nthrough many of the issues.\n  On to revenue. I could not agree more that we need to make sure that \nwe use, to the extent we can, a clearinghouse to make sure when \ncompanies are trading in derivatives, and they are money baths at the \nend of the day, they settle up. They get back into a position where \nthey are even. They put up collateral. They put up cash to make sure \nthey are not money baths, so that we do not end up in the same position \nwe were when AIG had not done that, had not trued up on a daily basis, \nand they found themselves with huge liabilities that they could not own \nup to which destabilized our financial system.\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\n  That is not where we need to be. But we know what we need to do. \nLook, this is a very complex piece of legislation. There is no doubt. \nIt is intellectually challenging to try to work through it and try to \nmake sure that you do not have unintended consequences by not fully \nseeing what a piece of legislation or a sentence may do.\n  But the fact is, we can do this. This is not that heavy. It is my \nunderstanding that the chairman of the Banking Committee plans to bring \nthis bill forward on April 26, maybe a week later. It is my \nunderstanding we may deal with some other issues. Maybe it is the first \nweek of May.\n  What I would say to everybody in this body, and anybody who may be \nwatching, is we can easily reach a bipartisan consensus on this. We \nhave to have the ability to sit down and do that.\n\n  I consider it not a good-faith effort to, instead of sitting down \nwith many of the principals who have been involved in this from day \none, the chairmen and ranking members on the committees, instead of \nsitting down and creating a template--it doesn't have to address every \nsingle issue but a template on the floor that deals with it--instead of \ndoing that, reaching out and trying to find one person to come over, I \ndon't consider that a good-faith effort. I am sorry. I hope that type \nof activity will end. That is not what has been stated as to how we can \nreach a bipartisan bill.\n  Let me go back to the template. This is complex, this piece of \nlegislation. To me what we need to do is sit down together. We could \nhave it done in a week. We need to sit down together and work through \nthe main issues in this template. Let's deal with derivatives, with \nconsumers. Let's deal with systemic risk and orderly liquidation. There \nwill be issues of Members on our side of the aisle where there is no \nway we could reach agreement on in our own caucus, and I know there are \nissues on the other side of the aisle on which their caucus will not be \nable to reach agreement, having to do with governance, some of the \nsecurity issues that may exist in title IX. Let's debate those issues \non the floor. My guess is that if we did that, there are going to be \nsome amendments adopted that I don't think are particularly good ideas. \nThere will be some amendments adopted that my friends on the other side \nof the aisle would not think are particularly good ideas. But at the \nend of the day, we would have come to the floor with a template that on \nthe big issues we have reached bipartisan agreement, and then we could \nhave amendments to debate on the floor, some of the other issues that \nmay delve down into details that don't necessarily change the entire \nbill but address issues that Members in this body think are important.\n  I consider it an honor to serve in this body. I have enjoyed this \nmore than any issue we have dealt with, trying to reach a consensus on \nthis financial regulation bill. There is plenty of fault to go around \non both sides that does not need to be rehashed at this moment. The \nfact is, we are where we are. We are getting ready to deal with a major \npiece of legislation. There are numbers of people on both sides of the \naisle who have spent a lot of time trying to understand the \ncomplexities of these issues. I am proud of the work Members on both \nsides of the aisle have done to try to understand these issues in a \nreal way. Let's get those folks together. Let's sit down and work out \nthe template. Let's bring a real bipartisan bill to the floor, not a \nbill where they go out and make a deal with one person and bring them \nover, and maybe there are other things going on at the same time. That \nis not what I call a bipartisan bill. Let's bring it to the floor. \nLet's debate it. Let's do what the people all across this country have \nelected us to do. Let's come to the floor and act like adults. Let's \ntone down the rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or the \nminuses.\n  Let's do what the Senate was created to do. We were supposed to be \nthe cool heads. We were supposed to be the people who took some of the \nred-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down \nwith cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. \nAs a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that on financial \nregulation, an issue that doesn't have any real philosophical bearings \nto it--there are some differences in points of view, but at the end of \nthe day, we all want to make sure we address financial regulation in an \nimportant way, that we do what we can to alleviate risk in the system \nwithout stifling innovation.\n  I think everybody still wants this country to be the world leader in \nfinancial innovation. But we want to do so in a manner that doesn't \ncreate risk, that doesn't upset our economy, that doesn't have periods \nof time where we have such risk and instability that people are \nunemployed. We all want to do that.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I believe a \ncommitment was made. I took it as a real commitment that after this \nbill came out of committee, we were going to sit down like adults and \nreach a bipartisan agreement on a template that would be brought to the \nfloor and debated. I took that as a commitment. I expect that \ncommitment to be honored. I look forward to that process beginning.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, later today, President Obama will \ntravel to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. He will visit with \nemployees and officials there and deliver a speech on his vision for \nNASA. We have begun to learn the details about some of what the \nPresident may be announcing, but so far nothing has been suggested that \nalleviates the concerns I expressed earlier this week. In fact, I am \ngrowing more concerned. I have serious questions about the \nadministration's proposed vision.\n  For example, the President is proposing to rely on a commercial space \nlaunch industry that is still in its infancy. Once the space shuttle is \nretired, a commercial vehicle would be the only American human \nspaceflight capability for the foreseeable future. Further, we are \nabout to complete the International Space Station and begin the period \nof scientific research we have been waiting for. For the past 10 years, \nwe have waited for the space station to be up and running and operable. \nAt the same time that it is now becoming operable, we are beginning to \nphase out the space shuttle program. That is the only means we have to \ndeliver crew and cargo to the space station. We are nowhere close to \nhaving an alternative to the shuttle, whether government operated or \ncommercial operation.\n  Congress and the President agree we should extend the life of the \nspace station to at least 2020. That only makes sense because we have \ninvested $100 billion in this space station. Our partners are \ninternational. We have contractual commitments to our partners who have \nalso made huge investments in the space station. Yet now we are looking \nat stopping our shuttle at the end of this year so the alternatives \nwill be limited. We must be certain the space station can be supplied \nand maintained with the spare parts and equipment it needs to operate \nfor the next 10 years. It may well be that equipment needed to ensure \nthe sustainability of the space station can only be delivered by the \nspace shuttle.\n  I introduced legislation last month to require NASA to conduct a \nreview of station components and identify anything that might be needed \nto be delivered to equip it for its research mission. Of course, NASA \ncould do that review right now without legislation. I urge General \nBolden, the NASA Administrator, to undertake such a review, \nparticularly in light of the space shuttle not being extended under the \nPresident's proposal. It is still possible we could extend the time \nbetween the shuttle flights to deliver the necessary materials to the \nstation. That is an option I believe we need to preserve. It would \nprolong the time we could put our own astronauts into space with our \nown vehicle that we know is reliable.\n  That is the key. We don't have to add more into the budget. The \nbudget already provides for two more space shuttles this year, plus one \nthat would\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nbe a contingency. We have this paid for in the budget. If we will only \nextend these out, it will give us so many more national options that \nwould be in America's best interest. Without a NASA-managed alternative \nfor human access to space, we will be dependent on the Russian Soyuz \nrockets to take American, European, Japanese, and Canadian crew members \nto the space station. Today it is a cost of $56 million per passenger. \nThat price could go up, if we end the space shuttles this year. We \ndon't know what the next contract might have, especially when it is \nrealized that we will have no capability and are shutting down our own \ncapabilities at the time that we would be asking for help from the \nRussians.\n  Of even more concern is the possibility that without a shuttle or \nother alternative, any failure of the Soyuz for any period of time \ncould leave the space station abandoned to become an orbiting example \nof space debris. What if something happened to the Russian program? \nWhat if the commercial industry that is fledgling doesn't come up with \nan alternative or, worse yet, what if they go out of business? These \nare the concerns the President is not addressing in his budget for \nNASA. I hope he will become more willing to look at the long-term \nconsequences of what he is proposing to do, if we are going to retain \nour leadership position in space, in economics, and in security.\n  These and other concerns have been expressed by a number of other \nindividuals, editorial boards, and organizations over the past days.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters and \neditorials expressing serious reservations about the President's plan \nand its adverse impact to our Nation's future leadership in space.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [An Open Letter to President Obama, Apr. 13, 2010]\n\n       The United States entered into the challenge of space \n     exploration under President Eisenhower's first term, however, \n     it was the Soviet Union who excelled in those early years. \n     Under the bold vision of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and \n     Nixon, and with the overwhelming approval of the American \n     people, we rapidly closed the gap in the final third of the \n     20th century, and became the world leader in space \n     exploration.\n       America's space accomplishments earned the respect and \n     admiration of the world. Science probes were unlocking the \n     secrets of the cosmos; space technology was providing \n     instantaneous worldwide communication; orbital sentinels were \n     helping man understand the vagaries of nature. Above all \n     else, the people around the world were inspired by the human \n     exploration of space and the expanding of man's frontier. It \n     suggested that what had been thought to be impossible was now \n     within reach. Students were inspired to prepare themselves to \n     be a part of this new age. No government program in modern \n     history has been so effective in motivating the young to do \n     ``what has never been done before.''\n       World leadership in space was not achieved easily. In the \n     first half-century of the space age, our country made a \n     significant financial investment, thousands of Americans \n     dedicated themselves to the effort, and some gave their lives \n     to achieve the dream of a nation. In the latter part of the \n     first half-century of the space age, Americans and their \n     international partners focused primarily on exploiting the \n     near frontiers of space with the Space Shuttle and the \n     International Space Station.\n       As a result of the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle \n     Columbia in 2003, it was concluded that our space policy \n     required a new strategic vision. Extensive studies and \n     analysis led to this new mandate: meet our existing \n     commitments, return to our exploration roots, return to the \n     moon, and prepare to venture further outward to the asteroids \n     and to Mars. The program was named ``Constellation.'' In the \n     ensuing years, this plan was endorsed by two Presidents of \n     different parties and approved by both Democratic and \n     Republican congresses.\n       The Columbia Accident Board had given NASA a number of \n     recommendations fundamental to the Constellation architecture \n     which were duly incorporated. The Ares rocket family was \n     patterned after the Von Braun Modular concept so essential to \n     the success of the Saturn 1B and the Saturn 5. A number of \n     components in the Ares 1 rocket would become the foundation \n     of the very large heavy lift Ares V, thus reducing the total \n     development costs substantially. After the Ares 1 becomes \n     operational, the only major new components necessary for the \n     Ares V would be the larger propellant tanks to support the \n     heavy lift requirements.\n       The design and the production of the flight components and \n     infrastructure to implement this vision was well underway. \n     Detailed planning of all the major sectors of the program had \n     begun. Enthusiasm within NASA and throughout the country was \n     very high.\n       When President Obama recently released his budget for NASA, \n     he proposed a slight increase in total funding, substantial \n     research and technology development, an extension of the \n     International Space Station operation until 2020, long range \n     planning for a new but undefined heavy lift rocket and \n     significant funding for the development of commercial access \n     to low earth orbit.\n       Although some of these proposals have merit, the \n     accompanying decision to cancel the Constellation program, \n     its Ares 1 and Ares V rockets, and the Orion spacecraft, is \n     devastating.\n       America's only path to low Earth orbit and the \n     International Space Station will now be subject to an \n     agreement with Russia to purchase space on their Soyuz (at a \n     price of over 50 million dollars per seat with significant \n     increases expected in the near future) until we have the \n     capacity to provide transportation for ourselves. The \n     availability of a commercial transport to orbit as envisioned \n     in the President's proposal cannot be predicted with any \n     certainty, but is likely to take substantially longer and be \n     more expensive than we would hope.\n       It appears that we will have wasted our current $10-plus \n     billion investment in Constellation and, equally importantly, \n     we will have lost the many years required to recreate the \n     equivalent of what we will have discarded.\n       For the United States, the leading spacefaring nation for \n     nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth \n     orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond \n     Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, \n     destines our nation to become one of second or even third \n     rate stature. While the President's plan envisages humans \n     traveling away from Earth and perhaps toward Mars at some \n     time in the future, the lack of developed rockets and \n     spacecraft will assure that ability will not be available for \n     many years.\n       Without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft \n     operation provides, the USA is far too likely to be on a long \n     downhill slide to mediocrity. America must decide if it \n     wishes to remain a leader in space. If it does, we should \n     institute a program which will give us the very best chance \n     of achieving that goal.\n     Neil Armstrong,\n       Commander, Apollo 11.\n     James Lovell,\n       Commander, Apollo 13.\n     Eugene Cernan,\n       Commander, Apollo 17.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Orlando Sentinel, Apr. 12, 2010]\n\n       Dear President Obama, America is faced with the near-\n     simultaneous ending of the Shuttle program and your recent \n     budget proposal to cancel the Constellation program. This is \n     wrong for our country for many reasons. We are very concerned \n     about America ceding its hard earned global leadership in \n     space technology to other nations. We are stunned that, in a \n     time of economic crisis, this move will force as many as \n     30,000 irreplaceable engineers and managers out of the space \n     industry. We see our human exploration program, one of the \n     most inspirational tools to promote science, technology, \n     engineering and math to our young people, being reduced to \n     mediocrity. NASA's human space program has inspired awe and \n     wonder in all ages by pursuing the American tradition of \n     exploring the unknown. We strongly urge you to drop this \n     misguided proposal that forces NASA out of human space \n     operations for the foreseeable future.\n       For those of us who have accepted the risk and dedicated a \n     portion of our lives to the exploration of outer space, this \n     is a terrible decision. Our experiences were made possible by \n     the efforts of thousands who were similarly dedicated to the \n     exploration of the last frontier. Success in this great \n     national adventure was predicated on well defined programs, \n     an unwavering national commitment, and an ambitious \n     challenge. We understand there are risks involved in human \n     space flight, but they are calculated risks for worthy goals, \n     whose benefits greatly exceed those risks.\n       America's greatness lies in her people: she will always \n     have men and women willing to ride rockets into the heavens. \n     America's challenge is to match their bravery and acceptance \n     of risk with specific plans and goals worthy of their \n     commitment. NASA must continue at the frontiers of human \n     space exploration in order to develop the technology and set \n     the standards of excellence that will enable commercial space \n     ventures to eventually succeed. Canceling NASA's human space \n     operations, after 50 years of unparalleled achievement, makes \n     that objective impossible.\n       One of the greatest fears of any generation is not leaving \n     things better for the young people of the next. In the area \n     of human space flight, we are about to realize that fear; \n     your NASA budget proposal raises more questions about our \n     future in space than it answers.\n       Too many men and women have worked too hard and sacrificed \n     too much to achieve America's preeminence in space, only to \n     see that effort needlessly thrown away. We urge you to \n     demonstrate the vision and determination necessary to keep \n     our nation at the forefront of human space exploration with \n     ambitious goals and the proper resources to see them through. \n     This is not the time to abandon the promise of the space \n     frontier for a lack of will or an unwillingness to pay the \n     price.\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\n       Sincerely, in hopes of continued American leadership in \n     human space exploration.\n         Walter Cunningham, Apollo 7; Chris Kraft, Past Director \n           JSC; Jack Lousma, Skylab 3, STS-3; Vance Brand, Apollo-\n           Soyuz, STS-5, STS-41B, STS-35; Bob Crippen, STS-1, STS-\n           7, STS-41C, STS-41G, Past Director KSC; Michael D. \n           Griffin, Past NASA Administrator; Ed Gibson, Skylab 4; \n           Jim Kennedy, Past Director KSC; Alan Bean, Apollo 12, \n           Skylab 3; Alfred M.

An underfunded Constellation program has \n     suffered a series of delays which will likely push the first \n     manned flight of Ares I with the Orion Crew Exploration \n     Vehicle back to 2017. The Shuttle is on track to be retired \n     near the end of 2010 after five more missions to the \n     International Space Station (ISS), leaving a gap in US \n     launched manned missions of at least seven years. The US, \n     which has funded approximately $60 billion of the $100 \n     billion ISS price tag, will soon find itself in an \n     embarrassing position of buying seats on Russian vehicles to \n     get its astronauts to and from the ISS. Further, and \n     incredibly, the US is currently only funded to operate and \n     maintain the ISS to 2015, just five years after its projected \n     completion date.\n       NASA's plans to retire the Shuttle in 2010 are intended to \n     redirect money to Constellation, a program which will not \n     only send Orion to the ISS, but also explore beyond low earth \n     orbit (LEO); i.e. go to the moon, Mars, and beyond. The \n     Shuttle retirement, though, would yield sole access to the \n     ISS to Russia for the currently projected seven-year gap. \n     Thus, much of the public is bewildered by our government's \n     desire to spend so much capital on such a crowning \n     achievement, the ISS, and not consider it valuable enough to \n     preserve our own independent access to it. I believe the \n     American public's thirst for US leadership of manned space \n     exploration will ultimately support NASA's desires to explore \n     beyond LEO; however, Americans will be cautious in their \n     support by first demanding we be good stewards of their \n     current 60-billion-dollar investment. To do that, we need to \n     extend the operational life of the ISS, guarantee our access \n     to it by flying Shuttle through the gap, and robustly fund \n     science research aboard the ISS.\n       Some insist we need to retire the Shuttle as soon as \n     possible for safety concerns. I disagree. For sure, the \n     Shuttle fleet is aging, as indicated by the fact that \n     Endeavour, our newest Shuttle, first flew in 1992. Still, it \n     is my personal belief that every Shuttle mission continues to \n     be safer than the previous one. While components on board the \n     Shuttle are aging, the redundancy designed into the system is \n     remarkable. Every day we get better at understanding the \n     hazards associated with the mission, as indicated by our \n     inspection techniques, repair procedures, external tank foam \n     improvements, etc. NASA mission management teams give me \n     great confidence that we are getting better at this business \n     each and every mission. If we are comfortable with flying the \n     currently remaining five missions (and I am quite certain we \n     are), then I argue we should not be afraid to continue to fly \n     the Shuttle through the gap.\n       Others argue that commercial alternatives exist to ferry \n     our astronauts to and from the ISS. Not quite yet. Our \n     commercial industry is indeed getting closer to attaining the \n     ability to send unmanned spacecraft to the ISS as resupply \n     ships. Ultimately, these companies may produce spacecraft \n     safe enough for human travel to LEO. However, I would not bet \n     the future of the ISS on commercial access for crewmembers \n     happening much sooner, if at all, than Orion is capable of \n     flying to the ISS in 2017. Thus, this option cannot be \n     considered a viable ``gap filler'' at this point.\n       So, our choice is to accept a seven-year gap (or more) of \n     no dedicated US access to the ISS or continue to fund the \n     Shuttle through this gap. It will cost three billion dollars \n     per year to maintain the Shuttle infrastructure and support \n     at least two resupply/crew rotation missions per year. Thus, \n     we need approximately an additional 20 billion dollars to \n     fill the entire gap with Shuttle flights. An extra 20 billion \n     dollars is a substantial amount of money. However, in the \n     context of today's trillion-dollar annual deficit and 800-\n     billion-dollar stimulus package, an extra 20 billion dollars \n     spread over seven years is a bargain for what the Space \n     Shuttle brings to our country. Not until Orion or a \n     commercial alternative is indeed ready and capable of \n     transporting our astronauts to and from the ISS, should we \n     consider retiring the Space Shuttle. I believe our best \n     approach to convince the public to ultimately support our \n     exploration beyond LEO is to first deliver significant \n     scientific payback with the ISS, and guaranteeing this \n     payback requires we maintain our own, uninterrupted, access \n     to it. The future of NASA and our manned exploration of space \n     must include flying the Shuttle through the gap, whatever \n     that gap may be.\n     Lee Archambault.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 13, 2010]\n\n                           Losing it in Space\n\n       Pity poor NASA. Rather than reaching toward the stars, \n     America's premier scientific organization has settled its \n     sights on studying shrimp schools beneath the Antarctic ice \n     cap and sticky accelerators on Toyotas. Such is the scope of \n     hope and change in President Obama's universe.\n       In his 2011 budget, the president zeroed out NASA's \n     Constellation project, the package of launch and landing \n     vehicles that were to replace the aging space shuttle fleet \n     to carry Americans into space. As a candidate, Mr. Obama said \n     he ``endorses the goal of sending human missions to the moon \n     by 2020, as a precursor in an orderly progression to missions \n     to more distant destinations, including Mars.'' The O Force \n     changed its mind. Killing the Constellation project means \n     billions wasted while space-flight hardware collects dust. \n     ``Yes we can'' has become ``mission impossible.''\n       This is not a cost-cutting move. The agency is budgeted to \n     receive $19 billion next year, and Mr. Obama wants to throw \n     an additional $6 billion at it over five years. The hitch is \n     he wants to shift its mission toward climate research and \n     airplane design. Anxious to stay relevant, NASA agreed to \n     research the cause of Toyota's sudden-acceleration problem.\n       NASA administrator Charles Bolden said Thursday that \n     federal money is budgeted for fostering the growth of the \n     commercial space industry, including the development of space \n     taxis. But if the results of the president's stimulus are any \n     indication, command economic policy is an inefficient \n     generator of jobs.\n       Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas Republican, has argued \n     that the most practical move would be to keep funding the \n     space shuttle program until a replacement vehicle is ready. \n     That way, the nation would maintain the continuity of space \n     travel and avoid further erosion of its faltering space \n     program.\n       As NASA's wings are clipped, our competitors soar. The U.S. \n     space agency even had to sign a $340 million deal with Russia \n     on April 6 to transport astronauts to the International Space \n     Station through 2014. By then, China intends to conduct an \n     ambitious schedule of flights with its Shenzhou spacecraft. \n     It doesn't take much imagination to envision the day when \n     NASA must pay its Asian competitor large sums for American \n     astronauts to ride into orbit as passengers. Thanks to Mr. \n     Obama, the United States will be dependent on Russia and \n     China for space travel.\n       The space program is a great symbol of the American spirit \n     of achievement. The day this nation cedes the conquest of \n     space to others is the day we admit that we have forfeited \n     our competitive exceptionalism. Earth-centric activities like \n     the study of the Antarctic shrimp ecosystem and automobile \n     anomalies should be left to others. A less-costly NASA should \n     be relieved of extraneous responsibilities and allowed to \n     retain its core mission--one that no other agency can \n     accomplish--the exploration of space.\n       On behalf of all Americans, Floridians should make certain \n     the president gets the message loud and clear when he hosts a \n     conference about the agency's future on Thursday in the \n     Sunshine State: Let NASA be NASA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 14, 2010]\n\n            Feud Over NASA Threatens America's Edge in Space\n\n                           (By Andy Pasztor)\n\n       After dominating space for a half century, the U.S. is \n     mired in a political fight that threatens its leadership role \n     and ambitions for manned exploration.\n       President Barack Obama travels Thursday to the Kennedy \n     Space Center to try to salvage his plans to re-energize the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, but experts \n     say U.S. manned space travel will likely be grounded for \n     years longer than previously expected.\n       The Florida summit comes amid an escalating battle between \n     the White House and Congress over the fastest and least \n     expensive way to revitalize the space program. Mr. Obama has \n     been pushing ambitious plans for start-up companies to ferry \n     astronauts into space on private rockets. Congress, \n     meanwhile, is bent on defending NASA's traditional rocket and \n     spacecraft programs, which the Obama administration wants to \n     kill.\n       The White House believes NASA's current projects are too \n     expensive and will take too long to deliver. Mr. Obama is \n     betting that private enterprise can fill the gap--carrying \n     astronauts and cargo to the space station--until a resurgent \n     NASA can deliver more advanced space vehicles.\n       But lawmakers, industry officials and scientists say they \n     fear that for the first time\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n     since the glory days of the Apollo moon landings, the U.S. \n     will end up without a clear plan, destination and timetable \n     for sending astronauts deeper into the solar system.\n       At stake is more than national pride. Losing the lead in \n     space has national-security and industrial consequences. Such \n     industries as shipping, airlines and oil exploration depend \n     on orbiting satellites to gather and send essential data. TV \n     signals, cell phones, ATMs, some credit card machines and \n     many Internet connections rely on space technology. Recent \n     estimates peg global civilian and military spending on space \n     and space-related technologies at more than $260 billion \n     annually.\n       At the same time, the Pentagon views space as a frontier \n     where foes will try to undermine U.S. security.\n       The importance of space has drawn the European Union and \n     more countries into the race. Russia, China, India and Brazil \n     all have, or are determined to create, robust space programs. \n     By 2016, China aims to develop and test a heavy-lift booster \n     capable of blasting five tons of cargo into orbit--a \n     timetable far more ambitious than anything on NASA's drawing \n     board.\n       With retirement of the space shuttle in a few months, the \n     U.S. was already facing the prospect of hitching rides for up \n     to five years on Russian spacecraft to reach the \n     international space station.\n       Some experts say the current political fight could leave \n     the U.S. with no way to blast astronauts deeper into space \n     until close to 2020. Initial optimistic hopes of returning \n     U.S. astronauts to the moon by the end of the decade could be \n     delayed another ten years or more, these experts say.\n       Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to walk on the moon, \n     Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan--the last \n     human to walk on the moon--warned in an open letter this week \n     that the president's plan ``destines our nation to become one \n     of second- or even third-rate stature.'' Buzz Aldrin, another \n     icon of U.S. space travel, has supported the president's \n     plan.\n       Burt Rutan, the aerospace engineer who was the first person \n     to send a privately built and designed craft into space, \n     warned that NASA could be crippled within a few years, \n     allowing international rivals to take the lead.\n       The retirement of the space shuttle program initiated a \n     chance to chart a new course for the U.S. space program, said \n     experts, but instead triggered conflict that is as much \n     political as technological.\n       Congress wants to save NASA's existing exploration program, \n     called Constellation, which was expected to produce 25,000 \n     jobs and more than $60 billion in contractor revenue over its \n     lifetime.\n       As originally conceived, Constellation was a $100 billion \n     project to take astronauts into orbit, and later to deploy \n     next-generation rockets and landers to explore the moon and, \n     eventually, pave the way for manned exploration of Mars.\n       The White House believes the Constellation program will \n     take too long and that a fresh approach is required. \n     Lawmakers say they are skeptical of the president's plan to \n     entrust core functions of the space program to untested \n     start-up companies.\n       NASA chief Charles Bolden, a former astronaut, said Mr. \n     Obama's visit to Florida would persuade doubters that ``he is \n     dedicated to exploration and human space flight'' and \n     ``committed to a vibrant future'' for NASA.\n       The president also plans to provide details on a few \n     concessions, such as retaining a small portion of the \n     Constellation program, as well as announcing that workers who \n     lose their jobs when the space shuttle retires will be \n     eligible for retraining and other benefits, according to \n     people familiar with the matter.\n       Those involved in talks over the future of the U.S. space \n     program say the most likely outcome is a compromise that may \n     satisfy politicians but probably won't provide enough funding \n     for either program to get off the ground quickly. ``That just \n     drags out the pain and slows everything down for a long \n     time,'' said Brewster Shaw, head of Boeing Co.'s space-\n     exploration division.\n       Mr. Obama, who often recounts watching NASA launches as a \n     youngster perched on his grandfather's shoulders, says he \n     hopes to lead the agency through a historic shift.\n       To chart a new course, he selected Mr. Bolden and Lori \n     Garver, a former NASA policy official and proponent of \n     commercial space travel, as advisers. Ms. Garver, now the No. \n     2 official at NASA, headed the administration's transition \n     team for the agency.\n       One of the first things Ms. Garver said she did was to \n     ``look under the hood'' of the Constellation program. She \n     didn't like what she found. The program was years behind \n     schedule and over budget, and she said she had doubts about \n     its long-term viability.\n       Ms. Garver also played a big role in naming a presidential \n     panel to assess NASA. Led by former Lockheed Martin Corp. \n     Chairman Norman Augustine, the panel released a report in \n     October that was critical of the agency. The study concluded \n     that without a substantial infusion of new money and ideas, \n     Constellation would wither and NASA would become increasingly \n     irrelevant.\n       A small group of administration officials, including White \n     House science chief John Holdren and his chief of staff Jim \n     Kohlenberger, set out to begin dismantling the Constellation \n     project.\n       ``The fact that we poured $9 billion into an un-executable \n     program really isn't an excuse to pour another $50 billion \n     into it and still not have an executable program,'' Mr. \n     Kohlenberger later said of the project. The money would be \n     better used, he and his colleagues concluded, on commercial \n     space transportation.\n       The White House aides envisioned a bevy of space taxis--\n     designed, built and operated by private enterprise--that \n     could take astronauts to and from the space station. This \n     earth-to-orbit job would rely on young companies and \n     relatively untested technologies.\n       Space Exploration Technologies Inc., started by 38-year-old \n     PayPal founder Elon Musk, for example, only had about 40 \n     employees in 2004. Its largest rocket is still waiting for \n     its first test flight, but SpaceX has a good chance of ending \n     up as a key part of NASA's plans to transport both astronauts \n     and cargo to the space station. Another entrant is Orbital \n     Sciences Corp, a midsize NASA supplier that hopes to parlay \n     its commercial efforts into securing a prime contract for \n     manned programs.\n       Big contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing \n     Co. would also play a role but wouldn't be as intensely \n     involved.\n       Supporters say the president's approach would create \n     thousands of high-tech jobs and game-changing technologies. \n     It would also free up NASA to deal with more difficult, \n     longer-term projects, such as developing powerful boosters \n     and in-orbit refueling systems making it possible to reach \n     distant planets.\n       But the administration failed to persuade lawmakers and \n     didn't make it easy for its staff. Mr. Bolden said he didn't \n     get final numbers from the White House about the impact of \n     Constellation's proposed demise until hours before the budget \n     was released in February. Only then, he said, did ``we really \n     know what the budget was going to be.''\n       Hours after announcing that NASA was betting on a group of \n     entrepreneurs to deliver pioneering technologies, Mr. Bolden \n     said he felt more comfortable with the agency's traditional \n     contractors. ``I would be lying,'' he acknowledged in an \n     interview, ``if I said I don't have some greater comfort with \n     a Boeing'' than a fledgling company.\n       Ms. Garver was also slow to disclose the proposed project \n     cancellations to NASA's biggest suppliers, such as Boeing, \n     Lockheed Martin and Alliant Techsystems Inc.\n       Even the Florida summit sparked friction. White House aides \n     initially encouraged lawmakers to organize the event, but \n     then decided to do it themselves. Aides to Mr. Obama then \n     promised to reserve tickets for any members of Congress who \n     wanted to attend, according to legislators and staffers. But \n     invitations were later limited, according to a White House \n     email this week that blamed Democratic Congressional leaders \n     and apologized for ``any misunderstanding.''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will highlight a number of quotes from these \ndocuments. Let me start with a letter by three of our Nation's renowned \nastronauts, true American heroes: Neil Armstrong, the first man to set \nfoot on the Moon, commander of Apollo 11; James Lovell, commander of \nApollo 13; and Eugene Cernan, commander of Apollo 17.\n  In an open letter to the President, these space pioneers state that \nalthough some of the President's proposals have merit, ``the decision \nto cancel the Constellation program, its Ares 1 and Ares V rockets and \nthe Orion spacecraft, is devastating.''\n  They say:\n\n       America's only path to low Earth orbit and the \n     International Space Station will now be subject to an \n     agreement with Russia to purchase space on their Soyuz (at a \n     price of over 50 million dollars per seat with significant \n     increases expected in the near future) until we have the \n     capacity to provide transportation for ourselves. The \n     availability of a commercial transport to orbit as envisioned \n     in the President's proposal cannot be predicted with any \n     certainty, but is likely to take substantially longer and be \n     more expensive than we would hope.\n       It appears that we will have wasted our current $10-plus \n     billion investment in Constellation and, equally importantly, \n     we will have lost the many years required to recreate the \n     equivalent of what we will have discarded.\n       For The United States, the leading space faring nation for \n     nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth \n     orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond \n     Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, \n     destines our nation to become one of second or even third \n     rate stature. While the President's plan envisages humans \n     traveling away from Earth and perhaps toward Mars at some \n     time in the future, the lack of developed rockets and \n     spacecraft will assure that ability will not be available for \n     many years.\n       Without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft \n     operation provides, the USA is far too likely to be on a long \n     downhill slide to mediocrity. America must decide if it \n     wishes to remain a leader in space. If it does, we should \n     institute a program which will give us the very best chance \n     of achieving that goal.\n\n  That is all from the letter signed by Neil Armstrong, James Lovell, \nand Eugene Cernan.\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\n  In another letter to President Obama, 27 space experts, including \nastronauts, former NASA Administrators, and program managers make the \nfollowing points:\n\n       America is faced with the near-simultaneous ending of the \n     Shuttle program and your recent budget proposal to cancel the \n     Constellation program. This is wrong for our country for many \n     reasons. We are very concerned about America ceding its hard \n     earned global leadership in space technology to other \n     nations. We are stunned that, in a time of economic crisis, \n     this move will force as many as 30,000 irreplaceable \n     engineers and managers out of the space industry. We see our \n     human exploration program, one of the most inspirational \n     tools to promote science, technology, engineering and math to \n     our young people, being reduced to mediocrity. NASA's human \n     space program has inspired awe and wonder in all ages by \n     pursuing the American tradition of exploring the unknown. We \n     strongly urge you to drop this misguided proposal that forces \n     NASA out of human space operations for the foreseeable \n     future.\n       For those of us who have accepted the risk and dedicated a \n     portion of our lives to the exploration of outer space, this \n     is a terrible decision. . . .\n       America's greatness lies in her people: she will always \n     have men and women willing to ride rockets into the heavens. \n     America's challenge is to match their bravery and acceptance \n     of risk with specific plans and goals worthy of their \n     commitment. NASA must continue at the frontiers of human \n     space exploration in order to develop the technology and set \n     the standards of excellence that will enable commercial space \n     ventures to eventually succeed. Canceling NASA's human space \n     operations, after 50 years of unparalleled achievement, makes \n     that objective impossible.\n       One of the greatest fears of any generation is not leaving \n     things better for the young people of the next. In the area \n     of human space flight, we are about to realize that fear; \n     your NASA budget proposal raises more questions about our \n     future in space than it answers.\n\n  That is all from the letter that was signed by 27 people who have \ndedicated their lives to America's space exploration.\n  In an open letter by astronaut Lee Archambault, who was a pilot of \nAtlantis in 2007 and Discovery in 2009, he says:\n\n       As the Space Shuttle program marches closer to its apparent \n     end, NASA's future is now in jeopardy more than perhaps at \n     any time in history. . . .\n       The Shuttle retirement . . . would yield sole access to the \n     International Space Station to Russia for the currently \n     projected seven year [U.S. human spaceflight] gap. . . .\n       Others argue that commercial alternatives exist to ferry \n     our astronauts to and from the International Space Station. \n     Not quite yet. Our commercial industry is indeed getting \n     closer to attaining the ability to send unmanned spacecraft \n     to the International Space Station as resupply ships. \n     Ultimately, these companies may produce spacecraft safe \n     enough for human travel to low Earth orbit. However, I would \n     not bet the future of the International Space Station on \n     commercial access for crewmembers happening much sooner, if \n     at all, than Orion is capable of flying to the International \n     Space Station in 2017. Thus, this option cannot be considered \n     a viable ``gap filler'' at this point. . . .\n       Not until Orion or a commercial alternative is indeed ready \n     and capable of transporting our astronauts to and from the \n     International Space Station, should we consider retiring the \n     Space Shuttle. . . . The future of NASA and our manned \n     exploration of space must include flying the Shuttle through \n     the gap, whatever that gap may be.\n\n  Finally, this week, in an editorial from the Washington Times \nentitled ``Losing It in Space,'' the editorial from the Washington \nTimes says:\n\n       Pity poor NASA. Rather than reaching toward the stars, \n     America's premier scientific organization has settled its \n     sights on studying shrimp schools beneath the Antarctic ice \n     cap and sticky accelerators on Toyotas. Such is the scope of \n     hope and change in President Obama's universe.\n\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       In his 2011 budget, the president zeroed out NASA's \n     Constellation project, the package of launch and landing \n     vehicles that were to replace the aging space shuttle fleet \n     to carry Americans into space. . . .\n       This is not a cost-cutting move. The agency is budgeted to \n     receive $19 billion next year, and Mr. Obama wants to throw \n     an additional $6 billion at it over [the next] five years. \n     The hitch is he wants to shift its mission toward climate \n     research and airplane design. Anxious to stay relevant, NASA \n     agreed to research the cause of Toyota's sudden-acceleration \n     problem.\n       NASA administrator Charles Bolden said Thursday that \n     federal money is budgeted for fostering the growth of the \n     commercial space industry, including the development of space \n     taxis. But if the results of the president's stimulus are any \n     indication, command economic policy is an inefficient \n     generator of jobs.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       As NASA's wings are clipped, our competitors soar. The U.S. \n     space agency even had to sign a $340 million deal with Russia \n     on April 6 to transport astronauts to the International Space \n     Station through 2014. By then, China intends to conduct an \n     ambitious schedule of flights with its Shenzhou spacecraft. \n     It doesn't take much imagination to envision the day when \n     NASA must pay its Asian competitor large sums for American \n     astronauts to ride into orbit as passengers. Thanks to Mr. \n     Obama, the United States will be dependent on Russia and \n     China for space travel.\n\n  The editorial goes on:\n\n       The space program is a great symbol of the American spirit \n     of achievement. The day this nation cedes the conquest of \n     space to others is the day we admit that we have forfeited \n     our competitive exceptionalism. Earth-centric activities like \n     the study of the Antarctic shrimp ecosystem and automobile \n     anomalies should be left to others. A less-costly NASA should \n     be relieved of extraneous responsibilities and allowed to \n     retain its core mission--one that no other agency can \n     accomplish--the exploration of space.\n       On behalf of all Americans, Floridians should make certain \n     the president gets the message loud and clear when he hosts a \n     conference about the agency's future on Thursday--\n\n  Today--\n\n     in the Sunshine State. Let NASA be NASA.\n\n  That is the editorial from the Washington Times earlier this week.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Augustine Committee, which the \nObama administration asked to review the Nation's human space flight \nactivities, used a subtitle for its report which proposed a set of \noptions for a space program ``worthy of a great nation.'' The items I \nhave submitted for the Record reflect the thoughts and feelings of many \nof those who gave us a space program that was worthy of greatness. I \nbelieve their words represent a challenge that Congress and the \nPresident must meet.\n  In a few hours, President Obama will share the details of his latest \nvision for our Nation's future space program. I still remain hopeful \nthe President will come away from this visit today with a deeper \nunderstanding of what is at stake in our Nation's history of space \nexploration. I renew my offer to work with the President and my \ncongressional colleagues to come up with a plan that makes sense for \nAmerica.\n  The principles necessary to bridge the gap between the President and \nCongress have been set forward by the bipartisan legislation I have \nintroduced and has also been introduced on the House side. All that is \nneeded to align these principles with the President's goals and \nexisting budget realities is a willingness to take the same risks that \nhave been hallmarks of our Nation's commitment to space exploration.\n  Some people would say we have to cut the budget somewhere. Why not \nhere? The answer is, this does not cut the budget. The President's \nproposal does not cut the budget. It increases the budget. It turns the \nmoney over to private companies that are as yet unproven to try to do \nsomething we have already made a $10 billion investment in and cut it \noff. When it is cut off, we will lose all that has been gained. The \nengineering, the science, the research that has gone into the space \nstation will be lost. Those people will go into other areas. We will \nnot be able to recreate it. But yet we have not cut the budget a \npenny. What we have done is squander the capability for America to \ncontinue to be the leader of the world in innovation, in creativity, \nand most certainly in taking the risk to explore the heavens, which has \nproduced so many results in our country.\n\n  It has produced results for national defense capabilities. We are \nusing satellites to put bombs into windows from miles out so we will \nnot have collateral damage and hurt innocent people. We learned that by \nexploring the heavens. We now have Velcro. We have MRIs. We have health \nbenefits that we could never have had without the research we did to go \ninto space.\n  Now we have a $100 billion investment in a space station that will \nspecialize with NIH and other agencies in doing research that cannot be \ndone on the ground because of the microgravity conditions. Yet we are \nstopping the capability, at the end of this year, for Americans to go \ninto space under our own auspices. This is not sound policy for our \ncountry. I am urging the President to listen to people such as Neil \nArmstrong and Eugene Cernan and Jim Lovell and former administrators \nwho have knowledge that is beyond mine or his about what we can do for \nthe future.\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\n  We need to rethink the position that is being announced today and \nremember that America's greatness is dependent on our creativity and \nour entrepreneurial spirit. Stopping midtrack and turning everything \nover to private companies that are in their fledgling stage is not the \nanswer.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, today is April 15, perhaps the most \ndread day of the year for the American taxpayer. At some point today, \nmillions of people will engage in a painful, complicated, and uniquely \nAmerican exercise: filing their Federal tax returns.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, Americans worked well over 3 months \nthis year--over 3 months; from January 1 to April 9--before they had \nearned enough money to pay this year's tax obligations at the Federal, \nState, and local levels. Congress has succeeded in establishing a \npattern of taxing and spending to the point that the average American \nmust work a full 99 days of the year just to pay their taxes.\n  Sadly, while we continue to spend and spend and spend here in our \nNation's capital, the tax burden carried by the average American gets \nheavier and heavier and heavier.\n  On September 12, 2008, in Dover, NH, then-candidate Obama said this:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making \n     less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. \n     Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital \n     gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\n\n  Another interesting quote from then-candidate Obama.\n  According to data released yesterday by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, since January of 2009, President Obama and the congressional \nDemocrats have enacted into law gross tax increases totaling more than \n$670 billion or more than $2,100 for every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States of America. A list of tax increases includes at least 14 \nviolations of the President's pledge not to raise taxes on Americans \nearning less than $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for married \ncouples.\n\n  For example, there is a new tax on individuals who don't purchase \ngovernment-approved health insurance. There is a new tax on employers \nwho fail to fully comply with government health insurance mandates. \nThere is a new 40-percent excise tax on certain high-cost health plans. \nThere is a new ban on the purchase of over-the-counter drugs using \nfunds from FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs. There is an increase from 7.5 percent \nto 10 percent of income, the threshold after which individuals can \ndeduct out-of-pocket medical expenses. There is a new $2,500 annual cap \non FSA contributions. There is a new annual tax on health insurance. \nThere is a new annual tax on brand-name pharmaceuticals. There is a new \n2.3-percent excise tax on certain medical devices. There is a new 10-\npercent tax on indoor UV--ultraviolet--tanning services. There is a new \ntax on insured and self-insured health plans, and it is double the \npenalty for nonqualified health savings accounts distributions. There \nis a tobacco tax increase. There are Federal unemployment surtaxes \nwhich have been extended through 2011, and there are more and more on \nthe list.\n  In addition to the financial burden associated with all of the tax \nincreases heaped upon the American people in the past year, taxpayers \nface the added anxiety of a complicated, antiquated, and oversized Tax \nCode. Let's look at what Americans go through every year in order to \nmeet the April 15 deadline as reported by National Review Online.\n\n       As April 15 approaches like an incoming monsoon, millions \n     of Americans brace for the pain of writing checks to the IRS. \n     Even worse, this annual discomfort begins even earlier, as \n     taxpayers generate a cyclone of documents just to calculate \n     their tax liability. America's excruciatingly complex tax-\n     compliance regime deepens the aggravation of sending hard-\n     earned cash to Washington for virtual incineration by \n     Congress.\n\n  Completing tax reforms required 7.75 billion hours of human labor in \nthe 2008 fiscal year, according to the latest reginfo.gov data. That \nroughly equals 3.7 million people--or everyone in Los Angeles--filling \nout IRS forms for 40 hours every week, all year, without vacations.\n\n       That involves more workers than those at the Fortune 500's \n     five biggest employers--\n\n  The National Taxpayers Union's David Keating concludes in a \nforthcoming report--\n\n     more than everybody at Wal-Mart, UPS, McDonald's, IBM and \n     Citigroup combined.\n\n  Keating also found that:\n\n       Individual taxpayers would devote some 2.3 billion hours \n     grappling with the income tax in 2010 at an equivalent labor \n     cost of $71.4 billion. Add to this the $31.5 billion that \n     individual taxpayers will cough up for tax software, \n     accounting services, photocopying, and other compliance-\n     related expenses. All told, individual taxpayers will spend \n     $103 billion to determine how much more money they must pump \n     into the Beltway.\n       Meanwhile, the IRS Web site now offers 1,909 different \n     documents, which is up from 1,770 last year. These include \n     the riveting form 8833: Treaty-Based Return Position \n     Disclosure Under Section 6114, or 7701(b). And don't miss \n     Form 990-W: Estimated Tax on Unrelated Business Taxable \n     Income for Tax-Exempt Organizations. This year's basic 1040 \n     tax return includes 76 lines and 174 pages of instructions, \n     up from 68 lines and 52 pages in 1985.\n       Last year, the National Taxpayers Union calculated that \n     U.S. corporations spent $159.4 billion on tax compliance, \n     equal to 54 percent of corporate income tax revenue. In 2008, \n     General Electric's tax returns droned on for some 24,000 \n     pages.\n\n  It is abundantly clear we are on a path to fiscal disaster. David \nWalker, the former head of the Government Accountability Office and \ncurrent president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and one \nof the most respected budget experts in the Nation, recently said:\n\n       The financial condition of the United States has \n     deteriorated dramatically in recent years. Importantly, our \n     primary fiscal threat is not today's deficit and debt levels, \n     but the structural deficits and escalating debt burdens that \n     will occur after the economy has recovered, unemployment is \n     down, the ``wars'' are over, and the recent crises have \n     passed. These large and growing structural deficits and the \n     tens of trillions in unfunded federal government promises \n     that drive them serve to threaten the future of our country \n     and our families. We must begin to take steps now to put our \n     Federal financial house in order. In addition, we must \n     achieve some meaningful reforms within the next three years \n     in order to help avoid a ``crisis of confidence'' that could \n     have much worse economic consequences for America, Americans, \n     and the world than the recent housing and financial crisis.\n\n  Today, all over America, there will be people demonstrating at tea \nparties, at gatherings, at organizations, at coffee shops, at \nrestaurants, at places of business at the water cooler. People all over \nAmerica will be talking today about this incredible, complex, \ndifficult, burdensome system we have laid on the American people. It is \nfundamentally unfair and fundamentally incomprehensible to average \ncitizens.\n  Most citizens, after they file their tax returns, will now live in \nsome concern, if not grave concern, that they may have made a mistake \nbecause of this incredibly complex document from the agency we call the \nIRS and the tax bills we have. These American citizens can't be \npositive--even if they have gone to an accountant--that they will not \nbe audited and then subject to further penalties.\n  We need to clean up the Tax Code. We need to stop the spending. We \nneed to restore the confidence of the American people. There is a \nveritable uprising going on out there. It is a peaceful one. It is all \nover America. On a day like today, when they see their taxes have \nincreased by some $670 billion just in the last year, this will fuel \nthe fire that is spreading across America and will culminate this \ncoming November.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2341-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Reid working with \nus. We are going to try to work through the amendments we have left \ntoday and hopefully get this taken care of tonight. Our intent has not \nbeen to slow down but to pay for this.\n  I wish to discuss amendment No. 3726, which has already been called \nup and is pending. I don't believe there is another pending amendment \nat this time; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Amendment No. 3727 is also pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is my amendment as well. Thank you.\n  Yesterday we defeated, by a vote of 51 to 46, actually smart \nfinancial management that would have paid for all the costs for the \nnext 60 days for the unemployment insurance. What we were doing was \nutilizing money that we are already paying interest on that is sitting, \nnot being used, by taking a portion of that to pay for this so that we \ndon't go and borrow another $18.2 billion. The wisdom of the Senate \nsaid, no, we don't want to do that.\n  We are going to have today two other opportunities on a way to \nfinance that. This amendment basically takes the agreed-to tax \nloophole, which we agreed to before we left for the spring work period, \nand adds to that half as much of the financial management money that I \nrecommended we do yesterday and the amendment was defeated. So we have \nabout $9.5 billion worth of tax loophole closures that we have already \nagreed to in this amendment and $20 billion, which will save $10 \nbillion in terms of the way CBO scores it--it is ridiculous the way \nthey score it, but in terms of the way they score it, we have to move \n$20 billion so we can save $10 billion.\n  The point is that we get an option: we can borrow another $18.2 \nbillion to pay for this or we can take money we are already utilizing \nvery inefficiently and pay for it. We are going to choose not to do it \nagain, and we will probably get another 46 or 47 votes. But we are \ngoing to choose to transfer the cost of helping people today to our \ngrandchildren because in my lifetime we are not going to pay back any \nof this money. We are going to be borrowing and paying interest on this \n$18.2 billion over the next 30 years. So the cost really isn't $18.2 \nbillion; it is $18.2 billion times 6 percent, times 106, times 106, \ntimes 106. It will end up costing our kids $60 billion or $70 billion \nbecause we are going to refuse to pay for something we ought to be \ndoing.\n  What we are also not going to do is make tough choices about \npriorities, as every family in this country has to do. We are going to \nrefuse to do that. We are going to say we are going to keep the bad \nhabit, the thing that got us $12.85 trillion in debt, the thing that \ngot us $75 trillion in unfunded liabilities. We are going to continue \nthat process. We are going to continue that process until such time \nthat we can no longer borrow the money. That is what it seems like to \nme. In other words, only until we cannot go to the world markets and \nfinance debt against our children's future are we not going to change \nthe habits in the Senate or in the Congress.\n  Of every dollar we spend this year, 43 cents will be borrowed. What \nare the long-term consequences of that? Very plainly speaking, it is a \nlower standard of living for those who follow us, a marked decrease in \nopportunity, a loss of freedom, an inhibition in entrepreneurial \nspirit, and truly an unwinding of what was the gift that was given to \nus, which was this great opportunity and this great freedom.\n  We don't often make the connection between freedom and debt as a \ngovernment, but we do personally because when we are highly in debt as \nindividuals, our choices start to get limited. If you are in a business \nthat has a high degree of debt, your choices are limited by those who \nloan you the money because they start getting involved in your \ndecisionmaking process.\n  If you really look at our foreign policy today, that is happening to \nus with what we are trying to do in terms of sanctions on Iran. What \nare the two nations that own the most of our debt and are also least \nlikely to agree with us on harsh sanctions for Iran? They are China and \nRussia. They are the No. 1 and No. 2 holders of our bonds. So we are \ngiving up tremendous flexibility and freedom.\n  I put forward that if we cannot find $18.2 billion in our Federal \nGovernment as we run it today, which will spend over $4 trillion this \nyear, none of us need to be here. We need a whole new 100 Senators if \nwe cannot find $18.2 billion. But the institutional stodginess of \nalways doing it the same old way is inhibiting us from creating a \nbright future for our children.\n  I won't detail the exact tax loophole closures we have, but we have \nagreed they can be utilized for this purpose--Senator Baucus, Senator \nReid, Senator McConnell, and myself--and they come to a total of $9.756 \nbillion. To properly manage our money instead of having money sitting \nthat has been appropriated but not obligated--and there is almost $900 \nbillion sitting out there this year in the agency that is not \nutilized--to not utilize that money is foolhardy.\n  My hope is that my colleagues will consider at some point in the \nfuture that we have to start making harder choices.\n  I understand the bias against it. It eliminates somebody's control of \npower. But where should the power be in this country? Should it be in \nthe Senate or should it be in the American people?\n  Do the American people want us to pay for this? Absolutely. Five to \none think anything we are doing new we ought to be paying for. Yet it \nis going to skid through here today, and we are going to add another \n$18.2 billion over the next 60 days that we do not have to, but we are \ngoing to choose specifically to do so.\n  I wish to leave with one last point on this amendment. When we say \nthere is nothing else that we can eliminate in the Federal Government \nto pay for this legislation, what we are saying is all the waste, all \nthe fraud, all the duplication is more important than helping people \nwith unemployment insurance. If it was less important, we would \neliminate it and pay for the unemployment. But by not paying for it, by \nnot making the choice to pay for it, what we have said is we have \nelevated everything else above this as a priority. We refuse to do what \nevery other business, what every other family, what every other \norganization, except the Federal Government, has to do; that is, make \ntough choices.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, the legislature and the Governor right now \nare making tough choices. They are going to cut several hundred million \ndollars from our budget. I promise you, they are going to look at what \nis least important so they can continue to fund what is most important. \nWe will have none of it. We have demonstrated none of it. We lack the \ncharacter and courage to do what is best for the future.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3727\n\n  Now let me talk about amendment No. 3727, which is, again, another \nopportunity, another way to pay for this good thing we want to do. It \nalso has two components.\n  The first component utilizes the agreed-to closure of tax loopholes \nof\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\n$9.7 billion. But then it gives us a real chance to do some real good \nthings to eliminate spending that is low priority.\n  There are 14 spending provisions that I propose eliminating in this \namendment. Many have been endorsed by President Obama and President \nBush and, before him, President Clinton. In the past 3 months, the \nPresident has endorsed five of these offsets, the House passed four of \nthem, and the Senate passed one identical to one section in section \n203.\n  What is the first one? According to the Government Accountability \nOffice, we paid out $1.1 billion to dead farmers. That is over the last \n7-year period. Forty percent of those payments were people who had been \ndead more than 3 years. Most people in America would say: Maybe you \nought to eliminate that. Maybe farmers who have been dead for more than \n3 years should not continue to get payments from the government. It \nwill save us $1.1 billion over 10 years if we hold the Department of \nAgriculture accountable to not continue to make payments to people who \nare not deserving of them.\n  We recently passed a Feingold amendment to the FAA bill that rescinds \nany DOT earmarks that remain 90 percent or more unobligated after 9 \nyears of being appropriated, with the possibility of holding funds one \nmore year for earmarks the agency head believes will be funded within \nthe following 12 months.\n  The only difference between what we passed and this amendment is that \nthis section applies to all agencies, not just the Department of \nTransportation. The Secretary of the Department of Transportation \nendorsed the Feingold amendment.\n  If it works for the Department of Transportation, why would we not do \nthat everywhere on earmarks? It is $500 million in savings immediately. \nWe cannot quantify through the CBO what it will be in the future, but \nit will probably be at least that every year.\n  Another section is the President's request to eliminate a duplicative \nbus grant program. This would repeal the Inner-City Bus Security Grant \nProgram. President Obama recommended this $12 million program be \neliminated because the grant awards are not based on risk and it is \nduplicative of the Public Rail Transit Security Grant Program that is \nalready out there and much less important than any other homeland \nsecurity priorities. It saves us $120 million.\n  In other words, the President does not want it, the Department of \nTransportation does not want it, but somebody who is getting that grant \nsomewhere is going to say: No, we cannot do that, even though there is \na duplicative program already in place to take care of it.\n  Section 235 of this amendment would repeal the Resource Conservation \nDevelopment Program. President Obama recommended this $51 million \nprogram be eliminated because it has outlived its need for Federal \nsupport. It was first begun in 1962 as a temporary program. It was \nintended to build community leadership skills through the establishment \nof RC councils that would access Federal, State, and local funding \nsources. These councils are now up and running--secure funding with \ncontinued operation without any money coming from RC It saves $510 \nmillion. Why would we continue to spend the money? The President, the \nleader of our country, agrees with it. It has been voted on several \ntimes. But it will be voted against today because somebody somewhere is \nstill sucking off this in a way that is not efficient and is not a \npriority for the country.\n  Section 236 would repeal the Brownfields Economic Development \nInitiative. President Obama recommended this program be eliminated \nbecause it is duplicative of a larger, more efficient Federal program, \nand local governments have access to many other public and private \nfunds that address the same purposes.\n  This was designed to assist cities with redevelopment of abandoned, \nidle, and underused industrial and commercial facilities where \nexpansion and redevelopment is burdened by real potential environmental \ncontamination. They eliminated almost all of those, and we have a \nbetter program now taking care of it, which goes back to the habits of \nCongress. We create new programs to address the need of what some may \nthink the present program is not doing rather than change the present \nprogram.\n  Here the administration, as well as the Bush administration, agreed \nwe should eliminate that program. That is $180 million over 10 years.\n  Section 237: This provision would repeal water and wastewater \ntreatment projects administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. \nPresident Obama recommended eliminating these projects. They are \nduplicative, and they are outside the scope of the Corps of Engineers. \nThat is what private civil engineering firms do. They plan, build, and \norganize these events. The Corps of Engineers has stated they do not \nhave the expertise to do these projects, which the Environmental \nProtection Agency normally funds through other grants in the Revolving \nFund Loan Program.\n  Since these programs were first funded in 1992, they have been \nexclusively funded through earmarks. In other words, somebody put \nsomething special in for one city or one place through an earmark. It \nmay not be the highest priority for the country. It may very well just \nbe a priority for the State, but it has been exclusively funded through \nearmarks, special interests, lobby-generated earmarks. It saves $1.29 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Section 238: This provision would repeal the Rail Line Relocation \nProgram. President Obama has twice recommended eliminating this program \nbecause it is not merit based--in other words, if you are well \nconnected, you get it, but if you have a real need and somebody else \nhas a lower need, you are not going to get it--and it duplicates other \nFederal programs that are larger and that are merit based.\n  The grant program is primarily earmarked, again; 75 percent of it \ngets earmarked every year. What happens is the administrators of the \ngrants do not get the grants based on need and merit because a Senator \nhas already said it will go here instead of into a pool of the greatest \nneed. Again, duplicating an existing program that is more efficient, \nthat is based on merit. It is a slush pot of money for earmarks.\n  We will hear lots of complaints about eliminating that program, even \nthough the administration wants to get rid of it as well. Savings: $340 \nmillion.\n  Section 239: Enacting rescissions offered and passed by the House \nleadership. This would rescind $112 million from a Commerce Department \nprogram designed to provide coupons to households to help people buy \nanalog-to-digital converter boxes. This has been used. The program is \nnot going anywhere because everybody has converted. Why should we \ncontinue to put money out to a program that nobody is going to utilize? \nThat money was used for an offset for a summer job youth program \nalready this year but did not come here. Estimated savings: $115 \nmillion.\n  Section 241: Enacting the USDA nutrition rescissions amendments \noffered and passed by the House leadership. This would rescind almost \n$362 million of unobligated reserved stimulus funds for the WIC \nProgram. This offset was selected because it was identified by the \nHouse appropriators and they unanimously voted to use these funds to \noffset another program.\n  It is obviously a low priority. It is a reserve fund. It has not been \nutilized. It is sitting there, and we need to eliminate it rather than \nborrow the money.\n  There are three or four other sections. There is a next-to-final \nsection on Federal real property disposal. We have 21,000 buildings we \nown that we do not use, but yet we do not have a clear way to allow \ngovernment agencies to dispose of property.\n  Last year, on these 21,000 buildings that we cannot get rid of \nbecause we have created a block to do so, we spent $8 billion \nmaintaining them, even though we are not using them. We could sell \nthose, we could give them to the States, we could do a lot of things \nthat would immediately save us $8 billion. But if we sold them and we \nsaved $8 billion a year, over the next 10 years that is $80 billion, \nnot counting anything we might get for selling them. We might have some \ncosts associated with razing some of them.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, 46,745 buildings \nthat are underutilized with a total value of the ones we should be \nselling are worth $83 billion. We are going to hear people\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\nsay: You can't do that; you can't sell those buildings. Why? Why would \nwe borrow money when we could sell buildings we are not using for $83 \nbillion? Almost enough in properties that we do not need and are having \nto maintain to pay for this entire bill. The estimated savings this \nyear alone from starting this would be $4 billion--just from starting \nit--that process would save us at least $4 billion this year.\n  Section 244: What we know is, at least 28 Federal programs, totaling \nover $9 billion, support job training and employment. Eighteen of these \nprograms fall under the Labor Department's jurisdiction, and the agency \nspends $130 million administering its training and employment programs. \nWe have 18 programs rather than 1. We are spending $130 million just to \nmanage them--this is just inside the Department of Labor--rather than \nhave one job training program with one set of administrators and not \nduplicating that administrative cost all the way across the board. \nSavings is probably $100 million to $130 million annually. There is \nwell in excess of $22 billion to $24 billion in this second amendment--\nNo. 3727.\n\n  So the question becomes this, if we continue down this road: Fair to \nour kids, fair to us because the Senate refuses to act responsibly?\n  Oh, I have heard the harsh rhetoric: You don't care about people who \nare unemployed because you think we ought to pay for it. You know, I \nthink there are two sets of people we ought to be caring for. I think \nwe should be caring for the unemployed, making sure they have \nsustenance and their needs fulfilled, as long as they qualify. But I \nthink we should care about those who are going to follow us, those who \nare going to have to pay back this $18.2 billion. Are they not both \nimportant, especially when we know we waste, through fraud and \nduplication, $300 billion a year in the Federal Government? I have just \ncome up with $20 billion of it.\n  We have enough fraud, waste, and duplication in the Federal \nGovernment to pay for this the whole rest of the year, to pay for the \nwar supplemental that is getting ready to come, without borrowing \nanother penny against the backs and future opportunities and freedom of \nour children.\n  I am pretty cynical about whether we are ever going to do that. I \nthink the American people will have to change who is here before we \nwill ever get to the point where we are going to make the hard choices \nthat families have to make. But I think that is a fight worth having to \nprotect our future. I think it is a fight worth having for my grandkids \nand everybody else's grandkids.\n  I was born in 1948, right after the end of the war, and we had the \nhighest debt ratio we have ever had in this country. But because we had \na limited government, what happened was we moved greatly and expanded \nboth growth opportunity, innovation, and wealth through the hard work \nand great character and spirit of the American people, and we handled \nthat. We can do that again. But we can't do it if we don't have the \nleadership that is necessary to do it. We have to start sometime to \nstart paying for what we are doing. We have to start making choices. \nThat is a rare occasion in Washington, but it is one I sense the \nAmerican people are going to start demanding.\n  I have been working at this for 5\\1/2\\ years, or almost 5\\1/2\\ years. \nI have not made much progress other than to make sure the American \npeople are informed of the absolutely atrocious amount of stupidity, \nwaste, and duplication that goes on here. It is time we act. And since \nthe majority controls the outcome, and they will let a few Senators \nvote for these amendments, we will get a high number of them, but not \nenough to make a difference.\n  So the question we ought to be asking is, What is so wrong with \ntrying to pay for what we are doing? Well, we have always done it as an \nemergency. We have always charged it to our kids. Well, we haven't \nalways been $12.8 trillion in debt. We haven't always been to the point \nthat in 2010 we are going to have a debt-to-GDP ratio of 90 percent, \nwhich means we are going to have about $20 trillion in debt, and that \nis going to suppress and depress our economy by 2 percentage points in \nterms of growth. We have never been here before in terms of the risk to \nour economy.\n  I see the chairman of the Finance Committee here, and I will close by \nsaying we are going to start doing this. The question is when. The \nquestion is, Should we be doing it when we are in control or when the \nbankers outside of America are in control--the sovereign nations \noutside who will tell us how we do it and what we can't do, just like \nwhat is happening in Greece today. The leadership in Greece is making \ndecisions not because they want to but because they have to. They are \nnot necessarily nice choices for the people of Greece. That can and \nwill happen to us if we don't change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, yesterday, the Senate tabled the \namendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma by a vote of 51 to 46. \nThat motion to table was successful, and shortly I will move to table \nthe two pending Coburn amendments. The Senate should reject these two \namendments offered by the good Senator from Oklahoma for the same \nreasons the Senate rejected the other amendment yesterday.\n  The Senator makes basically the same argument for each of his three \namendments. They appear to be pretty much a set in terms of amendments. \nThe Senator argues this emergency temporary extension of unemployment \ninsurance benefits is the place to draw the line. It is the place to \ndraw the line on which we need to take a stand to balance the budget.\n  Madam President, I agree with him the Nation should turn to serious \nbudget negotiations. Our high budget deficits are unconscionable and \nmust be addressed. We should balance the budget over the life of the \nbusiness cycle. We should balance the budget as quickly as we possibly \ncan. But we should not balance the budget while in the grips of the \nworst recession since the Great Depression. Doing that would only put \nmore people out of work.\n  I might say, Madam President, that at a hearing held yesterday by the \nFinance Committee, the well-known economist Mark Zandi, who was an \nadviser to Presidential candidate John McCain, volunteered that this is \nnot the time to draw that line in terms of deficit reduction. We should \nnot force people who are unemployed to bear the brunt of offsets at \nthis time. This is not the time to balance the budget, now that we are \nfacing this recession.\n  I might also point out that we should not balance the budget on the \nbacks of unemployed Americans who, through no fault of their own, are \nstruggling to get by in this recession. They need these unemployment \nbenefits, and if we were to adopt the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, first of all, it would be a mistake; and second of all, \nit would have to go to the House, and the House has said they wouldn't \naccept it. So for another couple of days people who deserve \nunemployment insurance benefits would not be getting them.\n  This Congress failed to act some time ago. As a consequence, \nunemployment benefits have expired and people who deserve unemployment \nbenefits are not getting those unemployment benefits. Again, if we were \nto adopt the Coburn amendment and send it to the House and have it come \nback, then it would be a longer period of time that people who are \nwaiting for their benefits would not be getting them.\n  It is just wrong for Congress not to have passed this extension a \nshort while ago. It is wrong, but it is something that happened so we \nare here trying to correct it. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are \nalready going without unemployment insurance benefits because we have \nnot passed this bill. Hundreds of thousands more will go without \nunemployment insurance benefits if we do not pass the bill this week.\n  I will repeat myself: If we were to adopt either of the Coburn \namendments, the House of Representatives has made it clear they will \nsimply send it back to us again without the Coburn language. So \nadopting either of these amendments would simply further delay the \nneeded aid to unemployed Americans struggling to get by. So I urge \nSenators to vote for the motion to table so we can temporarily extend \nthe benefits that so many people justly deserve.\n\n[[Page S2344]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:10 \np.m. today, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Coburn \namendment No. 3726, to be followed by a vote in relation to amendment \nNo. 3727; that prior to the second vote, there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that no amendment be \nin order to either amendment prior to a vote in relation thereto; \nfurther, that the time until 12:10 be equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise today to join so many of my \ncolleagues in urging that we pass critical extensions of Federal \nunemployment benefits, the COBRA health insurance subsidy, flood \ninsurance, and other vital programs that expired at the end of March.\n  I applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who, despite \nopposition from their leadership, have joined us in moving this \nlegislation forward. But despite the progress we seem to be making, \nthese extensions have been held up too frequently for too long, and the \nAmerican people deserve better.\n  Sadly, twice this year individual Senators have blocked extensions of \nFederal unemployment benefits right as the programs were about to \nexpire. Those actions have put struggling families at risk, and already \nthis month over 200,000 Americans have lost their benefits, with \nanother 30,000 losing their benefits every day until we pass an \nextension. What is of particular concern is that we continue to deal \nwith filibusters and delays and obstruction, even though almost every \nMember of this body says they want to extend unemployment. After weeks \nof delay, when extensions finally come up for votes, they have passed \noverwhelmingly.\n\n  We have had three situations now where this has occurred since last \nfall. In November, when the vote on extending unemployment benefits \nfinally came to the floor, that vote was 97 to 1. In December, when the \nextension came to the floor, the vote was 88 to 10. In March, it was 78 \nto 19. Given those majorities, I do not understand how the other side \nof the aisle can justify obstructing votes on these issues in the way \nthey have.\n  As important as this short-term extension is, the Senate must do more \nto address the long-term challenge of joblessness. Of the 15 million \nAmericans who are out of work today, nearly 6 million--so more than 1 \nin 3--have run through the 6 months of benefits provided by their \nStates. In fact, the average period of unemployment currently stands at \na record high of nearly 8 months. We need to pass a longer term \nextension to provide some stability for the millions of people who are \ngoing to need unemployment benefits in the months to come. I applaud \nSenator Baucus who has been working to try to bridge this gap.\n  While some people may think it is no big deal to wait a week or two, \neven short-term expirations have damaging results. When State workforce \nagencies are forced to shut down and restart complicated Federal \nbenefits programs, they experience huge backlogs in their systems that \ndelay getting checks out the door, even to people who are not affected \nby the expiration.\n  Phone lines at call centers are jammed with claimants holding up \nothers from filing for benefits while lines at one-stop centers get \nlonger and longer. In the best of circumstances, individuals who lost \ntheir benefits during this expiration will have to wait weeks before \nthey begin receiving checks again. That is a very long time when you \nare supporting a family on an unemployment check.\n  There is also the uncertainty and the fear that comes when parents \nopen the mail to find a notice that, although their benefits are \nsupposed to last for months to come, this is the last check they are \ngoing to receive. Families cannot afford to make the responsible \nchoices to budget and plan for the future when we cannot guarantee the \nfuture of their benefits and of their safety net.\n  The fact is, when somebody is unemployed, it is an emergency in their \nfamily. We need to treat this situation, extending benefits, as an \nemergency in our Federal programs as well.\n  I want to conclude by sharing a letter I got from one of my \nconstituents named Jo Ellen, who is from Canterbury, NH. She wrote:\n\n       On April 3, my State unemployment benefits maxed out. I am \n     in my 60s, a nurse and psychotherapist who has been out of \n     work since the end of December 2009. Seeking work constantly, \n     I am getting no responses from employers, probably due to my \n     age. I have worked my entire life caring for others. My \n     husband's salary is much lower than what I brought in, but I \n     have never had to rely on others. Unemployment checks are \n     allowing us to at least pay our bills. It plays havoc with \n     one's body and psyche, affecting one's health and causing \n     monumental anxiety when a vote is taken on a monthly basis to \n     extend benefits. It is the never knowing for sure. Those of \n     us who are in this situation are hard-working citizens who \n     have come upon bad times. I cannot believe you won't take \n     care of this horrendous situation immediately.\n\n  Unfortunately, like so many in this Chamber, I have received dozens \nof e-mails and letters and phone calls in the last 2 weeks from Granite \nStaters such as Jo Ellen. Unemployment benefits allow them to take care \nof their families, to fill up their gas tanks so they can go out and \nlook for work. But the obstructionism that has kept us from passing \nmeaningful long-term extension of unemployment benefits is having real \neffects on the financial, physical, and mental health of our \ncommunities. Jo Ellen is right; it is horrendous.\n  I am hopeful we are finally going to see agreement from the other \nside of the aisle that we can move this legislation forward, that we \ncan extend unemployment benefits for those thousands of people who are \nlosing them every single day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes remain.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Six minutes? I yield six minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                              TAX DAY 2010\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Montana. I hope I \ncan do my brief remarks in 6 minutes.\n  It is tax day, I say to the Senator. I hope your taxes are filed.\n  Madam President, as my colleagues and the American people are \nundoubtedly well aware, today is tax day.\n  Across the country, hundreds of millions of people are filing their \nreturns, paying what they owe or calculating the refunds they will \nreceive.\n  Now, even in the best of times, paying taxes is not something most \nAmericans look forward to.\n  In fact, in the wise words of George Washington, ``no taxes can be \ndevised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant.''\n  But even Washington and the other Founding Fathers recognized that \ntaxation is a necessity--and that paying taxes is every American's \npatriotic duty.\n  When they are levied--not by some tyrannical monarch across the \nocean, but by a representative government--taxes are ``the price we pay \nfor a civilized society,'' in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n  It is the only way a modern government can function.\n  We are each asked to contribute a percentage of our income, and in \nreturn we expect our government to provide certain essential benefits:\n  A strong, highly-capable national defense. Adequate roads, bridges, \nand other infrastructure. Quality schools.\n  Emergency responders, so there is someone to answer the phone when \nyou call 911.\n  Basic regulation and consumer protections, so you can buy food and \nother\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\nproducts without fear of getting sick or suffering injury.\n  A safety net to help you get back on your feet in tough economic \ntimes.\n  All of these programs and services are supported by our tax dollars.\n  They serve functions we cannot perform for ourselves--and it is \nappropriate that the government steps in to fulfill this role.\n  That is why my Democratic colleagues and I are fighting Republican \nobstructionism to extend unemployment insurance and other benefits \npeople desperately need.\n  And that is why I am proud to report that, this year, roughly 70 \npercent of Americans will get a tax refund.\n  But even so--my colleagues and I are all painfully aware that, \nespecially in difficult economic times, taxes can be a burden.\n  They can be hard on families that are already stretched to the \nbreaking point--struggling to make ends meet in the face of pay cuts, \nreduced hours, or even unemployment.\n  That is why my Democratic colleagues and I have been working hard to \nease the burden on these families.\n  We have committed ourselves to fight for the interests of working \nAmericans.\n  Our economic recovery remains fragile.\n  The national unemployment rate stands just under 10 percent--and in \nmy home State of Illinois, it exceeds 11 percent.\n  And among minority communities, it is much higher.\n  Roughly 16 percent of African Americans are currently unemployed, \nalong with 12 percent of Hispanics.\n  That is why my Democratic colleagues and I have taken action. We \npassed a sweeping stimulus package that brought us back from the edge \nof economic disaster.\n  While Republicans filibuster unemployment benefits, my colleagues and \nI are fighting to extend them. While they drag their feet on COBRA, we \nare fighting to increase access to this important program.\n  And, while they talk about enacting responsible tax policies, \nDemocrats are actually getting it done. We are working hard to make \nsure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes--but no one is asked \nto contribute more than they can afford.\n  This is an issue that has defined our party for many years, \nespecially under recent Democratic administrations:\n  From the middle-class tax relief provided by President Clinton, to \nthe largest tax cut in American history, which was proposed by \nPresident Obama and ratified by my Democratic colleagues and I just \nlast year--time and again, we have proven our commitment to commonsense \ntax policies.\n  We have passed fair, targeted reforms and responsible tax cuts for \nthose who need it most. We have stood squarely on the side of the \nAmerican people, despite what some of my Republican friends might \nclaim. And in fact, when you examine their record--when you look at the \ntruth behind the Republican rhetoric--it is quite different from what \nmany of them would have you believe.\n  For decades, Republicans have claimed to be both fair and responsible \nwhen it comes to tax policy. But the reality is that they have \nconsistently failed to deliver for the American people.\n  Since the days of President Reagan, Republicans have slashed tax \nrates for corporations and the super-rich, while squeezing the middle \nclass for everything they are worth.\n  This is a country that has always encouraged personal initiative and \nrespected success in the business world. But my friends on the other \nside are making it harder and harder for ordinary folks to attain \nprosperity and realize their dreams. It has never been harder to get \nrich in America--but it has never been easier to stay rich, as long as \nyou can arrange a seven-figure bonus or a golden parachute every time \nthe economy starts to look bad.\n  But for those of us who can't, Republican tax policies have brought \nnothing but headaches.\n  Under President George W. Bush, Republicans passed a massive tax \nbreak for the top 1 percent of wage earners, and did little or nothing \nto help the vast majority of Americans. In fact, this massive tax cut \nwas not even paid for--every penny of it was added directly to the \ndeficit.\n  So let's cut through the political rhetoric and talk about what this \nreally means.\n  My Republican friends exploded the deficit by more than a trillion \ndollars, so they could give tax breaks to the richest of the rich. Now \nthey are expecting us to pay down the deficit using the tax dollars of \nregular, middle class Americans.\n  These are folks who did not benefit from the original tax cut--but \nnow Republicans expect them to foot the bill?\n  Not on my watch.\n  These tax policies are irresponsible. They are outrageous. And the \nAmerican people have had enough. Even now, my friends on the other side \nthink we should spend even more money we don't have, on people who \ndon't need it.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I strongly disagree. We believe \nsignificant tax breaks should be targeted to middle-class Americans who \nneed help, and that is why we passed legislation that accomplished \nexactly that.\n  We believe in responsible tax policy, which asks each and every \nAmerican to pay their fair share without placing an unfair burden on \nany segment of the population.\n  My Republican friends will try to tell you they believe in the same \nvalues. So I would urge the American people to ask them: If that is the \ncase, why did every single one of them vote against the largest tax cut \nin history?\n  The Democratic record is clear. We believe in American prosperity on \nMain Street, not just Wall Street.\n  So I urge my Republican friends to join us in standing up for \nordinary folks, not just Wall Street bankers and the richest of the \nrich.\n  Unfortunately, taxes will always be necessary, and they will never be \npleasant. But if we embrace commonsense tax policies and fight for the \nprinciples that have guided Democrats for many years, we can make these \ntough times just a little bit easier for ordinary folks.\n  Pay your taxes, enjoy America, and let's make sure that everyone pays \ntheir fair share.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Coburn \namendment No. 3726.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to table the Coburn amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, I \nam aware of only one more amendment on this bill. The Senator from \nArizona has an amendment on the value-added tax. I am hopeful the \nSenate can consider that amendment at about 1:30 or so this afternoon \nand perhaps vote on the amendment shortly thereafter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I supported the motions to table the \nthree Coburn amendments to the Continuing Extension Act of 2010.\n  These amendments would delay important legislation to provide a short \nterm extension of unemployment and health care benefits to Americans \nwho have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. This bill is \ncritical to families that have bills to pay and are struggling to put \nfood on the table.\n  Yesterday, I voted to table the Coburn amendment that would have \nrescinded $40 billion in unobligated funding. This amendment did not \nsay where the cuts would be made. As the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee explained, many important homeland security, national \ndefense, and Veterans Administration priorities could have been \ndrastically reduced or eliminated by this amendment. There is no \ntelling how many jobs would have been lost had this amendment been \nadopted.\n  The two Coburn amendments considered today both include funding \noffsets that have already been included in a bill to create jobs and \nreduce taxes. This legislation, which has already passed the Senate and \nis pending in the House of Representatives, would also extend \nunemployment insurance and health care benefits until the end of the \nyear. Adoption of the Coburn amendment today would jeopardize this \ncritical bill.\n  Extending unemployment insurance and health benefits are an emergency \nfor those who have lost their jobs. We should come together as a body \nand pass this bill as soon as possible.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, it is vitally important that we extend \nCOBRA and unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans who \ncontinue to find themselves out of work in the midst of the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression. At the same time, we should \nwork to offset the cost of this additional funding through cuts in \nother Federal spending instead of passing this debt on to future \ngenerations.\n  That is why I opposed efforts to table three amendments by Senator \nCoburn that would have offset the additional spending, and was \ndisappointed those amendments were all defeated. In fact, amendment No. \n3727 even included two provisions from my Control Spending Now Act, a \nproposal to cut the deficit by around $\\1/2\\ trillion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  While I fully supported the majority of the cuts in this amendment, I \ndid have reservations about a few of the proposals. In particular, I \nhad serious concerns about the idea of consolidating all federal job \ntraining programs. While the amendment would not have cut funding to \nany of these important job training programs, many of these job \ntraining programs serve specific populations of Americans, such as \ndislocated workers or young adults, and are carefully tailored to serve \nthe unique needs of those workers. Nonetheless, the principle of taking \nsteps to balance our Nation's checkbook is one I fully support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, last month the Senate Banking \nCommittee reported out a bill to overhaul the financial regulatory \nsystem in this country--a bill that was, unfortunately, designed to \ninvite Republican opposition from committee members, as evidenced by \nthe party-line vote on reporting it out. At that time, I felt some \nsympathy for my Banking Committee colleagues who wanted to play a role \nbut were shut out of the process.\n  As the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, we have a history \nof producing bipartisan legislation. We always respect each other and \nseek to forge compromise in the name of advancing good public policy. \nThe chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Senator Lincoln, is \nalways more interested in getting the policy right than engaging in \npartisan debates. So I held out hope that the Agriculture Committee \ncould consider our contribution to the financial regulatory reform \nlegislation in a more productive environment than my colleagues on the \nBanking Committee faced.\n  The issues involved in financial regulatory reform are complex, very \nimportant, and involve both the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee \nand the Committee on Agriculture. The Agriculture Committee has a \nresponsibility to ensure that the Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission continues to effectively carry out its duties, including any \nnew authorities and responsibilities to regulate derivatives that \nCongress requires.\n  Before we make a big policy change, we need to ask ourselves whether \nthe solutions that have been proposed by the administration and which \nare largely reflected in Banking Committee Chairman Dodd's bill will \neven address the underlying problem. Why take a chance in these \nuncertain times to make legislative and regulatory changes that could \npossibly make things worse, potentially dry up capital, force the cost \nof doing business higher, and ultimately even drive these markets \noverseas?\n\n[[Page S2347]]\n\n  Let me be clear. I am not proposing a do-nothing approach. In fact, I \nbelieve there are a number of ways in which we can more appropriately \nregulate derivatives, and it is Congress' job to write this \nlegislation. We seek input from the administration and our regulatory \nagencies, but it is our responsibility to consider their suggestions, \ntake into consideration the opinions of the American public, and put \nforward that which will become law.\n  Many businesses that use derivatives and swaps to manage risk in \ntheir everyday course of business are concerned that as Congress tries \nto reduce overall systemic risk in our financial markets--including \nregulation of over-the-counter derivatives--Congress might actually \nlimit their risk management options. I am not talking about large \nfinancial institutions. I am not talking about Wall Street financial \ninstitutions. I am talking about businesses that provide goods and \nservices and employment opportunities in each of our States.\n  These companies are concerned about aspects of the administration's \nproposal that would require them to clear standardized transactions and \nexecute their transactions on a trading facility. Many of them have \ntold me this would add considerable costs that would be passed along to \ncustomers or consumers, or perhaps prevent their businesses from using \nswaps and derivatives as a risk management tool altogether.\n  These companies are not antiregulation; they are supportive of \nincreased transparency to the regulator, and they are willing to endure \nany additional burdens that go along with that. Clearly, the recent \npast has taught us that the regulator needs more data in order to view \nand police the entire marketplace, but I am not sure the lesson of the \nrecent market meltdown warrants increased costs to businesses that had \nlittle, if anything, to do with creating this financial crisis.\n  Beyond requiring more transparent market data for the regulators, the \nAgriculture Committee has been exploring how most effectively to apply \ngreater regulation to swap transactions. If Congress is truly \ninterested in addressing the problem as opposed to politicizing a \nsolution, we can no longer ignore the complexities of these markets. We \nmust devote time to understanding these instruments and their \napplications. We must seek to understand the legitimate purposes these \ncomplex instruments serve for large and small businesses in each of our \nStates. Chairman Lincoln and I have devoted a great deal of time to \nunderstanding the over-the-counter derivatives market, its complexities \nand its unique and legitimate utility. That is our job as Senators on \nthe committee of jurisdiction.\n  Unfortunately, our bipartisan negotiations have now been halted due \nto political influence from the administration. It seems that the \nadministration fears a bipartisan deal on any aspect of financial \nreform legislation. As the Banking Committee members moved toward a \nbipartisan deal, the administration launched an attack on such efforts, \nand as Chairman Lincoln and I were about to conclude our negotiations \nand release a bipartisan draft on derivatives reform, the \nadministration stepped in once again to shut down the process.\n  The American public should be aware of what is going on here. \nRepublicans on the committees of jurisdiction have been more than \nwilling to constructively participate in the development of new \nregulations aimed at addressing what went wrong with our financial \nsystem. But the current administration seems more interested in \npolitical gain than in addressing this critical issue. It seems that, \ninstead of seeking meaningful reform both Democrats and Republicans can \nsupport, the administration is more interested in trying to divert \nattention away from health care by changing the subject as we head into \nthe election season.\n  The administration seems intent on going far beyond finding \nbipartisan solutions to address what caused the financial meltdown, and \ninstead is pursuing reckless policies that could be dangerous for our \nmarkets and ultimately our consumers who depend on these markets.\n  However, it seems to me that the American public is well aware of the \nfinancial meltdown, because they live with it every single day. The \nlast thing they want is for Congress to spend months talking about it \nsome more.\n  I want to be very clear. A week ago, I was prepared to support a \nbipartisan compromise on reforming our derivatives market--a compromise \nthat I believe an overwhelming majority of the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats, could have supported and one that would have been \nimplemented quickly to provide much-needed regulation, and then the \nWhite House stepped in and basically said a bill with Republican \nsupport is not worth advancing. They want an issue, not a solution, and \nwant to drag this issue into the November elections in the hope that \nvoters will be focused on reforming the financial system and forget \nabout how angry they are about the passage of the recent health care \nlegislation.\n  I will say one more thing about the regulation of derivatives for \nfolks to keep in mind as this process moves forward, which is that \nRepublicans and Democrats generally agree on the major issues relating \nto derivatives regulation. We all generally agree there needs to be \ngreater transparency, registration, more clearing, and compliance with \na whole host of business conduct and efficient market operation \nregulations. This is important because it is a 180-degree shift away \nfrom current law where today over-the-counter swaps are essentially \nunregulated.\n  Within this general agreement that swaps need to go from unregulated \nto fully regulated, we have some significant areas of disagreement \nabout whether everyone needs to clear in all instances, and how best to \nrequire swaps to be transacted and reported. These disagreements are \nsignificant because they involve real burdens and duties, which will \nresult in real costs to businesses and consumers. As Republicans, we \nwant to make sure our new regulations serve a useful purpose.\n  As we begin the debate on derivatives regulation and Republicans \nstart to get painted--as we have already seen--as the party of Wall \nStreet and against reform, I want folks to know and understand this is \ndisingenuous. Republicans believe there is a need to regulate the \ncurrently unregulated swaps market. We support doing so in a way that \nis responsible and that meets the risk management needs of Main Street.\n  I remain very hopeful that at the end of the day, we can strike a \nbipartisan agreement--not just on the title that refers to swaps and \nderivatives but also on the titles to the financial regulatory reform \nthat deal with regulation, as well as the consumer protection finance \nagency.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                     1st Lt. Robert Wilson Collins\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nselfless commitment of 1LT Robert Collins to the U.S. Army and to our \nNation.\n  While many other young Americans his age were headed back to school \nfrom spring break, LT Collins died April 7, when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his vehicle on the streets of Mosul, \nIraq. He was 24 years old.\n  It is time the American people know a bit more about this young man \nwho sacrificed for his country his life, his family and all his \npotential, giving up all that he had, and all that he was going to be.\n  LT Collins was both a native Georgian, and was based in Georgia.\n  He hailed from the small town of Tyrone in Fayette County, where he \nplayed football under the Friday night lights at Sandy Creek High \nSchool, where he became a standout student that would take him to the \nhalls of West Point, and where he attended Hopewell United Methodist \nChurch with his family on Sunday mornings.\n  Later, he became a member of the local American Legion Post 105 in \nFayetteville, GA.\n  For me, the death of LT Collins is particularly sobering. Robert was \none of my first nominees to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in \nthe fall of 2003, and was offered an appointment there the following \nspring. He graduated from West Point in 2008.\n  He became one of the stalwarts of B Company, 1st Battalion, 64th \nArmor Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division based\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\nat Fort Stewart, GA. He deployed to Iraq in the autumn of 2009.\n  LT Collins served as his platoon's commander. While in Iraq, his unit \nwas charged with improving security and the quality of life for the \npeople of Iraq. He and his men also provided security for the recent, \nsuccessful Iraqi elections. They were dedicated to the goal of a \npeaceful, democratic Iraq, and sought to help its people lead normal, \nsafe lives.\n  It is said that the measure of a man can be taken by what those who \nknew him say when he is gone. Robert's friends have described him as a \nman of great compassion, a leader with an excellent personality and an \ninfectious laugh. They say he was always there for friends and family, \nfor when they needed him. They say they are better people for having \nknown him.\n  LT Collins found his voice in the honor and patriotism of the Army. \nWith both his mother and his father retired Army officers, he was a man \nwith the military in his blood. They both survive him, as does his \ngirlfriend, Nicole, who was Robert's high school sweetheart.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to LT Collins' family and friends, and \nask that my colleagues--and all Georgians--keep them in their prayers \nduring this time of sadness.\n  Robert performed his duty courageously, devotedly, without \nhesitation, without reservations. He was, after all, a soldier.\n  The world may be occupied with other things on this beautiful spring \nday, and the media with other stories.\n  But one of those should surely be the procession that will bring LT \nRobert Collins' body home today, winding its way from Falcon Field in \nPeachtree City through downtown Tyrone. It should also be about the \nAmericans who knew him, who will line the roads to welcome him home a \nfinal time, recalling the words of A.E. Housman:\n\n     Today the road all runners come,\n     Shoulder-high we bring you home,\n     And set you at your threshold down,\n     Townsmen of a stiller town.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Senator Ensign and Senator Scott Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, last week was the second of 2 weeks of the \nEaster recess. A number of us took that opportunity to travel to places \naround the world where our Nation is involved and has great interests. \nSenator Ensign, Senator Scott Brown, Senator Tom Udall, and a \nCongressman from Virginia, the First Congressional District of \nVirginia, named Rob Wittman, and I together visited--it was a 6-day \ntrip--several days in Afghanistan and a couple of days in Pakistan as \nwell, places I suspect the Presiding Officer has been or will be \nvisiting.\n  I led a similar congressional delegation almost 10 months ago to both \ncountries, Afghanistan and Pakistan. I had gone there right after the \nPresident had laid out his strategy for making progress in Afghanistan \nto restore the rule of law, to make sure the Taliban does not come back \ninto power and provide sanctuary for al-Qaida to launch attacks against \nus or any other nation.\n  The President, at the time, my colleagues may recall, said we were \ngoing to do a couple of things. He suggested a year ago that we launch \na military offensive, almost like a military surge on a modest basis, \nand we do the same thing with a civilian offensive. What he called for \na year ago was to commit an additional 10,000 marines, commit 7,000 \nArmy troops, commit 4,000 U.S. trainers to train the Afghan National \nArmy and Afghan national police, and to also send over about 150 \nadditional Black Hawk helicopters. That would be matched by a civilian \nsurge as well to complement the military increase in resources.\n  When we were coming out of Afghanistan, we did a press availability \nwith some reporters back home. One of the reporters asked me the \nquestion: What is our exit strategy in Afghanistan?\n  I replied: I think our exit strategy is to implement well the \nstrategy the President outlined in April of last year. That was the \nadditional marines, additional Army troops, additional trainers, \nadditional Black Hawk helicopters for mobility, and the civilian surge \nto help us with the Afghans; to diversify the economy, the poppy seed \ntrade where they produce enough opium to meet the demands of the world, \nto help them raise the kinds of agricultural commodities they used to \nraise to feed themselves and a lot of the folks in that part of the \nworld.\n  We want to help them diversify their economy with respect to the \nmining and minerals industry. We want to make sure they would have the \nopportunity to exploit the oil and gas reserves, which are about three \ntimes what was envisioned a couple of years ago; at the same time, on \nthe civilian side, work with the Afghans in cleaning up corruption \nwhich is rampant in most levels of Afghanistan and to help them to \nstart developing a governmental institution to provide services, \nactually serve the people of that country. That is what was laid out a \nyear ago.\n  I have been joined by Senator Ensign. I will yield to him in a \nmoment.\n  In my mind, when I returned almost a year ago to America, I thought \nit was a smart strategy. The key is to implement it well. We met with \nthe Afghanis last week, and we had an opportunity to see what we are \ndoing well and not doing well. I think what is key in almost every \nendeavor I have been part of is leadership.\n  We spent time with General McChrystal, our top military leader, and \nAmbassador Eikenberry, who used to be a four-star general and is now \nAmbassador to Afghanistan. We met with President Karzai and the \ncivilian and military leadership of Afghanistan, as well as the \ncivilian leadership of the United States.\n  I came home not hopeless, not euphoric, but more hopeful than not \nthat we have the right strategy, that we are beginning to implement it \nwell. We have some 40 other nations involved with us in this endeavor. \nWe are committing the resources to make this strategy potentially \nsuccessful.\n  That is my take on it. I yield at this time to the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Ensign. I have already asked unanimous consent to engage in \na colloquy. I will not ask that again. This is what it is about. It is \nnot a monologue for me. I very much enjoyed the time I spent on the \nroad with my colleagues, especially my colleague from Nevada. I was \nhappy to be his partner and lead the delegation.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Carper. I appreciate him \nand his staff. Wendy was absolutely terrific in setting up this trip \nand all the various briefings and places where we traveled in both \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. I thought we had a great team put together \namong the Senator from Delaware, myself, Senator Brown, Senator Udall, \nand the Congressman from the First District of Virginia, Congressman \nWittman, whom I did not know before the trip but with whom I was very \nimpressed.\n  My general impression of what is going on in Afghanistan--I was \ninitially very skeptical when I went over there. I thought we got an \nhonest assessment. I thought they talked about the positives, the \nnegatives, and the challenges ahead.\n  I agree with the Senator from Delaware. I was very impressed with \nboth the civilian and military leadership we have in the country. I was \nimpressed with the plan they put in place. The key to the plan, which \nis very similar to what we had in Iraq, is we have to clear, basically \nprovide security. Then we have to hold that security, not just go and \nclear and then leave. We have to clear and then hold it. Then we have \nto build. We have to give people opportunities, economic opportunities, \nand some reason to hope. Once we build, then we need to transfer the \nauthority to, in this case, the Afghan people, the Afghan Government.\n  The first part is a lot of our responsibility, although a lot of the \nclearing and holding is in combination with the Afghan Army. As a \nmatter of fact, I don't think a lot of Americans realize\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\nthere have been more Afghan soldiers killed in Afghanistan than \nAmerican soldiers or coalition soldiers. But the challenge is going to \nbe in the transfer. We saw that the Afghan Army is being built up and \ntrained fairly well.\n  Two big areas of concern are, one, the Afghan police. It has taken a \nlot longer to train them than we hoped. We experienced some of the same \nproblems in Iraq. The Afghan police are not even close to being fully \ntrained. There is a lot of corruption in the police. There are a lot of \nchallenges to overcome there, but they are challenges that, given the \nright plan, given the right amount of time and resources, can be \novercome.\n  Another huge problem in Afghanistan is development of infrastructure. \nI have heard Afghanistan described as an 18th century or 19th century \ncountry. However, one can really describe it as a second century \ncountry. There are many parts of it where people are living in mud \nstructures with no electricity, with no running water, with none of the \nmodern conveniences or technologies we think about.\n  In those areas, and the vast majority of the country, there is no \ngovernmental infrastructure. There is no rule of law. There is nothing \nto build on there. It literally has to be built from the ground up. \nThere is neither a lot of experience not the necessary resources in \nAfghanistan to do that. That may be the major problem going forward in \nthat transfer that I think the members of the delegation learned while \nwe were over there. It is also why we questioned, when we came back, if \nwe have the right strategy with the best chance of being successful. \nNone of us know whether our strategy is actually going to be successful \nin the future. But it is worth attempting. It is in our vital national \ninterest to do it. Then we have to pray it is successful in the future.\n  I think all of us came away thinking the American part of it, the \ninternational coalition part of it, will be successful. What we do not \nknow will be successful is the transfer of authority to the Afghan \ngovernment, the part at the end.\n  Is that the same impression the Senator from Delaware had?\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if I may respond, the Senator summed it up \nvery nicely. One of the things Senator Ensign and I and our colleagues \ndiscussed with President Karzai and with the military leadership of \nthat country and the civilian leadership of Afghanistan and with our \nown folks over there is the nature of the economy of Afghanistan. We \nheard a lot about corruption and heard a fair amount about their \nagricultural economy, which is largely dependent on raising poppies \nwhich feed the opium trade that provides a lot of money selling heroin \naround the world and to the Taliban and other insurgent groups.\n  The question on which Senator Ensign and I have gone back and forth \nwith our folks over there and the Afghan leaders is, What is likely to \nbe the most successful approach for us to take to eventually stop the \naddiction of the Afghan farmers to raising poppies? It was not that \nlong ago that they had the ability to raise plenty of wheat and cotton \nand all sorts of fruits and nuts.\n  They make a fair amount of money on poppies. One problem is it is an \nillicit trade. It is an illicit and bogus way on which to base their \neconomy. It subverts the government and corrupts the whole system over \nthere. This is an important issue going forward. How do we help wean \nthe farmers off an illicit agricultural economy to do something they \nused to do?\n  We sort of agree we need a tough love approach. We have to encourage \nand provide opportunities--seeds, fertilizer, advice, tactical \nassistance--on how to raise the kinds of products they used to raise.\n  Someone told us in one of our meetings that the people of India, not \nthat far away from Afghanistan, would consume every pomegranate the \nfolks in Afghanistan would raise. There are plenty of big markets and \nlots of hungry people to buy those commodities. The question is: Do we \ngo out and eradicate all the poppies in the fields like, next week, or \ndo we allow the poppies to be harvested but make it clear that is it? \nThen, next year we will help folks plant a different kind of crop, but \nwe are not going to stand by next year and allow them to harvest \npoppies.\n\n  It is an issue that I think can be resolved, but I think it is a \ntough love approach. It is important, if we want to get rid of \ncorruption in the government, in the country, we cannot avoid the \nwidespread effect on it from poppies.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. CARPER. Yes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. First of all, we were flying over the Kandahar Province \nin the southern part of Afghanistan in these Black Hawk helicopters, \nvisiting a few of the forward operating bases--one for training, the \nother one for trying to provide stability for the region. As we were \nflying over, it was surprising how many agricultural fields there were \nin that part of the country. It was a very fertile area, and it seemed \nto me that 80 to 90 percent of the crops I saw from the air were \npoppies. This is just an estimate, but it was pretty easy to see them \nbecause the poppies were in bloom. They were everywhere, including \nright next to our bases, because we have stopped the eradication \nprogram. There has been a change in policy. This change was the one \nelement of policy which I disagreed with over there. I think we do need \nto reevaluate, as the Senator from Delaware talked about, this tough \nlove approach. I do think that is the way to go because you do have to \nhave the positive incentives in there to grow other crops. But I don't \nbelieve you can do that without the negative consequences if farmers do \ndecide to grow the poppies. In other words, if the positives are not \nstrong enough, they may decide they are going to grow poppies anyway.\n  A couple problems with the poppies is, one, the Taliban wants to grow \nthem because it helps fund the Taliban; and two, poppies are a very \ndrought-resistant crop and Afghanistan has been in a drought for about \n8 years. So growing poppies is a stable source of income for the Afghan \nfarmers.\n  The other thing the Senator from Delaware mentioned is that other \ncountries in the area would love to have their produce. The problem is \ngetting that produce to market. They do not have anywhere to store the \nproduce. They have a guaranteed market there for the poppies with the \ntransportation. The Taliban is not going to attack their transport, if \nthat is what they are growing. So this is very much a difficult \nsituation, but it isn't a situation that is, I believe, without a \nsolution. I believe we can come to a solution on this, and that is why \nI think we need to reevaluate what we are doing in Afghanistan by not \nincluding eradication as part of the process. Because when we talk \nabout the police--and I see Senator Brown has joined us, one of our \ncolleagues who was on the trip--there is corruption in the police \nforce. Well, in every country in the world that has a serious drug \nproblem, it leads to corruption in the police, which leads to \ncorruption of any kind of judicial system, officials in the government \nand on and on and on.\n  I would be curious to hear from my colleague, our newest Senator, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, who was a real joy to have with us on the \ntrip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. First of all, I wish to begin by thanking \nour leader on the trip, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper. It was a \njoy to be on a trip with people who had different experiences, \ndifferent military experiences, and take that experience and work it \ntogether in such a short period of time to form such a powerful team. \nIf this is how every CODEL is going to be, I am excited to be a part of \nthat experience.\n  This trip enabled me--now that the campaign is over--to learn and \nmake sure that everything we were talking about then was accurate. If \nthat is so, how do we take that and use it in a productive way to give \nthe troops the tools they need to be, No. 1, safe; and No. 2, to finish \nthe job. My analysis is, General McChrystal's effort to do just that--\nthe new combined effort working with the Afghan police and national \narmy, as well as local tribal leaders and our coalition forces in the \nmilitary--has enabled us, I think, in all sincerity, to have the best \nchance to do just that; to keep our troops safe and ultimately to \nfinish the job.\n  What is finishing the job? Finishing the job, to me, and to General\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\nMcChrystal and others, is to provide that safety, that security net \naround the citizenry in Afghanistan, to protect them and to allow them \nto flourish and start to grow and weed out the corruption and not rely \nso much on the poppy fields and ensure that they can bring their \nproduce to market or keep their government safe and secure so they can \nstart to be more self-sufficient. Working with our coalition partners, \nPresident Karzai, and others, I think gives us the best chance of \nsuccess.\n  I wish to thank the team members for their patience. It was a long \nhaul, long flights--12- to 15-hour flights. We weren't partying there, \nI can assure you. We were there, up at the crack of dawn and going to \nbed late at night, working with the Ambassadors, the Presidents, the \nForeign Ministers of every country we visited. It made me feel, first \nof all, proud to be an American and thankful that I am an American. In \nrecognizing the true challenges other parts of the world face--and I \nknow the leader of our team will talk briefly about the refugee camp we \nsaw in Pakistan with 150,000 people and kids from 3 years old up to 18 \nyears old in school, with the smiles on their faces, and seeing the \nhope and the excitement that they were learning for the first time in \ntheir lives--it made all of us look at each other and say: Geez, can we \ncome back in August and help out? Because it was so intellectually \nrewarding, and it made me, and I know other Members, so excited to be \nthere and to see the hope.\n  What does education do in countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan? \nIt gives them the tools to make sure they know how to deal with the \nTaliban and other entities coming in to try to influence their lives. \nIt gives them the knowledge to be able to say no. It is almost like the \nDARE program, the drug program we have in Massachusetts, where it is \nthe resistance education program where they give you the tools to not \nsuccumb to peer pressure and take drugs and make bad choices. When I \nleft that refugee camp, I felt there was hope there.\n  I will defer to our leader to continue with this conversation.\n  Mr. CARPER. I see Senator McCain is on the floor, and if I am reading \nhis body language right, it looks like he wants to say something about \nour visit to Afghanistan and to Pakistan last week. I don't know if he \nwants to be a part of this colloquy or if he wants us to get out of his \nway so he can talk about something else, but I yield to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just wanted to congratulate my three \ncolleagues for taking that trip. It is of the utmost importance that my \ncolleagues are able to see the situation on the ground, meet with our \nleaders, meet with the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and meet \nwith the men and women who are serving in the military.\n  One thing I know is, the word spreads. The word spreads throughout \nthe men and women of our military that Senators took time from their \nschedules, from our recess, to be with the men and women who are \nserving. There is no better way to express our appreciation, but also \nit is very much noticed by the men and women serving over there.\n  I know my colleagues come back better informed. Also, as the \nsituation in Afghanistan continues to evolve, we will be much more \nqualified and informed as we engage in what is appropriate for the \nSenate to engage in--discussion and debate over our strategy and our \ngoals in Afghanistan.\n  So I thank my colleagues for going. I thank them for their service. \nThe Senator from Delaware has proven that even a former Navy person can \nunderstand the issues that confront the Army and the Marine Corps.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if I can reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Senator McCain, along with Senator Brown, spent a lot of \ntime in uniform. I know our Senators felt a special pride in our troops \nwho are serving over there. They are serving with troops from 40 other \ncountries, and not all countries send troops. Countries such as Japan \nsent money. They are quadrupling their salaries so they can hire some \ndecent people and keep them. But in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarine personnel we met with, morale was good. They understood their \nmission, they understood the importance of their mission, and they were \nproud to be serving. We are very proud to support them.\n  Before our time expires entirely, I will yield back to Senators \nEnsign and Brown for any closing comments they want to make, and then I \nthink Senator McCain wants to talk a little.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I have a couple of other observations and comments to \nmake. I expressed this to General McChrystal and Ambassador Eikenberry \nwhen we had one of our briefings regarding the various aspects of the \ninternational coalition including USAID, the State Department, the \nmilitary, all the members that make up what are called PRTs, provincial \nreconstruction teams. In that meeting, I asked the question about how \nmuch money we were spending now. It was very clearly a concern, when we \nwere talking about the economy of Afghanistan and whether it would be \nable to support this large army and large police force we are putting \ninto place. So I asked the question: How much money are we spending \nnow, how much money is going to be needed in the future, and for how \nlong is that money going to be needed?\n  President Obama has talked about us starting to withdraw troops about \nthe middle of 2011. As we are to start drawing down some troops there \naround July 2011, it became obvious to me that we are going to have a \ncommitment there for some time, and I think it is important for us to \nbe honest with the American people, first of all, about how much it is \ngoing to cost. I think a conservative estimate, for many years to come, \nis that we are going to be talking about spending at least $10 billion \na year--around $6 billion to support their army and their police force \nand another $4 billion as far as helping build their economy.\n  The Afghan economy can eventually take over if their natural \nresources come to be what the U.S. Geological Service says some of \ntheir minerals are worth; what they think the oil and gas reserves \npotentially are. China is coming in to build probably the largest \ncopper mine in the world there, but it is going to take years to \ndevelop these resources. So that is one of the things I came back with. \nWe need to be a little more open with the American people that we are \ngoing to be there for a while and it is going to cost us quite a bit of \nmoney. We should be able to say to our constituents back home: Here is \nhow much we are going to be spending and here is why it is in our vital \nnational interest.\n  The other thing we haven't taken a lot of time to talk about is \nPakistan. First of all, we have some great leaders over there, as well \nas Ambassador Patterson and Vice Admiral LeFever. They are the military \nleaders over there, and their teams are impressive as well.\n  As Senator Brown mentioned, we visited a refugee camp, and we also \nvisited a base that we built over there for Pakistanis to train. The \nPakistanis who train there are called the frontier scouts and they work \nin the tribal areas to help fight the Taliban. It is in our interest to \nbe able to do that.\n  I was very encouraged by what I saw in Pakistan, by the new leaders \nthere giving up some of their power voluntarily, the new President, and \nseeing Pakistan as much more of an ally to the United States in the \nfuture. In general, I thought that part of our trip to Pakistan was \nvery much worthwhile.\n  I would conclude my remarks with that, and turn it over to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, in conclusion, I concur \nwith all the comments made by the Senators before me. One of the things \nI found most interesting--and I have a hearing in about an hour on the \nAfghan police and the contracting associated with our supporting the \npolice force in Afghanistan--is that I was able to ask very direct \nquestions to our Ambassadors and to the military and civilian leaders \nwho helped me better understand where the $6 billion we have spent to \nuplift the Afghan police force has gone.\n  Another reason I went there was self-serving in that it gave me the \ntools to make sure I can better inquire to find out on behalf of the \nAmerican people where their money is going, how it is\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\nbeing spent, and whether we can find a way to spend it better.\n  In addition to that, one of the things that was glaring to me is that \neven in Pakistan there is an illiteracy problem that needs to be \naddressed. I think that illiteracy problem, if not addressed, will be \nfertile ground for the Taliban to come in and try to influence the \nyouth of that country. They have a lot of hope, yet they have some very \nserious problems.\n  Once again, I thank our leader. I have great respect for him, someone \nI didn't know before we went. I encourage others to do that and have \nthat bipartisan feel, as I tried to do often. We saw Senator Baucus \nover there with his team kind of shadowing us, making sure we were \nactually working. It was a lot of fun to see them over there as well, \neven with their travel problems. But I am looking forward to doing it \nagain.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to speak.\n  Mr. CARPER. Let me just close it down for our side. I say to Senator \nBrown, it was a great opportunity to travel with him and get to know \nhim and to learn. I thank him so much for being a great part of our \nteam. I also thank Wendy Anderson, who helped put that together, and \nArmy MAJ Jen McDonough.\n  We have been joined on the floor by Congressman Robert Wittman from \nthe First District of Virginia. I say, with him sitting there, how \nimpressed we were with him and how delighted we were to serve with him.\n  The road ahead in Afghanistan won't be easy. It is an important road \nfor us to travel. It is not one we have to travel by ourselves. A lot \nof other nations are involved in this with their time, their treasure, \nand their people.\n  We need the best efforts from the leadership of Afghanistan. We know \nhe is under a lot of pressure. We made it very clear to President \nKarzai that we have no intention of being an occupying force. We have \nevery intention of bringing our folks home within a reasonable period \nof time. This is not an open-ended commitment. My hope is it will not \nrun up the cash register as much as Senator Ensign has suggested, but \nnevertheless it is an important use of our resources. This is the \nbattle, in my judgment, this is the war we should have been fighting \nall along.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3724, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3721\n\n (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Value Added Tax \n is a massive tax increase that will cripple families on fixed income \nand only further push back Americas's economic recovery and the Senate \n                       opposes a Value Added Tax)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3724 and that it be modified with the changes at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment as modified.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3724, as modified:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A VALUE ADDED TAX.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Value Added Tax is a \n     massive tax increase that will cripple families on fixed \n     income and only further push back America's economic recovery \n     and the Senate opposes a Value Added Tax.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as my colleagues well know--today is tax \nday. Earlier today I came to the floor to speak about the enormous \nburden Americans bear every year in order to comply with today's \ndeadline for filing their Federal tax returns. We have a complex, \nantiquated and oversized Tax Code that wreaks havoc on American \ntaxpayers and, according to the National Taxpayers Union, will require \nthem to spend $103 billion this year in compliance-related expenses. \nWhen we have a 2,000-plus page Tax Code which requires over $100 \nbillion in compliance costs--something is clearly wrong. So what is the \nanswer? Amazingly--instead of offering proposals to reform the system \nand ease the burden on our citizens--some are suggesting creative ways \nto impose new taxes on Americans and even further complicate our Tax \nCode.\n  According to this morning's Wall Street Journal, the Obama \nadministration and its allies have floated the idea of imposing value \nadded tax--a sales tax imposed on each stage of production, on each \nfirm's value added with the actual cost ultimately hidden from the end \nuser with the final bill being paid by the consumer at the cash \nregister. This type of tax has been widely imposed throughout Europe. \nThis morning, in an editorial titled ``Europe's VAT Lessons,'' the Wall \nStreet Journal stated:\n\n       As Americans rush to complete their annual tax returns \n     today, there is still some consolation in knowing that it \n     could be worse: Like Europeans, we could pay both income \n     taxes and a value-added tax, or VAT. And maybe we soon will. \n     Paul Volcker, Nancy Pelosi, John Podesta and other allies of \n     the Obama Administration have already floated the idea of an \n     American VAT, so we thought you might like to know how it has \n     worked in Europe.\n       VATs were sold in Europe as a way to tax consumption, which \n     in principle does less economic harm than taxing income, \n     savings or investment. This sounds good, but in practice the \n     VAT has rarely replaced the income tax, or even resulted in a \n     lower income-tax rate. The top individual income tax rate \n     remains very high in Europe despite the VAT, with an average \n     on the continent of about 46%. . . .\n       In the U.S., VAT proponents aren't calling for a repeal of \n     the 16th Amendment that allowed the income tax--and, in fact, \n     they want income tax rates to rise. The White House has \n     promised to let the top individual rate increase in January \n     to 39.6% from 35% as the Bush tax cuts expire, while the \n     dividend rate will go to 39.6% from 15% and the capital gains \n     rate to 20% next year and 23.8% in 2013 under the health \n     bill, from 15% today. Even with these higher rates, or \n     because of them, revenues won't come close to paying for the \n     Obama Administration's new spending--which is why it is also \n     eyeing a VAT.\n       Thanks to the recession and the stimulus, U.S. federal debt \n     held by the public has now reached about 63% of GDP and is \n     headed higher, but the OECD forecasts that the 30 wealthiest \n     nations will see debt burdens ``exceed 100% of gross domestic \n     product in 2011.'' Debt levels in France, Germany, Spain and \n     Italy are expected to have increased by 30 percentage points \n     of GDP from 2008 to 2011. Greece has a VAT rate of 21%, but \n     its debt as a share of GDP is 113%.\n       The very efficiency of the VAT means that it throws off \n     huge amounts of revenue that politicians eagerly spend. The \n     VAT thus becomes an engine of even greater public spending. \n     In Europe, average government spending was about 30.2% of GDP \n     when VATs began to spread in the late 1960s. Today, those \n     governments are more than 50% larger, with spending of 47.1% \n     of GDP on average. By contrast, U.S. government spending \n     (federal and state) rose to 35.3% from 28.3% as a share of \n     GDP in the same period.\n       It is precisely this revenue-generating ability that makes \n     the VAT so appealing to liberal intellectuals and \n     politicians. Even liberals understand that at some point high \n     income tax rates stop yielding much more revenue as the rich \n     change their behavior or exploit loopholes. The middle-class \n     is where the real money is, and the only way to get more of \n     it with the least political pain is through a broad-based \n     consumption tax such as a VAT.\n       And one more point: In Europe, this heavier spending and \n     tax burden has also meant lower levels of income growth and \n     job creation. From 1982 to 2007, the U.S. created 45 million \n     new jobs, compared to fewer than 10 million in Europe, and \n     U.S. economic growth was more than one-third faster over the \n     last two decades, according to the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics.\n       In 2008, the average resident of West Virginia, one of the \n     poorest American states, had an income $2,000 a year higher \n     than the average resident of the European Union, according to \n     economist Mark Perry of the University of Michigan, Flint. \n     The price of a much higher tax burden to finance a cradle-to-\n     grave entitlement state in Europe has been a lower standard \n     of living. VAT supporters should explain why the same won't \n     be true in America.\n       One trait of European VATs is that while their rates often \n     start low, they rarely stay that way. Of the 10 major OECD \n     nations with VATs or national sales taxes, only Canada has \n     lowered its rate. Denmark has gone to 25% from 9%, Germany to \n     19% from 10%, and Italy to 20% from 12%. The nonpartisan Tax \n     Foundation recently calculated that to balance the U.S. \n     federal budget with a VAT would require a rate of at least \n     18%.\n       Proponents also argue that a VAT would result in less \n     federal government borrowing. But that, too, has rarely been \n     true in Europe. From the 1980s through 2005, deficits were by \n     and large higher in Europe than in the U.S. By 2005, debt \n     averaged 50% of GDP in Europe, according to OECD data, \n     compared to under 40% in the U.S.\n\n  While there is no official proposal to impose the VAT--I think it is \nnecessary for my colleagues to be on record on this onerous new tax. \nTherefore, I am offering this very simple sense of the Senate amendment \nwhich\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\ncalls the VAT exactly what it is--a massive tax increase that will \ncripple families on fixed incomes and only further push back America's \neconomic recovery.\n  Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute recently \nwrote:\n\n       The VAT--on top of all the other taxes Washington imposes--\n     is a terrible idea. Imposing it would pretty well finish the \n     transformation of our country into a European-style slow-\n     growth nation. The right way to close Uncle Sam's gaping \n     deficits is to reverse the continued explosion of federal \n     spending.\n       The real-world evidence shows that VATs are strongly linked \n     with both higher overall tax burdens and more government \n     spending. In 1965, before the VAT swept across Europe, the \n     average tax burden for advanced European economies (the EU-\n     15) was 27.7 percent of economic output, versus 24.7 percent \n     of GDP in the United States.\n       Taxes on income and profits consumed 8.8 percent of GDP in \n     Europe in 1965--below the US level of 11.9 percent. By 2006, \n     the European burden had climbed to 13.8 percent of GDP, \n     slightly higher than the 13.5 percent US figure. (The same \n     trend holds for corporate-tax data.)\n       Today's income-tax system is a nightmarish combination of \n     class warfare and corrupt loopholes. But adding a VAT solves \n     none of those problems, it merely gives politicians more \n     money to spend and a chance to auction off a new set of tax \n     breaks to interest groups. That's good for Washington, but \n     bad for America.\n\n  J.D. Foster, a senior economics fellow with the Heritage Foundation, \nwrote:\n\n       It comes as no surprise that attention is now turning \n     toward the VAT as the liberal solution for unsustainable \n     deficits that threaten the stability and very future of our \n     economy. Having hiked spending dramatically and then doubling \n     down with his Obamacare, the nation now faces unprecedented \n     near-term debts as the clock ticks toward the long-recognized \n     entitlements time bomb. If there's one thing conservatives \n     and liberals agree on completely, it's that deficits of this \n     magnitude cannot persist. Credit markets won't allow it. Some \n     fundamental course correction is certain. The massive amount \n     of revenue a VAT could raise is the only acceptable solution \n     left for most liberals since they steadfastly refuse to \n     reverse course on their recently enacted spending binge.\n       Why is the VAT the darling of the left? Because it can \n     raise vast new revenues without the taxpayers being really \n     sure who took their money. Consumers would pay the tax when \n     they purchase goods and services. Buy a car, pay the tax. Buy \n     groceries, pay the tax. Buy chemotherapy drugs, pay the tax. \n     In this way, taxpayers would only be aware of a bit of their \n     tax bite with each purchase. And unless the tax is printed on \n     the receipt and they look for it, consumers would have no \n     idea how much tax they paid on a particular transaction.\n       Today's deficits, and tomorrow's, result from too much \n     spending, not too little revenue. Reverse the massive Obama \n     spending surge (and the Bush surge before that) and the \n     deficits would quickly fall to sustainable levels. Instead, \n     Paul Volcker has done the nation a great service in telling \n     us what Obama and his congressional allies are planning. If \n     that is not the case, if the President and the democratic \n     leadership in Congress really are not planning a VAT attack, \n     let them declare their opposition to a VAT plainly. Every \n     current and would-be member of Congress should say where they \n     stand on the VAT. And unless they favor a huge government, \n     much higher taxes, and less transparency from government, \n     they will stand against it.\n\n  I agree with Mr. Foster--every current Member of Congress should say \nwhere they stand on the VAT. With this amendment I am giving Members of \nthe Senate that opportunity.\n  Several of my colleagues have explained that they would support a VAT \nif it was replacing the Federal income tax or the current corporate tax \nstructure. I say to those colleagues that I have not seen a shred of \nevidence from the administration or anyone in Congress that the VAT \nwould be used as a replacement tax. I am supremely confident that--if \nand when it is offered--the VAT will be an additional tax on the \nAmerican people. And that is the last thing the American people need \nright now. The solution to America's worsening government fiscal \noutlook is not to increase taxes--it is to cut spending. Congress could \nget America's economy back on track by focusing on tax relief and \nsimplification, liability reform, regulatory reform, health care \nsecurity, and energy independence--not on imposing a new, massive tax \nincrease that will cripple middle- and low-income families and delay \nAmerica's economic recovery.\n  The solution to America's worsening government fiscal outlook is not \nto increase taxes, it is to cut spending. Congress could get America's \neconomy back on track by focusing on tax relief and simplification, \nliability reform, regulatory reform, health care security and energy \nindependence, not on imposing a new massive tax increase that will \ncripple middle- and low-income families and delay America's economic \nrecovery.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The McCain amendment is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Financial Reform\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I come to the floor now, and I came to the \nfloor yesterday, in response to the campaign by those both outside and, \napparently, inside this Chamber who are literally trying to kill the \nWall Street reform legislation, and to tie that reform to that bill to \nbailouts.\n  I pointed out in those discussions yesterday that these arguments are \nstraight out of Wall Street's playbook, written by political strategist \nFrank Luntz. As we all know, I submitted his political strategy that he \noffered months or weeks before even consideration of the bill, \noutlining politically how to defeat this legislation. So even before \nthere was a bill, Mr. Luntz had a strategy on how to kill it. You \nmerely have to look at the date of his memo to know what I am talking \nabout.\n  Yesterday we heard a strategy, basically written by him, to avoid any \naccountability for the mess they have made of our economy. And if it \nseems strange to you, Mr. President, and others, that the minority \nleader is choosing to attack our bill for being too kind to Wall Street \nby reciting talking points written on behalf of Wall Street, well, you \nare not alone, obviously, if that seems strange.\n  Even stranger, of course, was the leader's insistence that this \nlegislation is too partisan. Perhaps he has not spoken to my colleague \nand friend from Alabama, the former chairman of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Shelby, with whom I have spent months working on building \nconsensus, who said himself months ago that we had achieved a consensus \non as much as 70 percent of the bill that will be presented to this \nbody in a matter of days.\n  Perhaps the minority leader had not spoken to any of the Republicans \non the Banking Committee, who joined with Democrats in bipartisan \nworking groups that I asked to be formed back months ago, each of which \nof those groups achieved real and meaningful progress that is reflected \nin the bill that will be on the floor in a matter of days; not just \namendments that will be offered, it is in the text of the bill of those \nworking groups, Democrats and Republicans on the Banking Committee.\n  Perhaps the Republican leader had forgotten that as far back as \nFebruary of 2009, I insisted that meetings with the Treasury \nDepartment, as they were still crafting their plan for reforming Wall \nStreet, include Republican staff so Republican ideas would be in the \nproposal from the very beginning.\n  Well, this morning the McClatchy newspapers looked into the minority \nleader's accusations made in this Chamber yesterday morning, and \nfrankly found them lacking. Please indulge me for a moment. I am \nreading from this morning's newspaper. Let me quote, if I can:\n\n       McConnell accused Dodd of drafting partisan legislation, \n     even though the banking committee Chairman has worked roughly \n     half a year with key Senate Republicans and incorporated many \n     of their ideas into his bill. McConnell also said the bill \n     contains controversial bailouts, but it doesn't.\n\n  And this from today's Associated Press report:\n\n       McConnell on Tuesday said his views on the financial \n     regulation package had been most influenced by the comments \n     of community bankers in Kentucky, his home state. Yet such \n     bankers are represented by the industry groups that most \n     favor setting up an advanced prefinanced liquidation fund for\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\n     large institutions--the Independent Community Bankers \n     Association.\n\n  The very community banks that insisted upon the $50 billion that the \nbanks have to put up if they are going to be unwound, rather than \ntaxpayers. So the very banks that my friend from Kentucky claims are \nadvising him on his views have a different view than he does about the \nbill that is before us.\n  The newspaper article goes on. It says:\n\n       . . . McConnell has also complained that the Democratic \n     bill is partisan and the White House intervened to stop \n     Democratic-Republican negotiations . . . But Sen. Christopher \n     Dodd, Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, \n     negotiated for months with leading Republicans and found much \n     common ground, only to see the vote in his committee unfold \n     along party lines.\n\n  Well, there you have it. Black and white. The attacks on the Wall \nStreet reform bill are false. This legislation incorporates Republican \nideas, Democratic ideas, and it definitely includes one idea that we \nall agree on: ending taxpayer bailouts. Just ask Sheila Bair, who is \nthe Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the \norganization that comes in and puts an end to failing banks. Ms. Bair \nis also a Republican, former legal adviser to Senator Bob Dole, former \nmajority leader, minority leader of the Senate, an appointee of the \nprevious administration, the Bush administration.\n  Sheila Bair told the American Banker, in an article published this \nmorning:\n\n       The status quo is bailouts. That is what we have now. If \n     you do not do anything you are going to keep having bailouts.\n\n  And nothing is what we will have if Members vote against allowing \nthis bill even to come up for debate on the floor of the Senate. Sheila \nBaer goes on to say about this bill:\n\n       It makes bailouts--\n\n  This bill that we will have before this body--\n\n       It makes bailouts impossible. And it should. We worked \n     really hard to squeeze bailout language out of this bill. The \n     construct is that you cannot bail out an individual \n     institution. You just cannot do it.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, I want to say thank you so much for taking to the \nfloor to explain to the American people the very strange debate we hear \ncoming from the Republican leader on this. I was stunned, because I had \nheard that he had met with the Wall Street people and the banks, and \nthen he said over and over again the same phrase yesterday, which was \nrepeated endlessly, that the bill you and the President and the \nDemocrats are working on--trying to get bipartisan support for, for \nwhich I commend you--he said that bill would mean one thing and one \nthing only--taxpayer bailouts--when we all know the entire purpose is \nto put an end to one dollar of loss of taxpayer bailouts. So I have a \nquestion to ask. Is it not my friend's goal to get into a situation \nwhere the banks, the super big banks, the investment houses, pay into a \nfund themselves with their own money, so that if there are any problems \nand they need to be wound down, it does not cost a dollar of taxpayer \nmoney, that the fund will be paid for by these businesses themselves? \nAm I correct on that?\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me thank my dear friend and colleague from California. \nShe says it so much more directly and clearly than my efforts here to \nexplain this. She is absolutely correct. This is the irony of ironies.\n  In fact, let me go further. The $50 billion provision in this bill \nwas proposed by the Republicans. I did not come up with this idea. This \nwas the idea that was brought up by the community bankers and \nRepublicans who said that if there is an unwinding of a failed \ninstitution, the American taxpayer should not have to pay a nickel for \nthat; it should be paid for by the institutions that put themselves in \nthat position.\n  That is what we did. In fact, in the other body, they have a stronger \nprovision with even more dollars involved. The irony of ironies, that a \nRepublican provision in this bill, designed to insulate the American \ntaxpayers from having to pay a nickel to unwind a failed institution, \nthey are now calling somehow evidence that this is a bailout.\n  The only reason that money can be used is to bail out, rather to \nunwind that institution, if it gets in that situation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Further, my understanding is, if an institution gets in \ntrouble, they are going to go down. They are not going to be revived.\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would say to my friend, because he is an expert on \nthis--and years ago I was on the Banking Committee, and am no longer \nthere--I want to make sure I understand if I am right on this: I think \nthe American people have appreciated the FDIC over the years, because \nthe FDIC was another way for taxpayers to be kept out of a problem, \nbecause it is an insurance fund. The banks are taxed and they put the \nmoney into the fund. And if there is, in fact, a bankruptcy, you are \ncovered. Right now I think it is up to $250,000. Am I correct?\n  Mr. DODD. Correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So this whole notion has worked very well. But in \nclosing, because I do not want to interrupt the speech of my friend, \nbecause I think it is important, it seems to me suddenly there has been \na huge injection of politics into a bill that should have had, as you \npoint out, I say to my friend from Connecticut, bipartisan support.\n  If, in fact, the Republicans came up with the idea to have a fee on \nthese institutions, to protect the taxpayers so that we have no \nbailouts, and now, after meeting with the banks, it feels to me these \nbig institutions have turned on their own idea. But they are using the \nlanguage that is the opposite of what they now want to do. Because, as \nI understand it--tell me if I am right--if we keep the status quo and \ndo nothing, which is again their idea right now, we are in trouble, \nbecause we saw what happens when these big institutions get in trouble. \nMain Street starts to hurt. Lending starts to freeze. We have seen \nmillions of job losses due to that horrible time we went through.\n  I want to commend my friend and urge him, if he has to come here \nevery day--and I will be glad to come over here as well--to explain to \nthe American people the truth. I am so tired of politics obscuring the \ntruth. We need to put an end to it. We are not perfect. The other party \nis not perfect. No one is perfect. We do not have the ideas that are \ngoing to save and cure every problem. But we know one thing from this \ncrisis. We had to turn to taxpayers. What a nightmare. Thank goodness, \nby the way, those funds are being repaid. We are still out some funds, \nbut the vast majority of those funds are repaid. But we are not going \nto go through that again. I would never vote, and I say that right \nhere, to bail out these big institutions that were gambling. They \ngambled on the future of America. I will not do it. Therefore, let's \nput something into place where they pay into a fund so if there is a \nproblem in the future and they are going bust, we will wind them down \nand we will wind them out on their dollar.\n  I hope you will keep saying that, because I do not mind getting in a \ndebate with the other side. As a matter of fact, I think there are \ngreat differences between the two parties, which makes our country \ngreat because we all appeal to different people in the country. It is \ngood for the stability of the Nation. But let's not come here with \nfalse debate. Let's not come here with made-up arguments, because that \nonly hurts the debate.\n  I wanted to praise my friend. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes \nthanking him for doing this.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I note, you only have to ask \nyourself--look, you do not have to have a Ph.D. in banking. Ask \nyourself this question: The idea of requiring these institutions to put \nup money in advance, so that if they fail they end up paying for the \ncost of unwinding----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Bingo.\n  Mr. DODD. Who would object to that? Who is objecting to this? I \nmentioned earlier, it was not my idea. This was brought to me by the \nRepublicans. Sounds to me like the people who have to put up that money \nare probably the ones objecting to it. These are the large institutions \nthat do not want to be assessed any cost associated with their \nmismanagement of an operation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You got it.\n  Mr. DODD. So it is pretty much as plain as the nose on your face. I \nam\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\neven surprised we have to make the case. So I thank my colleague from \nCalifornia. I will try to complete these remarks. I know others have \nother matters they want to be heard.\n  I thank Sheila Bair from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \nMany of us know her, having worked with the Republican leadership for \nyears as legal counsel, of course; being an appointee of the Bush \nadministration. She talked about our bill today, saying this bill has \nbeen written specifically to end any notion of any kind of a bailout by \nthe American taxpayer.\n\n       It makes [bailouts] impossible, and it should. We worked \n     really hard to squeeze bailout language out of this bill.\n\n  And she is right, working together.\n\n       The construct is you can't bail out an individual \n     institution--you just can't do it.\n\n  Our bill stops bailouts by imposing tough new requirements on Wall \nStreet firms. Being too big and too interconnected will cost these \nfirms dearly. And, should that not be enough, under our legislation \nregulators can use new powers to break up those firms before they can \ntake down the economy. It stops bailouts by forcing firms to write \ntheir own funeral plans and to pay for their own liquidation in advance \nso taxpayers do not have to pay a dime. They shouldn't. If that is not \nenough, our bill stops bailouts by literally eliminating any \npossibility for the government to bail out these firms. These Wall \nStreet firms believe that no matter how much we hate bailouts, if they \nare important enough, at the end of the day taxpayers will come riding \nin on a white horse to save them, just as they did under the Bush \nadministration.\n  This bill kills the white horse. There is no white horse under this \nbill. When we pass it, as I hope we will, large institutions, big banks \nwill know if they fail, they fail. Their management gets fired under \nour bill. Their assets will be liquidated under our bill. Their \ncreditors lose money under our bill, and taxpayers don't pay for any of \nit under our bill. The bill stops bailouts.\n  To insist otherwise indicates that either the minority leader doesn't \nknow what is in the bill or he chose to distort what is in the bill. \nYet I read this morning in the Wall Street Journal that the Republican \nleadership is ``struggling to maintain a unified opposition,'' even \ngoing so far as to circulate a letter pledging that each Republican \nSenator will vote to filibuster this bill and keep it from even being \ndiscussed. I hope that is not the case.\n  I can't tell my colleagues, in my 30 years here, what a denial that \nis of everything I have stood for and worked for in countless pieces of \nlegislation for three decades, to have Members of this body, who have \nspent hours with me crafting the bill I will offer, including their \nideas, to then vote against even allowing this bill to be debated. I \njust know that cannot happen. I don't want to believe that 41 of my \ncolleagues, many of whom have worked with me on this bill, are going to \nsign on to a commitment that they will not allow this bill even to be \ndebated unless I agree to their provisions. I have never seen anything \nlike that in my 30 years.\n  I have worked tirelessly for months to put together a bill that \nreflects various ideas. I know it doesn't satisfy everyone. I have been \ncriticized by the left and the right on this bill. I understand that. \nBut I have tried to put together a bill that reflected what I thought \nwas commonsense, sound, good legislation. I pray the news I am hearing \nabout 41 Senators--before most of these people have even read what is \nin the bill--signing on to a political commitment without understanding \nwhat is at stake is not true. By losing this bill and having the status \nquo remain, bailouts then are in place. Taxpayers are exposed. The 8 \nmillion jobs that have been lost, the 7 million homes, others who have \nsuffered as a result of this economic crisis get little or no relief. \nThat is a stunning conclusion of the efforts that have gone on. It \nisn't about us. It is about the people out there who deserve far better \nthan they are getting.\n  Still, even after it has become apparent that the Republican strategy \nis to delay and obstruct, even after it has become clear that the \nminority has very little to offer in this debate except for some false \ntalking points read verbatim from the big banks' script, the minority \nleader took the floor again this morning and said:\n\n       Republicans believe the solution is for bipartisan talks to \n     continue.\n\n  They will. As frustrated as I am, my door has never been shut. The \ndoor is still open to sit and resolve and work together to get to this \nbill. But I will not sit around days on end in the rope-a-dope game of \nnever knowing who I am talking with, whether they have any ability to \nbring people to the table, ``just agree with my idea and I am still \nagainst the bill.'' I have to ask myself, why did I go through this \nprocess over the last 4 or 5 months, agreeing to much of what they were \noffering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it; in \nfact, a vote against even debating the bill in the end? Why would one \never go through what I did to end up at this particular point?\n  Apparently, someone finally informed the minority leader that those \ntalks had been going on for over a year. So they will continue. But \nthen again, he once again made the false statement that the bill would \n``allow taxpayer dollars to bail out Wall Street banks.''\n  There they go again, the same old talking point, the mantra repeated. \nIf one says it often enough, I guess it becomes true in some people's \nminds.\n  I say to my friend, the minority leader, if he wants to continue the \ndebate, he could start by ceasing efforts to filibuster this bill \nbefore it gets to the floor; before, I would suggest, no more than \nprobably two or three people have even seen it or have any idea how \nmany titles are in it, what it includes, and what we try to achieve. If \nyou want to debate, if you have ideas, then bring them to the floor. \nThat is why this body exists.\n  If the debate is going to consist of Democrats offering ideas to \ntackle these very complex--and it is a complex set of issues--and \ncritical challenges on behalf of American families and businesses and \nRepublicans reading false talking points from Wall Street's playbook, \nthen count me out. I will not engage in that kind of a debate or \nnegotiation. I have no interest in that whatsoever.\n  We have a job to do. If my friends on the other side of the aisle \ndon't feel like doing the work, maybe they should think about the \nmillions of unemployed Americans who didn't go to work this morning \nbecause they lost a job in this economy, created by the mismanagement, \nthe failure to step up and take steps to correct these problems over \nthe last number of years. Those Americans would love nothing more than \nto put in an honest day's work for a good day's pay. But they can't \nbecause the same banks sponsoring this parade of bamboozlement on one \nside of the aisle cost our country 8.4 million jobs, 7 million homes, \nlost health care, and destroyed futures and retirement accounts. That \nis all gone.\n  What about them in this debate? Are their issues, their views, their \nconcerns going to be discussed? No, just shut it down. Don't even \ndebate the issue because ``you can't agree with my idea.''\n  That is not why this institution exists. It is not about the process. \nIt is not about committee assignments. It is not about your idea or \nmine. It is about people beyond the walls of this Chamber who are \ncounting on us to get a job done for them. Our failure to step up and \neven debate these issues and consider each other's ideas is a tragedy.\n  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced with a \ndifficult choice between supporting their party leadership and \nparticipating in this complicated, difficult debate. I am not naive. I \nknow that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. Senators \nfor the sake of this issue, for the sake of legislation whose success \nor failure has such an enormous impact on the very survival of the \nmiddle class and the economy as we know it, then why are we even here? \nWhy are we even engaged in this, if that is what the choice is?\n  It is easy to understand why the big banks don't like this bill. It \nis far harder for me to understand why any of us would be sympathetic \nto those arguments. We don't work for the big banks. We work for the \nAmerican people who sent us here from our respective States. We work \nfor families who have paid a steep price for Wall Street's risky \nbehavior. We work for the American public that lost those jobs, those \nmore than 8 million jobs, and still faces near double-digit \nunemployment. We work for an American public that lost nearly 7 million \nhomes\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nto foreclosure, for millions of people who have seen their small \nbusinesses fail or their retirement accounts evaporate in a matter of \nhours. We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling \nlike no one is looking out for their interests, like the political \nhacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions.\n\n  The minority seems intent on proving them right--I hope that is \nwrong, but I am worried they may be right--on proving that there is no \nissue more important than saying no, stopping all discussion, currying \nfavor with special interests, and trying to gain petty political \nadvantage, strangling this bill with a filibuster or suffocating it \nwith false claims that stick our Nation and its taxpayers with bailouts \nforever; that will continue this era of greed and recklessness on Wall \nStreet; that will leave us vulnerable once again to another economic \ncrisis.\n  I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than \nthat. I know there are friends of mine on the other side who care about \nthis bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part of \nthe solution and have ideas to bring to the table and recognize no one \ngroup, no one Senator is going to write this bill exclusively. But I \ncan't get there if the attitude is: We won't even let you debate or \ndiscuss it. That attitude is not what the American people expect of the \nMembers of this body.\n  On their behalf, who desperately need us to act, I hope we are better \nthan that; that in the coming days before this bill reaches the floor, \nwe can find that common ground. If not, we need to go forward. But we \nneed to have that debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. I came to the floor of the Senate because my friend from \nConnecticut, who is my friend, made numerous comments about the \nprocess. I hope that possibly he would be willing to enter into a \ncolloquy.\n  I will give a preamble, if I may. There is a lot of rhetoric that has \ngone on around this financial reform bill. I appreciate so much the \nchairman of the committee engaging me for 30 days to try to reach a \nbipartisan agreement. We voted a 1,336-page bill out of committee in 21 \nminutes with no amendments. We did so with the understanding--at least \nit was my understanding--that the best way to reach a bipartisan deal \nwas to vote a bill out of committee--we knew it was going to be a \nparty-line vote--to not stiffen opposition by having a bunch of \namendments debated and maybe get people pulled further apart. Then what \nwe would do is try to seek a template for a bipartisan bill before it \ncame to the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. CORKER. I will.\n  Mr. DODD. That was the intention. But there were 401 amendments filed \nby 2 p.m. on Friday, before the announced markup of the bill. Over the \nweekend, staff came to work on amendments.\n  I say respectfully, no one from the minority side came in on the \nweekend. But over the weekend, it was suggested to me by the minority--\n--\n  Mr. CORKER. Not by this Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. No, but that they wouldn't offer any amendments. It turned \nout to be a 21-minute markup. I was prepared to stay there all week, as \nmy colleagues know, and announced in advance that would be the case.\n  So for the purposes of understanding here, again, that was their \ndecision. I hope we could get to some agreement farther down the road. \nWe agreed to a lot. The bill that was on the table that day for the \nmarkup was substantially different than the bill I offered as a \ndiscussion draft in November.\n  Mr. CORKER. No question.\n  Mr. DODD. So it reflected a lot of ideas and thoughts that have been \nincorporated between that date and the actual markup date. I say that.\n  Mr. CORKER. I have repeatedly publicly thanked the good Senator from \nConnecticut for going through that process, and there is no question it \nis a much better bill. As a matter of fact, I think it is a very \namendable bill.\n  Here is what I would say. I think things are being said that--there \nis no question some of the attacks on the order to liquidation have \nbeen over the top. On the other hand, there is no question that \nTreasury and the FDIC created some loopholes. That is what executive \nbranches do because they want the flexibility to do whatever they wish \nto do. I would do the same thing if I were them. But there are some \nthings that need to be tightened up, and I think we could do that in 5 \nminutes, I really do.\n  I talked with the Treasury Secretary yesterday. It is obviously more \nof a committee-committee level deal now, and I understand that. But I \nthink we could resolve that. But I think the thing, if I could--I know \nthere have been discussions about this letter. The fact is, I think \nwhat we are trying to do is say let's get this template done over the \nnext couple weeks. Let's do not slow it down.\n  I know you talked about entering a bill on April 26. I know there \nhave been talks about maybe sliding a week because there are some other \ncats and dogs that need to be dealt with. But we can do this. I think \nif everybody would calm down, and if everybody would quit exaggerating \nhow bad things are--there has been a lot of cooperation.\n  I just met with the ranking member. I left his office. I think there \nis a strong desire to reach a bipartisan agreement. I hope that--I am \nnot blaming anybody, but I think the White House is stirring around on \nthis. You have all kinds of forces going on. I think the good Senator \nfrom Connecticut wants a bipartisan bill that will stand the test of \ntime. I know I want one. I know the ranking member wants one. I think \nmost every Republican wants one. I think if we could quit shooting \nthings over the transom and get settled down, I think, without even \nslowing down the introduction of this bill--not slowing it down 1 day; \nif we get serious as adults for the next 10 days or so, a week--I think \nwe could finish. And I believe that.\n  I would ask--I would ask all my colleagues--and I ask this \nrespectfully of my colleague from Connecticut--look, things did not get \nwhere they needed to be, and I understand what happened, but I still \nrelish the fact that we came close. I think we can get back there. I \ndo. I do not think anybody is trying to subterfuge this. I do not. I \nmet with all my colleagues yesterday on the Republican side. We may \nhave a few folks who do not want a bill, but just because they do not \nlike laws. I am making that up slightly over the top myself. But I \nthink most people want a good bill. And I say to the chairman, I think \nwhat you did in December demonstrated that you want a good bipartisan \nbill.\n  I do not think it is right--I will get into a little bit here--I do \nnot think trying to call one Republican Senator to pick him off, two \nRepublican Senators to pick them off--I do not think that is a \nbipartisan bill. Let's get back to the table to finish it.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague wanted a colloquy here, and I am glad to be an \naudience for him. But if he wants a colloquy I will stay around.\n  Mr. CORKER. I am glad to listen, as I have often.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say, again, I came here--if I have been strong it is \nbecause I am responding to the minority leader. The minority leader has \ncome every morning now saying this bill perpetuates bailouts. I am not \ngoing to sit here idly and allow those accusations to be spread across \nthe country when you and I both know that is not true--when I am told \nthis is a partisan bill.\n  I have spent too much time here over too many years doing exactly \nwhat I have done in the 38 months I have been chairman of this \ncommittee; that is, to develop wherever I can bipartisan solutions to \nthis bill. It has motivated me in everything I have done.\n  So to all of a sudden, out of the blue, knowing all the efforts I \nhave made, along with others, to try and find that common ground--as my \ncolleague from Tennessee well knows here--and then to be faced with a \nminority leader who should know better than coming to the floor making \nthese silly accusations, false accusations about a process that has \nbeen anything but partisan, about conclusions in a bill that are \nanything but accurate in terms, in fact, of what is included in the \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\n  I am willing to listen to ideas on how we can make this tighter, if, \nin fact, that is the case, to stop the bailouts that are occurring in \nthe country, all of that. But then having a letter being circulated, \nwhere 41 people, most of whom have no idea what is in this bill but \njust taking a political position because they are being asked to do so, \nwithout at least having some appreciation for those of us, including \nyourself, who have worked so hard on this to produce as good a bill as \nwe can--understanding there are still ideas that many of our colleagues \nwant to bring to this debate, and they should have a right to do that--\nthat having a full-throated debate on the floor of the Senate--I am \ndisturbed.\n  What does that say to future chairs? Why would you even bother doing \nwhat I went through if, in fact, at the end of it all the answer is: \nNo, I am sorry, we did not get our way, so we are going to stop the \ndebate? I find that terribly distressing. As a Member of this body, \nleaving it in a few months--I will not be here any longer next year for \nthe debates--I have to say to the younger Members, the newer Members \ncoming along: Be careful. If this is the template on how we operate, \nthen all of the things I tried to do over the last year on this bill--\nfrom the hearings, involving everyone, going through the discussions, \nrecognizing you did not solve every issue--then you have to ask \nyourself the question: Why would you do that if at the end of the \nprocess you get a letter circulated stopping a motion to proceed on a \nbill of this import after all the effort?\n  If this had been a purely partisan--you know, you are not allowed in \nthe room. We are just going to keep you outside. We just want to write \nit--then I get that. You would be right, in my view. I would sign the \nletter, in fact, if that were the case. This is not that case, in my \nview. I say that respectfully to my colleague.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will respond respectfully that I think the course of \naction that is trying to get underway is to finish the bipartisan--\nlet's face it. You and I went a long way. Then we stopped. On March 10 \nit ended. I understood that, look, you were losing Democrats on your \ncommittee.\n  Mr. DODD. And I was not gaining Republicans.\n  Mr. CORKER. You had one, and that is all you asked for when you \nstarted. I do not want to reiterate that. I never said I could speak \nfor anybody but myself. And I did not leave the table. I never left the \ntable. So the fact is, the bill took a partisan turn on March 10. There \nis no denying that. You would not deny that and look at me with a \nstraight face.\n  There are some bipartisan solutions in this bill, I grant that, and I \nthank you for those inclusions. But there is still work to be done. And \nI would say to you that what Republicans are trying to do is say, let's \nfinish that work before it gets to the floor. You have said this, and I \ndo not think I am betraying confidences. I would never do that \nintentionally. This is a complicated piece of legislation.\n  What we need to do is get the template--at least bipartisan in the \nbeginning. And then you are right, there are issues such as the Volcker \nrule and there are governance issues that are going to be amended back \nand forth. But let's at least get the main parts of the bill right in \nthe beginning--close to right--not the way you would want it on your \nown, not the way I would want it on my own. That has not happened on a \nnumber of the titles, in fairness.\n  I would urge everyone--there has been a lot of work done. You have \ndone a tremendous amount of work in this committee. Let's finish that \nwork over the next 10 days. Let's quit yelling at each other, and let's \nfinish the work the American people sent us to do. I am not lecturing. \nI say all this respectfully. Let's finish what we started.\n  Mr. DODD. I hope it can be the case.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is a view that sometime next week--upon \nthe disposition of the bill that is currently before us and perhaps \nsome other matters--we might take up the issue of so-called financial \nregulatory reform. I wish to speak for a moment to one of the key \nissues I know is of concern to some of my colleagues, and certainly to \nme.\n  The American people have a pretty firm view on this whole thing after \nwhat they have seen with regard to TARP and the other bailouts. They \nare obviously not crazy about what has happened.\n  I think most Americans think there should be two basic goals: First, \nto prevent the kind of crisis that occurred from ever happening again; \nand, secondly, to make sure that taxpayers are not on the hook, \nespecially if we are talking about the possibility of continued \nbailouts where Federal money would be involved in unwinding big Wall \nStreet firms that get into trouble.\n  Unfortunately, this bill that came out of the Banking Committee, and \ncould be brought to the floor next week--unless it is changed \nsignificantly--not only does not achieve the first goal, but it also \ncarries forward that policy of ``too big to fail'' and taxpayer \nbailouts. That is why in its current form you have a lot of people on \nmy side of the aisle saying it has to be changed. Let's get together, \ntalk in a bipartisan way, and make sure we can both achieve the goal \nand, secondly, not carry forward current bad policies.\n  This bill, at least in my view--and I will explain why--would set the \nconditions for firms to become overleveraged; that is to say, taking on \ntoo much debt relative to their value, and it would entrench in law \nforever this concept of taxpayer obligation to bail out these firms.\n  Well, how would it do this? Primarily, it creates a $50 billion so-\ncalled orderly liquidation fund established through assessments on the \nlargest banks. So at least the first part of the fund would be paid by \nbanks themselves. But even that, obviously, would not be big enough to \ncover the bailout, for example, of one of our larger banks, let alone \nsome of the other kinds of institutions. But by creating this fund, we \nare, in effect, designating those entities as ``too big to fail,'' \nmeaning the government will have to then pick up obligations beyond \nwhat is covered by the $50 billion.\n  So after the exhaustion of that fund, and some other steps, taxpayers \nhave provided not just an implicit but an explicit guarantee. I have \nread the language in the bill, and it provides the FDIC shall be \nliable, in effect, for amounts that are necessary beyond that. The \nspecific language is the FDIC ``will guarantee the obligations of \nbanks'' in times of severe economic distress. That is the status quo. \nThat is what people object to. Why should we be on the hook for those \nbig banks when they fail?\n  There are some additional problems. This kind of guarantee increases \nthe likelihood that those firms will take risky behavior and then \nbecome overleveraged, just as what happened with the real estate \nentities, so-called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Because there was an \nimplicit guarantee the government would bail them out if they got into \ntrouble, they took risks that were beyond what they should have taken, \nand the end result was, because they failed, we were on the hook, and \nfor a lot more than would have been the case had they not taken those \nrisks.\n\n  In addition to that, because there is an implicit guarantee, they are \nactually shielded from market forces and are given a competitive \nadvantage over their competition. Private investors, as we saw in the \ncases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are more likely to lend to these \nfirms and to charge them a lower interest rate because they are pretty \nwell guaranteed that if anything bad happens, they will get their money \nback. Meanwhile, other banks, such as Arizona community banks, don't \nhave that kind of implicit guarantee. In fact, a lot of those banks are \non the brink, frankly, of collapsing today. They are charged more money \nin order to borrow money than these very large, too-big-to-fail \ninstitutions. So this creates an anticompetitive barrier that will, in \neffect, make cartels out of the large institutions that would receive \nthis guarantee.\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\n  The consequences would be severe. Peter Wallison is a fellow at the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute and is very knowledgeable about these \nmatters. He wrote this last year:\n\n       Financial institutions that are not large enough to be \n     designated significant will gradually lose out in the \n     marketplace to the larger companies that are perceived to \n     have government backing just as Fannie and Freddie were able \n     to drive banks and others from the secondary market for prime \n     middle-class mortgages. A small group of government-backed \n     financial institutions will thus come to dominate all sectors \n     of finance in the U.S.\n\n  Well, that is the formal way of saying what I said before, and that \nis one of the reasons we don't want to have this kind of implicit \nguarantee or, in the case of the legislation, explicit guarantee by the \ntaxpayers. You will see the same kinds of distortions as were created \nby Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the housing market prior to the \ncollapse of the financial sector last year.\n  Back in 2003, I was chairman of the Senate Republican policy \ncommittee, and we began researching and writing about this. We wrote \ntwo specific papers sounding the alarm about Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. I was concerned back then that this explicit guarantee or backing \nof these institutions permitted them to operate without adequate \ncapital and to assume more risk than their competitors and borrow at \nbelow market rates of interest, and that is exactly what happened. \nSmaller companies got crushed. Fannie and Freddie engaged in \nincreasingly risky lending with the backing of the Federal Government. \nOn a massive scale, they made mortgages available to people who could \nnot afford them, like buying those risky mortgages, and that easy \ncredit fueled very rapidly rising home prices. As prices rose, \nobviously, the demand for even larger mortgages rose, and Fannie and \nFreddie looked for ways to make even more mortgage credit available, \nnotwithstanding a questionable ability to repay. It was a giant \naccident waiting to happen.\n  By 2008, these two GSEs--government-sponsored enterprises--held \nnearly $5 trillion in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They \nwere overleveraged. They were too big to fail. The resulting collapse \ndevastated our economy, and it left taxpayers with a tab of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. In fact, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have now \ntransferred to you and me $6.3 trillion of their liabilities--just \nthose two entities--and we are on the hook for it.\n  That is what we have to prevent from happening, but that is exactly \nwhat this legislation that passed out of the Banking Committee would \npermit. Why would we continue this kind of too-big-to-fail taxpayer \nliability in what we call a reform bill? We ought to stop that, make \nsure it never happens again.\n  I also wish to make this point, since there is a new regulator \ncontemplated in this legislation. What happened to Fannie and Freddie \nhappened despite the fact that they had their own dedicated regulator, \nand that is exactly what is proposed for institutions in this bill. In \nfact, the bill would use the very same regulators who failed to stop \nthe financial crisis from happening.\n  I thought this was supposed to be reform. This isn't reform. I am \nreminded of a line from literature--I don't think it is from ``A Tale \nof Two Cities,'' but it could be--where the actor says, ``Reform, sir? \nDon't talk of reform. Things are bad enough already.'' That is kind of \nthe way I look at this. We have problems, and the kind of reform that \nis being suggested here is not an improvement; it is a continuation of \nthe same obligation of taxpayers to bail out those who are deemed too \nbig to fail.\n  I wish to add that the bill even extends the scope of these potential \nfuture bailouts beyond banks. It would explicitly give the Federal \nReserve authority to regulate any large company in America that it \nwanted to. Thus, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, FSOC, would \nhave the power to designate nonbank financial institutions as a threat \nto financial stability--the code word for ``too big to fail.'' So a new \ngovernment board based in Washington would decide which institutions \nget special treatment, giving unaccountable bureaucrats tremendous \nauthority to pick winners and losers, and these favorite firms, too, \nwould have a funding advantage over their competitors.\n  In addition to extending this to bigger companies, the legislation \nextends this same definition all the way through our financing sectors \nto smaller companies. For example, one of the auto dealers in your town \nthat finances the automobiles you buy, if you have more than four \npayments, they are covered under here. It even would cover a dentist's \noffice or an optometrist. If it takes more than four payments to take \ncare of what he had to do, he would be covered by this. So this would \nextend to small and large and in all cases puts a government bureaucrat \nin charge of trying to find out why a firm is in trouble and ultimately \nrequires, if they are needed, taxpayers to come to the rescue of these \nfirms. As I said, we have to avoid making the mistakes of the past. A \nfirm's cost of capital should be based on its ability to repay its \ncommitments, not on the probability of future government assistance.\n  So given recent experience, I would suggest that we need a more \ncompetitive financial industry with many firms, not just a few large \nfirms with implicit government guarantees dominating the market.\n  I started my comments by speaking about what the American people \ndon't like and what they would like to see. I think they deserve a \nbetter approach than this legislation that passed out of the Banking \nCommittee, one that promotes accountability and responsible oversight. \nThis bill, as I said, is a risk the taxpayers don't need and, frankly, \ncannot afford.\n  So I urge my Democratic colleagues to reengage with Republicans to \nproduce a bipartisan bill that can pass the Senate by a wide margin. \nLet's not have any more health care bills where it is done strictly on \na partisan, party-line basis, with a consensus lacking, with the \nAmerican people not liking what is being done. We can provide for the \norderly bankruptcy of these failed institutions without keeping \ntaxpayers on the hook for losses.\n  By the way, a lot of this reform has to deal with preventing the \nbankruptcy in the first place--in other words, regulating some of these \nnew esoteric financial instruments so that there is greater \ntransparency in the complicated trading of these financial instruments.\n  I think we can work this out and keep politics out of it. Everybody \nunderstands there are things which need to be done to prevent the kind \nof collapse we had in the past. It is my understanding that the hard-\nworking members of the Banking Committee on both sides of the aisle had \nbeen working hard together and had been producing compromises. They \nwere characterized to me as, it is not everything I would want, but \nthen in a compromise you don't get everything you want. That is the \nspirit in which we can work together to produce a product that I think \nwould be acceptable to our constituents, who don't want to be on the \nhook for any more of these bailouts, as well as provide the kind of \ntransparency up front and procedures for unwinding businesses on the \nback end when they finally are unable to continue in business, a \nprocess which would not require the taxpayers to bear ultimate \nresponsibility for their losses. If we are able to work together to do \nthis, it will be a win-win situation for the American people, and just \nmaybe we will demonstrate that Republicans and Democrats can actually \nsit down together, work something out, and pass a bill that is good for \neverybody.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2357-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2357-S2360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST JUDGE G.

Thomas Porteous, Jr., United States District \nJudge for the Eastern District of Louisiana\n                                  ____\n\n\nREPLICATION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO THE ANSWER OF G. THOMAS \n             PORTEOUS, JR., TO THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT\n\n       The House of Representatives, through its Managers and \n     counsel, respectfully replies to the Answer to Articles of \n     Impeachment as follows:\n\n                        Response to the Preamble\n\n       Judge Porteous in his Answer to the Articles of \n     Impeachment, denies certain of the allegations and makes what \n     are primarily technical arguments as to the charging language \n     that do not address the factual substance of the allegations. \n     However, it is in Judge Porteous's Preamble that he sets \n     forth his real defense and, without denying he committed the \n     conduct that is alleged in the Articles of Impeachment, \n     insists that nevertheless he should not be removed from \n     Office.\n       At several points in his Preamble, Judge Porteous notes \n     that he was not criminally prosecuted by the Department of \n     Justice, the implication being that the House and the Senate \n     should abdicate their Constitutionally assigned roles of \n     deciding whether the conduct of a Federal judge rises to the \n     level of a high crime or misdemeanor and warrants the Judge's \n     removal, and should instead defer to the Department of \n     Justice on this issue. Judge Porteous maintains that \n     impeachment and removal may only proceed upon conduct that \n     resulted in a criminal prosecution, no matter how corrupt the \n     conduct at issue, or what reasons explain the Department's \n     decision not to prosecute. Judge Porteous provides no support \n     for this contention because there is none--that is not what \n     the Constitution provides.\n       Indeed, the Senate has by its prior actions made it clear \n     that the decision as to whether a Judge's conduct warrants \n     his removal from Office is the Constitutional prerogative of \n     the Senate--not the Department of Justice--and the existence \n     of a successful (or even an unsuccessful) criminal \n     prosecution is irrelevant to the Senate's decision. The \n     Senate has convicted and removed a Federal judge who was \n     acquitted at a criminal trial (Judge Alcee Hastings). The \n     Senate has also convicted a Federal judge for personal \n     financial misconduct (Judge Harry Claiborne) while at the \n     same time acquitting that same Judge of the Article that was \n     based specifically on the fact of his criminal conviction.\\1\\ \n     Thus, Judge Porteous's repeated references to what the \n     Department of Justice did or did not do adds nothing to the \n     Senate's evaluation of the charges or the facts in this \n     case.\\2\\\n       Further, according to Judge Porteous, pre-Federal bench \n     conduct cannot be the basis of Impeachment, even if that \n     conduct consisted of egregious corrupt activities that was \n     beyond the reach of criminal prosecution because the statute \n     of limitations had run, and even if Judge Porteous \n     fraudulently concealed that conduct from the Senate and the \n     White House at the time of his nomination and confirmation. \n     There is nothing in the Constitution to support this \n     contention, and it flies in the face of common sense. The \n     Senate is entitled to conclude that Judge Porteous's pre-\n     Federal bench conduct reveals him to have been a corrupt \n     state judge with his hand out under the table to bail \n     bondsmen and lawyers. Such conduct, which, as alleged in \n     Articles I and II, continued into his Federal bench \n     tenure, demonstrates that he is not fit to be a Federal \n     judge.\n       Finally, the notion that Judge Porteous is entitled to \n     maintain a lifetime position of Federal judge that he \n     obtained by acts that included making materially false \n     statements to the United States Senate is untenable. Judge \n     Porteous would turn the confirmation process into a sporting \n     contest, in which, if he successfully were to conceal his \n     corrupt background prior to the Senate vote and thereby \n     obtain the position of a Federal judge, he is home free and \n     the Senate cannot remove him.\n\n                               Article I\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     statement in the Answer to Article I that denies the acts, \n     knowledge, intent or wrongful conduct charged against \n     Respondent.\n\n\n                       FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense and further \n     states that Article I sets forth an impeachable offense as \n     defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                       SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, namely, \n     that Article I is vague. To the contrary, Article I sets \n     forth several precise and narrow factual assertions \n     associated with Judge Porteous's handling of a civil case \n     (the Liljeberg litigation), including allegations that Judge \n     Porteous ``denied a motion to recuse himself from the case, \n     despite the fact that he had a corrupt financial relationship \n     with the law firm of Amato & Creely, P.C. which had entered \n     the case to represent Liljeberg'' and that while that case \n     was pending, Judge Porteous ``solicited and accepted things \n     of value from both Amato and his law partner Creely, \n     including a payment of thousands of dollars in cash.'' There \n     is no vagueness whatsoever in these allegations. Article I's \n     allegation that Judge Porteous deprived the public and the \n     Court of Appeals of his ``honest services''--a phrase to \n     which Judge Porteous raises a particular objection--could not \n     he more clear and free of ambiguity as used in this Article, \n     and accurately describes Judge Porteous's dishonesty in \n     handling a case, including his distortion of the factual \n     record so that his ruling on the recusal motion was not \n     capable of appellate review.\\3\\\n\n\n                       THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of the purported affirmative defense that Article \n     I charges more than one offense. The plain reading of Article \n     I is that Judge Porteous committed misconduct in his handling \n     of the Liljeberg case by means of a course of conduct \n     involving his financial relationships with the attorneys in \n     that case and his failure to disclose those relationships or \n     take other appropriate judicial action. The separate acts set \n     forth in Article I constitute part of a single unified scheme \n     involving Judge Porteous's dishonesty in handling Liljeberg. \n     Further, the charges in this Article are fully consistent \n     with impeachment precedent.\\4\\\n\n\n                       FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which, in \n     effect, seeks to suppress the voluntary statements of a \n     highly educated and experienced Federal judge, made under \n     oath, before other Federal judges. Judge Porteous was \n     provided a grant of immunity in connection with his Fifth \n     Circuit Hearing testimony, and the immunity order provided \n     that his testimony from that proceeding could not be used \n     against him in ``any criminal case.'' Simply put, an \n     impeachment trial is not a criminal case.\\5\\ Accordingly, \n     there is simply no credible basis to argue that the Senate \n     should not consider Judge Porteous's voluntary and immunized \n     Fifth Circuit testimony.\n\n                          Answer to Article II\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     statement in the Answer to Article II that denies the acts, \n     knowledge, intent or wrongful conduct charged against \n     Respondent.\n\n\n                       FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense and further \n     states that Article II sets forth an impeachable offense as \n     defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                       SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, namely, \n     that the Article is vague. To the contrary, Article II sets \n     forth several precise and narrow factual assertions \n     associated with Judge Porteous's relationship with the \n     Marcottes--both prior to and subsequent to Judge Porteous \n     taking the Federal bench. Article II alleges with specificity \n     the things of value given to Judge Porteous over time and \n     identifies the judicial or other acts taken by Judge Porteous \n     for the benefit of the Marcottes and their business.\n\n\n                       THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, namely, \n     that the Article improperly charges multiple offenses. The \n     plain reading of Article II is that Judge Porteous engaged in \n     a corrupt course of conduct whereby, over time, he solicited \n     and accepted things of value from the Marcottes, and, in \n     return, he took judicial acts or other acts while a judge to \n     benefit the Marcottes and their business.\n\n\n                       FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, namely, \n     that Article II improperly charges pre-Federal bench conduct \n     as a basis for impeachment. First, Article II plainly alleges \n     that Judge Porteous's corrupt relationship with the Marcottes \n     continued while he was a Federal Judge. Second, Judge \n     Porteous's assertion that pre-Federal bench conduct may not \n     form a basis for impeachment finds no support in the \n     Constitution and is not supported by any other sound legal or \n     logical basis.\\6\\ As a factual matter, it is especially \n     appropriate for the Senate to consider Judge Porteous's pre-\n     Federal bench corrupt relationship with the Marcottes where \n     it was affirmatively concealed from the Senate in the \n     confirmation process,\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\n     where it involved conduct as a judicial officer directly \n     bearing on whether he was fit to hold a Federal judicial \n     office, and where that conduct, having now been exposed, \n     brings disrepute and scandal to the Federal bench.\n\n                              Article III\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     statement in the Answer to Article 111 that denies the acts, \n     knowledge, intent or wrongful conduct charged against \n     Respondent.\n\n\n                       FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense and further \n     states that Article III sets forth an impeachable offense as \n     defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                       SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which \n     alleges in substance that the allegations in Article III are \n     vague. To the contrary, Article III sets forth several \n     specific allegations associated with Judge Porteous's conduct \n     in his bankruptcy proceedings. There is no credible \n     contention that Judge Porteous cannot understand what he is \n     charged with in this Article.\n\n\n                       Third Affirmative Defense\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which \n     alleges, in substance, that Article III charges more than one \n     offense. The plain reading of Article III is that Judge \n     Porteous committed misconduct in his bankruptcy proceeding by \n     making a series of false statements and representations, and \n     by incurring new debt in violation of a Federal Bankruptcy \n     Court order. This Article alleges a single unified fraud \n     scheme, with the purpose of deceiving the bankruptcy court \n     and creditors as to his assets and his financial affairs, so \n     that Judge Porteous could enjoy undisclosed wealth and income \n     for personal purposes including gambling.\n\n\n                       FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which, in \n     effect, seeks to suppress the voluntary statements of a \n     highly educated and experienced Federal judge, made under \n     oath, before other Federal judges. Judge Porteous was \n     provided a grant of immunity in connection with his Fifth \n     Circuit Hearing testimony, effectively eliminating the \n     possibility that any of that testimony could be used against \n     him in any criminal case. An impeachment trial is not a \n     criminal case. There is simply no credible basis to argue \n     that the Senate should not consider Judge Porteous's \n     voluntary and immunized Fifth Circuit testimony.\n\n\n                       FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense--which does \n     not take issue with the proposition that Judge Porteous \n     committed misconduct in a Federal judicial bankruptcy \n     proceeding, but contends only that the acts as alleged do not \n     warrant impeachment. First, this is not an affirmative \n     defense. It is up to the Senate to decide whether the facts \n     surrounding the bankruptcy warrant impeachment.\n       Second, the Senate has in fact removed a judge for personal \n     financial misconduct, and in 1986 convicted Federal Judge \n     Harry Claiborne and removed him from office for evading \n     taxes. It is significant that the Senate did not convict \n     Judge Claiborne for the crime of evading taxes. Rather, the \n     Senate acquitted Judge Claiborne of the one Article that \n     charged him with having committed and having been convicted \n     of a crime.\n       Third, what the Department of Justice may consider material \n     for purposes of a criminal prosecution has nothing to do with \n     what the Senate may deem to be material for purposes of \n     determining whether Judge Porteous should be removed, from \n     Office--an Office which requires that he oversee bankruptcy \n     cases and administer and enforce the oath to tell the \n     truth.\\7\\\n\n                               Article IV\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     statement in the Answer to Article IV that denies the acts, \n     knowledge, intent or wrongful conduct charged against \n     Respondent.\n\n\n                       FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense and further \n     states that Article IV sets forth an impeachable offense as \n     defined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n                       SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, which \n     alleges the Article is vague. The allegations sets forth in \n     Article IV are specific and precise. In fact, Judge \n     Porteous's description of the charge fairly characterizes the \n     offense: ``In essence, Article IV alleges that Judge Porteous \n     gave false answers on various forms that were presented in \n     connection with the background investigation. . . . It is \n     apparent, therefore, that Judge Porteous has a clear \n     understanding of these allegations in Article IV, which \n     specify the dates and circumstances when the statements were \n     made, and the contents of the statements that are alleged to \n     have been false. There is no credible contention that Article \n     IV does not provide Judge Porteous specific notice as to what \n     this Article alleges.\n\n\n                       THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense. The \n     allegations set forth in Article IV are specific and precise. \n     They charge in substance that Judge Porteous made a series of \n     false statements to conceal the fact of his improper and \n     corrupt relationships with the Marcottes and with attorneys \n     Creely and Amato in order to procure the position of United \n     States District Court Judge. Charging these four \n     false statements, all involving a single issue, in a \n     single Article is consistent with precedent.'\n\n\n                       FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n       The House of Representatives denies each and every \n     allegation of this purported affirmative defense, alleging \n     that the Senate cannot impeach Judge Porteous based on pre-\n     Federal bench conduct. First, Judge Porteous's assertion that \n     pre-Federal bench conduct may not form a basis for \n     impeachment is not supported by the Constitution. \n     Notwithstanding Judge Porteous's assertions to the contrary, \n     the Constitution does not limit Congress from considering \n     pre-Federal bench conduct in deciding whether to impeach, and \n     there are compelling reasons for Congress to consider such \n     conduct--especially where such conduct consists of making \n     materially false statements to the Senate. The logic of Judge \n     Porteous's position is that he cannot be removed by the \n     Senate, even though the false statements he made to the \n     Senate concealed dishonest behavior that goes to the core of \n     his judicial qualifications and fitness to hold the Office of \n     United States District Court Judge. The proposition that the \n     Senate lacks power under these circumstances to remedy the \n     wrong committed by Judge Porteous is simply untenable.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n\n               The United States House of Representatives\n\n                                   By\n\n     Adam Schiff,\n       Manager.\n     Bob Goodlatte,\n       Manager.\n     Alan I.

Claiborne was acquitted of Article III, \n     charging that he ``was found guilty by a twelve-person jury'' \n     of criminal violations of the tax code, and that ``a \n     judgement of conviction was entered against [him].'' See \n     ``Impeachment of Harry E. Claiborne,'' H. Res. 471, 99th \n     Cong., 2d Sess. (1986) (Articles of Impeachment); 132 Cong. \n     Rec. S15761 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 1986) (acquitting him on \n     Article III).\n       \\2\\ Moreover, the Department of Justice's investigation \n     hardly vindicated Judge Porteous. To the contrary, the \n     Department viewed Judge Porteous's misconduct as so \n     significant that it referred the matter to the Fifth Circuit \n     for disciplinary review and potential impeachment, and set \n     forth its findings in its referral letter.\n       \\3\\ Judge Porteous treats Article I as if it alleges the \n     criminal offense of ``honest services fraud,'' in violation \n     of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1346, and that \n     because the term ``honest services'' has been challenged as \n     vague in the criminal context, the term is likewise vague as \n     used in Article I. Despite Judge Porteous's suggestion to the \n     contrary, Article I does not allege a violation of the \n     ``honest services'' statute. Moreover, it could hardly be \n     contended that proof that Judge Porteous acted dishonestly in \n     the performance of his official duties does not go to the \n     very heart of the Senate's determination of whether he is fit \n     to hold office.\n       \\4\\ The respective Articles of Impeachment against Judges \n     Halsted L. Ritter, Harold Louderback, and Robert W. Archbald \n     each set forth lengthy descriptions of judicial misconduct \n     arising from improper financial relationships between those \n     judges and the private parties. These consist of detailed \n     narration specifying numerous discrete acts. See \n     ``Impeachment of Judge Halsted L. Ritter, ``H. Res. 422, 74th \n     Cong., 2d Sess.

Mr. President, early this morning, we awoke to sad news \nout of Memphis, TN. This country has lost a civil rights pioneer, a \nstrong leader, and a witness to history.\n  Benjamin Lawson Hooks fought all of his life for freedom, prosperity, \nand universal equality. When the world was consumed by war, Benjamin \nput on the uniform of the 92nd Infantry Division and rendered honorable \nservice to his country.\n  When peace was won and America looked inward today to address \npolicies of discrimination and inequality, he was on the frontlines \nonce again, standing with visionaries such as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.\n  At every turn, and at every moment in his life, he waged to fight \nagainst injustice. He became an attorney and was eventually appointed \nas the highest ranking Black Federal judge in the State of Tennessee. \nBut that was only the beginning of a remarkable career in public \nservice.\n  Benjamin Hooks was the first African American to serve on the Federal \nCommunications Commission, where he spoke out against biased reporting \nin the media and called for minority ownership of TV and radio \nstations.\n  In 1977, he was unanimously elected as President of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP--a \nposition he would hold with distinction until his retirement in 1993 \nand which would come to define his career.\n  Throughout those tumultuous years, Benjamin Hooks was at the \nforefront of the nonviolent struggle for civil rights. He constantly \nchallenged old assumptions, stood up to discrimination, and fought \nagainst those who defended the status quo.\n  He taught us the courage to live out our convictions. He showed us \nhow to translate our dearest principles into words and action.\n  In 1980, he became the first national leader to address conventions \nof both political parties. He denounced those who resorted to violence, \nand he personally led prayer vigils, peaceful protests, and countless \nother popular demonstrations.\n  At various times throughout his career, Benjamin Hooks served as a \npastor, a soldier, a judge, and a political leader. He fought for \nequality in the courtroom, on the pulpit, on the airwaves, and even on \nthe battlefield, but never did he act for personal gain. Not once did \nhe forget the cause of justice that he and others dedicated their lives \nto defend.\n  So great was the legacy of this civil rights leader, so deep was the \nimpact he had on the fabric of our society, that even today, on the sad \noccasion of his passing, I cannot help but feel a lasting sense of \npride in the profound and enduring accomplishments he leaves behind.\n  Benjamin Hooks will be sorely missed by all who knew him, \nparticularly his family, to whom we express our deepest condolences \ntoday.\n  Even as we mourn his loss, I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating his memory and honoring the living legacy he leaves behind. \nI am sure Benjamin would be the first to remind us that we must not \npause in remembrance for long because there is much work yet to be \ndone.\n  Let us take up this fight. Let us defend the principles that guided \nBenjamin Hooks throughout his life and embrace the spirit that drove \nthis pioneer to reach for equality, fight for opportunity, and aspire \nto greatness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 3214 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, today is April 15. It is the day \nAmericans are required by law to file their tax returns to pay their \nfair share to the Internal Revenue Service so that we can operate the \nFederal Government. I think it is appropriate on a day such as this to \ntalk about the taxes and the efforts of Americans over the past months \nto put together their financial information to pay what they must pay \nto the government.\n  Leading up to today, Americans have been involved in that effort of \ncarefully preparing their income tax returns. It is estimated that 7.6 \nbillion hours of time and more than 1 million accountants were required \nto file this year's returns. Our Tax Code has become so complicated \nthat it takes 7.6 billion hours for Americans to file and figure out \nthose complicated returns, and more than 1 million accountants to help \nus in our efforts.\n  I know my wife Meike last night was up late making sure we got \neverything in on time. We do our own taxes, and it is not easy to \nunderstand, even for someone like my wife who is an accountant and who \nis trained in it.\n  It begs the question--why? Every time we do something in this \ngovernment that does not necessarily help the folks we represent, it is \nour obligation to question those practices. Need the Tax Code be as \ndifficult as it is? Need it take so many billions of hours of \nAmericans' time, time that could be spent working, time that could be \nspent with their families? Need we employ 1 million service providers \nin the form of accountants to help us fill out all these taxes? Of \ncourse, the answer is no. There are good proposals in this Chamber and \nin the House to simplify the Tax Code, to make it so one can put it on \none piece of paper.\n  My colleagues, Senator Gregg and Senator Wyden, have such a proposal. \nThere is a proposal in the House that offers the same type of clarity \nand simplicity to allow Americans, if they choose, to file taxes \nquickly and easily. Certainly, that is something we should undertake \nand be about.\n  But let's also ask this question: Is the amount of money that \nAmericans pay in tax actually going to something that is effectively \nand efficiently administered by the Federal Government? Let's think \nabout all of the money that Washington is taking from Americans every \nday--and not just Washington, our State and local authorities. In fact, \nwhen you think\n\n[[Page S2361]]\n\nabout the number of taxes that people pay, it is quite amazing.\n  First, they go to their jobs in the morning and they make a salary \nand they pay tax on their income. Then, if they choose to spend that \nmoney, they are taxed in a variety of different ways because, if not \nevery State, virtually every State has a sales tax. So they are taxed \non the money they make and then they are taxed on the money they spend. \nOf course, if they do not want to spend that money and save it, we are \ngoing to tax them on that too.\n  Think about that. What kind of incentive should we be creating for \nAmericans? Should we be saying they should save their money or should \nwe be saying they should spend it? We tax them, albeit at a lower rate, \neven to save their money.\n  Any interest they receive on money they put in the bank, or if they \ninvest in a mutual fund or a stock and they receive returns on that \ninvestment--they sell that stock, they pay tax again. Of course, we \nknow when they die they pay death taxes.\n  But that is not all. Do you have a phone? You are paying a tax on \nthat. Do you have a cell phone? You pay tax on that. Do you have cable \ntelevision? You pay tax on that. Do you want to buy property in the \nState of Florida where I am from? You pay tax on that. Do you want to \nown and hold property? You pay tax on that.\n  For some Americans, more than 50 percent of what they make, more than \nhalf is paid in taxes. I contend that it is immoral to take from \nanybody more than half of what they make in taxes, especially if how \nthat money is being spent is not being spent wisely.\n  Here in Washington we are very good at taxing. Now we have become \nvery good at spending. This year we are figuring the 2011 budget. We \nare going to take in an estimated $2.2 trillion, but we are going to \nspend $3.8 trillion--$1.6 trillion more than we are going to take in. \nWe are not looking at the money we are taking in in taxes and trying to \nfigure out how much we should spend based upon that baseline. We spend \nbased upon what this Congress decides it needs.\n  We have a Budget Committee in the Senate. There is one in the House, \ntoo. But the truth of it is we do not operate under a budget. American \nfamilies sit down at the kitchen table and figure out how much they \nmake and therefore how much they can spend. American businesses do the \nsame thing. So do State governments, by the way. State governments that \nhave balanced budget requirements like my home State of Florida right \nnow are in their legislative session, and they are evaluating how much \nthey can spend based upon how much they are going to have from tax \nreceipts. Guess what. They only spend what they take in. They have \nthree choices: They can cut spending, they can raise taxes, or find new \nsources of revenue.\n  Here in Washington it is like it is a different conversation, if \nthere is a conversation even at all, because we do not talk about \nspending based upon what we take in. We talk about spending based upon \nwhat people in this Chamber want to spend money on. That system, \nunfortunately, threatens the very viability of this country.\n  We know right now that we have a nearly $13 trillion national debt. \nRemember, 1 trillion is 1,000 billion. These numbers are so staggering, \nit is hard to comprehend them. We know if we continue to spend the way \nwe are projected to spend, this administration has told us that by 2020 \nwe will be $22 trillion in debt. Why is that important? It is important \nbecause it hurts investment in our country, and it is important because \nmore and more of what we spend each year goes to paying interest on the \ndebt. This year, we are going to spend more than $200 billion just \npaying interest on money we should not have spent in the past. If we \nkeep going, by 2020 we will spend $900 billion a year on interest. And, \nmy friends, by the time we get to that point, the system will have \nfailed because, with mandatory spending, spending on Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid, plus $900 billion in interest payments, there \nwill not be any money left for anything else. There will not be any \nmoney left for defense. There will not be any money left for homeland \nsecurity. There will not be any money left for commerce or agriculture \nor any of the other programs, and the system will have failed. So do we \nwait until 2020 when the system fails or do we do something about it \nnow?\n  We do not have a problem on the revenue side. We are taxing people \nplenty, and today is a day when most Americans realize that. There is a \nreal problem in this country that we do not think about taxes more \nbecause they are sort of hidden from us. We have something called \nwithholding. Most people work for somebody else, they are employees, \nand they get their check every week, every 2 weeks, once a month. And \nwhat do they look at? They want to know what the bottom-line number is. \nThey think that is what they make. They think that is what their \nemployer is paying them, in effect. They do not realize--and none of us \ndo--that they make the top-line number. What is in our check is after \neverything else has been paid.\n  Imagine if we got rid of withholding. Imagine if every American was \nrequired, at the end of the month or at the end of a quarter, as small \nbusinesspeople have to do, to write a check to the Federal Government \nto actually pay their taxes, to take that affirmative act instead of \nhaving it withheld out of their check. I think Americans would be in \nthe streets. I think they would be protesting because they would \nfinally realize how much money they are actually paying in taxes.\n  Our problem in this country isn't not enough tax. We do not need to, \nas members of this administration have suggested, add a value added tax \nor the equivalent of a national sales tax to help get us out of our \ndeficit and debt problems. What we need to do is stop spending money we \ndo not have.\n  By the way, this body and the body down the hall--you would think we \nwould be focused on oversight, trying to figure out how the money is \nbeing spent in these agencies. Sadly, I tell you that is a topic of \nlittle interest to many of the people in either of these two bodies. My \ncolleagues for the most part--and there are notable exceptions--care \nmore about creating new programs than focusing on the programs we have.\n  So what we need is a construct. We need something that is going to \nfocus us on spending--spending less. Legislation comes to the floor, \nand we have a Member of the Senate champion and shepherd that \nlegislation through to spend money. What we do not have is a procedure \nto focus us on spending less. All the mechanisms here, all the \ndirections flow toward spending money. They never flow toward saving \nmoney. We have to change the structure around here, even if just a \nlittle. We have to change the focus. What we need to focus on is not \nspending as much money so that we can have a balanced budget.\n  Yesterday, I proposed a solution called the 2007 solution and filed \nlegislation to this end, that we would freeze spending at the 2007 \nspending levels because if we did that, we could balance the budget by \n2013 and by 2020 we could cut our national debt in half--not the $22 \ntrillion that is estimated but $6 trillion, half of the $12 trillion \ndebt we have now--and we could save America for our children because if \nwe continue down the path we are on, they are not going to have the \nopportunities we have. We have been able to enjoy an America where \nanything is possible, where you are not limited by anything but your \nhopes and dreams. But for our children--I have four little ones: Max, \nTaylor, Chase, and Madeleine. Madeleine is 2 weeks old. They are not \ngoing to have the same opportunities I have enjoyed if their country \ncannot afford to meet its obligations; if investors from around the \nworld no longer come here because we are no longer a good investment; \nif we have to raise taxes to such an incredibly high level that it \nstifles innovation and entrepreneurship, where my kids come to me, when \nthey are 18 or 22, when they are done with school, and say: Dad, I am \ngoing to Ireland or India or Brazil or some other country because the \npromise of that country is greater than that of the United States of \nAmerica. So it is incumbent upon us in this time--not tomorrow, not \nnext week, not next year, not when we think the economy is doing \nbetter, but today--to start getting our spending under control.\n  Why can't we live off of what we lived off of in 2007? When I go back \nto Florida--and I talked to some folks today from Florida who are here \nfrom\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\nBartow, which is in central Florida, in Polk County, and I said to \nthese business leaders: Could you live off what you had in 2007? They \nall shook their heads affirmatively because they had more money in 2007 \nthan they have today.\n  So now that we have gotten past the stimulus and that big bulge in \nour spending, hopefully, is over, why can't we go back to 2007 levels, \nbefore the economy declined? Remember, it was not until December of \n2007 that the recession started. Why can't we go back to that robust \nyear and say: This is our baseline. We took in $2.7 trillion that year. \nThat is more than we expect to take in this year by $\\1/2\\ trillion. \nWhy can't we live on that level? Guess what. Then we would have to come \nto the floor of the Senate--and our colleagues would have to do it in \nthe House of Representatives--and have a discussion about priorities: \nDo we need to spend as much money as we are spending today in our \nvarious agencies? Are we getting bang for the buck?\n  When is the last time a Cabinet Secretary, an agency head went inside \ntheir department and said: I want you to find cuts of 10 percent, 20 \npercent. I want you to use technology to create efficiencies. Let's \nimpose a hiring freeze until we can figure out whether we can do more \nwith less.\n  American businesses have been doing this for the past 3 years during \nthis recession. They have been cutting in order to make ends meet. \nGovernment is going to have to do the same. And I guarantee you that \nthere are hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and inefficiency and \nfraud in the system; that if we spent as much money and attention and \ntime focusing on that as we do on creating new programs, we could right \nour fiscal house.\n  So I have offered this legislation to bring us back to 2007, really \njust to have a debate, have a focus and a structure to talk about it \nevery year for 50 hours on the floor of this Chamber and in the House \nso that we can begin to focus on what matters; that is, putting our \nfiscal house in order so that our children have the same opportunities \nwe have because, frankly, that is our solemn obligation in this \ncountry. Our obligation is to make sure our children have equal or \ngreater opportunities than we had. Everything else that we do, by \ncomparison, will not measure up if we fail to meet that solemn and \nsacred vow.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen.)

Madam President, my understanding is, our Republican \ncolleagues have been on the floor and have expressed their concerns \nabout financial reform and their desire to work in a bipartisan way. I \nwelcome that. I am going to lay out some ideas I hope could have \nRepublican support. I am not sure they will, but I would love to see it \nbecause the vast majority of the people in our country are profoundly \ndisgusted with the behavior on Wall Street, the greed, the \nrecklessness, the illegal behavior which has led us to the terrible \nrecession we find ourselves in today. I wish to tick off a couple \nissues I hope my Republican colleagues would be interested in working \nwith me on.\n  Every week I receive--and I suspect others do as well--telephone \ncalls and letters and e-mails from people in my State who are outraged \nby the kind of interest rates they are forced to pay, interest rates \nwhich are nothing less than usury, usury which has been condemned by \nevery major religion in this world, which has been condemned throughout \nhistory by some of our great philosophers and writers who have \nbasically said it is wrong and immoral to force desperate people who \nare in need of loans to pay outrageous interest rates.\n  Yet today more than one-quarter of all credit cardholders in this \ncountry are paying interest rates above 20 percent and, in some cases, \nas high as 79 percent. That is not providing credit. That is loan \nsharking. That is doing precisely what criminals do when they lend \npeople money and then break their kneecaps if they don't pay it back on \ntime--except the loan sharks who are doing this now wear three-piece \nsuits. They don't break kneecaps, but they destroy lives by forcing \npeople to pay outrageously high interest rates when people are using \ntheir credit cards to buy groceries, to fill the gas tank to get to \nwork, to pay for basic needs their families have.\n  Millions of credit cardholders have received letters from Citibank, \nBank of America, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase notifying them that \ntheir interest rates are going up, in some cases to 30 percent. A point \nthat has to be made is that these four large banks, the four largest \nbanks in a America, issue two-thirds of the credit cards. These four \nbanks are ripping off the American people from one end of the country \nto the other. It is time that outrageous behavior ended.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues who have come to the floor expressing \nconcern about Wall Street, I hope what they are saying is more than \njust rhetoric, that they truly want to do something. If they want to do \nsomething, I hope they will join me when I offer an amendment as part \nof financial reform to cap credit card interest rates at 15 percent. \nThat is the same statutory cap that has been in existence for 30 years \nat credit unions all over the country. Credit unions are doing just \nfine, but by law, they cannot ask for more than 15 percent, except \nunder certain circumstances, when it can go up to 18 percent. If that \nis good enough for credit unions, it should be good enough for \nCitibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and other large \nfinancial institutions.\n  If my Republican friends are sincere, I hope they will join me in \nsupporting efforts to bring transparency to the Federal Reserve. An \namendment I intend to offer will do that. What we need to do, among \nmany things, is to understand which financial institutions during the \nbailout received over $2 trillion in secret taxpayer-backed loans \nvirtually interest free. Who are they? Last year, as a member of the \nBudget Committee, I asked Fed Chairman Bernanke that simple question. \nHe said, no, he is not going to tell me which financial institutions, \nhe is not going to tell the American people which financial \ninstitutions received trillions of taxpayer dollars. I have a problem \nwith that. I believe the American people do. We are going to offer an \namendment as part of financial reform in order to understand what, in \nfact, is happening, to demand transparency there.\n  In April of last year, the Senate voted 59 to 39 on an amendment I \noffered with Senators Webb, Bunning, and Feingold to the budget \nresolution calling on the Fed to release this information. Yet as of \nthis day, the Fed has refused to do so. In August of last year, Federal \nU.S. district judge Loretta Preska, nominated by President George W. \nBush, ordered the Federal Reserve to release this information. The Fed \nappealed that decision and last March the U.S. appeals court in \nManhattan upheld that decision. Yet the Fed has still not disclosed \nthis information. Over 300 Members of Congress have cosponsored \nlegislation calling for an independent audit of the Fed. In other \nwords, we now have 59 Senators, over 300 Members of Congress, a U.S. \ndistrict court judge, and a U.S. appeals court that have said to the \nChairman of the Fed, Mr. Bernanke, in no uncertain terms, that the \nAmerican people have a right to know the names of the largest banks \nthat have received over $2 trillion in taxpayer-backed loans from the \nFederal Reserve.\n  If my Republican friends are sincere, if they truly want to take on \nthe greed and the recklessness of Wall Street, if they want to give the \nAmerican people transparency as to what is happening on Wall Street, I \ncertainly hope they will support that amendment.\n  I also hope we can receive support to address the issue of too big to \nfail. In that regard, I have offered legislation which is pretty \nsimple. It says the Treasury Department would provide a list to \nCongress of all the too-big-to-fail banks in this country within 90 \ndays of passage of that legislation and break them up within 1 year so \nthey can no longer threaten to bring down the economy if, once again, \nthey get into trouble. Quite amazingly--and I think most people don't \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\nthis--under the leadership of the Bush administration and Fed Chairman \nBernanke, the largest financial institutions since the bailout have not \ngotten smaller; in fact, they have become larger.\n  In 2008, the Bank of America, the largest commercial bank in the \ncountry, which received a $45 billion taxpayer bailout, purchased \nCountrywide, the largest mortgage lender in the country, and Merrill \nLynch, the largest brokerage firm. In other words, what we are seeing \nin at least three out of the four largest banks is, since the bailout, \nthey have become even larger, becoming an even greater threat to the \nfinancial stability of the country if, once again, they are ever in a \nposition to fail.\n  The issue of large banks is not only that they are a threat to the \nstability of our economy, if they are about to fail. The other aspect \nof the problem is the concentration of ownership that currently exists. \nWhen we have four large financial institutions that issue two-thirds of \nthe credit cards in the country and half the mortgages, we have a very \ndangerous and noncompetitive type of situation. Given the fact that we \nhave seen these financial institutions issue esoteric and not \nunderstandable financial instruments whose only goal is to secure more \nmoney and profits and compensation packages for the CEOs of these \ninstitutions, we need to start breaking them up and have financial \ninstitutions that understand that their role is to provide credit to \nthe productive economy, the businesses that actually produce real \nproducts, provide real services, and create real jobs. In other words, \nwe need to break them up to create a new Wall Street which becomes part \nof the United States, part of our economy, not an isolated island whose \nonly goal in life is to issue worthless financial instruments in order \nto make outrageous short-term profits. That is a huge issue that we \nhave to deal with.\n  If my Republican colleagues are, in fact, sincere, if they want to do \nmore than follow pollster Frank Luntz's playbook and throw out certain \nwords they think will work for them politically, I look forward to \ntheir support for real financial reform.\n  The Bottom line is, we cannot continue to do what we have done for a \nnumber of years. We have to summon the courage, and it will take \ncourage because Wall Street is enormously powerful. In order to get the \nderegulation that led us to the financial disaster we experienced a \nyear and a half ago, over a 10-year period, Wall Street spent the \nunbelievable sum of money of $5 billion on campaign contributions and \nlobbying. Frankly, I don't even know how one can spend that kind of \nmoney. But nonetheless, it certainly worked. Against my vote, when I \nwas in the House, they got the deregulation they wanted. Lo and behold, \nonce they were deregulated, not to my surprise, they went out and did \nall kinds of strange things, reckless things, illegal things, which \nbrought us to where we were a year and a half ago.\n  What we need is real financial reform. We need a cap on interest \nrates so Wall Street cannot continue to rip off ordinary Americans. We \nneed transparency at the Fed. We need to know which financial \ninstitutions are receiving trillions of dollars of taxpayer money. We \nneed to begin the process of breaking up these huge financial \ninstitutions, not only from a too-big-to-fail concern but also from a \nconcentration of ownership issue because we are going to need a lot \nmore competition in the financial industry than we have now.\n  We will find out soon enough whether our Republican friends are doing \nmore than reading from a pollster's playbook or whether they are \nserious about taking on Wall Street. I have my doubts, but I hope I am \nwrong. I hope we will gain their support in bringing real reform to our \nfinancial institutions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, for those who are following the Senate \nactivities today, we are considering the extension of unemployment \nbenefits. It is a debate which has gone on repeatedly. I see the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee has come to the Chamber and \nhas been sitting patiently on the floor trying to work this through, \nand I think we may be close to a vote on this matter very shortly.\n  If I am not mistaken, if we are successful in passing this extension, \nit will extend unemployment benefits to the end of May. I hope we do \nnot face this again between now and then because not only does it tie \nup the Senate for a lengthy period of time, but it creates real \nuncertainty across America.\n  Madam President, 212,000 people had their unemployment benefits cut \noff in the United States last week because we were gone and the \nbenefits expired; so this week another 212,000 people. In my home State \nof Illinois, 16,000 people a week lose their unemployment benefits \nbecause of the decision by the Senate not to move forward and extend \nthose unemployment checks.\n  An unemployment check in my home State is about $300 a week. Some \nhave come to the floor and argued we should not give unemployment \nbenefits because it makes people lazy. If they are getting $300 a week, \nthey will not go looking for jobs. I wonder when it was, if ever, that \na Senator tried to live on $300 a week. I think it would be very \ndifficult, in most cases impossible, for those who are used to a \nlifestyle that is much more expensive.\n  So extending these benefits, in my estimation, is not only humane, it \nis good economic judgment. The money given to people out of work is \nmoney that is spent immediately for the necessities of life. It is not \nsaved or invested. They go out and spend it on what they need, whether \nit is on utility bills or rent or food or clothing--whatever it might \nbe. So it is money that is injected straight into the economy.\n  When Republicans come to the floor, they say: Wait a minute. At some \npoint, with our national debt, we have to pay for this. I say to them: \nHow would you pay for it? They say: We pay for it by cutting spending \non projects that create jobs. Wait a minute. If you cut spending on \nprojects that create jobs, there are more people unemployed. More \npeople unemployed need more benefits. We cannot end the recession until \nwe focus on getting people back to work.\n  One of the key areas Senator Baucus on the Senate Finance Committee \nhas worked on is putting money into small businesses across America. \nMany of us believe small businesses are going to be the engine that \nbrings us out of this recession. So when Senator Baucus and the Finance \nCommittee create tax credits for businesses that hire the unemployed or \nreduce their payroll taxes for those who hire the unemployed or have \nnew deductions for expensing and the purchase of capital equipment, we \nare doing everything we can to put money into those small businesses. \nThe argument that we should stop spending on those things will mean the \nrecession goes on longer.\n  I hope we can reach a point soon where we put the question of \nunemployment behind us. There should be a debate on the national debt, \nand there will be. I do not know if it is a great honor, but Senator \nReid, the majority leader, has appointed me to the Deficit Commission. \nI met today with Erskine Bowles, who was the head of the Small Business \nAdministration under President Clinton, as well as Alan Simpson, a \nformer U.S. Senator from Wyoming, who chair this commission.\n  We are going to start, in a couple weeks, our inquiry and debate on \nwhat to do about our national debt. It is one that is long overdue. But \nI think if we are honest about this, we realize it will take some \nthoughtful consideration and some time to come up with an approach that \nreally deals with the debt in a humane and sensible way, but does not \nstop our recovery in this recession. So we are tasked with doing that.\n  Senator Baucus is a member of that commission as well. We will spend \nsome time together talking about it, I am sure. We have to report by \nthe end of the year. In the meantime, we will be watching the \nappropriations bills that come through here to cut the waste out of the \nspending if there is\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\nsome in some of these agencies. And I am sure we can find some.\n  In the meantime, let's not make the unemployed across America the \nvictims of this debate. Let us give them some certainty that the \nbasics, the necessities of life, which they need because they have lost \na job through no fault of their own, are going to be provided for. We \nwant to make certain if they lost their lifesavings and stand to lose \ntheir home, we give them at least a little bit of a helping hand while \nthey look for work.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the unemployment figures came out \ntoday, and, sadly, they have not gone down. It tells me we were late to \nthe recession and we will probably be slow to the recovery. I am sorry \nto report that, but I think it may be the case. But, in the meantime, \nwe have to create the climate for small business expansion, and we have \nto create the safety net for those who are out of work across America. \nThe passage of this bill will help us to do that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, first, I wish to express my appreciation \nto everyone in the Senate. This has been a good debate. Sides have been \nchosen, and I think the arguments were good on both sides. We had \namendments on this. There were efforts made to just move forward and \nhave a cloture vote on it. I thought this was the best way to go.\n  So I appreciate everyone's cooperation. We didn't want to take these \nvotes, but we took them, and I think it is better for the order.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the McCain amendment No. 3724; \nthat upon disposition of the McCain amendment, no further amendments be \nin order; that the Senate then proceed to vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the Baucus amendment No. 3721, as modified; that if cloture \nis invoked, then all postcloture time be yielded back; the Baucus \namendment as modified and amended, if amended, be agreed to; the bill \nthen be read a third time; and following the reading of the pay-go \nletter from the chairman of the Budget Committee, the cloture motion \nwith respect to the bill be withdrawn, the Senate then proceed to vote \non passage of the bill, as amended, and that 2 minutes prior to the \nfirst vote be equally divided and controlled between Senators Baucus \nand McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3724, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is tax day. Americans are \noverburdened and taxed by an antiquated, complex, and oversized Tax \nCode. This year they will spend $100 billion in compliance-related \nexpenses. Instead of offering proposals to reform the system, some are \nsuggesting a new value-added tax which would increase taxes on average \nAmericans and even further complicate our Tax Code. I believe it is an \nopportunity, with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, for Members of \nCongress to say where they stand. This is their opportunity.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the amendment by the Senator from \nArizona would state a sense of the Senate that we should not adopt a \nvalue-added tax. Personally, I agree with him. I do not favor a value-\nadded tax. I, for one, would be happy to accept the amendment. I don't \nknow if the Senator from Arizona wants a rollcall vote. I don't know if \nit is provided for. I hope we don't have to have one, but if he wants \none, that is fine with me. The order states we will start voting at 5 \no'clock, and when we do get to the vote on the McCain amendment, I \nintend to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is unfortunate that this vote comes \ntoday and not 2 weeks ago. While we delayed taking action, thousands of \npeople in my state, and millions across the country, worried that these \nbenefits, benefits that provide a thin buffer between their families \nand disaster, would disappear. These families are suffering through the \nanxiety and frustration of job loss not because of anything they did, \nbut because of a crisis spawned in Wall Street banks and unscrupulous \nmortgage companies.\n  This bill takes a number of important steps to alleviate the effects \nof the financial crisis. It would extend the unemployment and COBRA \nhealth insurance benefits on which so many families depend until early \nJune. While we have seen recent signs of improvement in employment, the \nunemployment rate in Michigan, and the Nation, remains unacceptably \nhigh, making these extensions all the more necessary. According to the \ngovernor's office, more than 125,000 Michiganians will exhaust their \nunemployment benefits.\n  We should keep in mind, too, that extending these benefits not only \nhelps families struggling to put food on the table and a roof overhead; \nit helps all\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\nof us, by contributing to our economic recovery. There is widespread \nagreement that benefits such as unemployment payments give us the \nbiggest ``bang for the buck'' in terms of economic stimulus. By \nextending these benefits, we will give continued support to an economy \nstruggling to recover, an effort that benefits all Americans.\n  I encourage my colleagues to place the interests of struggling \nAmerican families, and the economic recovery, clearly before us, and to \npass this much-needed extension.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2367-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF LAEL BRAINARD, TO BE AN UNDER SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF MARISA J.

Mr. President, the middle class is the backbone of \nour Nation. Middle-class families sustain our neighborhoods and our \neconomy and support our public services such as our schools and police \nand fire departments and libraries.\n  Over the last 2 weeks--last week and the week before--I traveled \nextensively across Ohio and met with Ohioans who define the character \nof the American middle class.\n  College students at the University of Toledo described their hopes \nand aspirations to become our next educators and entrepreneurs, \ncommunity and business leaders, and civic activists.\n  Workers at the 60-year-old General Motors plant in Defiance, near the \nIndiana border, described how they are ready to build the next \ngeneration car engines and rebuild the middle-class communities in \nwhich they work and live.\n  In Cincinnati, workers at GE's historic Evendale plant--a Cincinnati \nsuburb--represent the classic American success story: people working \nhard, getting ahead, getting paid an honest day's wage for an honest \nday's work.\n  I met with veterans. Chairman Akaka allowed me to set up, in \nCambridge, OH--in eastern rural Appalachian Ohio--a Veterans' Committee \nhearing. I met with other veterans in the Chillicothe VA Center and the \nCincinnati VA Center--two terrific VA facilities--to meet with and talk \nto and understand better the services for veterans who return from war \nand who represent those values of hard work and fair play.\n  Too many middle-class families in the Presiding Officer's State--\nwhether it is Joliet, IL--or Mansfield, OH, too many middle-class \nfamilies are still fighting to have something to show for it. They are \nfighting for a secure job with decent wages, a home with an affordable \nmortgage, and the belief that their children will have a future full of \nopportunity and stay close by and raise their children so they can know \ntheir grandparents.\n  Tax day is today, April 15, and many middle-class Americans are just \ntrying to get by while our economy begins to recover. That is why when \nPresident Obama and this Congress--the Senate and the House--enacted \nthe American\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act last year, we made sure that one-third of \nthose several hundred billion dollars--one-third of those dollars went \nto tax relief for 95 percent of working families in America.\n  We hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about tax \ncuts as if they invented them, but we don't hear them tell the truth \nabout tax cuts because their idea of tax cuts is overwhelming tax \nbenefits to the wealthiest people in our society--not doing what \nPresident Obama and the House and Senate did last year and this year: \nproviding those tax breaks and tax cuts and tax relief directly to the \nlarge middle-class and working class in this country. Middle-class \ntaxpayers, as a result, can collect on more than a dozen Recovery Act \ntax benefits this season. While the Recovery Act is putting Americans \nback to work rebuilding America, it is also honoring the dignity of \nwork through the Making Work Pay tax credit. On average, Ohioans \nreceived $496 through the Making Work Pay tax credit, $496 in people's \npockets. Middle-class tax relief helps make college more affordable \nthrough the American Opportunity Credit, tax savings for up to $2,500 \nto pay college expenses. More homes can be energy efficient and less \ncostly through energy efficiency and renewable energy incentives. \nEnergy-efficient windows and doors and heating and cooling systems \nreduce utility bills, while increasing the value of the most important \nasset for many Americans--their home. The first-time home buyer tax \ncredit has made the dream of home ownership a reality, helped create \njobs, stabilized home prices, and rebuilt communities across the \nNation.\n  These are tax breaks that have been enacted that Americans are \nalready taking advantage of and, in many cases, celebrating on this day \nthat people aren't particularly glad to see: April 15. It means this \nApril 15 is a whole lot better for American taxpayers than 2 years ago, \nwhen April 15 was for people who didn't have the tax relief the Obama \nadministration has brought them.\n  The Cash for Clunkers Program provided American consumers and Ohio \nconsumers with vouchers to purchase new fuel-efficient vehicles. It was \na resounding success. More Americans bought more American cars. That \nprogram stabilized the auto sector. It saved and created thousands of \njobs across Ohio and the Nation. I saw these jobs being created in \nDefiance, OH, as I mentioned, where some 80 workers will be called back \nto help build the engine for the new Chevy Cruze made in Youngstown. I \nknow those workers at GM in Parma, a Cleveland suburb, will be helping \nwith some of the stamping and the fabrication of the Chevy Cruze, and I \nknow that 1,100 workers are in the process of being put back to work, \nto work a third shift at the Lordstown GM plant to build the most \nenergy-efficient car in the GM fleet.\n  Existing tax credits, such as the earned income tax credit which \nrewards work for people making $20,000 to $40,000 a year--this is not \nwelfare; it rewards people who are working hard, playing by the rules, \nnot making a lot of money--or the child tax credit, these existing tax \ncredits were expanded to ensure more eligible Americans received the \ntax credits they earned. Nationwide, the average tax refund is up 10 \npercent--$266 for a record average. The average tax refund is $3,036 so \nfar. Those numbers will slightly change as people file today, before \nmidnight.\n  The IRS says this increase is largely due to the Recovery Act. \nNinety-nine percent of working families and individuals in Ohio \nbenefited from at least one of the tax cuts signed into law by \nPresident Obama. Working Ohioans received $1,046 on average as a result \nof these critical middle-class tax relief programs. That means because \nof what this Congress did, the Senate and the House, what President \nObama did, middle-class Ohio families save over $1,000. That is $1,000 \nin their pockets that wouldn't have been there 2 years ago, before \nPresident Obama took office, would not have been available under the \nBush tax policies because those tax policies benefited the richest \npeople but didn't benefit the middle class.\n  So under the Bush tax policies, wealthier people were particularly \nhappy, but the middle class was left out. Under Obama tax policies, \nwealthier people might not be quite so happy, but the broad middle \nclass will have more than $1,000 extra in their pockets as a result of \nthis middle-class tax relief. It is a critical part of the economic \nrecovery.\n  That is why the President and the Congress passed just last month the \nlargest health-related, middle-class tax cut in the last two decades \nwhen it passed the historic health care reform, insurance reform \nlegislation. We know there is much work ahead. I would add the first \nthing that came out of that legislation on health care was already in \nplace and is now already in place; that is, significant tax incentives \nfor small businesses, for employers to provide health insurance for \ntheir employees. When they couldn't afford it in the past, with these \ntax incentives, many employers will be able to afford providing health \ninsurance for their employees.\n  We know there is much work ahead to ensure the interests of the \nmiddle class are protected in our Tax Code over the corporate special \ninterests. I know many Republicans, including those running for office \nin my State--for Governor and Senate and attorney general--many \nRepublicans want to repeal the health care bill. But understand when \nthey repeal the health care bill, they are doing what they have done in \nthe past. They are taking from the middle class and giving to the \nwealthy. That is the class warfare I have heard on this floor for the \nlast 3 years. It is the class warfare I heard in the House of \nRepresentatives when Republicans continued to do more and more for the \nrichest people in this country and less and less for the middle class \nand less and less for low-income people. That is the kind of class \nwarfare they have waged for years. I hope they aren't successful in \ndoing that on the health care bill. I don't think they will be, but it \nis important to guard against that.\n  Senate Democrats are not just looking back with what we were able to \ndo, we are looking forward to what we are going to do to make taxes \nwork better for America. Senate Democrats are working on further tax \nrelief to help middle-class families whose daycare costs for a young \nchild or an elderly parent undercut their pay and their savings. We \nwill continue to fight for middle-class tax relief that will rebuild \nour economy in Dayton and Springfield and Zanesville and Mansfield and \nRavenna and Girard and Lima and restore prosperity for all Ohioans.

Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the fifth \nbudget scorekeeping report for the 2010 budget resolution. The report, \nwhich covers fiscal year 2010, was prepared by the Congressional Budget \nOffice pursuant to Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended.\n  The report shows the effects of Congressional action through April 9, \n2010, and includes the effects of legislation since I filed my last \nreport for fiscal year 2010 on January 28, 2010. The new legislation \nincludes: P.L. 111-127, the Emergency Aid to American Survivors of the \nHaiti Earthquake Act; P.L. 111-142, the Social Security Disability \nApplicants' Access to Professional Representation Act of 2010; P.L. \n111-145, the United States Capitol Police Administrative Technical \nCorrections Act of 2009; P.L. 111-147, the Hiring Incentives to Restore \nEmployment Act; P.L. 111-148, the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act; P.L. 111-151, the Satellite Television Extension Act of 2010; \nand P.L. 111-152, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of \n2010.\n  The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are \nconsistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. \n13, the 2010 budget resolution.\n  The estimates show that for fiscal year 2010 current level spending \nis above the levels provided in the budget resolution by $3.1 billion \nfor budget authority and $5.8 billion above for outlays. For revenues, \ncurrent level shows\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\nthat $14.2 billion in room remains relative to the budget resolution \nlevel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and accompanying tables from \nCBO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Apr. 15, 2010.\n     Hon.

Ross, USMC\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to express our Nation's \ndeepest thanks and gratitude to a special young man and his family. I \nwas deeply saddened to receive word during the past recess that that on \nMarch 24, 2010, LCpl Jacob A. Ross of Gillette, WY, was killed in the \nline of duty while serving our country in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom. Lance Corporal Ross was killed in combat in Helmand Province \nin southern Afghanistan.\n  Lance Corporal Ross was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marine \nRegiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force out of \nCamp Lejeune, NC. Lance Corporal Ross graduated from Campbell County \nHigh School in 2008. He is remembered by his friends as hard-working, \nintelligent and kind-hearted. He was athletic and was on the swimming \nand soccer teams in high school. Jacob had a passion for the outdoors \nand loved to hunt, fish and camp under the Wyoming skies. He always \nwanted to be a marine. After graduation, he followed in his father's \nfootsteps and joined the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  It is because of Jacob Ross that all Americans are able to live our \ndaily lives as free people. Freedom is not free. It carries a very high \nprice. And that price has been paid over and over by America's men and \nwomen who answer the call to service and willingly bear the burdens of \ndefending our Nation. They deserve our deepest respect and gratitude. \nThey put their very lives on the line every day, and because of them \nand their families, our nation remains free and strong in the face of \ndanger.\n  The motto of the U.S. Marine Corps is ``Semper Fidelis.'' It means \n``Always Faithful.'' LCpl Jacob Ross lived up to these words with great \nhonor. He gave his life, that last full measure of devotion, for you, \nme, and every single American. He gave his life serving and defending \nhis country and its people, and we honor him for this selfless \nsacrifice. He was always faithful to our country and its citizens, and \nto his fellow marines.\n  Lance Corporal Ross is survived by his wife Brittney, and his parents \nKaren and Dennis, his sister Katie and his brother, Nathan. He is also \nsurvived by his brothers and sisters in arms of the U.S. Marine Corps. \nWe say goodbye to a son, a husband, a brother, a friend, and a marine. \nThe United States of America pays its deepest respect to LCpl Jacob A. \nRoss for his courage, his love of country and his sacrifice, so that we \nmay remain free. He was a hero in life and he remains a hero in death. \nAll of Wyoming, and indeed the entire Nation, is proud of him. May God \nbless him and his family. Lance Corporal Ross, Semper Fi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2370-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2370-S2371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                     HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 2010\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncommemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n  This week, in America and throughout the world, Jews observed \nHolocaust Remembrance Day in synagogues, reciting prayers. Families \ngathered in their homes to light candles and remember those loved ones \nwho perished. Young people listened to the stirring testimonials of \ngrandparents and survivors of one of the worst atrocities committed by \nhumankind. These rituals are recited each year in an effort to \nremember. But, also to ensure that we as a human race never forget.\n  Florida has the largest number of Holocaust survivors in the entire \ncountry. Each time I visit the Miami Jewish Health Systems and other \ncenters in our state, I am reminded of our solemn obligation to care \nfor those survivors, whose numbers dwindle with each passing year.\n  This week, we pause to remember those who lost their lives simply \nbecause of their faith and their heritage. We also remember others who \nsuffered persecution and were murdered by the Nazis: Gypsies and Poles, \nthe handicapped, gays and lesbians, political dissidents, prisoners of \nwar, and the brave civilians who risked their own lives to save their \nneighbors.\n  Last June, a lone gunman attacked the Holocaust Memorial Museum here \nin Washington. This morally depraved man shot and killed a guard and \nterrorized countless visitors before he was brought down. The shots \nwere fired on the day the museum was scheduled to show a play based on \nthe life of Anne Frank, a girl whose story serves as a disturbing \nreminder of the Nazis' campaign of terror and also the heroism \ndemonstrated by a few decent people to protect those whose lives were \nin jeopardy.\n  January 11, 2010, Miep Gies, the last of those who protected Anne \nFrank passed away. She was a woman who did not want to be called a \nhero, but it is her heroism that we must honor, remember, and pass down \nto future generations.\n  A survivor recently informed me that on Holocaust Remembrance Day she \nwanted people to remember the kindness that she received during the \nHolocaust. She said that kindness helped her survive. Mr. President, it \nis amazing that survivors, when asked about a period of unimaginable \nhorror, can recall sentiments of thanks and an appreciation for life.\n  The good that individuals can do is not limited to the past. \nAmericans today are continuing to help those survivors by documenting \ntheir experiences and educating our communities. This past January, I \nattended the 30th anniversary celebration of the Holocaust \nDocumentation & Education Center. The center is in the process of \ncreating the first South Florida Holocaust Museum. There is still great \nwork to be done and I am proud of the Americans who are committed to \nthis important effort.\n  Congress also has a responsibility to ensure that the memories of \nthose dark days are recalled to ensure that nothing like it happens on \nthis Earth again.\n  In respect for the victims of the Holocaust and surviving relatives, \nI introduced a resolution on restitution or compensation for property \nand other assets seized by the Nazi and Communist regimes in postwar \nEurope, in anticipation of the International Conference on Holocaust \nAssets that was held in Prague in June 2009. At this conference, the \nUnited States signed the Terezin Declaration, which among many \ndeclarations reminds us about the need to take care of Holocaust \nsurvivors' social welfare as they increase in age.\n  I also introduced the World War II War Crimes Accountability Act to \nencourage foreign governments to prosecute and extradite wanted \ncriminals, and to bring them to justice.\n  We are in a race against time. Each year, more Holocaust survivors \nare laid to rest. Let us work together quickly to let them see a \nmeasure of justice done in their lifetime.\n  Finally, our government has made solemn commitments in the past that \nthe horror of the Holocaust will never be repeated. And yet we are all \nwell aware of the grim stories of ethnic cleansing in the former \nYugoslavia in the 1990s, the mass murder of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994, \nand the genocide in\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\nDarfur. America must be a moral leader among nations in working to halt \nand prevent genocide.\n  I urge President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and U.N. \nAmbassador Rice to continue the battle against ignorance, intolerance, \nand instability that contributes to genocide and to confront those \ngovernments that engage in genocide. America must make every effort to \nensure that those who commit these horrific crimes face \njustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2371-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GUATEMALA'S NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a matter of \nurgent importance for the people of Guatemala and for U.S. relations \nwith Guatemala.\n  Later this month, President Colom will select Guatemala's next \nAttorney General from a slate of six candidates. This may be among the \nmost important decisions he makes this year, at a time when drug \ntrafficking and other organized crimes, assassinations of human rights \ndefenders, and other social and political activists, corruption, and \nimpunity threaten the foundation of Guatemala's fragile democracy.\n  In the 3 three months of this year alone, at least five Guatemalan \nhuman rights defenders, social activists, and trade unionists have been \nmurdered, including two members of the Resistance Front for the Defense \nof Natural Resources--its president, Evelinda Ramirez Reyes, and \nOctavio Roblero. Also killed were Juan Antonio Chea, a Mayan indigenous \nlawyer who worked with the Human Rights Office of the Archbishop and \nthe National Reparations Program; Pedro Antonio Garcia of the Malacatan \nMunicipal Workers Union; and German Antonio Curup, a member of a group \nopposed to the construction of a cement plant in San Juan Sacatepequez. \nMr. Curup was murdered in particularly brutal fashion--abducted on \nFebruary 11, his body was dumped 2 days later, throat cut and showing \nsigns of torture. This type of brutality is not unusual in Guatemala, \nnor is it unusual that no one has been arrested or punished for those \ncrimes.\n  The 1996 Peace Accords were a historic milestone, ending three \ndecades of civil war when government security forces and associated \ndeath squads and civil patrols targeted anyone who was considered \nsubversive. Tens of thousands of rural Mayan villagers, students, \nlawyers, journalists, and other social and political activists were \narbitrarily arrested, tortured, and killed. The URNG rebels were also \nguilty of atrocities. Almost no one has been punished for those crimes.\n  While the Peace Accords spelled out commitments by the government and \ngoals for the country's future political, economic, and social \ndevelopment, progress has been disappointing. Implementation of many \nelements of the accords has been repeatedly delayed, and widespread \ndebilitating poverty, impunity, and women's and indigenous peoples' \nrights remain urgent concerns. These are among the key issues the Peace \nAccords were designed to address, which were at the root of the \nconflict.\n  In the meantime, in the absence of a credible or effective justice \nsystem, corruption has flourished and violent crime has skyrocketed. \nThere has also been a steady emigration of poor Guatemalans seeking \njobs in the United States.\n  Effectively confronting these problems requires political will, which \nhas too often been lacking in Guatemala. Secretary Clinton expressed \nthe willingness of the United States to stand with the Guatemalan \npeople during her visit there on March 5, and I hope the Guatemalan \nGovernment will seize this opportunity to develop ambitious and \neffective strategies to confront these challenges.\n  There is no better place to start than by appointing an Attorney \nGeneral who has the integrity, experience, courage, and determination \nto show that justice can be a reality for all the people of Guatemala \nregardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or economic status.\n  Investigating and prosecuting assassinations of human rights \ndefenders, as well as some of the most notorious political crimes, \nshould be a priority. The United States is helping through our \ndonations to the International Commission against Impunity in \nGuatemala, CICIG. The CICIG is doing an important job and should \ncontinue, but it is no substitute for an effective Ministry of Justice. \nWe are ready and willing to support an Attorney General who \ndemonstrates the necessary professional qualifications and commitment. \nBut absent those qualifications and commitment, as chairman of the \nState and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I would find it difficult to \njustify spending more resources on a fruitless quest for justice reform \nin Guatemala.\n  A related imperative is reforming Guatemala's police forces, which \nare undertrained, underpaid, underequipped, and infected with \ncorruption. President Colom deserves great credit for appointing Helen \nMack, a widely respected human rights defender, to develop a plan for \npolice reform, and I look forward to her recommendations. An Attorney \nGeneral whose integrity matches that of Helen Mack's would be a welcome \nstep.\n  Guatemala has a troubled history and is facing immense challenges, \nboth internally and along its borders, as it is rapidly becoming a \nfavorite haven for Latin criminal organizations. Yet as the land of one \nof the most accomplished pre-Colombian civilizations in this hemisphere \nwhose indigenous descendants enrich present-day Guatemala in countless \nways, spectacular tropical forests and towering volcanoes, it is also a \ncountry with great potential. The United States is prepared to help \ntackle these challenges if Guatemalan Government officials in key \npositions merit our support. I urge President Colom to use the \nopportunity of selecting Guatemala's next Attorney General to send that \nmessage clearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2371-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TOURETTE SYNDROME\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to raise awareness of a \ncomplex neurological disorder affecting an estimated 200,000 Americans. \nTourette Syndrome, TS, emerges in children, as young as 5 years old. \nSymptoms include ``tics,'' repeated involuntary noises or movement. \nSome adults with TS have learned to control their tics, or redirect \nthem in other ways.\n  I have not been knowledgeable on this subject. However, I recently \nhad the pleasure of meeting a group of four--two mothers and two sons--\nall dealing in some way with TS. Zach Pezzillo, a high school junior \nfrom Haiku, Maui, in my State of Hawaii, was diagnosed with TS at age \n7. After 2 years of misdiagnosis, Zach and his mother, Susannah \nChristy, were almost relieved to learn why Zach constantly sniffed. \nZach was fortunate in that his tics were mild. He has become a well \nspoken young man, a gifted photographer, and a wonderful youth \nambassador for the National Tourette Syndrome Association. I am sure \nmuch of his success is due in large part to his mother Susannah, whose \nsupport of her son's drive and openness with his affliction is \nnoteworthy.\n  I also had the pleasure of meeting Chris Schuette, a young man who, \nin his adulthood, has learned to control his tics so well that he was \nable to serve with AmeriCorps in 2007. His mother, Cynthia Schuette, \nheads the Northern California and Hawaii Chapter of the National \nTourette Syndrome Association, and has been involved in educating the \npublic about TS since her son, now 26, was diagnosed with the disorder \nnearly 20 years ago.\n  Not all Americans with TS are as lucky as Zach and Chris. This is a \ndisorder so largely misunderstood that Zach, after telling a \nneurologist about his TS, was challenged by this learned professional, \nwho told him he must not have TS because she couldn't see any physical \nmanifestations of his disorder. Such misinformation leads to \nmisdiagnosis for children with TS. While the Centers for Disease \nControl, through necessary grant programs, continues its essential \nresearch into the causes of TS, we must do our part in educating \nourselves and others about this disorder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2371-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2371-S2372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING BUTLER UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I honor Butler University's 2010 Men's \nBasketball team for its historic season which culminated in last week's \nNCAA championship game in Indianapolis.\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\n  Although the Bulldogs narrowly lost to the Duke University Blue \nDevils, 2010 was a season for the record books.\n  This was Butler's first-trip to the NCAA ``Final Four'' and the best \nperformance by a school of Butler's size in 40 years. Butler entered \nthe championship game with a 25-game winning streak, the longest in the \nNation.\n  The championship was especially meaningful as the team played in \nIndianapolis, nearby the university's home court, the storied Hinkle \nFieldhouse.\n  I particularly want to recognize the work of Butler's coach, Brad \nStevens. Under the leadership of this native Hoosier, the Bulldogs have \nbecome a national power. In his first three seasons, Coach Stevens has \nwon 89 games--a Butler record.\n  Much of that success can be attributed to the Bulldogs' guiding \nphilosophy, the ``Butler Way'' which emphasizes the importance of \nworking as a team, both on and off the court.\n  Dr. Bobby Fong, the university's president, and the faculty and \nadministration of Butler all deserve credit for maintaining the right \nbalance between athletics and academics. Butler has one of the highest \ngraduation rates of all the schools in this year's NCAA Tournament, and \n2 of this year's 15 Academic All-Americans were players for the \nBulldogs.\n  Butler's commitment to both academic and athletic excellence embodies \nthe best of college athletics. I am proud to recognize their winning \ncombination of talent and determination.\n  The Butler University Bulldogs have proved once again that an \nunderdog team from the Hoosier State can capture America's heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2372-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA BEECHER\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to thank and congratulate Virginia \nBeecher for her years of service to the people and State of New \nHampshire. Kathy and I have known Gini for so long, it is best not to \nmention the specific number of years. She is a friend, confidant, and \nsomeone we greatly admire for her extraordinary commitment to public \nservice.\n  Gini completes her work for New Hampshire as the director of Motor \nVehicles, a position she has held for 15 years. Her leadership of this \ncritical agency, which affects so many New Hampshire citizens, has \ntaken it from the dark ages to a highly computerized, customer-friendly \ndepartment. She has focused on providing the citizens of New Hampshire \nwith their licenses and car registrations in an efficient and pleasant \nway. Her commitment has always been to bring the highest standards and \na professional approach to the department.\n  This is only one stop in her exceptional career of service to New \nHampshire. Kathy and I had to convince her to leave her beloved \nDepartment of Safety for a brief tenure in the Governor's office when I \nbegan my term as Governor. It was her unique knowledge of how the State \ngovernment works that helped us get up and running effectively and \nquickly. After she straightened out the Governor's office, she returned \nto continue to be the force that made the Department of Safety one of \nthe most professional and well run agencies in the State.\n  You cannot talk about Gini's influence without mentioning her total \ncommitment to the North Country. It has always been a part of her \nbeing. Gini has a commonsense, no nonsense approach that characterizes \nthat part of our great State.\n  New Hampshire government will obviously miss Gini's talent and \nenthusiasm. Kathy and I wish her the best as she moves on to other \nchallenges. We are honored that our paths have been so intertwined over \nthese many years and that she is our friend.\n  Thank you, Virginia Beecher, for your many years of service to the \nState of New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2372-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2372-S2373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY GROWTH\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, one of the many blessings of being a \nU.S. Senator is the opportunity to be exposed to so many people who \nstrive, work together, and improve their communities and our Nation \nevery day.\n  Despite hardship, America is a place where Americans face challenges \nas opportunities determined to see that tomorrow is always better than \ntoday. One powerful example is the partnership that exists in St. \nJoseph, MO, between community leaders and the Missouri Western State \nUniversity. How pleasing it is to have members of the forward-leaning \nSt. Joseph Area Chamber of Commerce led by Ted Allison come to \nWashington and, as usual, front and center among the distinguished \ngroup is the president of the University, Dr. Robert Vartabedian.\n  How powerful it is to have Mr. Allison testify before the House \nCommittee on Small Business, represented by his Congressman and \ncommittee ranking member, Sam Graves, and speak passionately about the \njob-producing power of the small business community such as exists in \nSt. Joseph, and the importance of education to support small business \nproductivity and growth.\n  Dr. Vartabedian, and his predecessor, Dr. James Scanlon, share the \nview that the University does not exist in isolation but that the \nUniversity should understand and serve the community just as the \ncommunity, in this case, the Chamber of Commerce, and others, serve the \nUniversity.\n  Dr. Scanlon, who retired after 7 years in June of 2008, was a \ntireless head of the school and advocate for the community. Integrity \nand intellect served Dr. Scanlon's action-oriented approach which \ninsisted upon customer-based performance. He never rested and he did \nnot allow members of the St. Joseph community to rest either. After \nall, the community included future employers and neighbors of his kids \nand Dr. Scanlon was interested in them having productive and happy \nlives far beyond graduation.\n  Originally a New Yorker, of all things, one would think Dr. Scanlon \nalways lived in St. Joseph and intended never to leave, but his \nremarkable footprint continued under the current leadership and has \nprovided a foundation for continued vision and performance. ``Oh happy \nday!'' became his trademark exclamation, and while I hope it was for \nDr. Scanlon, I am certain that because of him, it has been for \nthousands of students and their faculty and community members.\n  In a large part thanks to Dr. Scanlon, and now, Dr. Vartabedian's \nleadership, Western has thrived, becoming a source of pride for the \ncommunity, region, and state.\n  Western's statewide mission is applied learning. Remarkably, about 90 \npercent of Western students completed at least one internship, \npractica, or faculty-student project by the time they graduate. In \nother words, Western students have classroom and real-world experience.\n  Since 2001, the college has become a university, experienced its \nfifth straight year of record enrollments, doubled its laboratory space \nfor sciences, undertaken to fill its capacity at the new Science & \nTechnology Incubator, built up modern math and science capacity, began \na new M.S. program in Nursing, became the summer home of the Kansas \nCity Chiefs, and has seen the establishment of the Steven L. Craig \nSchool of Business.\n  According to Missouri Western, the gift by Mr. Craig that made the \nnew school possible ``means serious business for Western.''\n  The generosity by Mr. Craig will not only launch another valuable \npath for students to develop value, but represents a strong endorsement \nof the Western program, and the sense of community in St. Joseph where \nCraig was born.\n  Mr. Craig graduated from nearby Savannah High School before moving to \nCalifornia to graduate from the University of Southern California. He \nfounded the Craig Realty Group, a Newport Beach, CA, company that owns \nand manages 13 upscale factory outlet centers in 6 states.\n  The gift of $5.5 million was one of the very largest in the Nation \nand the largest individual gift to the university's foundation. In \naddition to being the largest individual gift to the university, these \nfunds will directly enhance St. Joseph, MO, the Midwest region, and \nwill be used to develop tomorrow's business leaders who should follow \nnot only Mr. Craig's business model, but his model of selfless \nphilanthropy as well.\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\n  Missouri Western officials recognize that Mr. Craig's gift celebrates \nthree of his qualities: entrepreneurial spirit, generosity, and faith.\n  This conspiracy of goodness by a true working community on behalf of \na future community membership is a model to applaud and to emulate. \nDoctors Scanlon and Vartabedian, Mr. Allison, Mr. Craig and all those \nwho have locked arms with you leaders to plow forward, thank you and \nwell done and, more importantly, well doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2373-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING SAN BERNARDINO'S BICENTENNIAL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored today to join with the \npeople of San Bernardino as they celebrate their bicentennial--the \n200th anniversary of the founding of this great city.\n  From the day in 1810 when Franciscan missionary Father Dumetz named \nthe area ``San Bernardino'' to the present, San Bernardino--nestled \nsouth of the San Bernardino Mountains and west of the lower desert--has \nbeen recognized for its scenic beauty and strategic location.\n  San Bernardino's colorful history begins in the early years of the \n19th century when Spanish missionaries were the first settlers to the \nregion. Mission San Bernardino was established in 1810 and the \nmissionaries, along with the American Indians native to the area, \ndiverted water to the valley from Mill Creek for irrigation purposes. \nAs a result, the area flourished.\n  Gradually the mission period came to a close and soon came the rise \nof the Great Spanish Rancheros. The abandoned Mission San Bernardino \ndid not stay vacant for long. San Bernardino Rancho was granted to the \nLugo Brothers in 1842 and eventually became an important post on the \ntrading route known as the Spanish Trail, where pioneer trailblazers \nsuch as Kit Carson and Jedediah Strong Smith often traveled.\n  In 1848, California joined the United States. By this time, many \nrancheros had left the area. In 1851, the Lugo brothers eventually sold \nSan Bernardino Rancho to a party of 500 Mormon settlers who built a \nstockade around the ranch and named it ``Fort San Bernardino''. The \ncommunity thrived and was officially incorporated in 1854 as a city \nwith a population of 1,200. At that time, San Bernardino was strictly a \ntemperance town, with no drinking or gambling allowed.\n  As the 19th century waned, the giant railway companies eventually \nfound their way to San Bernardino, changing it from a sleepy town into \nan enterprising city. Santa Fe, Union Pacific, and Southern Pacific all \nmade San Bernardino the hub of their southern California operations. \nWhen the Santa Fe Railway established a transcontinental link in 1886, \nthe already prosperous valley exploded. Even more settlers flocked from \nthe East, and the population doubled between 1900 and 1910.\n  San Bernardino has had a great history with military involvement. The \nSan Bernardino Engineer Depot, commonly called Camp Ono, was located \nalong what is now the I-215 freeway was used by the U.S. Army as a \nvehicle and ammunition supply and storage depot, drycleaning facility, \nsewage spreading area, tent manufacturing and dyeing facility, \nlocomotive maintenance facility, railcar and tank degreasing facility, \nmotor vehicle pool, prisoner of war camp, bomb manufacturing, and water \nsoftening facility.\n  The site was also a part of the Advance Communications Zone Depot in \nthe southern California defense system. Camp Ono consisted of a total \nof 1,662.82 acres and was leased by the U.S. Army on 1 July 1940 and \nexisted until December 1946. A prisoner of war camp occupied 300 acres \nof the site. Approximately 499 Italian prisoners of war were \nincarcerated, and they were used to maintain army vehicles, degrease \ntanks, and operated a tent repair and tent dyeing facility.\n  Norton Air Force Base was also located east of downtown San \nBernardino. This frontline military installation was home to a \nlogistics depot and heavy-lift transport facility for a wide variety of \nmilitary aircraft, equipment, and supplies as part of the Material/Air \nForce Logistics Command and then as part of the Military Airlift \nCommand. The secondary mission of the base was as a headquarters for \nAerospace Defense Command for southern California, the Air Force Audio-\nVisual Center and numerous Air Force Reserve units and the Office of \nthe Inspector General.\n  Norton was closed as a result of base realignment and closure, BRAC, \naction in 1994. The aviation facilities of the base were converted into \nSan Bernardino International Airport and the remainder for other \nprivate development opportunities. Mattel Toys, Stater Bros Markets, \nPep Boys, and Kohl's also are located within the industrial complex on \nthe former base.\n  McDonald's was founded by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald in \nSan Bernardino in 1940. Their introduction of the Speedee Service \nSystem in 1948 established the principles of the modern fast-food \nrestaurant.\n  San Bernardino is also the home of Al Houghton Stadium and the \nWestern Regional Little League Inc. Each year San Bernardino hosts 11 \nWestern States in the West and Northwest regional tournaments. The \nwinner of each tournament goes on to the Little League World Series in \nWilliamsport, PA.\n  San Bernardino has a plethora of educational opportunities. \nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino, was founded in 1965 and \ngraduated its first class in 1969. From a very small beginning, this \nuniversity has flourished with new facilities and Division II sports \nprograms.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nmilitary service of Thomas Edward Pinelli, a veteran of World War II \nwho is being honored in Washington, DC, this week.\n  Mr. Pinelli served as a forward observer and technical sergeant in \nthe Third Infantry Division, which fought the Germans through the \nVosges Mountains in France, through the Colmar Pocket, and finally \nuntil VE day in Germany. As part of this division, he helped liberate \nthe Dachau concentration camp and free thousands of civilians who were \nunder Hitler's rule. His division received a unit citation from \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Sergeant Pinelli was awarded \nmedals for sharp shooting and good conduct.\n  After World War II, Thomas returned to his hometown of Bronx, NY, \nwhere he began a career with the U.S. Postal Service. After 30 years, \nhe retired in Westchester County, where he now resides.\n  As grateful as Thomas Pinelli is for the opportunity to serve his \ncountry, he is even more grateful for the opportunity to have lived a \nfull life in service to his community as a committed citizen, husband, \nand father. Mr. Pinelli's two sons are also giving back to their \ncommunities as they emulate their father's commitment to service: his \nelder son Thomas Jr. is a health care provider, and his younger son \nJohn teaches high school in New York City.\n  On April 14 and 15, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum honored Thomas \nPinelli and many others for their role in liberating the Dachau \nConcentration Camp in April 1945. Thomas traveled to Washington for \nthis ceremony, thrilled at the chance to visit the Nation's Capital, to \nsee old friends, and to relive this momentous time in American history. \nI wish to congratulate him on this honor and thank him for his service \nto our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2373-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2373-S2374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DALE E. KLEIN\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Honorable Dale E. Klein \ncompleted his last day as a member of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission on March 30,\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\n2010, and has returned to the faculty of the University of Texas, from \nwhich he had been on an extended leave of absence as the result of his \nappointment by former President George W. Bush to the Department of \nDefense and subsequently to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Dr. \nKlein began his tenure at the NRC on July 1, 2006, having been \nappointed by the President as the agency's Chairman. He continued to \nserve in that role until May 13, 2009, when President Obama designated \nGregory B. Jaczko as the NRC Chairman. Although Dr. Klein would have \npreferred to return to the University of Texas at that time, he elected \nto remain an NRC Commissioner from May 2009 to March 30, 2010, to \nensure continuity of the Commission until the President could nominate, \nand the U.S. Senate could confirm, his successor and two additional new \nCommissioners to fill existing vacancies on the Commission.\n  Dr. Klein's tenure as the NRC Chairman coincided with the rapid \nacceleration in the nuclear industry's plans for the development of a \nnew generation of U.S. nuclear power plants. By the time of his \ndeparture from the agency, the NRC had received 18 applications for 28 \nnew nuclear power plants after nearly three decades in which no new \nnuclear plants had been constructed in the U.S. This dramatic \nresurgence of the nuclear power option created an urgent and very \ncritical need for the NRC to hire an unprecedented number of new staff \nsince many of the agency's most experienced technical staff were \nnearing retirement age and the agency had critical skill shortages in \nsuch areas as construction inspection. Dr. Klein provided oversight and \ndirection to the recruiting effort, which at its peak would result in \nnet annual increases of approximately 250 new staff. In the absence of \nthis effort, the NRC would not have been able to complete its technical \nreviews of new applications on a time frame that would support the \nnuclear industry's plans or meet the Nation's growing need for new \nsources of clean, safe, and affordable energy.\n  At the same time, Dr. Klein recognized that the resurgence in \ninterest in nuclear power was a global phenomenon that was occurring \nboth in countries with established nuclear power programs and countries \nwith no prior experience with nuclear power. He consistently emphasized \nthe critical importance of establishing and maintaining a strong, \nindependent national nuclear regulatory authority in all countries \nconsidering the nuclear power option in his numerous meetings with his \ninternational regulatory counterparts in foreign countries, in meetings \nof international organizations like the IAEA, and during his frequent \ntrips to foreign countries. Noting that an accident anywhere is an \naccident everywhere, he also ensured that the NRC provided assistance \nin setting up national nuclear regulatory bodies when requested by the \nhost country.\n  Dr. Klein understood that for the NRC to continue to be an \noutstanding regulatory agency that could serve as a model for foreign \ncountries, it needed good people, a strong safety culture, and the \nright technology. He observed that when he arrived at the NRC in July \n2006, the agency had an outstanding technical staff and a strong safety \nculture, but was far behind the times in its technology infrastructure. \nHe spent considerable time and effort in upgrading NRC's technology \ninfrastructure not only to ensure improved communication within the NRC \nand with its stakeholders, but also to enable the NRC to attract and \nretain the young people that would become the core agency staff in the \nfuture.\n  As the NRC accelerated its hiring of new staff after 2006, however, \nthe existing NRC headquarters complex, the White Flint Complex in \nRockville, MD, could no longer accommodate the headquarters staff, \nforcing the NRC to rent additional space in four other buildings in the \nRockville area. This dispersal represented a return to conditions \nexisting at the time of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, when \nthe NRC was widely dispersed in 11 buildings in the Washington \nMetropolitan area. A study published after the accident cited the \nmultiple, scattered locations of the agency's headquarters staff as a \nfactor hampering the NRC's response to the 1979 accident. Consequently, \nDr. Klein made it one of his highest priority goals as Chairman to \nreconsolidate NRC headquarters in a single location in the vicinity of \nthe White Flint complex. Most of the preparatory work and obtaining \nlocal government, GSA, and Congressional approval for the construction \nof a third building at the White Flint complex occurred under the \nguidance and direction of Dr. Klein during his tenure as Chairman.\n  Dr. Klein has made very significant contributions to maintaining the \nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission as the world's first and most \nexperienced nuclear regulatory body and has demonstrated over the last \n7 years his commitment to public service and protection of the public \nhealth and safety. I am therefore pleased to ask my Senate colleagues \nto join me in recognizing this outstanding public servant and in \nwishing him and his family success in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2374-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AARON MARTIN\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor Aaron Martin, a \nnative of Stuttgart from my home State of Arkansas. His bravery and \nthat of his fellow servicemen and women made national headlines \nrecently as they captured a group of Somali pirates in the Indian \nOcean.\n  A 1994 Stuttgart High School graduate, Martin was among the sailors \nwho took on a small gang of Somali pirates in the early morning hours \nof April 1. The USS Nicholas, a guided missile warship, was tracking \nthe pirates when they opened fire in Indian Ocean waters, according to \nreports. The USS Nicholas, which saw combat in the first Gulf War, \nreturned fire and disabled the small ship.\n  Martin is the son of Bruce and Janette Martin of Stuttgart. He and \nhis wife Natalie have an 8-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I am grateful for the service and sacrifice \nof all of our military servicemembers and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2374-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2374-S2375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING THE LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I congratulate Little Rock \nAir Force Base and its community council for winning the prestigious \n2009 Abilene Trophy, which is presented annually to a civilian \ncommunity for outstanding support to a nearby U.S. Air Force Air \nMobility Command Base. The winner is determined by a selection \ncommittee of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce Military Affairs Committee \nin Texas, with final approval by the U.S. Air Force Air Mobility \nCommand.\n  According to COL Greg Otey, Little Rock Air Force Base Installation \nCommander, ``the council's steadfast support of the base, its missions \nand its people haven't gone unnoticed. I've said many times that we are \nblessed to have such a supportive local community, and this award \nvalidates everything I've been saying since I arrived here last year.''\n  Little Rock Air Force Base is known as the ``Home of C-130 Combat \nAirlift'' in large part due to the outstanding relationship among its \ncommunity partners. The relationship between the base and local \ncommunity remains as strong today as when it began in the 1950s, and \ncommunity support is integral to the base's ability to accomplish its \nmission.\n  For example, in 2009, ground was broken on a new Joint Education \nCenter, a higher-learning institution open to both military members and \ncivilians. The city of Jacksonville voted to support the center with \nanother $5 million of its own. Airpower Arkansas, a subset of the \nCommunity Council, raised more than $50,000 from local business and \nindividuals for the base's 2010 air show. Civic leaders sponsored base \nevents such as the Air Force Ball, the Annual Awards Ceremony, and the \nBlack Knight Heritage Dinner. These leaders also took time on \nThanksgiving and Christmas to serve meals to Airmen at the base dining \nfacility.\n  I commend the Little Rock Air Force Base and its community council \nfor their efforts, hard work, and dedication. Along with all Arkansans, \nI am grateful for the service and sacrifice of all of our military \nservicemembers and their families.\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2375-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THE GOLDEN LIONS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

In particular, I recognize \nCoach Ivory, who was recently named the 2010 National Coach of the Year \nby the Heritage Sports Radio Network, which covers sporting events for \nour nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Ivory \nreceived this honor based on voting from basketball fans across the \nNation.\n  Under the leadership of Chancellor Lawrence A.

UAPB earned a \n61-44 victory over Winthrop during the NCAA tournament, advancing to \nthe next round. The Golden Lions' tournament appearance marked the \nfirst in the program's history. The Golden Lions finished the season \n18-16, capturing their first overall winning season since rejoining the \nSouthwestern Athletic Conference in 1997.\n  I commend the entire UAPB community for their support of the Golden \nLions team, and for building an environment where students have the \nopportunity to reach their academic goals and achieve their \ndreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2375-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1258.

A bill to ensure that amounts credited to the Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund are used for harbor maintenance; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Harbor \nMaintenance Act, a bill with bipartisan and multi-regional support that \nwould help ensure that funds deposited into the Harbor Maintenance \nTrust Fund would be used for their intended purposes: to properly \nmaintain and operate our Federal harbors and ports.\n  The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, also known as the HMTF, was \ncreated to collect fees in order to pay for the\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\nmaintenance and operation costs of Federal harbors and ports. While \nnearly \\1/4\\ of the U.S. gross domestic product flows through these \nharbors, over half of these important ports are not maintained to their \nauthorized dimensions. This results in less efficient and more \npolluting transport, as well as an increased risk of vessel groundings \nand collisions. One of the ways to ensure a robust and sustainable \neconomic recovery includes strengthening our Nation's infrastructure, \nwhich includes our navigational infrastructure.\n  Every year, hundreds of millions of dollars are collected into the \nHMTF but never spent, even though there are critical navigation needs. \nFor example, the Army Corps of Engineers estimates a backlog of about \n15 million cubic yards of dredging needs at commercial federally-\nauthorized Great Lakes harbors and channels. This dredging backlog has \nresulted in freighters getting stuck in channels, ships having to carry \nreduced loads, and some shipments simply stopping altogether.Dredging \nto proper depths is critical not only for Michigan's economy, but for \nthe Nation's economy, as these shipments include commodities that fuel \nour Nation's industries, products for construction, fuel for heating \nand cooling homes and businesses, and agricultural products for export.\n  Similar navigational infrastructure needs exist throughout our \ncountry, and the range of cosponsors from different parts of the \ncountry demonstrates this bill would help improve the navigational \ninfrastructure across the Nation. This bill also has the support of a \nbroad coalition called the Realize America's Maritime Promise, which is \nmade up of hundreds of port authorities, vessel operators, port \ncommunities, public and private terminal operators, pilot associations, \ndredging companies, shipbuilders, maritime labor unions, manufacturers, \nbulk cargo owners and shippers, and other companies and associations \ndependent on fully accessible navigation channels.\n  Currently, the HMTF has a surplus that exceeds $5 billion. Beginning \nin 2003, funds appropriated for harbor and channel maintenance have \nbeen significantly below annual HMTF collections. To help ensure these \nbacklogs do not continue to grow, this bill would allow any Member of \nCongress to make a point of order against an appropriations bill if the \ntotal revenue for that fiscal year, as projected in the President's \nannual budget request, is not fully appropriated for its intended \nnavigational infrastructure purposes. Similar problems with funding \nbacklogs occurred with the Highway Trust Fund and the Airports and \nAirways Trust Fund. Congress responded by enacting legislation to \naddress these problems. Congress should do the same for the Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund. Our Nation's infrastructure--whether it be \nroadways, airports, or ports and harbors--should be treated the same \nway. Shipping by water is the most efficient means of transporting bulk \ncommodities, and we should make sure our Nation's navigational \ninfrastructure can effectively handle these shipments, rather than \nallowing these ports and harbors to exist in a state of disrepair.\n  A sustainable economic recovery depends on strong infrastructure. \nPassing this bill would help us advance our recovery and improve our \neconomic competitiveness. I urge your support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Kaufman):\n  S. 3214. A bill to prohibit any person from engaging in certain video \nsurveillance except under the same conditions authorized under chapter \n119 of title 18, United States Code, or as authorized by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Surreptitious Video Surveillance Act of 2010, on behalf of Senator \nFeingold, Senator Kaufman, and myself.\n  This is a bill which I submit is necessary to protect our citizens \nfrom unwarranted intrusions in their homes. The bill regulates the use \nof surreptitious video surveillance in private residences where there \nis a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n  Earlier this year, in Lower Merion Township, a suburb of \nPhiladelphia, it was discovered that laptops taken home by students \ncould be activated by school officials and thereby see what was going \non inside a private residence.\n  Surprisingly, this kind of surreptitious surveillance is not \nprohibited under Federal law. The wiretap laws specify it is a \nviolation of law to intercept a telephone conversation or to have a \nmicrophone that overhears a private conversation, but if it is visual, \nthere is no prohibition.\n  This issue has been in the public domain since 1984--more than 25 \nyears ago--when Judge Richard Posner, in the case captioned U.S. v. \nTorres, said this:\n\n       Electronic interception, being by nature a continuing \n     rather than one-shot invasion, is even less discriminating \n     than a physical search, because it picks up private \n     conversations (most of which will usually have nothing to do \n     with any illegal activity) over a long period of time. . . . \n     [E]lectronic interception is thought to pose a greater \n     potential threat to personal privacy than physical searches. \n     . . . Television surveillance is identical in its \n     indiscriminate character to wiretapping and bugging.\n\n  Judge Posner identified the problem a long time ago. Yet it lay \ndormant until this incident in Lower Merion Township brought it into \nthe public fore.\n  On March 29, in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee \non Crime and Drugs, we conducted a hearing in Philadelphia. We had an \narray of experts very forcefully identify the problem and the need for \ncorrective action.\n  The New York Times editorialized, on April 2, 2010, in favor of this \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the bill. I think there is \nlikely to be widespread acceptance that in an era of warrantless \nwiretaps, when privacy is so much at risk, we ought to fill the gap in \nthe law to cover this kind of electronic surveillance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the New York \nTimes editorial dated April 2, 2010, the text of my full statement and \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 2, 2010]\n\n                      Editorial: About That Webcam\n\n       A Pennsylvania town has been roiled by a local high school \n     using cameras in school-issued laptops to spy on students. \n     Almost as shocking is the fact that the federal wiretap law \n     that should prohibit this kind of surveillance does not cover \n     spying done through photography and video in private \n     settings.\n       Senator Arlen Specter, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, is \n     proposing to amend the federal wiretap statute to prohibit \n     visual spying that is not approved by a court in advance. \n     Congress should move quickly to make this change.\n       Lower Merion, outside of Philadelphia, gave students at \n     Harriton High School laptops that they could take home to use \n     to do their work. It did not tell the students, however, that \n     the laptops were equipped with special software that allowed \n     them to observe the students through the computers' built-in \n     cameras. The purpose, the school district later explained, \n     was to protect the laptops from theft or damage.\n       Using this surveillance capability, school officials found \n     images that led them to believe that Blake Robbins, a 15-\n     year-old student, was using illegal drugs. Mr. Robbins said \n     the ``pills'' he was seen consuming were Mike and Ike \n     candies. His parents filed a lawsuit against the school \n     district, charging that it had illegally spied on their son.\n       Conducting video surveillance of students in their homes is \n     an enormous invasion of their privacy. If the district was \n     really worried about losing the laptops, it could have used \n     GPS devices to track their whereabouts or other less-\n     intrusive methods. Whatever it did, the school had a \n     responsibility to inform students that if they accepted the \n     laptops, they would also accept monitoring.\n       The law should also do more. The Wiretap Act prohibits \n     electronic eavesdropping on conversations and intercepting \n     transmitted communications, such as e-mail. It does not cover \n     visual surveillance. That was a mistake when parts of the law \n     were passed in 1986, but it is an even bigger problem today, \n     with the ubiquity of cellphone cameras, and online video \n     services.\n       The act should be amended to prohibit video and \n     photographic surveillance of people without their consent in \n     their homes, hotels, and any other place in which they have a \n     legitimate expectation of privacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Floor Statement of Senator Arlen Specter in Support of the \n              Surreptitious Video Surveillance Act of 2010\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce the \n     Surreptitious Video Surveillance Act of 2010, a bill needed \n     to protect our citizens from unwarranted intrusions in their \n     homes. This bill regulates the use of surreptitious video \n     surveillance in private\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\n     residences where there is a reasonable expectation of \n     privacy.\n       In February of this year, national and international news \n     stories covered an alleged incident in the Lower Merion \n     School District in Montgomery County, PA. According to a \n     lawsuit filed in Federal court, the Harriton High School \n     administrators in Lower Merion allegedly engaged in \n     surreptitious video surveillance of a student in his bedroom \n     by using a remotely activated webcam on a school laptop. If \n     these allegations are true, the school engaged in a \n     significant invasion of an individual's fundamental right of \n     privacy. Michael and Holly Robbins, parents of the high \n     school student, allege that the school used a webcam, which \n     was part of a theft tracking software program installed in \n     each school-issued laptop, to remotely take photographs of \n     their son in their home. The parents allege that the school \n     district's actions amounted to ``spying'' and conducting \n     unlawful ``surveillance,'' and they claim that they were not \n     given prior notice that the school could remotely activate \n     the embedded webcam at any time.\n       This is something that could happen almost anywhere and at \n     any time in our country. Many corporations, government \n     agencies and schools loan laptops to employees and students. \n     And many of these laptops have webcams with the ability to \n     take video or still shots that can be operated remotely.\n       The alleged webcam spying case raises important and \n     fundamental issues concerning the rights of individuals to \n     privacy in their homes for themselves and for their children, \n     and shows how those rights can conflict with important rights \n     that owners of property have to conduct surveillance to \n     protect their property and to maintain safety.\n       On Monday, March 29, 2010, I chaired a Subcommittee on \n     Crime and Drugs field hearing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n     At that hearing, we heard from a host of experts that Title \n     III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, known \n     as the Federal Wiretap Act, does not forbid video \n     surveillance. Title III creates criminal and civil liability \n     for secretly recording conversations in a room or on the \n     telephone, as well as interceptions of email communications, \n     without a court order. But since the Wiretap Act was passed \n     in 1968, it has never covered silent visual images. This \n     conclusion is supported by a large body of case law and is \n     also bolstered by Congress' clear legislative history. After \n     studying the matter, I announced that I would introduce \n     legislation to close this gap in coverage. On April 2, 2010, \n     the New York Times editorial page noted I would introduce \n     legislation ``to amend the federal wiretap statute to \n     prohibit visual spying that is not approved by a court in \n     advance'' and went on to say, ``Congress should move quickly \n     to make this change.''\n       Technology is changing fast--faster than our federal laws \n     can keep up. More than 25 years ago, Judge Richard Posner in \n     United States v. Torres, 751 F.2d 875, 884-885 (7th Cir. \n     1984), saw the need for Congress to address video \n     surveillance when he wrote:\n\n       Electronic interception, being by nature a continuing \n     rather than one-shot invasion, is even less discriminating \n     than a physical search, because it picks up private \n     conversations (most of which will usually have nothing to do \n     with any illegal activity) over a long period of time . . . \n     [E]lectronic interception is thought to pose a greater \n     potential threat to personal privacy than physical searches . \n     . . Television surveillance is identical in its \n     indiscriminate character to wiretapping and bugging (emphasis \n     in original).\n\n     Holding that Title III did not apply to secret television \n     cameras placed by the government in a safe house to observe \n     members of the FALN terrorist organization build bombs, Judge \n     Posner specifically invited Congress to respond ``to the \n     issues discussed in this opinion by amending Title III to \n     bring television surveillance within its scope.''\n       The bill I am introducing today, the Surreptitious Video \n     Surveillance Act of 2010, makes that long overdue correction \n     to the law. The bill strikes the necessary and correct \n     balance of protecting important privacy rights without \n     proscribing the visual surveillance needed to protect our \n     property and safety. It does this simply by amending the \n     Federal Wiretap Act to treat video surveillance the same as \n     an interception of an electronic communication. Video \n     surveillance is defined in the bill to mean the intentional \n     recording of visual images of an individual in an area of a \n     residence that is not readily observable from a public \n     location and in which the individual has a reasonable \n     expectation of privacy.\n       The bill does not regulate video surveillance where another \n     resident or individual present in the residence consents to \n     the surveillance. Thus, the bill does not regulate cameras in \n     the workplace, does not prohibit the use of cameras in \n     undercover operations using confidential informants, and does \n     not include residential security systems that use video \n     cameras.\n       Many of us expect to be subject to certain kinds of video \n     surveillance when we leave our homes and go out each day--at \n     the ATM machine, at traffic lights, or in stores for example. \n     We expect this and we do not mind because we understand that \n     such surveillance helps to protect us and our property. What \n     we do not expect, however, is to be under visual surveillance \n     in our homes, in our bedrooms, and most especially, we do not \n     expect it for our children in our homes. Today cameras in \n     computers and in cell phones are ubiquitous, making it more \n     urgent that the Federal Wiretap Act be amended to prohibit \n     video surveillance of people without their consent in their \n     homes. I urge the Senate to make this long overdue correction \n     to the law and pass this bill quickly to protect important \n     privacy rights of all Americans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 3214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntaxpayer protection and assistance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on this annual Tax Day, I rise to \nintroduce the Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act of 2007, a robust \npackage of reforms aimed at protecting the rights of all American \ntaxpayers. I am pleased that my colleagues on the Finance Committee, \nSenators Schumer, Kerry, and Menendez, as well as Senators Akaka, Brown \nof Ohio, Dodd, Durbin, Lieberman, Merkley, Pryor, and Udall of New \nMexico, are joining me in introducing this bill.\n  This act consists of numerous well-vetted provisions, which will \nensure our nation's taxpayers are better able to prepare and file their \ntax returns each year in a fashion that is fair, reasonable, and \naffordable.\n  First, the act clarifies taxpayers' rights and responsibilities by \nrequiring Treasury to publish an easy-to-understand Taxpayer Bill of \nRights, enumerating taxpayers' rights and obligation, and corresponding \nInternal Revenue Code citations. As the National Taxpayer Advocate has \nexplained: ``The [Internal Revenue] Code contains no comprehensive \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights that explicitly and transparently sets out \ntaxpayer rights and obligations. Taxpayers do have rights, but they are \nscattered throughout the [Internal Revenue] Code and the Internal \nRevenue Manual and are neither easily accessible nor written in plain \nlanguage that most taxpayers can understand.'' The act would rectify \nthese shortcomings, without conferring any rights or obligations not \nalready provided for under law.\n  Second, the act supports programs that assist low-income taxpayers. \nIt authorizes a $35 million grant program for Volunteer Income Tax \nAssistance, VITA, programs. VITA programs across the country offer free \ntax assistance to low- to moderate-income individuals who cannot afford \nprofessional assistance. More than 75,000 VITA volunteers prepare basic \ntax returns for these taxpayers; typically VITA programs focus on at \nleast one specific underserved group with special needs--such as \npersons with disabilities, non-English speaking persons, Native \nAmericans, rural taxpayers, and the elderly. During the 2009 filing \nseason, VITA programs prepared more than 1.2 million tax returns and \nbrought back over $1.6 billion in tax refunds to working families.\n  I have seen firsthand the impact that free tax-preparation clinics \ncan have on taxpayers and their communities. In fact, New Mexico is \nfortunate to have one of the nation's leading programs. Tax Help New \nMexico began 35 years ago at Central New Mexico Community College, CNM, \nas a practical means of giving accounting students work experience in \ntax preparation while serving a community need. But while 70 percent of \nNew Mexicans are eligible for Tax Help New Mexico's services, only 6.5 \npercent are able to take advantage. To enable community VITA programs \nlike Tax Help New Mexico to reach more underserved low-income \ntaxpayers, the act authorizes a $35 million IRS grant program.\n  Likewise, the act would strengthen Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics. These \nclinics, typically operated by community organizations and law schools, \nprovide representation to low-income taxpayers in disputes with the \nIRS. The act authorizes the Treasury Secretary to refer taxpayers to \nthese clinics. It also increases to $20 million annually the \nauthorization for LITC grant programs. This will provide a substantial \nboost to clinics that serve this vital function, such as that which the \nUniversity of New Mexico Law School operates for taxpayers in my state.\n  Third, the act enhances the regulation of paid tax-return preparers. \nNearly all professions--from beauticians to mortuaries to opticians--\nare regulated at the state level. But with only a handful of \nexceptions, states do not regulate tax return preparers. Nor does the \nfederal government currently regulate unenrolled tax return preparers, \ni.e., return preparers who are not CPAs, attorneys, enrolled agents, or \nenrolled actuaries--all already regulated under IRS Circular 230. A \nsignificant percentage of unenrolled preparers are well-trained and \nmaintain high ethical standards. But untrained and unscrupulous tax \nreturn preparers can inflict serious harm on taxpayers and \nsignificantly undermine tax compliance.\n  For years, taxpayers, tax professionals, and the National Taxpayer \nAdvocate have been calling for federal regulation of unenrolled \npreparers. In early 2010, the IRS began taking steps to exercise \noversight over these unenrolled preparers. I applaud the IRS's \ninitiative. But it is still unclear that the IRS's program will be \nsufficiently comprehensive. Moreover, many see a benefit in clarifying \nthe scope of the IRS's regulatory authority.\n  The act responds to these concerns by codifying a regulatory system \nfor unenrolled preparers. In order for a tax preparer to become \nregistered and authorized by Treasury, the act requires preparers to \npass a basic background check and an examination of competency and \nethics standards. To remain in good standing, preparers will be \nrequired to satisfy continuing education requirements or be reexamined \nevery three years on changes in tax law and common preparation \nmistakes. The act requires Treasury to maintain and publish for \ntaxpayers a comprehensive list of all authorized tax return preparers, \nincluding Circular 230 preparers.\n  Fourth, the act creates an oversight system for tax refund delivery \nproducts. Refund Anticipation Loans, RALs, are high-cost bank loans \nsecured by a taxpayer's expected refund--loans that typically last 7 to \n14 days, until the actual IRS refund arrives and is used to repay the \nloan. RALs are often aggressively marketed by paid income-tax \npreparers, which advertise ``Instant Refunds'' or ``Quick Cash,'' \nsometimes disguising that they are selling advance loans on anticipated \ntax refunds. According to the National Consumer Law Center: ``Tax \npreparers and their bank partners made approximately 8.7 million RALs \nduring the 2007 tax-filing season. . . .'' In my state of New Mexico, \n25 percent of taxpayers eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit \nreceived a RAL in 2005.\n  RALs might offer quick cash, but they are not a good deal for \ntaxpayers. As the National Consumer Law Center exposed in a 2009 \nreport, the typical RAL of about $3,000 carries an annual percentage \nrate, APR, from 77 percent to 140 percent. We know that our vulnerable \ncommunities are particularly susceptible to RALs. In fact, a recent \nstudy by the First Nations Development Institute and Center for \nResponsible Lending found that RALs drained over $9.1 million from \nNative American communities in 2005.\n  I am very troubled by the prevalence of RALs. And to begin addressing \nproblems associated with them, the act requires Treasury to establish a \nregistration program for those involved in the process of facilitating \na tax refund delivery product, RDP, including RALs. Additionally, \nRDP facilitators will be required to disclose in writing and in an \neasily understandable format the taxpayer's options for receiving tax \nrefunds, listed from least expensive to most expensive, the RDP's loan \nterms and fee schedule, and any other costs that the taxpayer may incur \nin filing a tax return. Moreover, the Act would prohibit Treasury from \nissuing a Refund Indicator, a score on which RDP facilitators rely \nbefore issuing a RDP, unless Treasury first determines that the \ntaxpayer's refund would not be prevented by debts the taxpayer owes on \nstudent loans, child support, or by other provisions in the Tax Code. \nThis additional screen will minimize the likelihood that a taxpayer \nwill be issued a loan based on a refund claim that will not ultimately \nmaterialize\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nand which the taxpayer would nonetheless be required to repay.\n\n  Fifth, the act requires additional protections before the IRS files a \nfederal tax lien. The IRS has a number of enforcement tools at its \ndisposal to ensure tax compliance, but use of these tools must be \nbalanced with the need to ensure taxpayers do not suffer unnecessary \nlong-term harm as a result. One such tool is the filing of a Notice of \nFederal Tax Lien, NFTL, when a taxpayer owes back taxes. But as the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate explains in her 2009 Report to Congress: \n``[The filing of a tax lien can significantly harm the taxpayer's \ncredit and affect his or her ability to obtain financing, find or \nretain a job, secure affordable housing or insurance, and ultimately \npay the outstanding tax debt. For these reasons, the National Taxpayer \nAdvocate believes that the IRS should not automatically file NFTLs but \ninstead should carefully consider and balance these competing interests \nwhen determining whether a lien filing is appropriate.'' In my state \nalone, the IRS filed nearly 5,000 liens against taxpayers last year. \nThe act would require the IRS to make individualized determinations \nbefore filing an NFTL, and in doing so to consider several enumerated \nfactors, including the amount due, the taxpayer's compliance history, \nand any extenuating circumstances.\n  Sixth, the act establishes a demonstration program to provide \naccounts to those who currently lack bank accounts. IRS data show that \nof the 60 million Federal tax refunds that were issued via paper checks \nin 2005, almost half went to households earning $30,000 or less. These \nhouseholds are most likely to lack access to reasonably-priced \nfinancial services--and thus most likely to pay a disproportionate \namount of their income to conduct routine financial transactions. Yet \nthe issuance of a refund check presents an important opportunity to \nbring these low-income taxpayers into the financial mainstream. The act \nauthorizes Treasury to award eligible entities demonstration project \ngrants so that they can establish accounts for individuals who \ncurrently lack bank accounts. The act also requires a study on the \nfeasibility of delivering tax refunds on debit, prepaid, and other \nelectronic cards.\n  Finally, the act requires the IRS to study processing information \nreturns and the effectiveness of collection alternatives. Currently, \nthe IRS processes income tax returns before it processes most \ninformation returns, such as W-2s and 1099s. From the taxpayer's \nperspective, this leads to millions of cases where taxpayers may \ninadvertently make overclaims that the IRS does not identify until \nmonths later, exposing the taxpayer not only to additional tax \nliability, but to penalties and interest. This sequence also provides \nopportunities for fraud and requires the IRS to devote resources that \nshould have not been paid and that it often cannot recover. The act \nalso directs Treasury to conduct a study to identify and recommend \nlegislative and administrative changes that would enable the IRS to \nreceive and process information reporting documents before it processes \ntax returns. This should bring us closer to the goal of voluntary pre-\npopulated returns, which I understand are already available in most \nOECD countries.\n  I have long maintained that our tax system depends on taxpayers being \nable to receive the best advice and assistance possible. We have a \nresponsibility to our nation's taxpayers to make sure that they do \nreceive such advice and assistance. This bill goes a long way toward \nthat goal.\n  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that this bill is the \nproduct of considerable collaboration. It draws on many recommendations \nof our National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson. It also builds on input \nwe have received from national and local taxpayer advocacy \norganizations, among them the Center for Economic Progress, Tax Help \nNew Mexico, and the Maryland CASH Campaign. I am grateful for these \nstakeholders' participation.\n  These are long overdue reforms; I hope that the Senate will consider \nthem in this session.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ADDITIONAL STUDIES.\n\n       (a) Study on Accelerated Processing of Information \n     Returns.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\n       (A) Under current procedures, the Internal Revenue Service \n     processes income tax returns before it processes most \n     information returns, including Forms W-2, which report wages \n     and tax withholding, and Forms 1099, which report interest, \n     dividends, and other payments.\n       (B) The sequence described in subparagraph (A) makes little \n     logical sense.\n       (C) From a taxpayer perspective, the sequence leads to \n     millions of cases where taxpayers inadvertently make \n     overclaims that the Internal Revenue Service does not \n     identify until months later, exposing the taxpayer not only \n     to a tax liability but to penalties and interest charges as \n     well.\n       (D) From the Federal Government's perspective, this \n     sequence creates opportunities for fraud and requires the \n     Internal Revenue Service to devote resources to recovering \n     refunds that should not have been paid and that it often \n     cannot recover.\n       (2) Study.--The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n     with the National Taxpayer Advocate, shall conduct a study to \n     identify and recommend legislative and administrative changes \n     that would enable the Internal Revenue Service to receive and \n     process information reporting documents before it processes \n     tax returns. In conducting the study, the Secretary shall \n     consider, among other factors, the issues identified in the \n     National Taxpayer Advocate's 2009 Annual Report to Congress.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     submit a report to Congress describing the results of the \n     study conducted under paragraph (2).\n       (b) Study on the Effectiveness of Collection \n     Alternatives.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the National Taxpayer Advocate, shall \n     conduct a study to assess the effectiveness of collection \n     alternatives, especially offers in compromise, on long-term \n     tax compliance. Such a study shall analyze a group of \n     taxpayers who applied for offers in compromise 5 or more \n     years ago and compare the amount of revenue collected from \n     the taxpayers whose offers were accepted with the amount of \n     revenue collected from the taxpayers whose offers were \n     rejected, and compare, among the taxpayers whose offers were \n     rejected, the amount they offered with the amounts collected.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     submit a report to Congress containing the results of the \n     study conducted under paragraph (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 3216. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure Medicare beneficiary access to physicians, to ensure equitable \nreimbursement under the Medicare program for all rural States, and to \neliminate sweetheart deals for frontier States; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Medicare's payment system for physicians \nis flawed in many ways. One of those flaws has for many years given \nunfairly low payments to high quality areas like my own home state of \nIowa and many other rural States. The new health care reform law makes \nsome much-needed changes in that regard.\n  The legislation I am introducing today makes additional improvements \nin addressing unfair geographic disparities in payment. It is intended \nto provide more equitable rural health payments and improve rural \naccess to care for all rural states.\n  As many of you know, Medicare payment varies from one area to another \nbased on the geographic adjustments known as the Geographic Practice \nCost Indices or GPCIs. These geographic adjustments are intended to \nequalize physician payment by reflecting differences in physician's \npractice costs.\n  But they do not accurately represent those costs in Iowa or other \nrural states. They have been a dismal failure in fact. They discourage \nphysicians from practicing in rural areas like New Mexico, Arkansas, \nMissouri, and Iowa because they create such unfairly low Medicare \nrates.\n  I introduced legislation in the last Congress, and again last year, \nto correct these unwarranted payment disparities. Last fall, I offered \nan amendment in the Senate Finance Committee mark up of health reform \nlegislation to reform the inequitable formula that has caused these \nunduly low payments.\n  My amendment provided more equity and accuracy in calculating this \nadjustment, and it provided a national solution to the problem. It was \naccepted unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee, and it was \nincluded in the Senate health reform bill, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, that was signed into law.\n  But, unfortunately, the rural equity that would be achieved by that \namendment has been endangered by another sweetheart deal that was added \nto the Senate health care reform bill that is now the law.\n  This special deal was added behind closed doors, that is, the closed \ndoors of the majority leader. This special deal addresses geographic \ndisparities but it helps just five states at the expense of the other \n45 states.\n  It was included in the Senate health reform bill for two Democratic \nSenators from so-called ``frontier states.'' It's what I call the \n``Frontier Freeloader.''\n  The Frontier Freeloader provision improves Medicare reimbursement in \nso-called frontier states by establishing floors for the hospital wage \nindex and the physician practice expense GPCI.\n  A frontier state is defined as one with 50 percent or more frontier \ncounties, defined as counties with a population per square mile of less \nthan six.\n  The Frontier Freeloader deal ensures that higher payments go to just \nfive states--North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Utah--at \nthe expense of every other state.\n  It is another example of how the deals made behind closed doors to \ngarner votes led to bad policies, like the Cornhusker Kickback, the \nLouisiana Purchase, and the Florida Gator-aid.\n  Now we have the Frontier Freeloader deal that became law when the \nPresident signed the health care reform bill.\n  Iowa provides some of the highest quality care in the country but it \ndoes not meet the definition of a frontier state. Certainly Iowa should \nhave been helped since Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and \nphysicians is lower in Iowa than in most of these so-called \n``frontier'' states.\n  Medicare also pays much lower rates in other rural states, like \nArkansas and New Mexico, but they don't benefit from the Frontier \nFreeloader because they don't meet the definition of a frontier state.\n  The Frontier Freeloader is even more egregious because Iowa--and \nother States like Arkansas and New Mexico that don't benefit--are \npaying for it! So, taxpayers in your state and mine--all the other 45 \nstates--will kick in to pay the bill for these five states. And that's \njust the cost for the next few years.\n  This sweetheart deal is not time-limited. The Frontier Freeloader \nthat benefits these five states continues forever while taxpayers in \nyour State and mine--the other 45--continue to pay the bills.\n  The bill I am introducing today would repeal the Frontier Freeloader \nsweetheart deal.\n  We should improve physician payments for all rural states, not just a \nselect few. It is unfair to improve hospital payments for just a few \nstates. This bill would eliminate those special payment deals for just \n5 States.\n  It would also improve physician payments for all rural states during \nthe transition to more accurate data.\n  The new health care reform law requires the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to limit the impact of the current unfair adjustments to \n\\1/2\\ of the current adjustment in 2010 and 2011. This bill would use \nsome of the funds saved by repealing the frontier states deal to \nincrease physician payments more in rural states next year.\n  That would mean higher payments for all rural States, not higher \npayments for just a few States.\n  Finally, the bill makes it clear that a side agreement reportedly \nmade between House members and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for an Institute of Medicine study cannot interfere with the \nlegislative changes to the geographic adjustment for physician practice \nexpense that are now law.\n  My amendment in the Senate bill that became law improves the data \nthat the government uses to calculate geographic physician practice \ncosts.\n  The House health care reform bill called for a study by the Institute \nof Medicine to make recommendations on geographic disparities.\n  It is unclear what agreement was made between Secretary Sebelius and \nthe House, since it was another backroom deal. It is also unclear what \nadvantage it holds for rural health care equity for beneficiaries and \nphysicians.\n  My amendment that is now the law requires Medicare officials to use \naccurate data.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would ensure that the \nagreement\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nHouse members made with Secretary Sebelius--that somehow accompanies \nthe House health-care reconciliation bill--cannot undo the actual \nlegislative fix in the Senate health care bill that is now law.\n  If the Institute of Medicine comes up with different data or makes \nrecommendations that are not consistent with the requirements for the \ngeographic adjustments that are now law, we could be back where we \nstarted, or even worse off. So this legislation would ensure that HHS \nfollows the legislative improvements just enacted to require more \naccurate data for calculating these geographic adjustments.\n  To summarize, the bill does three main things:\n  First, it eliminates the unfair $2 billion Frontier Freeloader carve-\nout for 5 States that ends up harming all the other rural States. As I \nsaid earlier, that extra spending would continue forever if the \nFrontier Freeloader is allowed to take effect.\n  Second, the bill helps provide greater rural health care access and \npayment equity in a way that is fair to all taxpayers and states.\n  It would provide additional payments for physicians in all rural \nStates during the transition.\n  Finally, the bill would ensure that Medicare officials use accurate \ndata to calculate geographic adjustments as now required by the new \nhealth care reform law.\n  This legislation helps ensure that seniors in all of rural America \ncontinue to have access to needed health care.\n  It ensures rural health care equity nationwide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 3218. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to clarify \nthat persons who enter into a conspiracy within the United States to \npossess or traffic illegal controlled substances outside the United \nStates, or engage in conduct within the United States to aid or abet \ndrug trafficking outside the United States, may be criminally \nprosecuted in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the trafficking and use of illegal drugs \nis an ongoing challenge in our Nation. It is incumbent upon the \nGovernment to seek to prevent the flow of drugs into the country, and \nlimit the availability of drugs on our streets and in our communities. \nIt is for that purpose that I introduce the Drug Trafficking Safe \nHarbor Elimination Act of 2010 with Senator Sessions.\n  This bill will close a loophole that could allow drug traffickers, \nunder certain circumstances, to operate with impunity in the United \nStates. In United States v. Lopez-Vanegas, the Eleventh Circuit Court \nof Appeals held that where the object of a conspiracy is to possess \ncontrolled substances outside the United States with the intent to \ndistribute outside the United States, there is no violation of U.S. \nlaw, even if the conspiracy, including meetings, negotiations, and \narrangements to execute the drug transaction, occurs on U.S. soil.\n  Although a particular conspiracy may not be intended to bring illegal \ndrugs into the U.S., the same traffickers could very well act to bring \ndrugs across our own borders as their next crime. If we have a chance \nto prosecute such criminals, we should do so.\n  In the Lopez-Vanegas case, the court stated that the statute relied \nupon by Federal prosecutors could not be extended to conspiracies to \nact outside of the U.S. because Congress had not expressed its \nintention for the statute to be applied in such a manner. This \nlegislation provides Congress an opportunity to clarify its position.\n  While the binding effect of the Lopez-Vanegas case is now limited to \nthe Eleventh Circuit, it may influence other federal jurisdictions to \nissue similar decisions. A wide-scale adoption of the reasoning in this \ncase could establish the United States as a safe haven for \ninternational drug cartels, damage our relationships with the law \nenforcement authorities of other nations, and hinder global \ncoordination to combat drug trafficking. Further, the profits and \noperational capacities generated by extraterritorial drug transactions \ncould very well bolster the ability of drug cartels to distribute drugs \nin the United States in the future. For these reasons, it is important \nto close this loophole and give law enforcement the ability to \nprosecute all drug trafficking conspiracies conducted in the United \nStates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Franken, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 3219. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, with respect \nto certain exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, three weeks ago, the Senate passed \nsignificant student loan reform. It turns out that for the past several \ndecades, we have been paying banks $6 billion per year to be the middle \nmen in our student loan system. The bill we passed puts a stop to that. \nInstead of lining the pockets of bankers like Al Lord at Sallie Mae, we \nwill originate all Federal student loans through the Direct Loan \nProgram and we will invest the savings, $68 billion, in education \npriorities. We put $36 billion into Pell Grants to increase the grant \nsize and tie it to inflation. We also capped monthly student loan \npayments at 10 percent of discretionary income to help ease repayment \nfor students in public service careers. We invested in historically \nblack colleges and universities, minority serving institutions, \ncommunity colleges, and state-based college access programs that help \nstudents succeed in college. These reforms are essential in helping \nstudents afford a college education.\n  Today, along with Senator Franken and Senator Whitehouse, I am \nintroducing a bill that will take an additional step in restoring \nfairness in student lending by treating privately issued student loans \nin bankruptcy the same way other types of private debt are treated. Our \nbill, the Fairness for Struggling Students Act, will allow borrowers of \nprivate student loans to discharge those loans in bankruptcy. \nRepresentatives Cohen and Davis are introducing a similar bill in the \nHouse.\n  Federally issued or guaranteed student loans have been protected \nduring personal bankruptcy since 1978. This is a good law that protects \nFederal investments in higher education. In 2005, a provision was added \nto law to protect the investments of private lenders that extend \nprivate credit--not federally guaranteed student loans--to students. \nWith the 2005 protections in place, there is virtually no risk to \nlenders making high-cost private loans to students at schools with low \ngraduation rates and even lower job placement rates. So the industry \nhas boomed over the past decade. Private student loan volume last year \nwas $11 billion.\n  But there is plenty of risk for student borrowers. The interest rates \nand fees on private loans can be as onerous as credit cards. There are \nreports of private loans with variable interest rates reaching 18 \npercent. Unlike Federal student loans, the Government does not impose \nloan limits on private loans and does not regulate the terms or cost of \nthese loans. Some students who take out these loans find themselves \ntrapped under an enormous amount of debt that they cannot escape.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce a bill that will give students who \nfind themselves in dire financial straits a chance at a new beginning. \nMy bill restores the bankruptcy law, as it pertains to private student \nloans, back to where it was before the law was amended in 2005. Under \nthis legislation, privately issued student loans will once again be \ndischargeable in bankruptcy. My bill also clarifies that the remaining \nprotections are specific to loans that were issued by or are guaranteed \nby State and Federal Government.\n  Three weeks ago we ended the ability of lenders and banks to make \nrisk-free federal loans to students. It is time to also end the risk-\nfree nature of private student loans and restore fairness for student \nborrowers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3219\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 486\n\n       Whereas more than 25,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States are victims of crime each year, including more than \n     6,000,000 individuals who are victims of violent crime;\n       Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on \n     individuals, families, neighborhoods, and communities by \n     ensuring that rights, resources, and services are available \n     to help rebuild the lives of the victims;\n       Whereas, although the United States has steadily expanded \n     rights, protections, and services for victims of crime, too \n     many victims are still not able to realize the hope and \n     promise of the expanded rights, protections, and services;\n       Whereas, despite impressive accomplishments realized during \n     the past 40 years in crime victims' rights and services, \n     there remain many challenges to ensuring that all victims \n     are--\n       (1) treated with fairness, dignity, and respect;\n       (2) offered support and services regardless of whether the \n     victims report the crimes committed against them to law \n     enforcement; and\n       (3) recognized as key participants in the systems of \n     justice in the United States when the crimes are reported;\n       Whereas the systems of justice in the United States should \n     ensure that services are available for all victims of crime, \n     including victims from underserved communities of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas observing the rights of victims and treating \n     victims with fairness, dignity, and respect serve the public \n     interest by--\n       (1) engaging victims in the justice system;\n       (2) inspiring respect for public authorities; and\n       (3) promoting confidence in public safety;\n       Whereas individuals in the United States recognize that \n     homes, neighborhoods, and communities are made safer and \n     stronger by identifying and meeting the needs of crime \n     victims and ensuring justice for all;\n       Whereas treating victims of crime with fairness, dignity, \n     and respect, as encouraged and expressed through the 2010 \n     National Crime Victims' Rights Week theme referred to as \n     ``Crime Victims' Rights: Fairness. Dignity. Respect.''--\n       (1) costs nothing more than taking time to identify the \n     needs and concerns of victims; and\n       (2) requires effective collaboration among justice systems \n     to meet the needs and concerns of victims; and\n       Whereas the 2010 National Crime Victims' Rights Week, which \n     is observed during the week of April 18 through April 24, \n     2010, provides an opportunity for the systems of justice in \n     the United States to strive to reach the goal of justice for \n     all by ensuring that victims are afforded legal rights and \n     provided with assistance to face the financial, physical, \n     spiritual, psychological, and social impact of crime: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the mission and goals of the 2010 National \n     Crime Victims' Rights Week to increase public awareness of--\n       (A) the impact on victims and survivors of crime; and\n       (B) the constitutional and statutory rights and needs of \n     victims and survivors of crime; and\n       (2) recognizes that fairness, dignity, and respect comprise \n     the very foundation of the manner in which victims and \n     survivors of crime should be treated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2390-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2390-S2391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 487--HONORING THE COAL MINERS WHO PERISHED IN THE \nUPPER BIG BRANCH MINE-SOUTH IN RALEIGH COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA, EXTENDING \n  THE CONDOLENCES OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO THE FAMILIES OF THE \n    FALLEN COAL MINERS, AND RECOGNIZING THE VALIANT EFFORTS OF THE \n                       EMERGENCY RESPONSE WORKERS\n\n  Mr. BYRD (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \nReid, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Brown of Ohio, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Burris, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nCardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, \nMs. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nGregg, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, \nMr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. LeMieux, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nMcCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, \nMr. Sessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of \nNew Mexico, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 484\n\n       Whereas public works infrastructure, facilities, and \n     services are of vital importance to the health, safety, and \n     well-being of the people of the United States;\n       Whereas the public works infrastructure, facilities, and \n     services could not be provided without the dedicated efforts \n     of public works professionals, including engineers and \n     administrators, who represent State and local governments \n     throughout the United States;\n       Whereas public works professionals design, build, operate, \n     and maintain the transportation systems, water \n     infrastructure, sewage and refuse disposal systems, public \n     buildings, and other structures and facilities that are vital \n     to the people and communities of the United States;\n       Whereas understanding the role that public infrastructure \n     plays in protecting the environment, improving public health \n     and safety, contributing to economic vitality, and enhancing \n     the quality of life of every community of the United States \n     is in the interest of the people of the United States; and\n       Whereas 2010 marks the 50th anniversary of ``National \n     Public Works Week'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 16 through May 22, 2010, as \n     ``National Public Works Week'';\n       (2) recognizes and celebrates the important contributions \n     that public works professionals make every day to improve--\n       (A) the public infrastructure of the United States; and\n       (B) the communities that public works professionals serve; \n     and\n       (3) urges individuals and communities throughout the United \n     States to join with representatives of the Federal Government \n     and the American Public Works Association in activities and \n     ceremonies that are designed--\n       (A) to pay tribute to the public works professionals of the \n     United States; and\n       (B) to recognize the substantial contributions that public \n     works professionals make to the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 485\n\n       Whereas according to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, at least 25.6 percent of households in the \n     United States, or close to 30,000,000 households with \n     approximately 60,000,000 adults, are unbanked or underbanked \n     and, subsequently, have missed opportunities for savings, \n     lending, and basic financial services;\n       Whereas according to the 2009 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, 41 percent of adults in the United States, or \n     more than 92,000,000 adults living in the United States, gave \n     themselves a grade of C, D, or F on their knowledge of \n     personal finance;\n       Whereas according to the National Bankruptcy Research \n     Center, the number of personal bankruptcy filings reached \n     1,410,000 in 2009, a 32 percent increase from 2008 and the \n     highest number since 2005;\n       Whereas the 2009 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that the \n     percentage of workers who were ``very confident'' about \n     having enough money for a comfortable retirement decreased \n     sharply, from 27 percent in 2007 to 18 percent in 2008 to 13 \n     percent in 2009, the lowest since the question was first \n     asked in the survey in 1993, and representing a 50 percent \n     decline in worker confidence since 2007;\n       Whereas according to a 2009 ``Flow of Funds'' report by the \n     Federal Reserve, household debt stood at $13,600,000,000,000;\n       Whereas according to the Department of Labor, only 43 \n     percent of people in the United States have calculated how \n     much they need to save for retirement;\n       Whereas according to the 2009 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, 26 percent, or more than 58,000,000 adults, admit \n     to not paying all of their bills on time;\n       Whereas according to the 2009 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, \\1/3\\ of adults in the United States, \n     approximately 72,000,000 adults, report that they have no \n     savings and only 23 percent of adults in the United States \n     are now saving more than they did a year ago because of the \n     current economic climate;\n       Whereas according to the 2009 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, less than \\1/2\\ of adults keep close track of \n     their spending, and nearly 16,000,000 adults do not know how \n     much they spend on food, housing, and entertainment, and do \n     not monitor their overall spending;\n       Whereas the number of adults keeping close track of their \n     spending has not improved since 2007;\n       Whereas according to the sixth Survey of the States 2009: \n     Economic, Personal Finance, and Entrepreneurship Education in \n     Our Nation's Schools, conducted by the Council for Economic \n     Education, only 21 States require students to take an \n     economics course as a high school graduation requirement, and \n     only 19 States require the testing of student knowledge in \n     economics;\n       Whereas according to the sixth Survey of the States 2009: \n     Economic, Personal Finance, and Entrepreneurship Education in \n     Our Nation's Schools, conducted by the Council for Economic \n     Education, only 13 States require students to take a personal \n     finance course either independently or as part of an \n     economics course as a high school graduation requirement;\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\n       Whereas expanding access to the mainstream financial system \n     will provide individuals with less expensive and more secure \n     options for managing finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas quality personal financial education is essential \n     to ensure that individuals are prepared to manage money, \n     credit, and debt, and to become responsible workers, heads of \n     households, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and \n     citizens;\n       Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals \n     to make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion \n     caused by an increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas a greater understanding of, and familiarity with, \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas, in 2003, Congress found it important to coordinate \n     Federal financial literacy efforts and formulate a national \n     strategy; and\n       Whereas, in light of that finding, Congress passed the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act of 2003 \n     (Public Law 108-159; 117 Stat. 2003) establishing the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Commission and designating \n     the Office of Financial Education of the Department of the \n     Treasury to provide support for the Commission: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2010 as ``Financial Literacy Month'' \n     to raise public awareness about--\n       (A) the importance of personal financial education in the \n     United States; and\n       (B) the serious consequences that may result from a lack of \n     understanding about personal finances; and\n       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the people \n     of the United States to observe the month with appropriate \n     programs and activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 486\n\n       Whereas more than 25,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States are victims of crime each year, including more than \n     6,000,000 individuals who are victims of violent crime;\n       Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on \n     individuals, families, neighborhoods, and communities by \n     ensuring that rights, resources, and services are available \n     to help rebuild the lives of the victims;\n       Whereas, although the United States has steadily expanded \n     rights, protections, and services for victims of crime, too \n     many victims are still not able to realize the hope and \n     promise of the expanded rights, protections, and services;\n       Whereas, despite impressive accomplishments realized during \n     the past 40 years in crime victims' rights and services, \n     there remain many challenges to ensuring that all victims \n     are--\n       (1) treated with fairness, dignity, and respect;\n       (2) offered support and services regardless of whether the \n     victims report the crimes committed against them to law \n     enforcement; and\n       (3) recognized as key participants in the systems of \n     justice in the United States when the crimes are reported;\n       Whereas the systems of justice in the United States should \n     ensure that services are available for all victims of crime, \n     including victims from underserved communities of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas observing the rights of victims and treating \n     victims with fairness, dignity, and respect serve the public \n     interest by--\n       (1) engaging victims in the justice system;\n       (2) inspiring respect for public authorities; and\n       (3) promoting confidence in public safety;\n       Whereas individuals in the United States recognize that \n     homes, neighborhoods, and communities are made safer and \n     stronger by identifying and meeting the needs of crime \n     victims and ensuring justice for all;\n       Whereas treating victims of crime with fairness, dignity, \n     and respect, as encouraged and expressed through the 2010 \n     National Crime Victims' Rights Week theme referred to as \n     ``Crime Victims' Rights: Fairness.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has once again \npassed a resolution designating April as Financial Literacy Month. I \nthank my cosponsors, Senators Enzi, Dodd, Crapo, Johnson, Corker, \nSchumer, Cochran, Menendez, Wicker, Kohl, Merkley, Inouye, Durbin, \nBaucus, Murray, Lincoln, Begich, Gillibrand, Feingold, Levin, Carper, \nCardin, Stabenow, and Hagan. I am glad to work once again with my \ncolleagues in a bipartisan manner to promote financial and economic \nliteracy for all Americans.\n  This tax day I want to recognize those organizations that gathered \ninformation on the status of financial literacy in our country. This \nincludes the Jumpstart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy's \nsurvey of high school seniors and the Employee Benefit Research \nInstitute's Retirement Confidence Survey. These surveys present deeply \ntroubling figures that underscore the need for increased financial \nliteracy. The financial literacy of high school students has fallen to \nits lowest level ever, with a score of just 48.3 percent. Also, the \npercentage of workers who were ``very confident'' about having enough \nmoney for a comfortable retirement decreased sharply, from 27 percent \nin 2007 to 18 percent in 2008 to 13 percent in 2009, the lowest since \nthe question was first asked in the survey in 1993, and representing a \n50 percent decline in worker confidence since 2007. There is still much \nwork to do in properly educating America's youth on basic personal \nfinancial management skills.\n  In addition, last year the Federal Reserve noted that household debt \nin the United States stood at $13.6 trillion. The 2009 Consumer \nFinancial Literacy Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for \nCredit Counseling found that less than half of all adults keep close \ntrack of their spending, and nearly 16 million adults do not monitor \ntheir overall spending and do not know how much they spend on food, \nhousing, and entertainment. With regard to retirement planning, the \nU.S. Department of Labor noted that only 43 percent of people in the \nUnited States have calculated how much they need to save for \nretirement. These findings suggest a serious problem underscored by the \nfact that most workers have not calculated how much they need to save \nfor retirement, even if they believe they are behind schedule in their \nretirement.\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\n  Increased financial and economic literacy can help people navigate \naround the countless pitfalls found in the marketplace. A significant \nstep occurred with the passage of the Credit Card Accountability \nResponsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009. The Act requires credit card \ncompanies to disclose information about the impact of making only the \nminimum monthly payment. This includes how long it will take to repay a \ncredit card and the extra amount in interest that must be paid when \nonly the minimum payment is made. This easily-found information will \nallow consumers to become more aware of their financial situation and \nenable them to make better financial choices.\n  Our resolution designates April 2010 as Financial Literacy Month and \nhighlights the need to promote financial literacy. I am pleased by \nefforts underway to promote financial and economic education and wish \nto highlight a few examples. Here in Washington, the Jumpstart \nCoalition for Personal Financial Literacy is holding a celebration of \nfinancial literacy this month. During the celebration, Jumpstart will \nhonor two national leaders, a State coalition of the year, and the \nprestigious Odom Award winner. In addition, the National Foundation for \nCredit Counseling will announce the winner of its annual poster \ncontest. The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, \nDFI, announced that it is launching a new statewide financial education \ncalendar. DFI is working with organizations providing financial \neducation in their communities to incorporate existing calendars into a \nsingle searchable, comprehensive statewide calendar of financial \neducation classes and events. Maryland Public Television is airing the \nprogram ``Pursuit of the Dream: Building Credit for Life.'' This \nspecial and important documentary will educate viewers on the \nimportance of credit scores. Viewers will also learn tips for building \na good credit score and helpful ways to avoid money traps that can drag \ndown credit ratings. Viewers will also be able to hear from local \nfinancial experts and call a toll-free number airing throughout the \nbroadcast to connect to valuable resources. In my home State of Hawaii, \nthe Hawaii State Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs recently \norganized a fair to provide free financial information and help arm \nconsumers with accurate and useful information to encourage financial \nliteracy.\n  As policymakers, we need to focus on these issues year round, not \njust in the month of April. However, focusing on Financial Literacy \nMonth in April means that we have a designated part of the year when we \ncan reassess and improve upon our efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2395-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, APRIL 19, 2010\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, I shared recently with my colleagues my \nconcern about the surging Federal debt and the ramifications that arise \nfrom that, and how it has a damaging effect in ways a lot of people \nhave not considered on our economy and on the quality of life of the \nAmerican people.\n  A scholar at the Cato Institute published an excellent op ed in \nyesterday's Washington Times on the impact of borrowing on the American \neconomy. Savings are essential, as we all know, for economic growth \nbecause it is from those savings that people borrow, and then they are \nable to invest in new factories, equipment, research, development, and \ncreate businesses that create jobs. That is how we get economic growth. \nIt is part of our tradition of a free economy, and it has served us \nwell. Very few would deny that this is the best way to allocate wealth, \nrather than trying to have a government-mandated economy.\n  When the government issues debt and private citizens and corporations \nbuy it, that, by definition, steers that money, that savings, from the \nproductive or private sector of the economy toward the government. If \nthe government wasn't issuing the debt, or borrowing the money, people \nwould have money that they would likely invest in private corporations \nthrough bonds or stocks. They might place it in a bank and buy a CD, \nand then the bank would loan that to a private company, or some person \nwho is wishing to build a home or a shopping center, creating jobs and \ngrowth in the economy. Some of our colleagues like to think that you \ncan borrow money and you can increase debt and it is free money. But we \nknow that is not true. Nothing comes from nothing. Everything has a \ncost, and it will be paid for one way or the other, at one time or \nanother.\n  The unprecedented Federal debt that we are dealing with today is \nunlike anything we have seen before. I think it is fair to say that \nboth parties have blame to share, but I have to say we have never seen \nanything like the President's 10-year budget and what impact it will \nhave on the debt in our country.\n  Our debt in 2008 was $5.8 billion. In 2012, it is projected to double \nto $11.6 billion. In 2018, it will triple to 17.6 billion. That is a \ntripling of the entire debt of the United States in that many years. \nPeople would say, well, what does that mean? I say to you it means one \nthing I can show you. You borrow that money--somebody loaned it to the \ngovernment. When the government took that loan and borrowed that money, \nthey have to pay interest on it.\n  Just to show what the Congressional Budget Office has told us about \nwhat that actually means, in 2009 we paid $187 billion in interest on \nour debt. That is going to go up every single year, according to them, \nuntil 2020 when we will be paying $840 billion in 1 year in interest on \nthe debt.\n  All of us have projects in which we believe. We believe in education \nor health. We believe in helping seniors or\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nyoung people. We believe in highways and research and development, \nnational defense, the National Institutes of Health, science and \ntechnology, improving our energy use, cleaning up our environment. \nThose things cost money.\n  According to the projections of the Congressional Budget Office, $840 \nbillion will have to be taken off the top. It will have to be paid \nfirst. That will be larger than anything in our budget, including \ndefense, unless it continues to surge, and we hope it does not. It will \nbe larger than any other account. It will be crowding out money we \ncould have been spending on things that work.\n  Some of the money we spend does not work. Too much of it is wasteful \nWashington spending. Some of this money is very productive, and we like \nto think we are making the world a better place. We are going to have \nless of it because of this interest.\n  The unprecedented Federal deficit last year of $1.4 trillion is a \nstunning number, and the projected $1.5 trillion deficit this year will \nbe taking $3 trillion out of the economy. In fact, the CATO scholar, \nRichard Rahn, compared the percentage of money the government is taking \nout of the economy in this recession with how much the government took \nout of the economy in previous recessions and found that the current \ndepletion of savings that is going to the government is unprecedented \nover the last 30 years.\n  He says in 2009 the government took 38 percent of all the gross \nsavings in the country by borrowing it, money that might have been \navailable to a shopping center guy or a startup company or a person who \nneeds to buy a home. They would borrow the money. The government is \nborrowing the money. The number of dollars in savings in this country \nis limited. We are taking 38 percent of it.\n  By contrast, it did not take more than 15 percent in any other \nrecession in the past 30 years. The average takings have been less than \n5 percent.\n  I will show this chart: savings taken by the government during \nrecessions. The average per quarter in the last 30 years is 1 or 2 \npercent. In the 1982-1983 recession, it hit about 12; in the 1992-1993 \nrecession, it hit about 15 percent; in 2003-2004, about 11 or 12 \npercent. Look at this, 38 percent in the 2009 recession we are in.\n  Some say this is worse than anything we have ever seen before. It is \nvery bad, and it is unprecedented. If it is so easy, and if there is no \ncost to borrow, why don't we borrow twice as much? We all know there is \na cost. We have to make judgments about how far we can go, how much we \ncan continue to borrow.\n  We borrowed $800 billion for the stimulus package. Now we have a $270 \nbillion stimulus package that is proposed. Since that would not fly as \na big package, it is being broken up. We voted to have another $18 \nbillion for a 2-month extension of unemployment insurance, the doctor \nfix, and some other items. We just borrowed it.\n  We thought when we did the largest expenditure in the history of the \nRepublic, when we borrowed $800 billion for the stimulus package--I \nthought that was more than we could possibly afford to borrow to try to \nstimulate ourselves artificially out of this economic slowdown. It \nworried me. In fact, I supported a plan that I believe would have cost \nhalf as much and created more jobs using the studies of the President's \nadviser on economics, Christina Romer. It would have been more \nproductive than the one Congress did.\n  One of the great tragedies of this whole process is how little \nstimulus we got out of the $800 billion. As Gary Becker, the Nobel \nPrize winner, said, it was not a stimulus package. It was not written \nto create jobs and growth. He predicted it would not create jobs, and \nhe, unfortunately, has turned out to be correct.\n  Senator Coburn and several of us and others opposed this bill because \nit ought to have been paid for. It should have been paid for out of the \nstimulus package. Unemployment compensation is certainly one of the \nitems that was in the stimulus package. The doctor fix--what about \nthat? We have to do that, don't we? Yes, we do. We really do. From \nwhere should that money come?\n  The failure of compensation to our physicians--please understand--is \na result of a law we passed that we now cannot adhere to that if it is \nin effect would cut physicians' pay for Medicare patients 21 percent. \nMany physicians are already quitting taking Medicare patients. If this \nwere to pass, we would have very few continuing to take Medicare \npatients. The whole system would collapse. They are not getting paid \nenough now. Private insurance pays them much more than the government \ndoes. How should we pay the doctors? Don't we have to borrow the money?\n  One of the great flaws in the health care bill was the failure to fix \nthe Medicare doctor payment. That was the crisis always in Medicare. \nThe proposal that passed on a partisan vote in the Senate, the proposal \nto have a new health care program to raise taxes for Medicare, bringing \nin more money for Medicare, cut benefits from Medicare.\n  Did they fix the crisis, the doctor payment first, like what had been \nsaid had to be done from the beginning? One of the reasons we needed \nhealth care reform is because we needed to have a permanent solution to \nthe doctor payments shortfall. Did we use the money for that? No. We \ntook the money and created an entirely new spending program, a new \nhealth care program.\n  Our colleagues are proposing that we just borrow the money, the $371 \nbillion it is going to take over 10 years to fix the doctor payments.\n  This is why the American people instinctively understand that we are \nnot in control. We are out of control. We are in denial about how \nserious our situation is. I think the American people instinctively are \nright.\n  People say: Oh, the townhall meetings are angry. Some of them are \nangry. I sense they are just deeply concerned about the country they \nlove, and they have a sense--and it is correct--that we are \nirresponsibly managing our duties here. As a result, we are saddling \nthem and their children with the largest increase in debt the Nation \nhas ever seen. It has the potential to put a cloud over the long-term \ngrowth in our economy.\n  I do believe we are going to get some economic strength from this \nstimulus package. It is impossible to spend $800 billion and not get \nsome economic growth from it in the short term. In 1 more year it will \nalmost all be spent. I guess before the election we will have a lot of \nmoney being spent, and we are going to get some benefit from that, and \nI hope we will have a long-term positive benefit.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office, our group that we ask to analyze \nspending and score the cost of legislation, analyzed the $800 billion \nstimulus package and this is what they said. I think it makes sense and \nI am afraid it is true. For the first 2 or 3 years, we are going to \nhave an economic lift from this flood of money into the economy. But \nover 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the \n$800 billion in spending will not improve the economy. Their score was \nthat the economy would grow less in 10 years having passed the stimulus \npackage than if we passed nothing--if we didn't spend anything. Why is \nthat? Mr. Elmendorf said the reason is that when you borrow $800 \nbillion, you crowd out borrowing from the private sector, which is \nwhere our economic growth is. You take available money that the private \nsector could have borrowed to run their businesses and factories and \nthe government spends it on pork programs and social programs. This \nchart shows exactly that. I didn't know that 38 percent of the money \nthat is being saved in this country would be gobbled up by Federal \nGovernment borrowing to keep our ship afloat so we can still try to buy \nour way out of this recession.\n  The experts say recessions are cyclical. If you don't do anything, \nyou will come out of it. We hoped some sort of stimulus package could \nhelp us come out of it faster, with less pain, and I was prepared to \nvote for and I did vote for several packages that would be more job \noriented and more targeted to growth. But we didn't pass that kind of \nbill. We passed a big governmental spending bill. It was predicted not \nto be growth oriented, it was predicted not to be job creating, and \napparently, unfortunately, that has been basically true.\n  So I am hoping we will have some growth for a few years here, but I \nam confident, and logic tells me, that in the outyears that growth will \nnot be as vigorous as it would otherwise have been because we are going \nto be carrying an unprecedented amount of debt\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nand we are going to be paying an unprecedented amount of interest every \nyear, and this will crowd out private borrowing and cost the government \na stunning amount of interest. That means the government will not be \nable to do anything to improve the lives of the American people because \nthat money first has to go to pay the interest.\n  I wanted to share that, because there are some people who are saying \nthat those of us who objected to this bill--this small $18 billion debt \nexpansion that passed today--somehow we don't love America and we don't \nlove people in need. We believe and we offered legislation that would \nhave paid for these expenses by taking it from unobligated funds and \nprograms that don't work effectively in our country. So we would have \nbeen able to fill this $18 billion need without increasing the debt. \nBut instead of doing that, the majority of the Senate, or Democratic \nleadership, pushed through legislation that would borrow it.\n  I guess that is the path we are on, to have an $800 billion stimulus, \na $270 billion stimulus II, to start a new $2.5 trillion health care \nbill--with these kinds of bills, more and more spending each year, and \nmore and more debt. But we have got to stop. I know it is hard to say \nno and hard to make the tough choices, but that is what we have been \nelected to do.\n  I think we have to get serious about it. I am getting serious about \nit. I don't intend to continue to vote willy-nilly for these debt-\nincreasing bills. I believe this Congress has got to get serious about \nour financial future and take some commonsense steps that can lead us \ninto a better future.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/15/senate-section/article/S2397-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 19, 2010, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
