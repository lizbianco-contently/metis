Mr. President, there is no bigger, no more heart-\nwrenching, no more inspiring story today than what happened in \nNashville in the 48 hours on May 1 and 2, over that weekend, when 2 to \n4 inches of rain were expected and up to 17 inches came. As a result of \nthat--from the Opryland Hotel outside Nashville to the Millington naval \nstation near Memphis--all across Tennessee there have been devastating \nfloods.\n  It is, according to the Weather Service, a 1,000-year rainfall event. \nI do not know how anybody knows what a 1,000-year rainfall event is--\nthat is a long time--but this was not a 20-year flood or a 100-year \nflood, this was a 1,000-year rainfall event that overtook the people of \nTennessee.\n  As a result, our Governor, Phil Bredesen, has asked the President to \nidentify 52 counties--from the Nashville area to all the way across our \nState to the Mississippi River--as disaster areas. The President has \nresponded swiftly. Forty-two of those 52 counties have been designated \nas disaster areas.\n  Some people say to me: Well, there has not been so much news about \nthis Tennessee flood. There are two reasons for it. One is, there has \nbeen a lot of other news. Greece has been collapsing. A bomber tried to \nblow up Times Square. There is turmoil over immigration in Arizona. \nThere is the gulf oilspill which threatens to be the worst in history.\n  But it is important for the American people to know the Tennessee \nflood last weekend is by far the largest disaster in our country since \nPresident Obama came into office, except for the oilspill in the Gulf \nof Mexico, and it may be that the Tennessee flood affects more people \nthan what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  The other reason we have not heard so much about it is this: \nTennesseans have been busy cleaning up and helping each other instead \nof complaining and looting. So people are hurt. Thousands of people are \nhurt. But they are going\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\nabout their business helping themselves and helping others in \nremarkable and inspiring ways.\n  I have many images from over the last few days of the visits I have \nmade in Tennessee: being at the Bellevue Community Center on Saturday \nmorning, where there were dozens of volunteers in red T-shirts that \nwere headed out in teams to help people in that area whose homes have \nbeen devastated; the image of 502 soldiers from Fort Campbell--those \nare the most deployed soldiers in America--yet the commanding officer \ngave them a day's leave, and 502 of them formed teams and cleaned up \nthree neighborhoods in Clarksville-Montgomery County.\n  I spent an hour that same day with Mayor Bowers and Congresswoman \nBlackburn and the team that is responding in Montgomery County, and it \nis an impressive response. I would say the same for Governor Bredesen \nof Tennessee and Mayor Dean of Nashville, whose metro services have \nworked overtime.\n  This is true all the way across our State to Dyer County--badly hurt; \nthousands of people have homes damaged there--to the Navy's principal \npersonnel and recruiting station at Millington, just outside Memphis, \nwhere the Secretary of the Navy saw personally, on Saturday, the damage \nthat had been done there.\n  According to the Tennessean, the American Red Cross had recorded more \nthan 1,300 volunteers by Friday. Whole congregations, on Sunday, showed \nup en masse to help at places such as Cross Point Community Church, \nwhich had more than 1,600 members of the congregation on Saturday. \nHands-On Nashville saw more than 5,100 volunteers log more than 19,000 \nhours to help out across the city by Saturday.\n  Our own church, Westminster Presbyterian Church, in Nashville--we had \na lot of people going down to help with Katrina and in Gulfport after \nthose disasters--will be the center for people coming in to help the \npeople in Tennessee. If you go through Nashville today--or other parts \nof Tennessee, all the way down to Memphis--you will see thousands of \nfront yards littered with damage from the basements of homes.\n  FEMA has been on the ground from the beginning, and I thank them for \ntheir prompt response. Unfortunately, we have worked with them before \non tornadoes and other disasters, so they know Tennessee pretty well. \nBy Saturday morning, 16,000 persons in Tennessee had registered with \nFEMA, and there had already been 750 inspections.\n  I talked with the sheriff of Montgomery County Saturday night. He was \nflooded out, but he had been in touch with FEMA. He was already \nregistered. He had arranged for his inspection. He was very well \nsatisfied by that.\n\n  Channel 4--Nashville television--had a telethon on Thursday night. \nVince Gill and a group of stars raised $2 million in the Nashville area \nfor the victims of the flood. Taylor Swift gave $500,000. Bud Adams of \nthe Titans gave $400,000. So people in large and small ways are pouring \nout their hearts and their help and their money to help one another.\n  As we look forward--this is not a time to complain. I did not hear \nanybody complain this past week. As I said before, maybe that is why \nthere is not so much news about this. But as we look ahead, I want to \nmake sure in the future we make sure we do the best possible job of \nhandling floods, particularly that we have clear and correct \ninformation about the rising water, and that we communicate it as \nbroadly as we should.\n  We have learned how to do that with tornadoes. Using the media, we \ncan tell you whether a tornado is coming across your house in 14 \nminutes in a remarkable set of cooperation between the National Weather \nService and the media broadcasters.\n  I have asked Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe of our \ncommittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, to look at \nperhaps holding a hearing on how well the Army Corps of Engineers and \nother Federal agencies and State agencies are delivering accurate, \nclear information to businesses and individuals who might be hurt by \nthe rising water.\n  This morning, I flew up to Nashville with a person from Sumner County \nwho was trapped in a Chevrolet Blazer with her 12-year-old son and her \nhusband and nearly killed except they were rescued by emergency \nservices. Another person on the plane lives on a high hill near River \nRoad, and the National Guard helicopters landed four times in her front \nyard to rescue 50 people who could not get out except in that way.\n  I have talked with Colin Reed, who is the chief executive officer of \nthe Opryland Hotel, who had to make an evacuation order. They evacuated \n1,500 guests rather than risk what happened during Katrina because the \nwater suddenly came into the Opryland Hotel--many people are familiar \nwith that--and the water became 10 feet high. It is still several feet \nhigh there. So there is a lot of long-term damage, and I want to make \nsure we have clear and consistent information.\n  I would have to add, I thank the Congress for approving my request \nover the last few years for additional funding to make two of the four \ndams on the Cumberland River safer. If they had not been made safer, \ntheir water levels would have been lower and tons more water would have \npoured into the Cumberland River, creating millions of more dollars of \ndamages and perhaps taking lives.\n  I am simply here this morning to say I am very proud of Tennessee, \nfrom Nashville to Memphis. There is no bigger, more heart-wrenching, \nmore inspiring story than of these thousands of Tennesseans who have \nsuffered a 1,000-year flood, thousands of whom have losses they \nunderstand will not be fully made whole. But they are busy--not \nlooting, not complaining--they are cleaning up and they are helping one \nanother.\n  As the days go on, I will be meeting with Senator Inouye and Senator \nCochran to make certain the Federal accounts that fund FEMA, economic \ndevelopment, the Community Development Block Grant, and other projects \nand accounts in the Federal Government that respond to natural \ndisasters have enough money in them to meet the Federal part of the \nresponsibility. But so far the President, his Cabinet, and others have \nbeen doing very well.\n  The Governor of Tennessee and the mayors across our State have been \ndoing extraordinarily well. But the people, who are the real heroines \nand heroes, are the men and women of Tennessee who have been hurt, or \ntheir neighbors who have been busy cleaning up and helping one another.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore, and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/10/senate-section/article/S3452-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to congratulate Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan on her nomination. Senate Republicans will treat Ms. \nKagan with the same courtesy and fairness with which we treated Justice \nSotomayor when she was nominated to the Supreme Court last year. The \nrest of the Republican Conference and I appreciated that at the end of \nher confirmation process, then-Judge Sotomayor recognized that she had \nbeen treated fairly by everyone. Unfortunately, that has not always \nbeen the case with Supreme Court nominees of Republican Presidents.\n  The American people know what they want in a Supreme Court Justice. \nThey want someone who will apply the law fairly and impartially \n``without respect to persons,'' as the judicial oath requires. They do \nnot want someone to be a rubberstamp for any administration.\n  Ms. Kagan is currently a member of President Obama's administration \nand serves at his pleasure in a position that lasts no longer than the \nadministration itself. By contrast, today she was nominated for a \nlifetime appointment to the Nation's highest Court. The standard of \nscrutiny is clearly much higher\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\nnow. Now we must determine whether someone who is a member of the \nPresident's administration will be an independent and impartial jurist \non the Nation's highest Court.\n\n  The American people also want a nominee with the requisite legal \nexperience. They instinctively know a lifetime position on the Supreme \nCourt does not lend itself to on-the-job training. Of course, one does \nnot need to have prior experience as a judge before being appointed to \nthe country's highest Court, but it strikes me that if a nominee does \nnot have traditional experience, they should have substantial \nlitigation experience. Ms. Kagan has neither, unlike Justice Rehnquist, \nfor instance, who was in private practice for 16 years prior to his \nappointment as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel, a job he had at the time of his appointment to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  But exploring these questions is precisely what the nominations \nprocess is all about. Starting today, both parties will begin the \nprocess of carefully reviewing Ms. Kagan's brief litigation experience \nas well as her judgment and her career in academia, both as a professor \nand as an administrator. Fulfilling our duty to advise and consent on a \nnomination of this office requires a thorough process, not a rush to \njudgment. Senate Republicans will have vigorous debate on the \nimportance of equal justice under law. This principle lies at the very \nheart of our judicial system. We will diligently review Ms. Kagan's \nrecord to ensure that she shares this principle and that she possesses \nthe requisite experience to serve on the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/10/senate-section/article/S3453-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in honor of National Nurses Week, I wish \nto recognize the more than 3 million nurses who work hard day-in and \nday-out to give patients the care they deserve. Because my wife Mary is \na nurse, I have seen firsthand what an enormous impact nurses have on \nboth patients and families. Their compassion and devotion to their \npatients give families the peace of mind that their loved ones are in \ngood hands. They also play an irreplaceable role in making sure our \nhospitals and clinics run smoothly. Unfortunately, many nurses are \noverworked, underpaid, and our hospitals and clinics have trouble \nretaining them.\n  Through the Health Care Reform Act Congress passed earlier this year, \nwe made significant strides in addressing many of the challenges nurses \nface. We expanded the nursing student loan program to help make nursing \nprograms more affordable. We also expanded the nursing loan repayment \nprogram and scholarship programs to students who commit to working at \nan accredited nursing school for 2 years. This will help ensure our \nnursing schools have the teachers they need to train additional nurses. \nWe invested $1.5 billion over 5 years in the National Health Service \nCorps scholarship and loan repayment program for primary care \nproviders, including nurses who practice in underserved areas. In \naddition, we included $50 million in grants for nurse-managed health \nclinics that offer primary care and wellness services to low-income and \nuninsured Americans.\n  While we made good progress easing many of the difficulties nurses \nface, much more still needs to be done. Nurses play such a crucial role \nin the delivery of care. We need to provide them with the resources \nthey need to do their jobs.\n  The nursing shortage also remains a serious issue, especially in \nhard-hit rural areas. To find commonsense solutions to the problems \nnurses face, I formed the Senate Nursing Caucus with Senator Johanns, \nSenator Mikulski, and Senator Snowe. I urge all of my colleagues to \njoin the caucus to help strengthen the nursing profession and advance \nthe goals of the nursing community. Together, we will explore ways we \ncan enhance the role nurses play in our health care system and address \nthe nationwide nursing shortage.\n  I ask my colleagues and my fellow Americans to take a moment during \nNational Nurses Week to show your appreciation to nurses across the \ncountry for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to their \npatients. Their dedication is invaluable to the success of our health \ncare system and, most of all, to the patients who depend on them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from the State \nof Oregon in speaking on behalf of nurses across America.\n  We know that with the baby boom generation, we are going to need more \nnurses than ever, and with these nurses, we will have the professional \nmedical care we need across this Nation, but we better get busy. We are \nfalling behind. We don't graduate enough nurses now to take care of the \nanticipated needs, and we have to change that.\n  Sadly, in many instances we have been poaching nursing talent from \nother poor nations around the world. Filipino nurses in Chicago play a \nmajor role at many hospitals, particularly inner-city hospitals, and \nnurses from other parts of the world. Many times, the Philippines, for \nexample, generates more medical professionals and expects they will \nserve overseas, but some places in Africa lose their best medical \nprofessionals to higher and more predictable pay in places such as the \nUnited States, England, France, and Germany. So we have to reach a \npoint where we are graduating more nursing students each year. Last \nyear in Illinois, 2,000 qualified nursing applicants were turned down \nbecause we didn't have the capacity in our nursing schools.\n  We don't have enough nursing faculty, enough clinical opportunities. \nWe need to really focus on that. So in addition to lauding the nursing \nprofession--I certainly echo my colleague in that regard--we also need \nto think ahead to make sure we have more nurses when we need them, and \nthat day is going to be fast upon us. So I thank the Senator from \nOregon for his words.\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who are here following the \nSenate today, as announced earlier, we are resuming consideration of \nthis bill, and, of course, it is the Wall Street reform bill, the \nFinancial Stability Act. It is over 1,400 pages long.\n  The Senator from Virginia who is presiding over the Senate now is a \nmember of the Senate Banking Committee. Senator Mark Warner has worked \non this bill, and large sections of it are his handiwork in an effort \nto try to deal with changes on Wall Street which will protect our \neconomy and make certain we don't relive some of the horror stories we \nhave seen over the last several years, and we all know those stories \npretty well.\n  There was a time not that long ago--about a year and a half ago--\nwhen, under the previous President, I was brought into a meeting just a \nfew steps away from the Senate floor with the chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Ben Bernanke, and the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry \nPaulson. They basically sat down in the first meeting and said: We \nwanted to let you know the largest insurance company in the world, AIG, \nis about to go broke. When it goes broke, it is going to bring down so \nmany companies and corporations with it that it can literally crater \nthe American economy. At that point, Chairman Bernanke said: So the \nFederal Reserve is giving $85 billion to AIG Corporation.\n  There was a moment of silence in the room, and finally someone in the\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nroom--I don't remember who it was--had the nerve to ask: Where did you \nget $85 billion at the Federal Reserve?\n\n  Chairman Bernanke said something like: Oh, we have our resources.\n  Someone asked: Where did you get the authority to give it to a \nprivate company?\n  They said: Well, there was a law passed during the Great Depression \nwhich said that if it looks as if the economy is going to crater, the \nFederal Reserve can step in.\n  So an obscure law that was over 75 years old and a fund of money most \nMembers of Congress had never seen--since they are a separate agency \nand don't go through our appropriations process--ended up propping up a \ncompany. And it didn't cost $85 billion; I think when it was over it \nwas $180 billion or somewhere in that range. The reason, of course, we \ncouldn't let that company go down was they had literally insured \ncontracts and corporations all around America, that there would be no \ndefault. They insured more contracts than they had a reserve to cover. \nAs the contracts started to fail, they didn't have the reserves to back \nup their promise of insurance.\n  That was the first meeting. Only a few days later, they asked us to \nmeet again, and I thought, this ought to be equally interesting, and it \nwas. They brought us to a meeting, and Secretary Paulson, the Secretary \nof the Treasury, said: Now we are seeing, with the failure of Lehman \nBrothers and other companies, the potential that many large financial \ninstitutions in America are also going to fail. Then Secretary Paulson \nsaid: So we need a fund of money immediately, by Friday--and this was a \nTuesday meeting--we need a fund by Friday of $800 billion to buy the \nso-called toxic assets, TARP funds, toxic assets relief program.\n  Again, there was a stunned silence in the room because even those of \nus in Washington who deal with millions and billions on a regular basis \nwere stunned to get a request for $800 billion in a matter of days.\n  So the first question that was asked was: Who is going to prepare the \nlegislation that actually asks for the money?\n  They looked around, and no one had kind of thought of that detail, \nand we said: We think the White House should. President Bush's White \nHouse, with Secretary Paulson, prepared a bill and sent it to us. The \nbill was exactly three pages long asking for $800 billion. Naturally, \nmany of us thought that was not adequate. We needed to put provisions \nin there about how the money would be spent, the supervisory authority \nin Congress, and so forth.\n  Eventually, it was passed on a bipartisan rollcall. People like \nmyself who voted for it did it out of a feeling of desperation. What \nelse could we do? If we were being told by the financial leaders of our \ngovernment that our economy was about to fail--we had seen it already \nin the stock market going down in value, and we knew people were losing \ntheir jobs and businesses were failing--we felt this was the only way \nto try to stop this terrible crisis from becoming much worse.\n  Well, the toxic assets relief program ended up sending billions of \ndollars to these struggling financial institutions. They were \nstruggling because they made bad judgments. They bought, created, and \nsold securities, derivatives, and interest which were, in fact, toxic. \nThey were based on a mortgage market and the premises of that market \nwhich turned out to be totally wrong. They had made bad business \ndecisions. Their companies were about to fail.\n  The Federal Government--make that the taxpayers of this country--was \nexpected to step in and save them, which we did. To show their \ngratitude for this act of mercy--rescuing them from their own bad \nworks--they declared bonuses for one another. They gave one another \nbonus checks after the Federal taxpayers bailed them out. Is it any \nwonder people across this country have a bad taste in their mouth about \nWall Street, about the TARP program, about the bonuses? Is it any \nwonder we are here this week considering a bill to make sure we never \nrelive this financial crisis? It is overdue--long overdue.\n  We know what this crisis cost us in real human terms. The estimates \nare that it took $17 trillion out of the American economy--$17 trillion \nin value--and it hit almost everybody. Anybody with a savings account, \na retirement account knows what I am talking about. The value of the \naccount went down 20, 30, 40 percent or more. So your net worth, your \nnest egg, your retirement plan was diminished because of this \nrecession.\n  In addition to that, 8 million people are currently unemployed across \nAmerica, having lost their jobs by this recession, and another 6 \nmillion have been unemployed long term and are not trying as hard as \nthey once did. Even though those numbers are getting better--in fact, \nlast week there was a good report--we know it is still serious. There \nare still too many people out of work because of this recession.\n  When we tried to bring this bill to the floor 2 weeks ago, we had a \ntough time. We had three votes Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, 2 weeks \nago, and they were filibustered from the Republican side of the aisle. \nThey refused to let us bring the bill to the floor.\n  While the filibuster votes were going on on the floor of the Senate, \nthough, on another stage on Capitol Hill, the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations of the Homeland Security Committee, chaired by Senator \nCarl Levin of Michigan, was holding a historic hearing and bringing in \nthe top leaders of Goldman Sachs, including its CEO, asking them about \ntheir practices that had led to financial difficulties at that company \nand were being questioned now even in a lawsuit that has been brought \nby our government against that company.\n  That display and that testimony was happening at the same time the \nRepublican filibuster to stop this reform bill was going on here on the \nfloor. Finally, several Republican Senators spoke up to their \nleadership and said: That is it. We want to engage in this debate. We \nwant to get it started. We want to do it in a prompt way.\n  The filibuster finally broke and we started, nominally, the debate \nlast week. You could count, I think, on one hand all the amendments we \nconsidered in that week. We could have done much better. We wasted a \nlot of time. There are important policy considerations that have to be \nasked and answered by votes on the Senate floor--some from the \nRepublican side, valid questions, and some from our side. What we are \nlooking for--and I think the American people are looking for--is for \nthe Senate to be the Senate, not just a dead end for debate, to \ndeliberate these issues and cast a vote and move forward.\n  There was an amendment--of great moment--offered by Senator Sherrod \nBrown of Ohio and Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware as to whether we \nshould limit the size of financial institutions. They had a very catchy \nmantra, which was: Too big to fail means too big. They would limit the \nsize of financial institutions so you could not have these big giants \ndominating the scene. There would be more competition and more \nfinancial institutions involved in our economy's business. That \namendment failed. It got 31 votes. I was 1 of the 31 who voted for it. \nI was disappointed, but let's be honest, that amendment had its day in \ncourt, on the floor of the Senate. We debated it and a vote was taken.\n  Now we are moving on to other amendments. Senator Sanders of Vermont \nwill offer an amendment, probably tomorrow, as to whether there should \nbe an audit of the activities of the Federal Reserve. This is a big \namendment and one that is somewhat controversial, but I think we have \nreached a point where Senator Sanders is likely to prevail. He came up \nwith a bold idea, and now I think we are going to move toward that \nidea. The Senate is doing what it is supposed to do. There are other \nthings we need to take up as well.\n  Senator McCain will offer an amendment about the future of Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, which are two government-type entities that literally \nback up the mortgages for most of the homes across America. They are in \ntrouble because so many homes across America are going underwater; that \nis, the value of the home is lower than the mortgage balance. If that \naffects one of the homeowners across the country, you can understand \nthat these agencies are going to be in trouble financially. What are we \ngoing to do about it? If we eliminate the agencies, the housing market \nwill collapse without this government guarantee. But if there is going \nto be a government guarantee,\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\nhow much will the taxpayers be on the line for? It is an important \npolicy issue.\n  I am glad we are moving into that debate. I wish to offer an \namendment on credit cards. Two years ago, we debated credit card \nreform. At the time, we passed a historic bill that changed some of the \nrules and gave consumers across America more rights and disclosure when \nit came to the use of credit cards. If there was one mistake made in \nthat credit reform, it was the argument between the large banks and \ncredit card companies that they could not implement the changes, unless \nthey were given a long lead time before it occurred. They were given \nthat lead time in the bill, and they have used that lead time \nconsistently to raise interest rates on credit cards across America. It \nwas a mistake. We should not have given them that much time. We should \nhave anticipated they would have done the wrong thing during that \nperiod of time.\n  There is another aspect of credit cards I would like to discuss, \nwhich I will offer an amendment on, which is the interchange fee. If I \nreach in my wallet and pull out my credit card at a restaurant in \nChicago and use it to pay, I am going to be billed for the cost of that \ndinner on my monthly bill, and I have to deal with the credit card \ncompany about how much interest I would pay on the balance I owe, for \nexample. However, there is another part of the transaction that takes \nplace between the restaurant and the credit card company. If I use a \ncredit card, then the restaurant is going to pay to the credit card \ncompany some percentage of the bill for my dinner. It turns out this \nso-called interchange fee between the retail establishment and the \ncredit card companies has become a serious problem.\n  Let me give you an illustration. I go to the same restaurant and \ninstead of using a credit card, I pay by check. It used to be done a \nlot but not much anymore. The restaurant takes your check to their bank \nand their bank calls your bank, transfers the funds in, and no fee is \ninvolved. However, if you use a debit card, which would take the money \ndirectly out of my checking account, the same as with my check, it \nturns out the interchange fee is applied. So many restaurants and \nretail establishments are saying: Why is it with a check the bank gets \nno extra money and with a debit card the credit card company gets \nmoney. What is that all about? Should it be the same fee as a credit \ncard?\n  These are legitimate questions that aren't a minor issue. They turn \nout to be a major issue. I had the CEO of Walgreens contact me last \nweek. He told me that when they look at the expenses of this national \nchain of drugstores, the No. 1 expense is compensation of employees, \npersonnel costs; No. 2, mortgage and rent payments; No. 3, health \ninsurance; No. 4, interchange fees. It turns out the fees Walgreens \npays to credit card companies is the fourth largest item of cost for \ntheir business.\n  Imagine that instead of being Walgreens, a national chain of \ndrugstores, you are a small town store. Let's think it through. How \nmany times have you gone to the cash register and stood behind as \nsomebody handed them a credit card or a debit card for a pack of \nchewing gum or something even smaller? I saw it at National Airport. \nAfter the person left, I said to the person at the cash register: What \nis the smallest amount anybody has ever put on a credit card here? He \nsaid it was 35 cents.\n  When you look at the interchange fees, it turns out that the retailer \nloses money on that sale. Most of these involve a flat fee that is \ncertainly more than the profit they are going to make on a 35-cent or \neven a $5 sale and a percentage of the actual item that is charged to \nthe credit card. I would say, when you look at this circumstance, you \ncan understand why some smaller businesses want to say there will be a \nminimum amount you can charge--not 35 cents but obviously something \nwhere they are not losing money. They will lose money if somebody uses \na credit card under the current interchange fees.\n  The major card companies currently--Visa and MasterCard--prohibit \ncompanies that accept their credit cards from establishing a minimum \namount that can be charged. They are going to make money, and they are \nnot going to give the retail establishments that kind of opportunity.\n  Of course, they also prohibit that company--that small retailer--from \nsaying: I get a better deal on the interchange fee from Visa than \nMasterCard, so I will favor Visa. They used to say: If you go to the \nOlympics, so and so is the official credit card of--they can say that, \nbut the retailer cannot say that. If you own a restaurant and say: I \nprefer this credit card or that credit card, you violate the agreements \nof the credit card companies.\n  With this amendment, we are trying to establish that the fees charged \nto retailers for debit card usage at their establishments will be \nreasonable and proportional. It will be monitored by the Federal \nReserve, which has that responsibility when it comes to credit card \ncharges for consumers. So there is some parallel thinking here. The \nFederal Reserve will look at both sides--the retail establishment as \nwell as the retail customer--in terms of the reasonable fees that can \nbe charged by credit card companies.\n  Secondly, we eliminate the prohibition against what I consider to be \ncompetitive practices, where you would say you cannot use a credit card \nor a debit card at my establishment if your bill is less than $5 or \nsomething of that nature. That is currently prohibited, but it would \nnot be under my amendment. This amendment has the support of some of \nthe largest retailers and small businesses in America. Thousands have \ncome to me and said: Please give us a fighting chance with the credit \ncard companies. They are killing us. I cannot tell you how many \nspeeches have been made on the floor of the Senate--on both sides of \nthe aisle--about small businesses. We believe--I think both parties \nbelieve--if we are going to come out of this recession, it will be \nbecause of the strength and recovery of small business. This amendment \nis the No. 1 priority of small businesses across America. I wish to \nbring this amendment to the floor for a debate and a vote.\n  My colleagues can decide, do they want to come down on the side of \nretail establishments and small business or on the side of the credit \ncard companies? Some will say: Wait a minute, what about community \nbanks, the small banks that issue credit cards too? We specifically \nexempt them when it comes to this question of debit cards. If your \nestablishment has less than $1 billion in assets--your bank--you will \nnot be subject to this regulation. We are going after the largest banks \nthat make the largest amount of money out of this, not the smalltown \nbanks with local credit cards. We are trying to make this focused and \nfair and help small businesses.\n\n  On Friday, I went to a press conference at a supermarket in downtown \nChicago. Potash Brothers have been around for decades, and it is a \ngreat success story of a family that came and opened a store. They have \ntwo or three and they are well liked and respected. They came and \ntestified at this press conference about what they are going through, \nthe struggle they have to make it as a small business in downtown \nChicago--a supermarket that has to pay these high fees to the credit \ncard companies. All they are asking is that the fees be fair.\n  We know that with the use of a credit card, the credit card company \nruns a risk that you would not pay off the balance. With the debit \ncard, it comes out of your checking account or it doesn't. There is not \na big risk factor involved.\n  Many people don't realize the size of this credit and debit card \ninvolvement in today's economy. Those cards are rapidly replacing cash \nand checks. There are over 1 billion credit and debit cards in the \nUnited States. In a nation of 300 million, that is more than three \ncards per person in the United States. Last year, Americans conducted \n$1.7 trillion in transactions on credit cards and $1.6 trillion on \ndebit cards.\n  Credit cards and debit cards are now used in more than half of all \nretail sales in America, and the number is growing. Yet while paying \nwith plastic may be a convenience for some, it turns out to be a real \nproblem for small businesses. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant--to give small businesses a fighting chance. Individual \nbusinesses have no chance against the giants. Visa and\n\n[[Page S3456]]\n\nMasterCard control about 80 percent of all the credit and debit cards \nin the United States. About $50 billion in interchange fees were \ncollected in 2008, and about 80 percent of that money went to 10 big \nbanks--the ones we think should be the subject of this requirement that \nthe fees be reasonable and proportional, based on the amount of work \nthat is being done.\n  It is no surprise these 10 banks hate the Durbin amendment like the \nDevil hates holy water. They cannot wait to see it defeated on the \nfloor. I wish to debate it on the floor on behalf of retailers and \nsmall businesses across America, and I would like my colleagues to have \na chance to join me in this effort. I don't think it is unreasonable. \nThe big banks will try to stop this amendment from coming to the floor, \nbut I will fight for it, and we are going to put people on record on \nhow they want to vote on this issue. This will be the first time \ninterchange fees will be taken up, to my knowledge, in the history of \nthe Congress. It is about time. It is a major part of our economy. I \nthink a fair and reasonable fee for the use of credit and debit cards \nis something we should stand behind and unreasonable charges should be \nbasically prohibited based on the regulation of the Federal Reserve.\n  I will be offering that amendment this week. Those who want to \ncosponsor it are welcome to.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/10/senate-section/article/S3456-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3456-S3457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks about the \nfinancial regulation bill, the Restoring American Financial Stability \nAct. Certainly, we need to take some steps to deal with the catastrophe \nwe have gone through--the damage and destruction, and the financial \nmismanagement that has been wreaked on us and from which people are \nstill suffering today.\n  This crisis exploded in the fall of 2007. It was centered in the \nhousing market and home loans. The question people ask and should ask \nis: How did it happen? Did Congress know about it? Why didn't Congress \ndo something about it?\n  There is a false myth out there--many have heard it--that somehow \nthis crisis was a product of Ronald Reagan and his disciple George Bush \nbecause they did not believe in regulations, they opposed regulations, \nderegulation is what caused this and more regulations would have \nprevented it. And so to the rescue, this myth says, come Democratic \ncolleagues and President Obama with more new regulations that are going \nto fix the problem.\n  I believe good regulations can be helpful. Anybody who has lived in \nthe world and been in businesses and governments knows there are bad \nregulations that drive people crazy every day, that drive up the cost \nof products, that costs jobs in America, and that should not be on the \nbooks. The question is: How do we have a good regulation or a bad \nregulation?\n  Let me focus for a second on a critical component of the fundamental \nproblem, which was the housing market, and how our government-sponsored \nentities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, came to be responsible for half \nof the housing loans in America--50 percent of the housing market. How \ndid they get involved in that, and how was this the big factor in the \neconomic destruction we suffer?\n  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration, and the \nVeterans Administration backed 96.5 percent of home loans in the first \nquarter of 2010. It used to be you went to your bank and they loaned \nyou the money. If they did not think you were creditworthy, you did not \nget the money. Some people would complain, but a lot of times people \nwere saved from very unwise decisions because their banker correctly \nintuited they were not going to be able to make these payments, there \nwas too much risk because they had a better perspective on who could be \nsuccessful in paying off the loans.\n  Before Freddie and Fannie collapsed in 2008, they owned or guaranteed \n$5.2 trillion in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, almost half \nof their $12 trillion market. Prior to that, Freddie and Fannie were \nleveraged at twice the rate at Bear Stearns which failed. In other \nwords, they had half the real capital for the loans they made, as did \nBear Stearns, which failed.\n  Because of this improvident policy, Freddie and Fannie have cost the \ntaxpayers $126 billion. That is an incredible sum of money. Fannie Mae \nreported a $72 billion loss for 2009; Freddie Mac reported a $22 \nbillion for 2009; and it came in last week asking for another $10 \nbillion.\n  CBO, our Congressional Budget Office which analyzes these costs, \nprojects Fannie and Freddie will ultimately cost the taxpayers $389 \nbillion. But that amount is not on the government's books. Because of \nthe way our books are managed, these two institutions are supposed to \nbe somehow quasi-private and thus not affecting the government \nTreasury. But they did affect the government Treasury.\n  I asked the question at the beginning: How did it happen? What did \nCongress know and did not know, and why did Congress not act? These are \ngood questions. I am pushing back a little bit. I am not going to \ncontinue to have all this talk that somehow Ronald Reagan is \nresponsible for this crisis.\n  Let me read a letter. I do not think a lot of people paid much \nattention to it at the time, but it was very real. I remember reading \nfrom it in debate during that time. It is a letter to my colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Richard Shelby, who was chairman of the Banking \nCommittee. It is dated March 31, 2008, from the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System, signed by none other than Alan Greenspan, \nChairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  Remember, at this time, Senator Shelby and Republicans had become \nconcerned about the health of Freddie and Fannie. They realized they \nwere overleveraged and presented great risk. This was 2004, about 3 \nyears before the collapse occurred. Senator Shelby felt something \nshould be done about it. My Republican colleague offered legislation to \ndo something about it. This is what Alan Greenspan wrote:\n\n       Thank you for requesting the views of the Federal Reserve \n     Board on the legislation you have proposed to improve the \n     supervision and regulation of government-sponsored \n     enterprises.\n\n  That is GSEs, that is Freddie and Fannie.\n\n       As I stated in my testimony of February 24, the Congress \n     needs to create a GSE regulator with authority on a par with \n     banking regulators, with a free hand to set appropriate \n     capital standards, and with a clear process sanctioned by the \n     Congress for placing a GSE in receivership.\n\n  It had begun to dawn on them that these GSEs could go into \nreceivership. They were so overleveraged. They were on the verge of \ncollapse. That is what he wrote to Senator Shelby in early 2004.\n  He goes on to say, and this language is dramatic:\n\n       To fend off possible future systemic difficulties, which we \n     assess as likely if current trends continue unabated, \n     preventive actions are required sooner rather than later.\n\n  Isn't that a dramatic statement, ``To fend off possible systemic \ndifficulties''? Did we not have the whole system go into a spin and we \nare still suffering from it and may for years to come?\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       The Board believes your proposed legislation makes \n     substantial progress toward meeting these objectives.\n       With regard to the receivership issue, the Board continues \n     to believe that the Congress needs to clarify the \n     circumstances under which a GSE can become insolvent and, in \n     particular, the resulting position--both during and after \n     insolvency--of the investors that hold GSE debt. The process \n     must be clear before it is needed. Leaving the matter \n     unresolved, as it is under current law, only heightens the \n     prospect that a crisis would result in an explicit \n     guaranteeing of GSE debt. In this area, too, your proposal \n     makes substantial strides.\n\n  It is basically an endorsement of Senator Shelby's efforts. Not \nbasically, it is a flat out endorsement. He goes on to say:\n\n       With regard to capital, the Board continues to believe that \n     determining the suitable amount of capital for GSEs is a \n     difficult and technical process, and, that a regulator should \n     have a free hand in determining both\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\n     the minimum and risk-based capital standards for these \n     institutions. Your proposal, which gives the new regulator \n     more discretion in these areas, is an important improvement \n     in this respect.\n\n  This was an endorsement by the Federal Reserve Board of Senator \nShelby's efforts to reform. What happened? Senator Shelby brought it up \nin the Banking Committee, and it passed the committee on a straight \nparty-line vote. All Republicans voted for increased regulations, \nincreased accountability, increased capitalization of Freddie and \nFannie, and every Democrat on the committee voted against it.\n  When it got to the floor, it was subject to a 60-vote filibuster. It \nwas clear the Democrats had sent word they were not going to support \nit, and there was no prospect of passing the bill. Although he bill \npassed in committee, it never actually passed the Senate floor.\n  I want to say the idea that the only greed, the only mismanagement \nwas with private bankers is not accurate. There was plenty of that. I \nhave no grief to bear for the big guys on Wall Street. They rolled the \ndice. I voted against their bailout and I do not believe they should \nhave been bailed out at all. They should have suffered the \nconsequences. We would probably be better off today economically \nbecause we would have taken the hit and gotten it out of our system. We \ncan dispute that. All I can say is there are other areas of greed and \nmismanagement.\n  But currently, 96 percent of home loans are backed by government \ninstitutions--Fannie, Freddie, VA, the Housing Administration. Who is \nto say they are always perfect? We know, as Senator McCain has pointed \nout in his amendment to this legislation that is before us today, that \nwe can still do more about it.\n  Since 96 percent of housing mortgages are now backed by government \ninstitutions, why does this legislation not deal with it? Why does it \nnot? It completely sidesteps the issue. Why? Because we would have to \ndeal with how to score and add to our debt another $400 billion. Is \nthat one reason?\n  Is another reason because Freddie and Fannie have been so powerful \npolitically that they have been able to fend off the oversight they \nshould have been subjected to from the beginning? Is it a belief \nsomehow because they are quasi-government institutions that they can do \nno wrong, that only private industries and institutions can do wrong?\n  I don't know exactly why all of this is so, but it is not dealt with, \nand it should be dealt with. Senator McCain's legislation will deal \nwith it. He made a speech Thursday in which he delineated the history \nof how this all occurred. I thought it was very valuable insight. \nAmericans should know about this. When the government comes in and \nallows politics and governmental policy to override financial reality, \nthen we can get in trouble. If you order agencies or agencies are \nwilling to make bad loans because they think that somehow it is good \npolicy, do people think nobody is going to have to pick up the tab some \nday in the future? I am afraid they are.\n  The situation we are in arose from the fact that richly paid GSE \nexecutives and their political supporters had no skin in the game on \nthe loans they were making. They were getting their salaries, and they \nkept getting their salaries even when it became clear the firms were \nmismanaged and heading for disaster and were going to be bailed out by \nthe American taxpayers. They operated recklessly and they, I believe it \nis fair to say, were the precipitating cause, frankly, of the collapse \nof the financial markets; if not the cause, one of the primary causes \nof it. It is unbelievable and improper that when we propose legislation \nto restore America's financial stability, we don't fix the Freddie and \nFannie problem.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Wall Street Journal wrote that ``reforming the \nfinancial system without fixing Freddie and Fannie is like declaring a \nwar on terror and ignoring al-Qaida.''\n  Fannie and Freddie were at the center of it.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 3217, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3217) to promote the financial stability of the \n     United States by improving accountability and transparency in \n     the financial system, to end ``too big to fail,'' to protect \n     the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect \n     consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Dodd/Lincoln) amendment No. 3739, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Sanders/Dodd modified amendment No. 3738 (to amendment No. \n     3739), to require the nonpartisan Government Accountability \n     Office to conduct an independent audit of the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System that does not \n     interfere with monetary policy, to let the American people \n     know the names of the recipients of over $2,000,000,000,000 \n     in taxpayer assistance from the Federal Reserve System.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Senator Bob Bennett of Utah\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to share a few thoughts, if I may, \nfor a minute or so on the pending matter before us. But before I do \nthat--and at a later time I will speak at greater length about this--I \nwant to express my regrets over the decision made in Utah over the \nweekend regarding Bob Bennett, our colleague.\n  I have served with Bob for 18 years. We have been on the Banking \nCommittee together during that time. Obviously, we have differences of \nopinion on a lot of policy questions. In fact, the majority of policy \nquestions we have had our differences on. But at critical moments, Bob \nBennett was always someone you could talk to, someone you could \napproach with an idea or an issue.\n  He went through a tough battle over the last number of weeks and did \nnot prevail in his convention over the weekend in Utah. But I want to \nexpress to him and Joyce how much this institution will miss them in \nthe coming year. He is a thoughtful, considerate individual. He is \ndeliberate in his views and accessible when it comes to others' ideas. \nIn my view, it will be a loss for the institution that he will not be \nback. That is coming from a Democrat on this side of the aisle.\n  I realize there is a contest coming up, but I didn't want the day to \nbegin or end without expressing my disappointment over the results in \nUtah. I know that is probably not appropriate for Democrats, making \ncomments about Republican races, but Bob Bennett is one fine U.S. \nSenator, and he has played an invaluable role, a critical role at \ncritical junctures over the last number of years that I have served \nwith him.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to make some comments about the bill \nbefore us. It has been nearly 7 weeks since the Banking Committee \napproved legislation to reform Wall Street. It has been more than 3 \nyears since our committee began work on this very important topic. It \nwas in January or early February of 2007 that I became chairman of the \nBanking Committee for the first time, and, obviously, the news even at \nthat early date was about the mortgage foreclosure issue.\n  A lot of work has gone on in the Banking Committee. We have literally \nhad dozens and dozens of hearings and meetings with people on how best \nto\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\naddress this economic decline that we have suffered--with 8\\1/2\\ \nmillion jobs being lost and 7 million homes in foreclosure. In fact, \nover the weekend there was a report that nearly 4 million households \nare severely delinquent on their mortgages, and 250,000 homes have been \nseized--are in foreclosure--since the first 3 months of this.\n  Even though we have 4 million homes delinquent on their mortgages, \nwhich is the largest backlog since the crisis began, there is some \npositive news on job creation--290,000 jobs in the month of April, \nwhich is 121,000 more jobs created in the first few months of the year \nthan were anticipated. We are clearly seeing an economy that seems to \nbe improving. But when we have 4 million homes that are underwater, we \nalso realize we are far from out of this difficulty, particularly if \nyou are a working family.\n  We also, of course, saw last Thursday a market decline of 1,000 \npoints in almost 17 minutes. The Presiding Officer and I, in fact, \ntalked about this over the weekend, and I appreciate his insights and \nobservations on the matter as someone who spent time working in this \nfield before getting involved in public life. There are a number of \nideas emerging as to how this happened, and my hope is that as early as \nnext week our Banking Committee will have an informal meeting with \npeople from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, as well as others, to hear what they think \nhappened and what steps they are taking to minimize that event from \noccurring again.\n  Then, of course, over the weekend we had the stories emerging about \nEurope and the Euro and what was occurring in Greece and other nations \nin danger of going to default because of the huge debt problems that \nexist. Tomorrow morning, our committee will be briefed by the Federal \nReserve as well as the Secretary of the Treasury on exactly what plans \nhave been put in place in Europe.\n  I do not want to dwell on either of those points at this juncture \nexcept to make this point. Here we have an event totally unrelated to \nmismanagement of investment banks or financial institutions in the case \nof a market decline as precipitous as we saw Thursday and events that \nare beyond the borders of our own nation that will have an impact at \nhome. We are told this is not going to have any kind of severe impact--\nat least we don't believe it will at this juncture. But we do live in a \nhighly sophisticated, computerized world with this flash trading, as it \nis called--``high frequency trading,'' as it is referred to--where \nliterally within microseconds buyers and sellers are matched up. What \nthe system doesn't accommodate for is panic, unfortunately, and \napparently the circuit breakers necessary in market-wide exchanges to \nminimize these kinds of events when they occur and also events that \noccur in a small country in the Mediterranean--such as Greece or \nPortugal or Spain or other countries--where their debt situations pose \nrisks globally.\n  So what is critically important, in my view, is, while our \nlegislation before us it not going to stop crises from occurring, what \nwe try to do is provide our government with the necessary tools so we \ncan respond when crises occur. No one can stop the rain from coming. It \nwill happen. It will happen again and again. What you can do, however, \nis make sure the roof is going to be solid enough so it doesn't leak or \nthat you are not going to be in a situation where, when things break \ndown in the next crisis, no matter how modest it may be, it endangers \nthe job creation as we saw in this country--as we are today seeing \nmassive losses occurring, retirement accounts declining. The value of \nhomes has gone down some 30 percent in the last several years. Again, \nthere are some indications that things are improving here at home, and \nwe welcome that news. But if you are one of those 8.5 million who lost \na job or home or if you are a retiree who watched your savings \ndisappear overnight, as many did in this country, then this positive \nnews, while it is welcome, is hardly any relief to you.\n  So it is critically important because we are in no better shape today \ndespite advances and the progress we have made on this bill. If \nsomething were to happen tonight or tomorrow in our own country or \nsomething happened elsewhere that would have the contagion effect, it \nis called, to spread here or elsewhere, we have not yet passed this \nlegislation. We don't have any more provisions in place than we did in \nthe fall of 2008 when the problems exploded. While we have written \nstrong provisions in this bill that never would allow an institution to \nbecome too big to fail, the fact is that has only been adopted in a \nbill that has yet to be passed in this body, yet to be reconciled with \nthe language from the other Chamber in this Congress and to be signed \ninto law by the President.\n  It is important that we get this job done. We have had a good debate \nup until now. With the guidance of our leadership, we will begin \ntomorrow to consider some amendments, allowing for some adequate \ndebate--hopefully not too long on each of these ideas. And there are a \nlot of ideas we have, both Democrats and Republicans. We can have our \nvotes on these matters and either include them or exclude them on the \nlegislation. But we need to get this job done, I hope this week--at the \nvery latest, the end of this week--so we can work with the other body \nand resolve the differences and get this legislation to the President.\n  I would be the last one to suggest that what we have written here \ntakes care of every imaginable situation. It doesn't at all. What it \ndoes is it ends too big to fail and puts in place a consumer protection \nbureau that has never existed before in our Nation so that average \ncitizens might have some redress when a mortgage broker or company \ntakes advantage of them. We try to put in place an early warning system \nso when matters like those that happened in Europe or other places \noccur, we can respond to them early and adequately so they don't \nexplode and expand to affect everyone else in economy. We also deal \nwith some of these exotic instruments that were totally unregulated and \noperated in the shadow economy of our Nation.\n  There are other provisions in the bill, but those are the four at \nleast major goals. As I said a moment ago, I know there are other \ncircumstances people wanted to accommodate in this legislation. But, as \nmy colleague from New Hampshire pointed out the other day, some of \nthese other issues are so complex, they will need adequate study, and \ntrying to sort of hurl them into this bill or eliminate things without \nany alternative being proposed is not exactly the wise way to be \ndealing with matters as important as the financial sector of our \nNation.\n  I am grateful to our colleagues for what they have done already. As \nmany have pointed out, this has been a worthwhile process. It has taken \na long time considering the implications--none of us, obviously, want \nto have the so-called unintended consequences. No matter how good we \nthink our ideas are, we need to make sure what we are doing is not \ngoing to provoke its own set of difficulties.\n  We have to finish our work on this legislation, not just in \nrecognition of what has happened but in preparation for what may happen \nnext. As we have seen in recent days, the shocks to our system are as \ninevitable as rainfall. Throughout Europe, as we have seen, countries \nare bracing for the effects of the Greek crisis, effects which respect \nno boundaries and offer no safe haven for anyone. Right here at home, \nour market stumbled, as we saw last week with our stock market tumbling \nhundreds of points before righting itself.\n  Again, as I made reference to a moment ago, the rain is coming, but \nwe need to fix our roof so we don't all suffer as a result of the \ninevitability of rain. The issues raised by the crisis in Greece and \nlast week's stock market scare require our attention--and they have it.\n  I have asked Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who chairs the \nsubcommittee dealing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to \nprepare for hearings on the stock market issue so we can get to the \nbottom of what happened.\n  As I mentioned, our staff is working to ensure our government does \nits part to help contain the crisis in Europe--at least to watch it and \ndetermine whether there are any spillover effects. But these events are \nreminders that our work on this legislation must look through the \nwindshield at the crises to come, not just in the rearview mirror at \nthe one from which we are now just\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\nemerging. They are a further reminder that our work does not end with \nthis legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in making a final push to get this \nbill done so we can move on to those other emerging issues. When we do, \nwe can face these challenges with the knowledge that we have \nstrengthened our financial system; that although we cannot prevent \ncrises from occurring, we can prepare for them so their effects are not \nfelt by ordinary Americans to the extent they have been in the last \nnumber of years. That is all we are really trying to do. I always get \nuneasy when I hear authors of bills claim they are going to solve every \nproblem known to mankind in that issue area. We are not, unfortunately. \nWe do the best we can under the circumstances.\n  Again, last Thursday's and the weekend's events are a constant \nreminder that we live in an ever-shrinking world and we are affected by \nevents far beyond our shores. It is not just because some company did \nsomething wrong. It can happen far away and yet have implications here. \nBut we need to make sure the next generation will have tools on hand so \nthey can spot problems early on and take steps to minimize their \neffects here at home when they occur. That is the goal of this bill. It \nis not an insignificant one; it is an important one.\n  I thank my colleagues. They have been extremely constructive and \nthoughtful over the last week or so. We had a good weekend. A lot of \npeople stepped forward, and we were able to work out some language that \nI think will allow various provisions to be adopted. More work needs to \nbe done, but I am confident we can achieve that goal.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge once again my thanks to the \nPresiding Officer, a new Member of this body and the banking committee \nbut he has made invaluable contributions to this product. While not a \nchairman of even a subcommittee yet, he has acted as a very senior \nMember in many ways because of the knowledge he has brought to this \ndiscussion and debate. That has been, as I said, invaluable to this \nchairman of the committee, and I thank him personally for his efforts \nin that regard.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Maine, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of an \namendment I filed to direct regulators to impose tough risk- and size-\nbased capital standards on financial institutions as they grow in size \nor engage in risky business practices. I am pleased to offer this \namendment on behalf of Senator Shaheen and myself.\n  Our amendment is aimed at addressing the too-big-to-fail problem at \nthe root of the current crisis by requiring financial firms to have \nadequate amounts of cash and other liquid assets to survive financial \ncrises without turning to the taxpayers for a bailout. It is critical \nto our ability to avoid future crises that this amendment be adopted.\n  I am very pleased that the FDIC Chairman, Sheila Bair, has strongly \nendorsed our amendment. In a recent letter to me, Chairman Bair called \nthis proposal:\n\n     . . . a critical element to ensure that U.S. financial \n     institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb losses during \n     future periods of financial stress. With new resolution \n     authority, taxpayers will no longer bail out large financial \n     institutions. This makes it imperative that they have \n     sufficient capital to stand on their own in times of \n     adversity.\n\n  Chairman Bair also noted the importance of ensuring that bank holding \ncompanies and large nonbanks are held to the same capital and risk \nstandards that are applied to insured banks in order to protect against \nexcessive leverage that could destabilize our financial system. As \nChairman Bair put it, ``The amendment accomplishes this goal simply and \ndirectly.''\n  It makes no sense that capital and risk standards for our Nation's \nlargest financial institutions are more lenient than those that apply \nto small depository banks, when the failure of larger institutions is \nmuch more likely to have a broad economic impact. Yet that is currently \nthe case. We must give the regulators the tools to end and the \ndirection to address this problem. If financial firms, including bank \nholding companies, were required to meet stronger capital standards, \nthey would be far less likely to fail and to trigger the kind of \ncascade of economic harm we have been experiencing since 2008.\n  The Collins-Shaheen amendment directs Federal regulators to impose \nminimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on banks, bank \nholding companies, and those nonbank financial firms identified by the \nnew Financial Stability Oversight Council for supervision by the \nFederal Reserve. Neither current law nor the bill before us requires \nregulators to adjust capital standards for risk factors as financial \ninstitutions grow in size and engage in risky practices.\n  The current Senate financial regulatory reform bill also does not \nrequire regulators to apply minimum capital and risk measures across \nfinancial institutions, as would be required by our amendment. As the \nFDIC Chairman has noted about the current financial crisis, ``Far from \nbeing a source of strength to banks . . . holding companies became a \nsource of weakness, requiring financial support.''\n  She went on to caution that ``they should not be allowed to operate \nunder consolidated capital requirements that are numerically lower and \nqualitatively less stringent than those that apply to insured banks.''\n  Our amendment would tighten the standards that would apply to larger \nfinancial institutions by requiring them to meet, at a minimum, the \nstandards that already apply to small banks. This only makes sense. If \na small bank fails, the FDIC can close down that bank over a weekend, \nallow it to operate, avoid a run on the bank, and deal with it in an \norderly way. But if a large bank holding company fails, it is so \ninterconnected in our economy that it sets off a cascade of dire \neconomic consequences. That was the point that the chairman of the \nBanking Committee was just making. We live in such an interconnected \nglobal financial system now.\n  So, from my point of view, a view that is shared by the Chairman of \nthe FDIC, it is only prudent for us to empower the regulators to \nimpose, at a minimum, the same kinds of capital and leverage \nrequirements and restrictions that apply to small insured banks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Chairman Bair be printed \nin the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. I had the privilege of serving the people of Maine as a \nfinancial regulator for 5 years about 20 years ago. This is an issue \nabout which I care deeply and am committed to helping forge a solution \nto, so that never again can the problems and the excesses of Wall \nStreet have such dire consequences for Main Street.\n  Increasing capital requirements as firms grow provides a disincentive \nto their becoming too big to fail in the first place, and ensures an \nadequate capital cushion in difficult economic times. Our amendment \ndirects the regulators to establish capital standards that take size \nand risk into account.\n  Our amendment strengthens the economic foundation of large financial \nfirms, increases oversight and accountability, and helps prevent the \nexcesses that contributed to a deep recession that has cost millions of \nAmericans their jobs.\n  Let me conclude by thanking the chairman of the Banking Committee and \nthe ranking member of the Banking Committee and members such as the \nPresiding Officer and Senator Corker and Senator Gregg for their work \non this very complex issue. More than a year ago I introduced a \nfinancial regulatory reform bill. I had the pleasure of discussing the \nbill with the chairman of the Banking Committee, and I am pleased with \nmuch of what is in his bill at this point in the debate.\n  I hope we can continue to make further changes, such as the amendment \nI have proposed with Senator Shaheen, but I do want to salute the \nmembers of the Banking Committee. I know this is enormously complex \nand, at times, a thankless task. But it is so important. In fact, I \nargued that we should have dealt with financial regulatory reform last \nyear. I think it is that important to the future of our economy. We \nrealize we were operating with regulatory\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\nblack holes that allowed, for example, trillions of dollars of credit \ndefault swaps to develop with no one having oversight or visibility as \nfar as their impact on the financial market.\n  They were not regulated as insurance, even though I personally \nbelieve they act as an insurance product, nor were they regulated by \nthe banking regulators. The creation of the Council of Regulators in \nthis bill has not received a great deal of discussion, but I think it \nis one of the most important provisions in this reform, and it is one \nthat has widespread bipartisan support. It was the key feature of the \nbill I introduced last year. I have discussed it with the Presiding \nOfficer as well.\n  I personally still believe we need an independent chairman of that \ncouncil rather than the Secretary of the Treasury. I think we need to \nbroaden the makeup of the council to include some State regulators so \nthat the insurance area is covered, and State securities \nadministrators, since they play such a critical role. I think those \nState regulators should be brought on to the council in a nonvoting \ncapacity given the constitutional issues. But that council is \nabsolutely critical. I think we should add the regulator for credit \nunions to that council. What we want is a council with as broad an \noverview as possible, bringing together everyone who has a role so we \ndo not have these regulatory gaps, these black holes developing in the \nfuture, and so that we can bring the collective wisdom of these \nofficials to the table.\n  So that is an example of a provision of this bill that I think is \nextraordinarily important. But perhaps because it does have widespread \nsupport, it has not generated much discussion on this floor. So I \nwanted to mention that and salute the committee for what I think is a \nprovision that is going to make a real difference in preventing the \nkinds of problems we saw that triggered the recession of 2008.\n  I also want to commend Senator Levin and Senator Coburn for their \nwork on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the Senate's \npremiere investigative subcommittee which is part of the Homeland \nSecurity Governmental Affairs Committee which Senator Lieberman and I \nhave the privilege of leading. They have given us great insight into \nthe role of everyone from sloppy mortgage brokers and bankers who threw \nunderwriting standards out the window and made loans that never should \nhave been made to people who could not possibly repay them.\n  They have looked at the role of credit rating agencies that also did \nnot perform in the way we would like. They have looked at the role of \ninvestment banks such as Goldman Sachs. We need to take the lessons we \nhave learned, the great depth of knowledge in this body, and work \ntogether in a bipartisan way. That is what we have been doing in the \nlast couple of weeks.\n  In closing, let me just say, we have made a lot of progress. I am \nconfident we can get there. Let's not pull the plug on this debate \nprematurely. There are a lot of amendments that are good-faith \namendments that are still out there. Let's work through them and \ncontinue to strengthen and improve this bill which has so many \nexcellent features to it.\n  At the end of the day, I hope we can vote on a bill that will command \nthe support of 70 Members of this body. I would like it to be all 100, \nbut let's aim for 70. In doing so we can demonstrate to the American \npeople that we can come together and work on an issue that really \nmatters--matters to our economy, to the American homeowners, to our \nsmall businesses, to anyone who has a retirement account. It matters to \nevery American.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   Federal Deposit\n\n\n                                        Insurance Corporation,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2010.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for your amendment number 3879 to ensure strong \n     capital requirements for our nation's financial institutions. \n     This amendment is a critical element to ensure that U.S. \n     financial institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb \n     losses during future periods of financial stress. With new \n     resolution authority, taxpayers will no longer bail out large \n     financial institutions. This makes it imperative that they \n     have sufficient capital to stand on their own in times of \n     adversity.\n       During the crisis, FDIC-insured subsidiary banks became the \n     source of strength both to the holding companies and holding \n     company affiliates. Far from being a source of strength to \n     banks as Congress intended, holding companies became a source \n     of weakness requiring federal support. If, in the future, \n     bank holding companies are to become sources of financial \n     stability for insured banks, then they cannot operate under \n     consolidated capital requirements that are numerically lower \n     and qualitatively less stringent than those applying to \n     insured banks. This amendment would address this issue by \n     requiring bank holding companies to operate under capital \n     standards at least as stringent as those applying to banks.\n       The crisis also demonstrated the dangers of excessive \n     leverage undertaken by large nonbanks outside of the scope of \n     federal bank regulation. Notable examples included the \n     excessive leverage of the largest investment banks during the \n     run-up to the crisis, and the extremely high leverage of \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. To remedy this and prevent \n     regulatory gaps and arbitrage, large nonbank financial \n     institutions deemed to be systemic must be held to the same, \n     or higher, capital standards as those applying to banks and \n     bank holding companies. Again, the amendment accomplishes \n     this goal simply and directly.\n       Finally, and more broadly, the crisis identified the \n     dangers of a regulatory mindset focused exclusively on the \n     soundness of individual banks without reference to the ``big \n     picture.'' For example, an individual overnight repo may be \n     safe, but widespread financing of illiquid securities with \n     overnight repos left the system vulnerable to a liquidity \n     crisis. A financial system-wide view requires regulators, \n     working in conjunction with the new Financial Services \n     Oversight Panel, to develop capital regulations to address \n     the risks of activities that affect the broader financial \n     system, beyond the bank that is engaging in the activity.\n       We at the FDIC remain committed to working with you towards \n     a stronger financial system. This amendment will be an \n     important step in accomplishing this goal.\n       If you have further questions or comments, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me or Paul Nash, Deputy for External \n     Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila C. Bair,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Before my friend and fellow New Englander leaves the floor, \nlet me thank her for her comments, but also let me thank her for this \nwhole notion of leverage and capital standards as well. It is something \nwe feel equally strongly about.\n  We have provisions in the bill, but anything can be strengthened. We \nare very interested in the idea that the Senator from Maine and Senator \nShaheen have brought to the table, and invite, at this moment, their \nstaff and others to get with ours and take a look and see if we \ncannot--and I will talk to Senator Shelby as well because it is \nimportant.\n  There has been some debate, and I go back and forth in this regard. I \nhave always resisted the idea that the Senate should set accounting \nstandards. We have had some times in the past on stock options--I \nrecall a few years ago the debate was whether we would set the \naccounting standard on stock options.\n  I thought there was a very persuasive argument made by the industry \nthat pointed out that we should probably consider them as a tool to \nattract, particularly, startup companies. But as attracted as I was to \ntheir ideas, I did not want to open the box of beginning to set \naccounting standards in Congress. We have competency here, but \nsometimes we get beyond our competency.\n  The issue was sort of the same on capital leverage, that we have to \nhave stronger leverage and capital standards. The debate is, should we \nactually set the leverage here or do we say we want strong standards \nand defer to our regulators to determine exactly what that standard \nought to be? Clearly, we need to have better leverage and better \ncapital standards. If we do not, these large institutions--my colleague \nfrom Maine is absolutely correct in this regard, that we will end up \nthen having these institutions that are interconnected. If we do not \ndemand greater accountability through that requirement, then we expose \nourselves to the very kinds of things we are seeing elsewhere.\n  So I thank her for this, and over the next day or so let's see if we \ncan take a look at the Senator's amendment and adopt it as well. I \nthank her for her ideas as well on the oversight council we have \ncrafted. Actually, many of us\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\nlike the idea of having an independent chair. We had this debate.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury was not my first choice, the \nindependent chair--but as my colleague from Maine knows, having chaired \ncommittees, when you are trying to get a committee to agree on \nsomething, the idea is the one that prevailed--having the Secretary of \nthe Treasury was the one that prevailed, as the Presiding Officer will \nrecall in those discussions. But, clearly, as to the idea of having the \ncredit unions, the Senator makes a lot of sense. It is a major part of \nour economy, and having the State regulators at least represented at \nthat table makes sense to me as well.\n  So maybe before this is over we can accommodate some of those \nadditional ideas. But I thank the Senator immensely for her \ncontribution, and I appreciate, as well, that she understands how long \nand arduous this has been to get to the best we can. When we have 100 \nof us here dealing with something of this magnitude, it is harder to \nput that together. But we are getting there. And I agree with her that \nwe ought to be able to finish. It does not mean we are going to satisfy \neveryone, and it cannot go on forever, but we certainly ought to \naccommodate as many different ideas as we can and make our judgments on \nthem to include them in the bill.\n  I thank her immensely for her contribution.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as the debate over Wall Street enters a \npivotal stage, we should ask ourselves, what is financial regulatory \nreform about? We all agree that one of the main objectives of the \nlegislation is to ensure taxpayers will no longer be forced to bail out \nor subsidize financial institutions that engage in risky behavior. That \nmeans ending so-called too big to fail. Unfortunately, the legislation \nwe are now considering does not mention the two institutions that have \ncome to epitomize too big to fail. I am referring to the two \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, the so-called GSEs, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, which are currently in Federal conservatorship. The \negregious behavior of these two institutions has rippled throughout the \nentire commercial banking sector and our economy as a whole.\n  Let's recall how central the two GSEs were to the housing bubble. \nFannie and Freddie represent the dangers of what former American \nEnterprise Institute president Chris DeMuth has described as ``fusion \nenterprise,'' or the ``intermingling of politics and power with finance \nand commerce.'' This is a perverse business model that allows companies \nto reap enormous private profits while enjoying either implicit or \nexplicit public backing. It is the model that enabled Fannie and \nFreddie to inflate the subprime mortgage bubble.\n  For years some of my colleagues and I have urged this Chamber to \nimpose stronger regulations on Fannie and Freddie. As chairman of the \nSenate Republican Policy Committee, I authored several papers on the \nthreats posed by the size of their mortgage-backed securities \nportfolios. I was particularly concerned that the government's implicit \nguarantee of these institutions permitted them to operate without \nadequate capital, to assume more risk than competing financial \ninstitutions, and to borrow at a below-market rate of interest. Of \ncourse, that is just what happened. Smaller companies got crushed while \nFannie and Freddie engaged in increasingly risky lending with the \nbacking of the Federal Government. Wall Street understood how it \nworked. So when Fannie and Freddie wanted these toxic loans, the \nmortgage markets would produce them. Between 2004 and 2007, Fannie and \nFreddie became the largest buyers of subprime and Alt-A mortgages. And \nalthough these two institutions had their own dedicated regulator, the \nOffice of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight still allowed the \nsituation to spiral out of control. Fannie and Freddie made mortgages \navailable to too many people who could not afford them. That easy \ncredit fueled rapidly rising home prices. As prices rose, so did also \nthe demand for even larger mortgages, so Fannie and Freddie looked for \nways to make even more mortgage credit available to borrowers with a \nquestionable ability to repay.\n  By 2008, the two GSEs held nearly $5 trillion in mortgages and \nmortgage-backed securities. They were overleveraged and too big to \nfail. It was a textbook example of moral hazard on a massive scale. \n``Worst of all,'' M Bank CEO Robert Wilmers recently wrote in the \nWall Street Journal, ``are the tracts of foreclosed homes left behind \nby households lured into inappropriate mortgages by the lax credit \nstandards made possible by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.''\n  Congress would have done well to support a bill adopted by the \nBanking Committee in 2005 under then-Chairman Shelby. The bill would \nhave established a new regulator for Fannie and Freddie and given that \nregulator authority to make sure the GSEs maintained adequate amounts \nof capital, had adequately liquidity and reserves, properly managed \ntheir interest rate risk, and controlled their asset investment \nportfolio growth. But the legislation was filibustered. Its opponents \nincluded then-Senator Obama.\n  As American Enterprise Institute scholar Peter Wallison, who has \nwritten extensively on this topic, concluded:\n\n       If legislation along the lines of the Senate committee's \n     bill had been enacted in that year, many, if not all, the \n     losses that Fannie and Freddie have suffered, and will suffer \n     in the future, might have been avoided.\n\n  But, of course, we didn't avoid that fate. And today, Fannie and \nFreddie continue to impose on the taxpayers while accruing massive \ndebt. In fact, their total debt outstanding, the debt held on their \nbalance sheets or as mortgage security guarantees, is an astounding \n$8.1 trillion. This is debt that is not reflected on the national \nbalance sheet. Last Wednesday, Freddie Mac announced it will need an \nadditional capital injection of $10.6 billion. That is from the \ntaxpayers. That is after it lost $6.7 billion during the first quarter \nof this year. In 10 of the last 11 quarters, Freddie Mac has lost a \ntotal of $82 billion which is twice the amount it earned over the \nprevious 30 years.\n  This morning it was reported that Fannie too has asked taxpayers for \nmore money, $8.4 billion, to cover its soaring losses. The combined \ngovernment loss for both companies now stands at $145 billion, \naccording to the Associated Press. Where will this end? Weren't we \nsupposed to end taxpayer liability for entities too big to fail?\n  The McCain amendment, which we will be voting on hopefully tomorrow, \nwill provide us with another opportunity to target the problems caused \nby Fannie and Freddie. The McCain amendment would end the \nconservatorship within 2 years and place both companies into \nreceivership if they are not viable. It would also reduce the \ncompanies' mortgage holdings over the next 3 years, reimpose \nrestrictions on the size of the mortgages they can buy, and force them \nto pay State and local taxes just as private companies do.\n  As the Wall Street Journal editorialized Thursday:\n\n       If the housing giants are no longer subsidized, they will \n     become small enough to fail. That means they will stop \n     lending money to people who can't pay them back, and in turn, \n     they will stop endangering taxpayers. This is a genuine anti-\n     bailout vote.\n\n  They were referring to the McCain amendment.\n  Let's be clear. Every day Fannie and Freddie remain in their current \nform is a day U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing their activities. \nFinancial regulatory reform must include a restructuring of Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac. That is why I urge my colleagues to support the McCain \namendment tomorrow and end too big to fail.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Wall Street \nJournal editorial titled ``What About Fan and Fred Reform?'' by Robert \nG. Wilmers, to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                    What About Fan and Fred Reform?\n\n                         (By Robert G. Wilmers)\n\n       Congress may be making progress crafting new regulations \n     for the financial-services industry, but it has yet to begin \n     reforming two\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\n     institutions that played a key role in the 2008 credit \n     crisis--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n       We cannot reform these government-sponsored enterprises \n     unless we fully confront the extent to which their outrageous \n     behavior and reckless business practices have affected the \n     entire commercial banking sector and the U.S. economy as a \n     whole.\n       At the end of 2009, their total debt outstanding--either \n     held directly on their balance sheets or as guarantees on \n     mortgage securities they'd sold to investors--was $8.1 \n     trillion. That compares to $7.8 trillion in total marketable \n     debt outstanding for the entire U.S. government. The debt has \n     the implicit guarantee of the federal government but is not \n     reflected on the national balance sheet.\n       The public has focused more on taxpayer bailouts of banks, \n     auto makers and insurance companies. But the scale the rescue \n     required in September 2008 when Fannie and Freddie were \n     forced into conservatorship--their version of bankruptcy--was \n     staggering. To date, the federal government has been forced \n     to pump $126 billion into Fannie and Freddie. That's far more \n     than AIG, which absorbed $70 billion of government largess, \n     and General Motors and Chrysler, which shared $77 billion. \n     Banks received $205 billion, of which $136 billion has been \n     repaid.\n       Fannie and Freddie continue to operate deeply in the red, \n     with no end in sight. The Congressional Budget Office \n     estimated that if their operating costs and subsidies were \n     included in our accounting of the overall federal deficit--as \n     properly they should be--the 2009 deficit would be greater by \n     $291 billion.\n       Worst of all are the tracts of foreclosed homes left behind \n     by households lured into inappropriate mortgages by the lax \n     credit standards made possible by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n     and their promise to purchase and securitize millions of \n     subprime mortgages.\n       All this happened in the name of the ``American Dream'' of \n     home ownership. But there's no evidence Fannie and Freddie \n     helped much, if at all, to make this dream come true. Despite \n     all their initiatives since the early 1970s, shortly after \n     they were incorporated as private corporations protected by \n     government charters, the percentage of American households \n     owning homes has increased by merely four percentage points \n     to 67%.\n       In contrast, between 1991 and 2008, home ownership in Italy \n     and the Netherlands increased by 12 percentage points. It \n     increased by nine points in Portugal and Greece. At least 14 \n     other developed countries have home ownership rates higher \n     than in the U.S. They include Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, \n     Poland and Spain.\n       Canada doesn't have the equivalent of Fannie and Freddie. \n     Nor does it permit the deduction of mortgage interest from an \n     individual's taxes. Nevertheless, its home ownership rate is \n     68%. Canadian banks have weathered the financial crisis \n     particularly well and required no government bailouts.\n       This mediocre U.S. home ownership record developed despite \n     the fact that Fannie and Freddie were allowed to operate as a \n     tax-advantaged duopoly, supposedly to allow them to lower the \n     cost of mortgage finance. But a great deal of their taxpayer \n     subsidy did not actually help make housing less expensive for \n     home buyers.\n       According to a 2004 Congressional Budget Office study, the \n     two GSEs enjoyed $23 billion in subsidies 2003--primarily in \n     the form of lower borrowing costs and exemption from state \n     and local taxation. But they passed on only $13 billion to \n     home buyers. Nevertheless, one former Fannie Mae CEO, \n     Franklin Raines, received $91 million in compensation from \n     1998 through 2003. In 2006, the top five Fannie Mae \n     executives shared $34 million in compensation, while their \n     counterparts at Freddie Mac shared $35 million. In 2009, even \n     after the financial crash and as these two GSEs fell deeper \n     into the red, the top five executives at Fannie Mae received \n     $19 million in compensation, and the CEO earned $6 million.\n       This is not private enterprise--it's crony capitalism, in \n     which public subsidies are turned into private riches. From \n     2001 through 2006, Fannie and Freddie spent $123 million to \n     lobby Congress--the second-highest lobbying total (after the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce) in the country. That lobbying was \n     complemented by sizable direct political contributions to \n     members of Congress.\n       Changing this terrible situation will not be easy. The \n     mortgage market has come to be structured around Fannie and \n     Freddie and powerful interests are allied with the status \n     quo. I recall a personal conversation with a member of \n     Congress who, despite saying he understood my concerns about \n     the two GSEs, admitted he would never push for significant \n     change because ``they've done so much for me, my colleagues \n     and my staff.''\n       Nonetheless, Congress must get to work on the reform of \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A healthy housing market, a \n     healthy financial system and even the bond rating of the \n     federal government depend on it.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I stand today to discuss the McCain \namendment as well. We have had a lot of debate about the financial \nregulatory legislation before us. A lot of the debate has focused on \nthe content of the bill, with concerns being raised by some such as \nmyself about whether we truly are ending too big to fail and truly are \nending bailouts and whether we are going too far in creating yet again \na big government response to an issue that needs to have a more \neffective response rather than more government, a response that will \nhammer Main Street, not Wall Street, and create yet again another big \nexpansion of government in this Congress. We have seen way too much of \nthat in way too many parts of our economy so far, and some of us are \nconcerned about that.\n\n  But what I want to talk about today is what is noticeably absent in \nthe bill; that is, the reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, our \ngovernment-sponsored entities--actually, our government-managed \nentities now--and the fact that these entities are at the core of the \nfinancial crisis we are dealing with and yet are not even touched by \nthis legislation.\n  Americans remain rightly outraged that their tax dollars were used to \nbail out irresponsible Wall Street firms and auto companies. I have \nvoted against these bailouts, and I have been working with my \ncolleagues to make sure we do not set the stage for yet more government \nbailouts. The most expensive government bailouts of all, however, will \nbe those of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--the largest housing lenders \nthat purchased home loans, packaged them into investments, and then \nguaranteed them against default.\n  I think a little history of how we got to where we are is \nappropriate. Congress chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide \naccess to home financing by maintaining liquidity in the secondary \nmarket. According to Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise \nInstitute:\n\n       Their implicit, or assumed, government backing enabled them \n     to drive all competition out of the middle-class housing \n     sector, permitting Fannie and Freddie to acquire over $5 \n     trillion in mortgages, which they either held in portfolios \n     totaling approximately $1.5 trillion or securitized as \n     mortgage backed securities.\n\n  Continuing his quote:\n\n       In pursuing their mission to support low and middle-income \n     housing--also called affordable housing--Fannie and Freddie \n     assumed the credit risk on almost 11 million subprime and \n     other high-risk mortgages and contributed substantially to \n     the growth of a housing bubble. When the bubble began to \n     deflate in 2007, they began to suffer huge losses.\n\n  But I want to go back and talk a little bit about the history before \n2007, when it became evident to everyone what was happening to Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac in our housing markets, because it did not just \nbecome known then. As my colleague, Senator Sessions, has already \nmentioned on the floor today in his earlier remarks, the Banking \nCommittee was heavily engaged in reviewing this issue for several years \nleading up to this, as was the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \nOversight at HUD and the Fed and a number of other analysts.\n  Senator Sessions quoted a letter. I believe it was from then-Chairman \nGreenspan of the Fed, who noted we needed to put focus on Fannie and \nFreddie then--this was back in the 2004 to 2005 timeframe--and that if \nwe did not establish much tighter regulatory control over Fannie and \nFreddie, their excesses were going to create systemic risk that would \nput the taxpayer in extreme jeopardy.\n  The committee itself focused very heavily on this same dynamic. In \nMay of 2006, we had established legislation that would have, had it \nbeen able to be passed on the floor of this Senate, created a strong, \nnew regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and begun the process of \nsetting the right capital standards and the right regulatory \nenvironment in which we could control this excessive growth and set the \nprocess in place for us to take Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac into \nreceivership or into trust if they eventually failed, as it began \nlooking as if they would.\n  The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight completed a \nmultiyear special examination of Fannie Mae and\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\nissued a report describing OFHEO's findings and recommendations in May \nof 2006. OFHEO found the following:\n  Fannie Mae senior management promoted a false image of the enterprise \nas one of the lowest risk financial institutions in the world.\n  A large number of Fannie Mae's accounting policies and practices did \nnot comply with generally accepted accounting principles.\n  Fannie Mae had serious problems of internal control, financial \nreporting, and corporate governance, resulting in Fannie Mae \noverstating reported income and capital.\n  Between 1998 and 2004, Fannie Mae senior management deliberately and \nintentionally manipulated accounting to hit earnings targets so that \nsenior management maximized the bonuses and other executive \ncompensation they received.\n  Fannie Mae's board of directors failed to be sufficiently informed, \nto act independently of its chairman and other senior executives, and \nto exercise the requisite oversight over the enterprise's operations.\n  And then the final finding of the report: Despite rapid growth and \nchanging accounting and legal requirements, Fannie Mae senior \nmanagement did not make investments in accounting systems, computer \nsystems, other infrastructure and staffing needed to support a sound \ninternal control system, proper accounting, and GAAP-consistent \nfinancial reporting.\n  Again, as a result of these findings and of an increasing awareness \nof the threat that was being posed by the excesses at Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, the Banking Committee, on which I served then and still \nserve, developed legislation to address these very excesses and to \ncreate the kind of regulatory structure in which we could control these \nproblems.\n  Along with 26 of my colleagues, in May of 2006 I signed a letter to \nthen-majority leader Bill Frist and to the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee then, Senator Richard Shelby. In the letter, we stated:\n\n       We are concerned that if effective regulatory reform \n     legislation for the housing-finance government sponsored \n     entities is not enacted this year--\n\n  Remember, this is 2006--\n\n     American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the \n     enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the \n     housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy \n     as a whole. Therefore, we offer you our support in bringing \n     the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act (S. 190) \n     to the floor and allowing the Senate to debate the merits of \n     this bill, which was passed by the Senate Banking Committee.\n\n  I might note that when we debated this bill back in 2006, it came out \non a straight party-line vote from the Banking Committee--all the \nRepublicans voting for it, all the Democrats opposing it.\n  As history shows us, we never were able to get that bill to the floor \nbecause although we had 55 Republican votes, it takes 60 votes to move \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate in the face of filibusters, and \nthat bill was filibustered. We were not able to get the additional \nsupport to get it past the filibuster.\n  I would like to quote from a recently written editorial about this \nchapter of the Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac history. Peter Wallison, in an \nApril 20, 2010, editorial in the Wall Street Journal, wrote:\n\n       One chapter in this story took place in July 2005, when the \n     Senate Banking Committee, then controlled by the Republicans, \n     adopted tough regulatory legislation for the GSEs on a party-\n     line vote. . . . The bill would have established a new \n     regulator for Fannie and Freddie and given it authority to \n     ensure that they maintained adequate capital, properly \n     managed their interest rate risk, had adequate liquidity and \n     reserves, and controlled their asset and investment portfolio \n     growth.\n       These authorities were necessary to control the GSEs' risk-\n     taking, but opposition by Fannie and Freddie--then the most \n     politically powerful firms in the country--had consistently \n     prevented reform.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The date of the Senate Banking Committee's action is \n     important. It was in 2005 that the GSEs--which had been \n     acquiring increasing numbers of subprime and Alt-A loans for \n     many years in order to meet their HUD-imposed affordable \n     housing requirements--accelerated the purchases that led to \n     their 2008 insolvency. If legislation--\n\n  And this is the key part of the editorial--\n\n     along the lines of the Senate committee's bill had been \n     enacted in that year, many if not all the losses that Fannie \n     and Freddie have suffered, and will suffer in the future, \n     might have been avoided.\n\n  What happened was the bill was stalled. Fannie and Freddie collapsed. \nWhen it became evident the losses were going to occur, there was a rush \non the floor of the Senate to get back to that bill, and in 2008 the \nbill passed--after the horse was out of the barn. At least, though, we \ndid get it passed in 2008, and Fannie and Freddie were taken into \nconservatorship.\n  Where are we now? The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nin the wake of the housing bubble and the unprecedented deflation in \nhousing values that resulted, the government's cost to bail out Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac will eventually reach $381 billion. As we talk on \nthis floor about bailouts, this is the biggest bailout of all. It \nexceeds, in fact, all of the other bailouts together, by far. Yet it is \nunlimited. I mean that literally.\n  Last Christmas Eve, in what was considered by many to be a Christmas \nEve taxpayer massacre, the Treasury Department announced it was lifting \nthe $400 billion loss cap on these two companies, creating a \npotentially unlimited liability and effectively providing the full \nfaith and credit of the government to support their debt.\n  To date, the Federal Government has already provided about $126 \nbillion to $130 billion to Fannie and Freddie. As I just indicated, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that will ultimately top $380 \nbillion, and many believe that is a conservative number--direct \ntaxpayer bailouts that are not even mentioned in this bill.\n  It reminds me of the fight back in 2005 when we were trying to get \nthe legislation to reform Fannie and Freddie passed then, and here we \nare knowing what we need to do--seeing these bailouts, knowing the \nAmerican taxpayers want those bailouts to stop--and we are being \nresisted in trying to bring an amendment just to add Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac--GSE--reform to the bill.\n  Last week, Freddie Mac announced it had lost $8 billion, as others on \nthe floor have just said, in the first quarter and has requested \nanother $10.6 billion to add to this mounting bailout.\n  As the government has pledged more and more money to cover these \ncompanies' losses, it has assured the public that planning is underway \nfor overhauling these firms so that the bailouts will end. In December, \nthe administration said it expected to release a preliminary report on \nhow to remake Fannie and Freddie around February 1. But February 1 has \ncome and gone, and no plan has been provided, and now we are being told \nit will be another year before the government proposes how to \nrestructure these firms. Eighteen months after they were seized to \nprevent their collapse, the companies remain wards of the state in what \nhas become the single costliest component of bailouts in our financial \nsystem.\n  In September of 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac into that conservatorship I talked about, \nwhich allows the regulator to establish control and oversight of a \ncompany to put it in a sound and solvent condition. Since being placed \nin conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have actually become a \nbigger part of the market, which will make reform of them even more \ndifficult. Last quarter, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were responsible \nfor funding two-thirds of all U.S. home loans. That is primarily \nbecause there is nobody else able to play in the markets these days, \nexcept for these government--now completely government--controlled and \nfinanced entities. When you add in the Federal Housing Administration, \nthe U.S. Government is behind 96.5 percent of all loans.\n  What we have seen here is literally another government takeover. We \nhave seen the government take over in the health care industry. We have \nseen the government take over in the auto industry. We have seen the \ngovernment takeover of AIG and the insurance industry. We have seen the \ngovernment take over in multiple parts of our financial industries and \na greater government takeover being proposed in this bill. Yet we have \nthe literal government control and management of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac going unabated and unaddressed in the legislation that is before \nus.\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\n  What does the legislation do?\n  The longer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are allowed to operate in their \ncurrent role--as political rather than business entities--the greater \nthe financial losses will be for taxpayers and, frankly, the greater \nthe risk they will simply continue endlessly in government control and \ngovernment management, with the government managing yet one other big \npart of our economy perpetually.\n  That is why the McCain amendment requires the current conservatorship \nof the companies to end in the next 2\\1/2\\ years and begin the process \nof shrinking their portfolios. If the companies are not viable at the \nend of that period, they would be placed into receivership, which is a \nform of bankruptcy restriction.\n  Without a hard deadline, I am very concerned Congress will not act \nand, just like back in 2005, we will find gridlock here in the Senate \nstopping us from moving forward and be left with a nationalized Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac.\n  The amendment would also reestablish the $200 billion cap and \naccelerate the 10-percent reductions of the mortgage portfolios, \neffectively requiring the companies to shrink those portfolios by \nholding a combined $100 billion from their current levels. This will \nalso limit the losses taxpayers will face as a result of the blank \ncheck given by the administration in lifting all caps on December 24 of \nlast year.\n  It also includes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a part of the Federal \nbudget as long as either institution is under conservatorship or \nreceivership. This is going to show the American people the true \npicture of how much of our national debt has increased by the bailout \nof these institutions.\n  As an aside here, as most people probably did not realize, the Senate \nBudget Committee recently acted on a proposed budget for the Congress \nthis year. We were supposed to have declared and created a budget for \nus to operate under months ago, but because of, I think, an \nunwillingness to literally put it out there--how much money this \ngovernment is spending--the committee and the Senate have not acted on \na budget yet. But the Budget Committee actually did finally act on one. \nI didn't vote for it. It is more spending--trying to spend ourselves \ninto prosperity again as the last budget was--but at least we acted.\n  In that Budget Committee process, I brought forth an amendment to \nrequire that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt be added to our national \ndebt calculations. Why would I do that? According to the Congressional \nBudget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf:\n\n       After the U.S. Government assumed control in 2008 of Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac, two Federally-chartered institutions \n     that provided credit guarantees for almost half--\n\n  and by the way, as I indicated, now it is two-thirds--\n\n     of all the outstanding residential mortgages in the United \n     States, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the \n     institutions had effectively become government entities whose \n     operations should be included in the Federal budget.\n\n  So here we have the Director of the Congressional Budget Office \nsaying we run these companies, we are financially backing these \ncompanies, we should at least include them in our budget.\n  The purpose of my amendment then--and the same language that is in \nthis amendment on the floor today--is to include in the debt \ncalculations of the budget resolution the debt obligations of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. This allows the American people to see a true \npicture of how much our national debt has been increased by the bailout \nof these institutions. At the end of calendar year 2009, per the \nfinancial statements, those figures are $774 billion for Fannie Mae and \n$781 billion for Freddie Mac, for a total of $1.555 trillion of debt. \nThat is debt the United States holds today that is not being disclosed \nto the American public as part of our debt because of our interesting \nbudget procedures.\n  To put into perspective how large these entities are, their combined \ntotal books of business are nearly $5.5 trillion. The Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated that in the wake of the housing bubble and \nthe unprecedented deflation in housing values that resulted, the \ngovernment's cost to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as I \nindicated earlier, will eventually reach $381 billion, and that \nestimate may be too optimistic.\n  I also already mentioned that last Christmas Eve the Treasury lifted \nthe cap. We actually had a cap so that the taxpayer was at least \nprotected at $400 billion. Last Christmas Eve--and I told my colleagues \nearlier some called it the ``Christmas Eve Taxpayer Massacre''--\nTreasury lifted that cap so there now is no limit to the amount of debt \nwe will assume and pay for as taxpayers as a result of this bailout of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to a January 2010 CBO background \npaper entitled ``CBO's Budgetary Treatment of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac,'' CBO:\n\n     believes that the Federal Government's current financial and \n     operational relationship with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n     warrants their inclusion in the budget.\n\n  By contrast, the administration has taken a different approach by \ncontinuing to treat Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as outside the Federal \nbudget, recording and projecting outlays equal to amounts of any cash \ninfusions made by Treasury into the entities.\n  The Office of Management and Budget of the U.S. Government fiscal \nyear 2011 states:\n\n       Under the approach in the budget--\n\n  This is the President's budget--\n\n     all of the GSEs' transactions with the public are \n     nonbudgetary because the GSEs are not considered to be \n     government agencies.\n\n  So we have the administration saying they are not considered to be \ngovernment agencies, and, therefore, we aren't going to consider their \ndebt and their financing, and we have the Congressional Budget Office \nsaying they should be. CBO has included the GSEs in its budget \nbaseline, but does not include the debt in its calculations because of \ntheir narrow view of how to calculate the Federal debt.\n  In light of all these facts, I think it is evident that we need to \nhave transparency and we need to start telling the American people \nexactly what it means, that we have taken Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \ninto receivership, and that we are not going to put their finances in \nthe Federal budget.\n  Going back to what the amendment we are debating here today does, in \naddition to putting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the budget, it \nestablishes a Senate-confirmed special inspector general within the \nGovernment Accountability Office with responsibility for investigating \nand reporting to Congress on decisions made with respect to the \nconservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and this special \ninspector general would provide quarterly reports to Congress. There is \nno one politically accountable to the public for the operation of these \nmultitrillion-dollar entities since the President has yet to nominate \nanyone to officially run the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the \nOffice of Special Inspector General. The office of the Special \nInspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program has done a good \njob to inform the public and Congress about TARP, and we should follow \nthis model with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It is not credible to say \nwe are protecting the taxpayer and fixing mortgage financing and do \nnothing about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  Let me conclude by reading from a couple of editorials. If you scan \nthe news today about this issue, you will see editorials across this \ncountry. I think one of them said ``the silence on this issue is \ndeafening.'' Others have said there is a huge hole in the legislation. \nThe title of another one: ``Congress Remains Missing In Action on Two \nKey Causes of the Financial Crisis.''\n  I wish to read from one of the Wall Street Journal editorials on May \n6 of this year. In part it says:\n\n       One sign that the White House financial reform is less \n     potent than its advertising claims is that it doesn't even \n     attempt to reform the two companies at the heart of the \n     housing mania and panic--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So we \n     are glad to see that yesterday GOP Senators John McCain, \n     Richard Shelby, and Judd Gregg introduced a Fannie and \n     Freddie reform amendment.\n\n  Going on, it says:\n\n       The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission spent yesterday \n     focusing on financial leverage using Bear Stearns as an \n     example. But Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were twice as \n     leveraged as Bear and much larger as a share of the mortgage \n     market. Fan and Fred owned or guaranteed $5 trillion in \n     mortgages and mortgage-backed securities when they collapsed \n     in September of 2008.\n\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\n\n  This is a quote that has been read on the floor before, but it is \nexactly applicable.\n  Again, quoting the editorial:\n\n       Reforming the financial system without fixing Fannie and \n     Freddie is like declaring war on terror and ignoring the al-\n     Qaida. Unreformed, they are sure to kill the taxpayers again. \n     Only yesterday--\n\nthis was on May 6--\n\n     Freddie said it had lost $8 billion in the first quarter--\n\nwhich I have already mentioned.\n  Going on to another editorial, this one also in the Wall Street \nJournal by Robert Wilmers--and I quote just a part of it:\n\n       At the end of 2009, their total debt outstanding--either \n     held directly by their balance sheets or as guarantees on \n     mortgage securities they'd sold to investors--was $8.1 \n     trillion. That compares to $7.8 trillion in total marketable \n     debt outstanding for the entire U.S. Government. The debt has \n     the implicit guarantee of the federal government but is not \n     reflected on the national balance sheet.\n       The public has focused more on taxpayer bailouts of banks, \n     auto makers and insurance companies. But the scale of the \n     rescue required in September 2008 when Fannie and Freddie \n     were forced into conservatorship--their version of \n     bankruptcy--was staggering. To date, the federal government \n     has been forced to pump $126 billion into Fannie and Freddie. \n     That's far more than AIG, which absorbed $70 billion of \n     government largess, and General Motors and Chrysler, which \n     shared $77 billion. Banks received $205 billion, of which \n     $136 billion has been repaid.\n       Fannie and Freddie continue to operate in the red, with no \n     end in sight. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that \n     if their operating costs and subsidies were included in our \n     accounting of the overall deficit--as properly they should \n     be--the 2009 deficit would be greater by $291 billion.\n\n  The point is simple. This bill is alleged to be focused on trying to \nsolve the problem of bailouts. We will hear Senators on this floor say \nday in and day out that this bill will end bailouts and stop too big to \nfail. Yet the two largest enterprises which were at the core of the \nfinancial crisis are exempt from the provisions of the legislation. \nThey are not even mentioned in the legislation. Apparently, they are \ntoo big to fail, because we in this Senate will not put them into a \ntrack of being resolved properly.\n  As I indicated earlier, I am concerned that the same outcome is going \nto happen now that happened back in 2005 and 2006 when we tried before \ntheir collapse to put some restraint into place, and that we will not \nact, the net result of which will be that we will, in effect, \nnationalize Fannie and Freddie and have a huge portion of our Nation's \nmortgage market be run by the government.\n  The McCain amendment will simply give us a track to move forward to \nstop that result from happening, and I encourage all of my colleagues \nto consider strongly supporting this amendment. If we don't, then I \ndon't think we can honestly call this a bill that truly ends the \nbailouts in our country.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak again on the problem of \ncredit rating agencies and the inherent conflicts of interest that \ndrive the industry. The underlying Wall Street reform bill takes some \nsteps in the right direction, but I believe we can go much further in \naddressing the fundamental problem--the opportunity to shop around for \nthe highest rating.\n  Currently, a bank that issues a security can shop its product around \nto one of the three biggest credit rating agencies--all three of them--\nseeking out the highest possible rating. The credit rating agency \npromising the highest rating will get hired. This process ensures that \nthe credit rating agency will not just be evaluating the risk of the \nfinancial product, it will be weighing its own business interests when \noffering up a rating. If the agency hands out a AAA rating, the \ncustomer will come back again; the banks will come back again. That \nincentive affects the ultimate rating the product receives. This \nratings shopping leads to major conflicts of interest, and it was one \nof the major causes of the financial meltdown.\n  You have probably heard of something in our court system called forum \nshopping. It is when an attorney seeks out the judge who will be most \nsympathetic to the case. If a prosecutor is bringing a case against a \ndefendant for drunk driving, that prosecutor might negotiate with the \ncourt clerk to get the judge known for being tough on drunk drivers. \nYou can imagine the problems forum shopping has created and the \ncorruption it has bred.\n  The courts have identified forum shopping as a practice that \nmanipulates outcomes and undermines public confidence in the courts. \nGiven these problems, the courts have sought out ways to reduce forum \nshopping. In fact, the majority of Federal courts now use some \nvariation of a random drawing to match cases with judges, though each \ndistrict court has discretion to make its own specific rules. \nAccommodations can be made for particular circumstances. For example, a \nsubset of qualified judges can be set aside for particularly complex \ncriminal cases, and the caseload of each judge can be taken into \naccount. But overall, the primary selection method in most Federal \ncourts is a rotating assignment system.\n  This rotating assignment system is used in my home State of \nMinnesota. New York, the home State of Senator Schumer, who is joining \nme on this amendment, also uses a rotating system. The use of a \nrotating assignment system limits opportunities for forum shopping, \nincreases public confidence in the court system, and reduces \ncorruption.\n  Let's return to the problem of credit rating agencies. I have filed \nan amendment that seeks to reduce the conflicts of interest inherent in \nthe issuer-pays model. In this model, issuers of financial products \nhave incentives to shop around for the best ratings possible. In order \nto retain business, credit rating agencies will issue ratings high \nenough to keep issuers coming back, as I said. The system incentivizes \nhigh ratings, not accurate ratings.\n  The same solution used to address forum shopping in the courts can \nalso be applied to reduce ratings shopping in the credit rating \nindustries. My amendment allows for the same types of discretion \nawarded to individual district courts.\n  A court can develop special provisions for the assignment of \nparticularly complex cases. My amendment would allow a new credit \nrating agency board to designate certain ratings agencies as being \nqualified to rate the most complex products. A court can take into \naccount the existing caseload of a particular judge. My amendment \nallows the board to take into account the institutional and technical \ncapacity of credit raters.\n  The rotating assignment model used in the court system can be used in \nthe rating system. It hasn't eliminated every problem, but it has gone \na long way to reduce the corruption and conflicts of interest in \nselecting judges for particular cases.\n  My amendment will not eliminate every problem facing the credit \nrating agency industry, but it will go a long way toward reducing \nratings shopping. Ratings shopping is the root of the problem, and it \nis what allows issuers to bargain with credit raters. If a credit ratee \nknows the issuer cannot simply walk away and turn to another rating \nagency, there is no pressure to issue a high rating just to retain the \nbusiness transaction.\n  My amendment will not reduce competition, nor does it seek to put any \nrating agency out of business--quite the opposite. My amendment \nactually will increase and incentivize true competition. By allowing a \nboard to assign more work to credit raters producing accurate ratings \nand assign less work to those producing inaccurate ratings, the market \nwill finally reward accuracy and no longer reward ratings inflation, \nwhich was the case during this whole fiasco and what led to it. It is \nonly by limiting ratings shopping and adjusting the market's incentives \nthat we will finally have credit rating agencies in which the public \ncan have faith.\n  The Wall Street reform bill includes many important provisions \naddressing the credit rating agency problem, such as increased \ndisclosures and improved postrating surveillance, but I believe it \ndoesn't get to the root of the problem. When the stability of such a \nsignificant\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\npart of our economy is based, for better or worse, on the accuracy of \nthese ratings, we can't take any more chances.\n  I thank Senator Schumer and Senator Nelson for helping me lead this \nreform and Senator Wicker, who has recently joined our effort. I also \nappreciate that Senators Johnson, Whitehouse, Brown, Murray, Merkley, \nBingaman, Lautenberg, Shaheen, Casey, and Sanders support this approach \nand have joined as cosponsors. I look forward to other colleagues \njoining us, and, ultimately, I hope this bipartisan amendment will be \ntaken up and passed by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed for a few moments \non my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                        Treatment of Terrorists\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we continue to learn more about the \nterrorist who attempted to kill scores of innocent Americans in Times \nSquare earlier this month.\n  The President's assistant for counterterrorism, John Brennan, now \nsays Faisal Shahzad was working on behalf of the Pakistan Taliban, or \nTTP, all along.\n  What this event and the aftermath have shown is that the \nadministration has what can most charitably be described as an evolving \nstrategy on dealing with captured terrorists.\n  This was perfectly clear over the weekend when Attorney General \nHolder said in reference to the Times Square bomber that America is \n``now dealing with international terrorists,'' and this may require \nchanges to when and how terrorists are issued Miranda warnings.\n  Now dealing with international terrorists? I remind the Attorney \nGeneral that we have been very much at war with international terrorism \nfor a long time and that we face threats in this war from those who \nattacked us on 9/11, al-Qaida's associated groups, those who attack our \ntroops every day in Afghanistan and Iraq, the man who tried to blow up \na plane over Detroit on Christmas, and men such as the one who plotted \nto maim and kill Americans in Times Square.\n  Once the administration realizes this, a lot of other questions will \nbecome a lot clearer. Unfortunately, the administration seems too often \nto have a trial-and-error approach.\n  On Guantanamo, they tried to close it and realized it was not that \neasy. On the question of the proper venue for trials, they announced \nthey would try 9/11 mastermind Khaleid Sheikh Mohammed in New York City \nand then realized maybe that was not a good idea. When it came to the \nChristmas Day bomber, they treated him like a common criminal and then \nrealized that might not have been the best route either.\n  Now, after learning the Times Square bomber is actually a tool of the \nPakistani Taliban, they are wondering out loud again if they should \nrevisit their approach to administering Miranda warnings.\n  Let's make it easy for the Attorney General. Every terrorist--every \nsingle one of them--every terrorist should be treated like one.\n  In the first months of the administration, the President signed \nExecutive orders ending the CIA's interrogation program, demanding the \nclosure of Guantanamo within a year, and essentially putting the \nAttorney General in charge of the war on terror.\n  More than a year after these Executive orders were signed and after \nseveral failed terrorist attacks on the homeland, the administration \nfinally--finally--seems to realize the war on terror is not a simple \nmatter of law enforcement. A clear and forceful strategy is needed just \nas much at home as it is needed abroad.\n  Republicans have been saying this all along. It is time the \nadministration decides on a strategy that recognizes the implications \nof the war we are in and the dangers we face, not only abroad but right \nat home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes, if I may. I \nlistened with some interest this afternoon, as I did last week, to my \ncolleague and friend from Arizona talk about his amendment regarding \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, specifically Fannie and Freddie. I \nwish to respond to some of those comments and some comments today about \nthese two agencies and their value, their present condition, and what \nneeds to be done.\n  First, there is a little revisionist history in all of this that \nseems to be important. In 2005, the House Financial Services Committee, \nunder the leadership of Mike Oxley, a Republican from Ohio, chairman of \nthe committee, passed bipartisan legislation dealing with Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac. Senate Democrats picked up that proposal. It stalled \nin the committee over here despite support for it. The Republican-\ncontrolled committee then passed a bill. They never filed it, never \nbrought it up for a vote on the floor of the Senate in 2005.\n  I became chairman of the Banking Committee in 2007. As the Presiding \nOfficer will recall, when he arrived in 2008, we had a significant \nnumber of hearings and discussions about Fannie and Freddie. In the \nsummer of 2008, the Banking Committee passed a comprehensive overhaul \nof the regulations of Fannie and Freddie, including establishment of a \ntough new regulator, the FHFA, limited portfolio holdings of Fannie and \nFreddie, and we increased their capital requirements. The authority to \nput Fannie and Freddie into receivership was also adopted. We required \ninternal controls and risk management and reviving and approving new \nproducts.\n  The committee voted 19 to 2 on a very strong bipartisan basis in the \nsummer of 2008, and overwhelmingly on the floor, this body supported \nthose efforts by a vote of 72 to 13. That was in the summer and fall of \n2008.\n  When I hear the comments being made that nothing has been done about \nFannie and Freddie--Mike Oxley tried and failed. I cannot repeat on the \nfloor of the Chamber the words Mike Oxley used to describe the \nminority's handling of reform when he was accused later of not having \nan effective reform package. The Republican chairman of that committee \nhad very strong language to describe the failure of our Republican \nfriends to pick up his efforts, his bipartisan efforts, in 2005. As I \nsay, in 2008, by a vote of 72 to 13, this body adopted the committee's \nrecommendations--adopted 19 to 2 in the Banking Committee--to put \nstrong regulations over Fannie and Freddie. So that is as a backdrop.\n\n  I will be the first to recognize that more needs to be done, clearly, \nin terms of coming up with a whole new financing structure for the \nhousing market. There is no doubt about that. But as my colleague from \nNew Hampshire has pointed out--and while it wasn't part of the whole \nreform package included in this 1,400-page bill because it probably \nwould have doubled the size of this legislation--the issue is far too \ncomplex at this juncture to include those kinds of reforms in this \nbill. That is not to suggest they do not need to be done, but it will \ntake a separate undertaking, it seems to me and most who have looked at \nit, to decide what is that alternative idea.\n  So when we have the McCain amendment, as in the Ensign amendment the \nother night, I would urge my colleagues to vote against it. All their \namendments do is to get rid of Fannie and Freddie. There is no \nalternative idea here. The McCain amendment says that in 24 months you \nhave to get rid of Fannie and Freddie. Well, that is a nice idea, but \nwhat are the implications if we get rid of it?\n  Today, 97 percent of all mortgages are backed by Fannie and Freddie. \nIf you want to see interest rates go up, if you get rid of the only \nentity that is purchasing these mortgages today--and that is Fannie and \nFreddie, by and large--who will purchase them? If they are not \npurchased, what happens to interest rates and home values? If you think \nthe market took a plunge last Thursday, adopt the McCain amendment. It \nis a reckless amendment. There is no alternative whatsoever included in \nthat proposal.\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\n  Let me identify the three major problems with it, aside from the fact \nit doesn't offer any alternative whatsoever as to how we end up with a \nfinancing mechanism for housing in this country. Remember, we are the \nonly Nation on the face of the planet today that provides a 30-year, \nfixed-rate mortgage for homeowners. It is the reason why we have had a \nrelatively high percentage of our population in home ownership. It also \nis the single largest wealth creator for most families--home \nownership--not to mention the value it is to a family, a neighborhood, \na community.\n  When people have an equity interest--when they can accrue equity over \ntime--it leads to long-term financial security, retirement security, \nand it has made a difference in how middle-income families have been \nable to afford a higher education for their children. All these \nbenefits accrue. No other Nation on Earth provides that kind of \nstability and long-term security that we have in the housing market, \nand it doesn't happen miraculously. It happens because we have had a \nfinancing mechanism that has provided for that kind of assurance at a \nrelatively low cost.\n  So when you look at the amendment, it severs all Federal involvement \nwith these mortgage securitization, government-sponsored enterprises \nwithin 24 months. That is the McCain amendment. Before people jump on \nboard with what a great idea this is, consider the implications and \nthen be prepared to explain them when they happen. There is no reform \nhere. It just gets rids of something without replacing it with \nanything, except somehow the private market is going to pick up. There \nis no private market for that today, and we need an alternative idea. \nSome have mentioned a public utility concept, others have mentioned \nvarious other ideas, all of which we have listened to. But, frankly, \nthere is a lot of debate about what that alternative ought to be.\n  So to draft a bill to take in all these other ideas for housing, \nfrankly, as the Senator from New Hampshire has said, was far too \ncomplex, given all the other challenges we are faced with in this \nlegislation, to try to deal with too big to fail, consumer protection, \nfinally getting some clarity and regulation over exotic instruments, \nproviding some long-term radar system, as we describe it, to identify \nproblems as they emerge, whether in Greece or someplace else, not to \nmention all the other provisions, dealing with underwriting standards, \ncapital requirements, leverage, and all the rest. This bill is 1,400 \npages, not to mention the bill passed out of the Agriculture Committee, \nwhich adds, of course, a whole other title VII to the bill.\n  So when you consider what is in here, I hope my colleagues will be \ncareful before they jump on what is a politically charged issue and \nunderstand what the implications may be if it is adopted. The McCain \namendment, as I said, is reckless, it is poorly thought out, it poses \nsignificant risk to the housing markets that have only recently begun \nto stabilize, by the way. We are seeing just in the last few weeks that \nfinally prices are beginning to move up in the housing area, new \nstakeholders are occurring, and things are beginning to move in the \nright direction.\n  You can say a lot of things, but if you don't have stability in the \nhousing market, this recovery will not occur. It is a critical \ncomponent of recovery and to pull the rug out from underneath this \nparticular effort right now would be a major blow to our economy and I \nthink would set us back on our heels at the worst possible moment. As I \nsaid earlier, major reforms to the housing financing system are clearly \nnecessary. I will be the first to acknowledge that--all should. As we \ncan't go back to the system of the past and the status quo of the GSEs \nunder Federal conservatorship--by the way, Fannie and Freddie are under \nconservatorship because of our 2008 legislation--it is untenable. We \ncan't continue with that, and we need to replace it, but such changes \nmust be thoughtful and deliberate.\n  In the near term, we must ensure that changes affecting the Federal \nrole in Fannie and Freddie do not jeopardize the fragile economic \nrecovery. Over the long term, we must be careful in structuring the \nhousing financing system in a way that guarantees continued mortgage \nliquidity with minimum economic disruptions.\n  The McCain amendment falls short in several respects. First of all, \nit imposes significant risk to our economic recovery. Some 95 to 97 \npercent of mortgage originations are currently backed by the Federal \nGovernment--95 to 97 percent, the vast majority of this coming through \nFannie and Freddie. The McCain amendment would cause significant \nuncertainty among investors and GSE-issued mortgage-backed securities, \nthreatening the primary source of mortgage credit that we have at this \ntime. Pull away the credit we have, what replaces it? In this \namendment, nothing, without offering any alternative sources of \nliquidity. Such a precipitous drop in mortgage liquidity could severely \nthreaten this fragile recovery we are presently feeling.\n  Second, the McCain amendment fails to ensure sufficient mortgage \ncredit would be available in the future. Private securitization of the \nGSEs account for, as I said, some $9 trillion of the $14 trillion in \ntotal outstanding mortgages in the United States today. With the future \nof private securitization highly uncertain--in fact, that is a mild \nstatement given the present economic circumstances--policymakers \nseeking to reform the housing financing system must ensure that the \nsystem of the future will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the \nmortgage needs of all Americans. The McCain amendment would eliminate \nexisting sources of mortgage liquidity while remaining silent on the \nmore difficult question of how to replace them.\n  So you may not like what you have here, but you are replacing it with \nnothing. What are the alternatives to go to in the housing market?\n  Thirdly, the McCain amendment neglects to replace the public purposes \nserved by GSEs. The GSEs were poorly run, but they clearly served a \nnumber of public purposes, such as making the 30-year fixed-rate \nmortgage broadly available for American home buyers. This does not go \nto the question of the underwriting standards. That was a disaster with \nunregulated brokers and mortgage companies. But putting aside that \nquestion, which we address--and there are other ideas on how to further \naddress the underwriting requirements--there is the idea that the \naverage family in this country could purchase and have a chance to get \nin that starter home, to put them on the pathway to home ownership and \nall that means to families--what it has meant to our country to make \nthat available, not just to the affluent and the well-heeled but to \nfamilies even at the lower end of the economic spectrum--to have that \nkind of job that could provide that income to support a mortgage; what \nit means to be able to say to your family: We own our home. This is \nwhere we live. We have a vested interest in our community, in our \nneighborhood.\n\n  You can talk to anyone about social policy and home equity interest \nin a neighborhood, and it changes a neighborhood. It makes a \ndifference. So when you start stripping away, pulling out the rug from \nunderneath the financing scheme for doing this today, the mechanism for \ndoing it, then you undermine the very ability to have that long-term, \nstable mortgage that a family can count on. Watching their equity grow, \nunder normal circumstances, makes such a difference. It is why this \neconomic disaster we have been through over the last couple years is so \nharmful.\n  I said earlier there are 4 million homes today that are underwater--4 \nmillion of them underwater--and 250,000 homes in the first 3 months of \nthis year have been seized because of the economic conditions. So \nhousing is critical. It is where this crisis began because of the \nshoddy underwriting requirements that are out there and luring people \ninto subprime mortgages. By the way, that is the alternative. When you \nstrip away the financing mechanism, what you are left with is subprime \nlending. That is what goes on, luring people into those circumstances.\n  So, Mr. President, you are entitled to your own opinion but not your \nown facts in this debate. The fact is, there was an effort in 2005, led \nby a Republican chairman in the housing committee in the House, and he \nhas some very choice words for those who suggest that effort wasn't \nreal to make a change here. I regret deeply that Mr.\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\nOxley didn't prevail in his ideas here in the Senate. He passed it in \nthe House, but it was squashed over here.\n  Then, in 2008, as I said, by votes of 19 to 2 and 72 to 13 on the \nfloor of this Chamber, we did pass legislation that provided for a \ncomprehensive overhaul of the regulation of Fannie and Freddie. It made \na substantial change, but far more needs to be done. I acknowledge \nthat, clearly. But let's not, in the face of that acknowledgment, strip \naway that ability in this bill, within 24 months, without replacing it \nwith anything, putting our economic recovery at great risk. I predict \nto you, as certain as I am standing here, if the McCain amendment were \nto pass, that is the outcome, count on it, in my view.\n  So I caution my colleagues, despite the political mantra associated \nwith all this, we are in a very delicate time. It is very important \nthat we use our heads and carefully deliberate on how we are moving. By \na vote of 59 to 35, we rejected the Ensign amendment last week. It was \nthe right outcome. If we reverse that vote tomorrow or in the next \nday--whenever the McCain amendment comes up--and we will have a side-\nby-side amendment, by the way, to explain what the committee is doing \nfurther and what needs to be done to get us on the right track so \npeople can be supportive of some alternative ideas here--then I think \nwe will set ourselves back.\n  In light of what has happened in Europe over the weekend, still may \nunfold here, right now we don't need to be sending messages to the \nmarkets without any alternative ideas in place as to how to come up \nwith a housing finance system that is as worthy of the very people who \ncounted on that ability to have that fixed-rate mortgage, to watch \ntheir family prosper and grow and become stable, as this has over the \nyears.\n  I know others want to be heard on probably other matters, but this is \na very important issue, and my hope is my colleagues will pay careful \nattention to this and not succumb to the temporary temptation to follow \nbecause there are some groups out there that have never liked this \nanyway. They have never liked the idea of this program. Clearly, as I \nsay, reforms are needed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am honored to rise to address the \nVolcker amendment, which I am pleased to be able to cosponsor with my \ncolleague and friend who is now presiding over the Senate. I thank \nSenator Levin for the outstanding job he has done in shining the light \non the need for financial reform through his Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Dodd for shepherding this important \nfinancial reform and bringing such a significant and solid bill to the \nfloor of the Senate, and I thank him for working with several of us to \nstrengthen the approach proposed in the Volcker amendment. I look \nforward to having a chance to present that on the floor and appreciate \nvery much Senator Dodd's support.\n  The goal of our financial system is to efficiently aggregate and \nallocate capital. That is sometimes done through banks that make loans, \nand that is sometimes done through pools of investors who put their \nmoney together and ask managers to find the highest return. But these \ntwo functions of lending and high-risk investing, although both \ncritical to the capital system of aggregating and allocating our \ndollars, are in fact very different. This Volcker amendment is all \nabout creating the right balance between these two so they work \ncollectively to make a more efficient, stronger financial system rather \nthan working at odds with each other.\n\n  This bill has three components. The first is to get high-risk trading \nout of our banks on which families and small businesses depend. The \nsecond is to establish higher capital requirements for high-risk \ninvesting or hedge funds. The third is to eliminate conflicts of \ninterest, conflicts of interest that have proceeded to undermine the \nintegrity of our securities system.\n  I want to try to give kind of an analogy so we can all get our hands \naround these functions; that is, to try to imagine you are collecting \nfireworks. Fireworks are a wonderful thing, and you might want to have \nthem for the Fourth of July or for New Year's. But you do not store \nthem in your living room because, if they were to accidentally go off, \nyou would burn down your house. The fireworks in this example is your \nhigh-risk investing, and your living room represents the lending \ndepository banks that power up our economy by making their loans in our \ncommunities to our businesses and our families.\n  To continue that analogy, you would want those fireworks stored not \nonly not in your living room but not in any of the bedrooms of your \nhouse or any of the other rooms. You would want them stored out in your \nshed, in this case outside the bank holding company, so if the high-\nrisk investments do explode or go down you don't burn down your house. \nThis leads to the second part of the Volcker amendment which says, \nwhile you are storing them in your shed, you should make it more fire \nresistant. Maybe that means putting in a sprinkler system or some other \nsystem. That is the second part. But the third part is to say those who \ndesign and sell the fireworks should not simultaneously be developing \nand designing fuses designed to fail and then taking bets that the \nfireworks would go off prematurely. This is a conflict-of-interest \nissue on which recent hearings have shined such a bright light.\n  Turning, then, to this high-risk trading and the challenges it \npresented to our financial system, what I am putting up right now is a \nchart that shows the impact of high-risk trading on the meltdown that \noccurred in 2008 and 2009. We have Lehman Brothers that lost $30 \nbillion in trading; Merrill Lynch lost $20 billion in trading; Morgan \nStanley over $10 billion; JPMorgan Chase over $10 billion, Goldman \nSachs over $4 billion, and Bank of America over $7 billion. High-risk \ntrading primarily on mortgage securities and derivatives of those \nsecurities blew a hole through almost every major Wall Street financial \ninvestment institution.\n  I do not think anyone should, in light of these facts, be able to say \nthat high-risk investing has nothing to do with the current crisis. It \nhas pretty much everything to do with it, and that is why the \nGovernment stepped in to provide financial relief to these firms--huge \namounts of money. Lehman Brothers went down because we didn't step in \nto assist them. Merrill Lynch basically was saved by being purchased by \nBank of America which had a tremendous bailout; that is, $45 billion. \nMorgan Stanley got $10 billion in TARP funds; JPMorgan Chase, $25 \nbillion; Goldman Sachs, $10 billion; and, of course, the list goes on.\n  This high-risk investing does not belong in our lending depository \ninstitutions. A bank that has access to the discount window of the Fed, \na bank that has access to insured deposits, deposits insured by Uncle \nSam, that bank should not be diverting those funds into the temptation \nof high-risk investing. Similarly, they should not be proceeding to \nallow the high-risk investing to blow up the lending side of a \nfinancial organization.\n  The risk of an investment house going down is certainly higher during \na recession. It is very high in a severe recession. That is just the \ntime we need banks to be able to continue lending, to not let lending \nseize up.\n  I can tell you, back home in Oregon business after business has come \nforward and said: Our credit line was cut in half or we went to \nrefinance a commercial loan and the bank said we will not do it because \nthe value has dropped or we can't make any more loans in that sector or \nperhaps we can't make any more loans at all because we have reached our \nleverage limits.\n  Lending seized up in America, and it is a key factor in prolonging \nthis recession. These are the reasons that, if you want to have high-\nrisk investing with the money from pools of investors--that is an \nimportant part of the capital allocation but do it at a safe distance \nfrom the lending depository function.\n  The second piece of this--and back to my analogy that this is when \nyou put the high-risk investing in the woodshed--is that you also make \nthe woodshed more resilient, and that is enabling the regulators to say \nthat as an investment house becomes more systemically significant those \nregulators\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\ncan raise or will raise the capital requirements necessary so that the \nleverage decreases as the firms become larger. This greatly reduces the \nchance that an investment house will go down during a recession or go \ndown because of bad loans because they are putting up more capital \nagainst those investments.\n  I want to come to the third part, the conflict-of-interest \nprovisions. They will also be addressed at greater length by my \ncolleague. By the way, I ask unanimous consent Senator Levin be allowed \nto follow directly behind me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, he will elaborate on these provisions, \nbut I want to put up my third chart because at the hearings my \ncolleague had focused attention on a real challenge. Through those \nhearings some have observed that Goldman Sachs has become an ``iconic \nimage of bankers with conflicts of interest.'' Let me try to again \naddress that.\n  If you are selling fireworks, you should not be in the business of \ndesigning bad fuses to put on those fireworks and then betting the \nfireworks will go off accidentally or, as another person has put it, if \nyou are selling cars, you should not be selling cars without brakes and \ntaking out insurance on the owners. That fundamentally undermines the \nintegrity of the market, whether it is the fireworks market or car \nmarket. But those are analogies for our financial market.\n  Integrity is so important. International capital flows to systems \nwith integrity. It was after the Great Depression that we established \nreforms on Wall Street that led to decades in which the international \ncommunity saw the American markets as the best organized, best policed \nsafe place--no scams or minimal scams--that they could put their money.\n  We want Wall Street to be able to continue to attract and aggregate \nand allocate that capital. That is an essential function.\n  I note that this group of three commonsense reforms on this chart, \ngoing back to these three pieces--getting the high-risk trading out of \nthe banks, increasing the capital requirements for investment firms \nthat become systemically significant, and ending the conflicts of \ninterest in securities--these commonsense reforms have a lot of \nsupport.\n  In addition to Senator Levin, I thank 15 cosponsors who have jumped \nin to join this effort: Senator Brown, Senator Kaufman, Senator \nShaheen, Senator Feinstein, Senator Casey, Senator Bill Nelson, Senator \nBurris, Senator Begich, Senator Inouye, Senator Whitehouse, Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Mark Udall, Senator Mikulski, Senator Sanders, and \nSenator Tom Udall. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto consider jumping in to support these commonsense reforms.\n  I note also that the supporters for this amendment include Paul \nVolcker; they include John Reed, the former chair and CEO of Citibank; \nthey include the Independent Community Bankers of America, who \nrecognize that community banks do better if the Wall Street system has \nintegrity in allocating capital. The Main Street Alliance of Small \nBusinesses supports this amendment, the AFL/CIO supports it, Americans \nfor Financial Reform, and a dozen other organizations.\n\n  I also note that a group has solicited support online. Here I have \n25,000 individuals from across the country, all 50 States, who sent \nthis petition to the Senate. This is from the Progressive Change \nCampaign Committee, and these 25,000 citizens say:\n\n       The big Wall Street banks gambled away our money on a \n     reckless housing bubble and then insisted we spend more money \n     bailing them out. We need you to support the Merkley-Levin \n     proposal to end this risky gambling and other conflicts of \n     interest.\n\n  I conclude by saying we have a responsibility, following this great \nrecession we are in now, to redesign the rules of the road for Wall \nStreet, to increase integrity, to increase transparency, to decrease \nthe conflicts of interest, and to make it work in the most efficient \npossible way. It is with that spirit these three commonsense proposals \nhave been laid out.\n  It has been a privilege to partner with the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Carl Levin, in this effort.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend the Presiding \nOfficer. Senator Merkley has been an avid leader in doing something \nsignificantly important to end the role of proprietary trading, which \nis something that helped create a housing bubble, expanded that bubble, \nand the bubble burst and helped to sink this economy. This amendment we \nare offering is aimed at trying to rein in the excesses of those \nproprietary trades. It does it in a way which makes a lot of sense. A \nlot of work went into it.\n  The Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, his staff, our staffs, and many \nother staffs and people outside of this body have worked very hard to \nmake sure this will be a practical amendment. It is. I am proud to \ncosponsor it with the Presiding Officer, Senator Merkley, who has been \nsuch a great leader.\n  As recent hearings that I chaired at the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations demonstrated, many things caused the financial crisis \nthat started the recession that we are climbing out of. But up and down \nthe financial system--upstream, from mortgage brokers hustling dubious \nmortgages, to Wall Street firms downstream that sliced and diced \nsecurities, betting on those risky mortgages--there were failures and \nmistakes piled on top of plain old-fashioned fraud.\n  At its heart, the financial crisis is a story of extreme greed and \nexcessive risk. In the pursuit of ever larger profits, financial \ninstitutions took on ever-increasing risk while ignoring the danger \nthat risk represented. When their bets failed and the risks came \ncrashing down upon them, the financial system teetered on the brink of \ncollapse. The economy plunged into what has become known as the great \nrecession. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and homes, and \ntaxpayers had to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to keep things \nfrom getting even worse. We cannot allow a repeat.\n  The bill from Senator Dodd is a huge step in avoiding that repeat. We \nsimply must never again allow Wall Street firms seeking to boost their \nbottom lines, borrowing millions, or billions in this case, of dollars, \nmaking risky bets and risky trades, pocketing the winnings when their \nbets go well, and going to taxpayers for salvation when the bets go \nsouth. That is surely true of what is known as proprietary trading.\n  Too often, before and during the crisis and even today, financial \ninstitutions trade financial instruments often using large amounts of \nborrowed money to make risky bets for their own benefit, not on behalf \nof their clients.\n  Today, Senator Merkley and I, along with our cosponsors, are \nintroducing an amendment to Senator Dodd's financial regulatory reform \nbill that seeks to limit the damage these proprietary transactions can \ninflict on our economy and end the conflicts of interest which too \noften accompany them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jack Reed be added as a \ncosponsor of our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Proprietary trading brings high amounts of risk directly \ninto the financial infrastructure and has repeatedly and severely \ndamaged the financial system. It was a large part of the banking \ncollapse of 1929, which is why Glass-Steagall restrictions separating \ninvestment banks from commercial banks were enacted. In 1998, as Glass-\nSteagall was being weakened, proprietary trading in complex derivatives \nleft the major Wall Street banks facing billions in losses. The Federal \nReserve organized the first massive bailout of a too big to fail \nnonbank, Long-Term Capital Management. And in our current crisis, \nproprietary trading in subprime securities and derivatives was the \ncritical factor in the failure of major Wall Street firms in 2008.\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\n  By April 2008, the Nation's largest financial firms had suffered $230 \nbillion in losses based on their proprietary trading. And by the end of \n2008, the taxpayers were forced to put up hundreds of billions of \ndollars in TARP funds to avoid the collapse of our economy. Lehman \nBrothers is one example. In 1998, it had ``only'' $28 billion in \nproprietary holdings. By 2007, its proprietary holdings had soared to \n$313 billion. When the values of these holdings declined in 2007 and \n2008, Lehman Brothers lost $32 billion, its losses exceeded its net \nworth, and by September 2008, the firm had collapsed in the largest \nbankruptcy in history.\n  Senator Merkley and I propose an amendment that addresses these \nissues in the following ways:\n  First, commercial banks and their affiliates would be barred from \nhigh-risk proprietary trading. The risk to the federal deposit fund is \nsimply too great to allow commercial banks to gamble as they can today.\n  This prohibition will not inhibit these institutions from serving \ntheir customers. Our amendment expressly permits carefully specified \nclient-based transactions. That means that banks, through their broker-\ndealer affiliates, could buy or sell securities and other instruments \nas requested by clients. Those affiliates can also, for example, act as \nunderwriter for a client issuing new stocks or bonds, provided those \ntransactions are not allowed to endanger the safety and soundness of \nthe bank.\n  Second, we limit proprietary trades at the largest nonbank financial \ninstitutions. These institutions would be required to keep enough \ncapital on hand to ensure that they, and not the taxpayers, would cover \ntheir trading losses. That would limit the size of their proprietary \nactivities. The regulators overseeing the financial system would be \ntasked with specifying the capital levels these institutions would be \nrequired to maintain, as well as limits on the amount of proprietary \ntrading they could do, in order to protect the stability of the system. \nThese restrictions would address one of the chronic problems that led \nto the crisis, that of financial institutions borrowing heavily to make \ntheir risky trades by leveraging their own funds, and jeopardizing the \nentire financial system when their risks overcame their own funds.\n  Third, we would address one of the most dramatic findings of our \nsubcommittee's recent hearings, that of firms betting against financial \ninstruments they are assembling and selling. As our hearing on \ninvestment banks showed, Goldman Sachs assembled and sold mortgage-\nrelated financial instruments, then placed large bets, for the firm's \nown accounts, against those very same instruments. In one case \nhighlighted at the hearing, involving risky mortgage-backed securities, \na Goldman trader bragged in an email that, although the firm lost $2.5 \nmillion when the securities failed, Goldman made $5 million on a bet \nplaced against those very same securities. The conflict of interest \nprohibition in our amendment is intended to prevent firms that \nassemble, underwrite, place or sponsor these instruments from making \nproprietary bets against those same instruments.\n  Assembling and selling financial instruments to its clients while \nbetting against those same instruments did injury to Goldman's clients. \nThe fact that the firm described these instruments, in its own emails, \nas ``junk,'' added insult to injury. This isn't market making, bringing \ntogether two customers, a buyer and a seller, as Goldman executives \nclaimed during our hearing. This is Goldman Sachs acting as its own \nsecret client, betting against its customers. When members of the \nsubcommittee asked Goldman executives about that conflict of interest, \nthey answered by saying that we just understand, that this is how \nbusiness is done on Wall Street. We understand all too well how \nbusiness has been done on Wall Street. And that is why we must end the \nself-dealing and put a cop back on the beat on Wall Street.\n  Our amendment would protect depositors and taxpayers from the risk of \nproprietary trading at commercial banks. It will protect taxpayers from \nthe dilemma of having to pay for Wall Street's risky bets, or watch our \nfinancial system disintegrate. And it would protect investors and the \nfinancial system at large from the conflicts of interest that too often \nrepresent business as usual on Wall Street. It will strengthen \nprotections already in place in the bill before us, and add new ones to \nguard the stability of a financial system on which our economy and \nAmerican jobs depend.\n  Senator Merkley and I have worked closely with a number of \ncolleagues, including Senator Dodd, as well as officials from the \nTreasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to \nensure that our legislation would address the problems we seek to \naddress without endangering legitimate market activity and activity on \nbehalf of clients. It has been endorsed by former Federal Reserve \nChairman Paul Volcker; business leaders such as John Reed, the former \nChair and CEO of Citibank; and major organizations calling for real \nWall Street reform, including the Independent Community Bankers of \nAmerica, Americans for Financial Reform, and the AFL-CIO.\n  There is nothing wrong with Wall Street firms making a profit. What \nwe oppose is the notion that in seeking such profit, these financial \ninstitutions can put depositors, clients, taxpayers, and the very \nsafety of our financial system at risk. What we oppose is conflict of \ninterest. I hope our colleagues will support these commonsense \nsafeguards to strengthen the financial system and our economy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, \nMay 11, after any leader time, the Senate resume consideration of S. \n3217, and debate concurrently the pending Sanders amendment No. 3738 \nand the Vitter amendment No. 3760; that prior to a vote in relation to \neach amendment, there be a total debate limit of 80 minutes, with 20 \nminutes each under the control of Senators Sanders, Vitter, Shelby, and \nDodd, or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of all \ntime, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Sanders \namendment, followed by a vote in relation to the Vitter amendment, with \nno amendment in order to either amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am also pleased to transmit my \nwritten approval of the proposed Agreement and determination that the \nproposed Agreement will promote, and will not constitute an \nunreasonable risk to, the common defense and security, together with a \ncopy of an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement \n(NPAS) concerning the Agreement. In accordance with section 123 of the \nAct, as amended by title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), classified annexes to \nthe NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State in consultation with the \nDirector of National Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified \ninformation, will be submitted to the Congress separately.\n  The proposed Agreement was signed in Moscow on May 6, 2008. Former \nPresident George W. Bush approved the Agreement and authorized its \nexecution, and he made the determinations required by section 123 b. of \nthe Act. (Presidential Determination 2008-19 of May 5, 2008, 73 FR \n27719 (May 14, 2008)).\n  On May 13, 2008, President Bush transmitted the Agreement, together \nwith his Presidential Determination, an unclassified NPAS, and \nclassified annex, to the Congress for review (see House Doc. 110-112, \nMay 13, 2008). On September 8, 2008, prior to the completion of the 90-\nday continuous session review period, he sent a message informing the \nCongress that ``in view of recent actions by the Government of the \nRussian Federation incompatible with peaceful relations with its \nsovereign and democratic neighbor, Georgia,'' he had determined that \nhis earlier determination (concerning performance of the proposed \nAgreement promoting, and not constituting an unreasonable risk to, the \ncommon defense and security) was no longer effective. He further stated \nthat if circumstances should permit future reconsideration by the \nCongress, a new determination would be made and the proposed Agreement \nresubmitted.\n\n  After review of the situation and of the NPAS and classified annex, I \nhave concluded: (1) that the situation in Georgia need no longer be \nconsidered an obstacle to proceeding with the proposed Agreement; and \n(2) that the level and scope of U.S.-Russia cooperation on Iran are \nsufficient to justify resubmitting the proposed Agreement to the \nCongress for the statutory review period of 90 days of continuous \nsession and, absent enactment of legislation to disapprove it, taking \nthe remaining steps to bring it into force.\n  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and the members of \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have recommended that I \nresubmit the proposed Agreement to the Congress for review. The joint \nmemorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of State and Energy and a \nletter from the Chairman of the NRC stating the views of the Commission \nare enclosed.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \ndepartments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement, and have \ndetermined that performance of the proposed Agreement will promote, and \nwill not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and \nsecurity. Accordingly, I have approved the proposed Agreement and urge \nthe Congress to give the proposed Agreement favorable consideration.\n  My reasons for resubmitting the proposed Agreement to the Congress \nfor its review at this time are as follows:\n  The United States and Russia have significantly increased cooperation \non nuclear nonproliferation and civil nuclear energy in the last 12 \nmonths, starting with the establishment of the Bilateral Presidential \nCommission Working Group on Nuclear Energy and Security. In our July \n2009 Joint Statement on Nuclear Cooperation, Russian President Medvedev \nand I acknowledged the shared vision between the United States and \nRussia of the growth of clean, safe, and secure nuclear energy for \npeaceful purposes and committed to work together to bring into force \nthe agreement for nuclear cooperation to achieve this end. The Russian \ngovernment has indicated its support for a new United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution on Iran and has begun to engage on specific \nresolution elements with P5 members in New York. On April 8, 2010, the \nUnited States and Russia signed a historic New START Treaty \nsignificantly reducing the number of strategic nuclear weapons both \ncountries may deploy. On April 13, both sides signed the Protocol to \namend the 2000 U.S.-Russian Plutonium Management and Disposition \nAgreement, which is an essential step toward fulfilling each country's \ncommitment to effectively and transparently dispose of at least 34 \nmetric tons of excess weapon-grade plutonium, enough for about 17,000 \nnuclear weapons, with more envisioned to be disposed of in the future. \nRussia recently established an international nuclear fuel reserve in \nAngarsk to provide an incentive to other nations not to acquire \nsensitive uranium enrichment technologies. Joint U.S. and Russian \nleadership continue to successfully guide the Global Initiative to \nCombat Nuclear Terrorism as it becomes a durable \ninternational institution. The United States believes these events \ndemonstrate significant progress in the U.S.-Russia nuclear \nnonproliferation relationship and that it is now appropriate to move \nforward with this Agreement for cooperation in the peaceful uses of \nnuclear energy.\n\n  The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act \nand other applicable laws. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with Russia based on a mutual commitment \nto nuclear nonproliferation. It has a term of 30 years, and permits the \ntransfer, subject to subsequent U.S. licensing decisions, of \ntechnology, material, equipment (including reactors), and components \nfor nuclear research and nuclear power production. It does not permit \ntransfers of Restricted Data. Transfers of sensitive nuclear \ntechnology, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major critical components \nof such facilities may only occur if the Agreement is amended to cover \nsuch transfers. In the event of termination, key nonproliferation \nconditions and controls continue with respect to material, equipment, \nand components subject to the Agreement.\n  The Russian Federation is a nuclear weapon state party to the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Like the United \nStates, it has a ``voluntary offer'' safeguards agreement with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That agreement gives the \nIAEA the right to apply safeguards on all source or special fissionable \nmaterial at peaceful-\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\nuse nuclear facilities on a list provided by Russia. The Russian \nFederation is also a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection \nof Nuclear Material, which establishes international standards of \nphysical protection for the use, storage, and transport of nuclear \nmaterial. It is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, whose \nnon-legally binding guidelines set forth standards for the responsible \nexport of nuclear commodities for peaceful use. A more detailed \ndiscussion of Russia's domestic civil nuclear program and its nuclear \nnonproliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export \npolicies and practices, is provided in the NPAS and in the classified \nannexes to the NPAS submitted to the Congress separately.\n  This transmittal shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to \nimmediately begin the consultations with the Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations and House Committee on Foreign Affairs as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123 b., the 60-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 10, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/10/senate-section/article/S3472-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following bill was discharged from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, and referred as indicated:\n\n       S.J.

CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES ARE THE CONSTITUTIONS OF THE UNITED \n      STATES AND THE SEVERAL STATES, AND THAT, BECAUSE THE USE OF \n    INTERNATIONAL TREATIES TO GOVERN POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES

PRINCIPLES OF LAW IN THE \nUNITED STATES REGARDING PARENTS AND CHILDREN, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT \n    TRANSMIT THE CONVENTION TO THE SENATE FOR ITS ADVICE AND CONSENT\n\n  Mr. DeMINT submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 519\n\n       Whereas the Senate affirms the commitment of the people and \n     the Government of the United States to the well-being, \n     protection, and advancement of children, and the protection \n     of the inalienable rights of all persons of all ages;\n       Whereas the Constitution and laws of the United States and \n     those of the several States are the best guarantees against \n     mistreatment of children in this Nation;\n       Whereas the Constitution, laws, and traditions of the \n     United States affirm the rights of parents to raise their \n     children and to impart their values and religious beliefs;\n       Whereas the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the \n     Child, adopted at New York November 20, 1989, and entered \n     into force September 2, 1990, if ratified, would become a \n     part of the supreme law of the land, taking precedence over \n     all State laws and constitutions;\n       Whereas the United States, and not the several States, \n     would be held responsible for compliance with this Convention \n     if ratified, and as a consequence, the United States would \n     create an incredible expansion of subject matter jurisdiction \n     over all matters concerning children, seriously undermining \n     the constitutional balance between the Federal Government and \n     the governments of the several States;\n       Whereas Professor Geraldine Van Bueren, the author of the \n     principal textbook on the international rights of the child, \n     and a participant in the drafting of the Convention, has \n     described the ``best interest of the child standard'' in the \n     treaty as ``provid[ing] decision and policy makers with the \n     authority to substitute their own decisions for either the \n     child's or the parents'';\n       Whereas the Scottish Government has issued a pamphlet to \n     children of that country explaining their rights under the \n     Convention, which declares that children have the right to \n     decide their own religion and that parents can only provide \n     advice;\n       Whereas the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the \n     Child has repeatedly interpreted the Convention to ban common \n     disciplinary measures utilized by parents;\n       Whereas the Government of the United Kingdom was found to \n     be in violation of the Convention by the United Nations \n     Committee on the Rights of the Child for allowing parents to \n     exercise a right to opt their children out of sex education \n     courses in the public schools without a prior government \n     review of the wishes of the child;\n       Whereas the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the \n     Child has held that the Governments of Indonesia and Egypt \n     were out of compliance with the Convention because military \n     expenditures were given inappropriate priority over \n     children's programs;\n       Whereas these and many other interpretations of the \n     Convention by those charged with its implementation and by \n     other authoritative supporters demonstrates that the \n     provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of \n     the Child are utterly contrary to the principles of law in \n     the United States and the inherent principles of freedom;\n       Whereas the decisions and interpretations of the United \n     Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child would be \n     considered by the Committee to be binding and authoritative \n     upon the United States should the United States Government \n     ratify the Convention, such that the Convention poses a \n     threat to the sovereign rights of the United States and the \n     several States to make final determinations regarding \n     domestic law; and\n       Whereas the proposition that the United States should be \n     governed by international legal standards in its domestic \n     policy is tantamount to proclaiming that the Congress of the \n     United States and the legislatures of the several States are \n     incompetent to draft domestic laws that are necessary for the \n     proper protection of children, an assertion that is not only \n     an affront to self-government but an inappropriate attack on \n     the capability of legislators in the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the \n     Child, adopted at New York November 20, 1989, and entered \n     into force September 2, 1990, is incompatible with the \n     Constitution, the laws, and the traditions of the United \n     States;\n       (2) the Convention would undermine proper presumptions of \n     freedom and independence for families in the United States, \n     supplanting those principles with a presumption in favor of \n     governmental intervention without the necessity for proving \n     harm or wrong-doing;\n       (3) the Convention would interfere with the principles of \n     sovereignty, independence, and self-government in the United \n     States that preclude the necessity or propriety of adopting \n     international law to govern domestic matters; and\n       (4) the President should not transmit the Convention to the \n     Senate for its advice and consent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/10/senate-section/article/S3475-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 520--HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                 ESTABLISHMENT OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Tester) submitted the following \nresolution;
